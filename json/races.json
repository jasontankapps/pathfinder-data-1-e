			"Aasimars are humans with a significant amount of celestial or other good outsider blood in their ancestry. While not always benevolent, aasimars are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil, and they gravitate toward faiths or organizations associated with celestials. Aasimar heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently human parents. Most societies interpret aasimar births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some aasimars take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. \"It's always the one you least suspect\" is the axiom these evil aasimars live by, and they often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Aasimars look mostly human except for some minor physical trait that reveals their unusual heritage. Typical aasimar features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin color, or even glowing, golden halos.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Aasimars cannot truly be said to have an independent society of their own. As an offshoot of humanity, they adopt the societal norms around them, though most find themselves drawn to those elements of society that work for the redress of injustice and the assuagement of suffering. This sometimes puts them on the wrong side of the law in more tyrannical societies, but aasimars can be careful and cunning when necessary, able to put on a dissembling guise to divert the attention of oppressors elsewhere. While corrupt aasimars may be loners or may establish secret societies to conceal their involvement in crime, righteous aasimars are often found congregating in numbers as part of good-aligned organizations, especially (though not always) churches and religious orders.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Aasimars are most common and most comfortable in human communities. This is especially true of those whose lineage is more distant and who bear only faint marks of their heavenly ancestry. It is unclear why the touch of the celestial is felt so much more strongly in humanity than other races, though it may be that humanity's inherent adaptability and affinity for change is responsible for the evolution of aasimars as a distinct race. Perhaps the endemic racial traits of other races are too deeply bred, too strongly present, and too resistant to change. Whatever dalliances other races may have had with the denizens of the upper planes, the progeny of such couplings are vanishingly rare and have never bred true.",
			"",
			"However, even if they generally tend toward human societies, aasimars can become comfortable in virtually any environment. They have an easy social grace and are disarmingly personable. They get on well with half-elves, who share a similar not-quite-human marginal status, though their relations are often less cordial with half-orcs, who have no patience for aasimars' overly pretty words and faces. Elven courtiers sometimes dismiss aasimars as unsophisticated, and criticize them for relying on natural charm to overcome faux pas. Perhaps of all the known races, gnomes find aasimars most fascinating, and have an intense appreciation for their varied appearances as well as the mystique surrounding their celestial heritage.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Aasimars are most often of good alignment, though this isn't necessarily universal, and aasimars that have turned their back on righteousness may fall into an unfathomable abyss of depravity. For the most part, however, aasimars favor deities of honor, valor, protection, healing, and refuge, or simple and prosaic faiths of home, community, and family. Some also follow the paths of art, music, and lore, finding truth and wisdom in beauty and learning.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Aasimars frequently become adventurers, as they often do not quite feel at home in human society and feel the pull of some greater destiny. Clerics, oracles, and paladins are most plentiful in their ranks, though bards, sorcerers, and summoners are not uncommon among those with a fondness for arcane magic. Aasimar barbarians are rare, but when born into such tribes they often rise to leadership and encourage their clans to embrace celestial totems.",

			"### Non-Human Aasimars",
			"",
			"Not all aasimars are descended from humans. Aasimars can be born of any intelligent race, though human aasimars are the most common. Aasimars of other races usually exemplify the ideals of beauty and skill as seen by their base race. For example, halfling aasimars are small, beautifully proportioned, and display exceptional grace. Half-orc aasimars are slightly larger and stronger than ordinary orcs, with tough skin and metallic claws and tusks - they are likely to be neutral rather than evil, but still display aggression and incredible combat prowess. Less common humanoids, such as lizardfolk, catfolk, tengus, and others, can also produce aasimars, though given these races' exotic appearance, members of the more common races may have trouble telling such aasimars apart from their kin.",
			"",
			"It should be noted that while any creature that breeds with a celestial may give birth to half-celestial offspring, only humanoids can give birth to aasimars. Thus, while it's possible to encounter a half-celestial dragon, unicorn, or griffon, any children of such creatures would be either half-celestials or normal members of their race. (And just as often, these less conventional half-celestials are sterile.) When discussing half-celestials and aasimars, it's important to distinguish them from both true celestials (angels, azatas, agathions, etc.) and simple celestial creatures (creatures with the celestial template, which are themselves denizens of the good-aligned Outer Planes but similar in many ways to their Material Plane counterparts). Most aasimars also have a difficult time getting people to grasp distinctions between celestial types, with common folk erroneously grouping all such beings together as \"angels.\"",
			"",
			"Non-human aasimars have the same statistics as human aasimars with the exception of size. Thus a halfling aasimar is Small but otherwise possesses the same statistics and abilities as a human aasimar - the difference is purely cosmetic. Non-human aasimars do not possess any of the racial abilities of their base race. However, they are usually raised in the same cultural context as other members of their base race, and thus generally adopt the same fighting style as their peers, use the same types of weapons and armor, and study the same skills.",

			"The primary inhabitants of the perfect city of Axis are the race known as axiomites, outsiders born of lawful neutral souls whose primary focus is to serve Axis in one of three ways: the construction and tending of inevitables, the expansion and maintenance of the city itself, and exploring and calculating the laws and constants that underpin all reality in hopes of using this knowledge to bring order to the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"But the axiomites are ill-suited to interactions with mortals. As creatures of pure order, they find it difficult to deal with creatures who have the free will to choose their own destinies and to interpret (or even willfully ignore) laws. Ancient axiomites long pondered a solution to problematic encounters with visitors from the Material Plane. The answer they arrived at was the creation of a new form of life - a melding of their own perfection of order with the unpredictable and fragile bodies and minds of mortal humanoids.",
			"",
			"Thus, the first aphorites came to be. Although these women and men were always welcome in Axis, the perfect city was not their true home. Infused with a spark of mortality and the influence of the Material Plane, aphorites were created to serve as diplomats, translators, and envoys between the axiomites and the myriad cultures of the countless Material Plane worlds. As native outsiders, aphorites have free will of their own, and they live and die just as other mortals do. Though akin in many ways to other native outsiders such as aasimars, ganzis, and tieflings, the aphorites differ in that they are not the results of unions between outsiders and mortals. While the original population was forged in Axis by the axiomites, new aphorites are born to aphorite parents. In cases where an aphorite and a humanoid have a child, the offspring is either a newborn aphorite or a member of the humanoid parent's race. Originally, the aphorites were created with nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified as a result of generations spent on the Material Plane. Today, an aphorite always appears humanoid in form with golden skin that flickers and periodically coruscates with sparkling crystalline dust, and eyes and hair that tend toward metallic hues (with copper, gold, and silver being common colors). Beyond this, they can appear similar to dwarves, elves, and humans, or any other Medium humanoid race. The heritage of the immutable order of Axis has long prevented the formation of aphorites of other sizes, but exceptions have occurred with increasing frequency as each new generation of aphorites is born on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Aphorites do not exist in large numbers on most Material Plane worlds, and Golarion is no exception. The first aphorites to arrive on Golarion did not seek to establish their own race as a distinct cultural element, but instead to assimilate into established societies to help guide the formation of laws and bolster potential interactions with the citizens of Axis. But as the aphorite race spread, something that the axiomites should have anticipated occurred: as native outsiders with the ability to choose their own destinies, many aphorites became intrigued by the societies they were living in. There are some limits to this acceptance of new societies; aphorites who embrace chaos are considered outcasts and troublemakers by their kin, despite the fact that these aphorites are natural expressions of mortals' defining characteristics.",
			"",
			"Smart and strong, aphorites are as likely to become the focus of attention and admiration as they are the victims of jealousy and hatred. Their ordered and structured personalities often cause strained relations with more capricious or mischievous neighbors and can be a source of conflict with cultures who highly value individual expression of thought, such as that of the elves. Races with stronger tendencies toward law typically build stronger bonds with aphorites. Dwarves in particular enjoy the company of aphorites and find the birth of an aphorite among their own kind a welcome event, as aphorites have an intuitive understanding of the crafting so integral to dwarven society.",
			"",
			"While not all aphorites are inherently lawful, most relish structure and order in their lives. Ideas of morality, however, are less clear cut to aphorites. While most can appreciate scholarly studies of the philosophy of good and evil and recognize the differences between them, this divide does not influence them to the same extent that the structure of law versus the disorganized madness of chaos does. Consequently, most aphorites are lawful neutral. Typically, aphorites drawn to theology choose lawful gods as patrons, with the worship of Abadar in particular resonating with their inherent desires and goals of building a perfect society. When an aphorite embraces chaos, other aphorites often treat their wayward kin with a mix of curiosity, horror, and pity. Chaotic aphorites themselves tend to be loners and have little interest in the traditions of their own kind, instead seeking out other societies to join.",
			"",
			"Most aphorites, no matter the culture they are raised in, eventually experience a longing to see the world beyond the boundaries of their birthplace. Be it by choice or chance, aphorites seem predisposed to the life of an adventurer. Always seeking to better understand not only the world, but themselves as well, aphorites excel when they are placed in situations where their intellects might shine. Being both cunning of mind and naturally strong, aphorites gravitate toward classes which blend the arts of spellcasting and combat, such as magus or warpriest.",

They're often mistaken for dark stalkers, though their features are more defined and individually distinctive beneath their thick wrappings. Their skin is bleached gray, deepening to obsidian at the extremities. Caligni age at the same rate as half-elves, and don't typically breed true, instead giving birth to more common dark folk types - typically dark creepers.",

			"Catfolk are a race of natural explorers who rarely tire of trailblazing, but such trailblazing is not limited merely to the search for new horizons in distant lands. Many catfolk see personal growth and development as equally valid avenues of exploration. While most catfolk are nimble, capable, and often active creatures, there is also a strong tendency among some catfolk to engage in quiet contemplation and study. Such individuals are interested in finding new solutions to age-old problems and questioning even the most steadfast philosophical certainties of the day. They are curious by nature, and catfolk culture never discourages inquisitiveness, but rather fosters and encourages it. Many are seen as quirky extroverts by members of other races, but within catfolk tribes there is no shame attached to minor peculiarities, eccentricities, or foolhardiness. All but the most inwardly focused catfolk enjoy being the center of attention, but not at the expense of their tribe, whether it's the one the catfolk are born into or the tribe they choose through the bonds of friendship with other creatures. Catfolk tend to be both generous and loyal to their family and friends.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** In general, catfolk are lithe and slender, standing midway between dwarves and humans in stature. While clearly humanoid, they possess many feline features, including a coat of soft fine fur, slit pupils, and a sleek, slender tail. Their ears are pointed, but unlike those of elves, are more rounded and catlike. They manipulate objects as easily as any other humanoid, but their fingers terminate in small, sharp, retractable claws. These claws are typically not powerful enough to be used as weapons, but some members of the species - either by quirk of birth or from years of honing - can use them with deadly effect. Feline whiskers are not uncommon, but not universal, and hair and eye color vary greatly.",
			"",
			"**Society:** While self-expression is an important aspect of catfolk culture, it is mitigated by a strong sense of community and group effort. In the wild, catfolk are a hunter-gatherer tribal people. The pursuit of personal power never comes before the health and well-being of the tribe. More than one race has underestimated this seemingly gentle people only to discover much too late that their cohesion also provides them great strength.",
			"",
			"Catfolk prefer to be led by their most competent members, usually a council of sub-chieftains chosen by their peers, either though consensus or election. The sub-chiefs then choose a chieftain to lead in times of danger and to mediate disputes among the sub-chiefs. The chieftain is the most capable member of the tribe, and is often magically talented. Catfolk who settle in more urban and civilized areas still cling to a similar tribal structure, but often see friends outside the tribe, even those from other races, as part of their extended tribe. Within adventuring groups, catfolk who do not consider themselves the obvious choice as chieftain often defer to the person who most resembles their cultural ideal of a chieftain.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Adaptable and curious, catfolk get along with almost any race that extends reciprocal goodwill. They acclimate easily to halflings, humans, and especially elves. Catfolk and elves share a passionate nature, as well as a love of music, dance, and storytelling; elven communities often gently mentor catfolk tribes, though such elves are careful not to act in a patronizing manner toward their feline friends. Gnomes make natural companions for catfolk, as catfolk enjoy gnomes' strange and obsessive qualities. Catfolk are tolerant of kobolds as long as the reptilian beings respect the catfolk's boundaries. The feral nature of orcs stirs as much puzzlement as it does revulsion among catfolk, as they don't understand orcs' savagery and propensity for self-destruction. Half-orcs, on the other hand, intrigue catfolk, especially those half-orcs who strive to excel beyond the deleterious and hateful nature of their savage kin. Catfolk often view goblins and ratfolk as vermin, as they disdain the swarming and pernicious tendencies of those races.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** With community and unselfish cooperation at the center of their culture, as well as a good-natured curiosity and willingness to adapt to the customs of many other races, most catfolk tend toward good alignments. The clear majority of catfolk are also chaotic, as wisdom is not their strongest virtue; nevertheless, there are exceptions with cause.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Natural born trackers, the hunter-gatherer aspect of their tribes pushes many catfolk toward occupations as rangers and druids by default, but such roles don't always speak to their love of performance art, be it song, dance, or storytelling. Catfolk legends also speak of a rich tradition of great sorcerer heroes. Those catfolk who internalize their wanderlust often become wizards and monks, with many of those monks taking the path of the nimble guardian. While catfolk cavaliers and inquisitors are rare (steadfast dedication to a cause is often alien to the catfolk mindset) individuals who choose these paths are never looked down upon. Catfolk understand that exploration and self-knowledge can lead down many roads, and are accepting of nearly all professions and ways of life.",

			"Cecaelias are curious and social half-octopus creatures with a love of novelty. A short-lived race, cecaelias search for every bit of enjoyment they can draw from life. They take pleasure in new experiences, from trying new land fare to meeting a previously unknown race and exploring unknown waters.",
			"",
			"From the waist up, cecaelias resemble humans with agile but muscular builds. Their eye, hair, and skin coloring tends to mimic that of surfacers in nearby communities; this natural adaptive trait allows them to more easily form social bonds with neighbors. Instead of humanoid legs, cecaelias have eight cephalopod tentacles that allow them to move quickly both on land and underwater. Cecaelia tentacles tend toward shades of brown, russet, emerald green, and deep blue, with coral tones on the suckered underside.",
			"",
			"Cecaelias generally get along well with humans, as both races share the experience of being a relatively short-lived race among much longer-lived peoples. Cecaelias also ally frequently with locathahs, as the fish-people are as social and inquisitive as they are. Cecaelias are proud but don't hold themselves above other races, reacting with cautious openness when meeting new people. They're sensitive to condescension, though, and they anger quickly if they suspect someone is talking down to them. Overly flowery language or flattery can likewise insult them; cecaelias respect those who speak plainly, even if what they have to say is unpleasant.",
			"",
			"Cecaelias rarely form large settlements. Cecaelia families with infants and young children band together for protection, remaining in one area. Once the children reach the age of five, they're considered strong enough to no longer need the protection of a large group; the family then leaves the settlement with the children and resumes its nomadic ways.",
			"",
			"Cecaelias often decorate their bodies with tattoos. Cecaelia tattoo artists are valued members of a cecaelia community and create colorful pigments from cephalopod ink, sea plants, and tropical fish. Always seeking new experiences, cecaelias also visit coastal settlements and hail passing ships to trade for tattoo services; a cecaelia sporting a \"land drawn\" tattoo earns respect and admiration from her peers. Most cecaelias favor swooping, abstract tattoos reminiscent of ocean currents, though some memorialize their adventures or significant life experiences with symbolic images.",
			"",
			"Cecaelia Adventurers: Cecaelias are restless wanderers at heart. The attraction of a new location is often enough to spark a journey - the more exotic and far-flung the destination, the better. They scavenge ruins and shipwrecks near coastlines, trading their finds with nearby land dwellers. Cecaelias enjoy traveling with adventuring parties, particularly those with surfacers in the mix. They may hire on with a group solely for the opportunity to socialize and explore. That doesn't mean cecaelias disdain their share of the treasure, though; they use the proceeds from their expeditions to fund their coastal trading and travel.",
			"",
			"The notorious cecaelia pride stems from a conviction that they were once part of an enormous empire. Though most evidence has been worn away by time and the waves over thousands of years, cecaelias firmly believe they are descended from powerful ancestors. Cecaelias also consider any artifacts of their lost empire - or artifacts they simply suspect might be from their lost empire - to be their belongings.

			"The half-living children of vampires birthed by human females, dhampirs are progenies of both horror and tragedy. The circumstances of a dhampir's conception are often called into question but scarcely understood, as few mortal mothers survive the childbirth. Those who do often abandon their monstrous children and refuse to speak of the matter. While some speculate that dhampirs result when mortal women couple with vampires, others claim that they form when a pregnant woman suffers a vampire bite. Some particularly zealous scholars even contest dhampirs' status as a unique race, instead viewing them as humans suffering from an unholy affliction. Indeed, this hypothesis is strengthened by dhampirs' seeming inability to reproduce, their offspring inevitably humans (usually sorcerers with the undead bloodline). Regardless, they live and die just like any other mortal creatures, despite possessing a supernatural longevity akin to that of elves.",
			"",
			"Hardship and suffering fill a dhampir's formative years. Most grow up as orphans, and despite their exquisite features and innate charm, they face a lifetime of prejudice, mistrust, fear, and persecution. Humans who witness the seemingly sinister nature of a dhampir child's supernatural powers or sensitivity to daylight display an array of reactions ranging from awe to terror to outright hatred. Eventually, a dhampir must learn to cope with these difficulties in order to find his place in the world. While most dhampirs succumb to the innate evil of their undead heritage and devolve into the monstrous fiends depicted by society, a few reject their unholy conceptions, instead vowing to avenge their mothers by hunting the very creatures that sired them.",
			"",
			"Dhampirs keep few, if any, close companions. Ultimately, the majority of evil dhampirs regard their allies as little more than tools or fodder. Those whom they deem useful are judged by their merits as individuals, not by their race. However, even with those they feel attached to, most dhampirs are sullen and reserved. Some fear the persecution heaped upon them may be transferred to their companions, whereas others worry their own bloodlust will one day overwhelm them and they'll inadvertently turn upon their friends. In any case, an alliance with a dhampir almost always leads to an ill-fated conclusion.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Tall and slender and with well-defined musculature, dhampirs look like statuesque humans of unearthly beauty. Their hair, eye, and skin colors resemble unnerving versions of their mothers'; many possess a ghastly pallor, particularly in the sunlight, while those with dark complexions often possess skin the color of a bruise.",
			"",
			"While many dhampirs can pass as humans in ideal conditions, their features are inevitably more pronounced and they move with an unnaturally fluid grace. All dhampirs have elongated incisors. While not true fangs, these teeth are sharp enough to draw blood, and many suffer a reprehensible desire to indulge in sanguinary delights, despite the fact that the act provides most no physical benefit.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Dhampirs have no culture of their own, nor do they have any known lands or even communities. Often born in secret and abandoned at orphanages or left to die on the outskirts of town, they tend to live solitary lives as exiles and outcasts. Individuals acquire the cultural beliefs and teachings of the regions in which they grew up, and adopt additional philosophies over the course of their complex lives. This ability to adapt to a verity of circumstances provides dhampirs with a social camouflage that hides them from both predators and prey.",
			"",
			"In rare instances, dhampirs might gather to form small groups or cabals dedicated to resolving their joint issues. Even so, the philosophies of such groups reflect the interests of the individuals involved, not any common dhampir culture.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** As dhampirs are scions of evil, few races view them favorably. They share an affinity for those half-breeds whose sinister ancestry also sets them apart from human society, particularly tieflings and half-orcs. Humans view them with a combination of fear and pity, though such feelings often devolve into hatred and violence. Other humanoid races, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, simply shun them. Similarly, dhampirs bear a deep-seeded loathing for living creatures, their hatred planted by jealousy and fed by frustration.",

They are unnatural creatures, and the foul influence of their undead heritage makes an evil outlook difficult to overcome. Those who struggle against their wicked natures rarely progress beyond a neutral outlook.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** The life of an adventurer comes naturally to most dhampirs, since constant persecution condemns many to spend their days wandering. Evil dhampirs keep moving to maintain their secrecy and evade lynch mobs, while those who follow the path of vengeance venture forth in search of their despised fathers. Regardless of their reasons, most dhampirs simply feel more at home on the road than in a settlement. Having little formal training, a great many of these journeyers become fighters and rogues.",

Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble. Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to death-sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society's noble houses. Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their houses.

Drow seldom make themselves known to surface folk, preferring to remain legends while advancing their sinister agendas through proxies and agents. Drow have no love for anyone but themselves, and are adept at manipulating other creatures. While they are not born evil, malignancy is deep-rooted in their culture and society, and non-conformists rarely survive for long. Some stories tell that given the right circumstances, a particularly hateful elf might turn into a drow, though such a transformation would require a truly heinous individual.",

			"**Physical Description:** Drow are similar in stature to humans, but share the slender build and features of elves, including the distinctive long, pointed ears. Their eyes lack pupils and are usually solid white or red. Drow skin ranges from coal black to a dusky purple. Their hair is typically white or silver, though some variation is not unknown.",

Male drow usually fulfill martial roles, defending the species from external threats, while female drow assume positions of leadership and authority. Reinforcing these gender roles, one in 20 drow are born with exceptional abilities and thus considered to be nobility, and the majority of these special drow are female. Noble houses define drow politics, with each house governed by a noble matriarch and composed of lesser families, business enterprises, and military companies. Each house is also associated with a demon lord patron. Drow are strongly driven by individual self-interest and advancement, which shapes their culture with seething intrigue and politics, as common drow jockey for favor of the nobility, and the nobility rise in power through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery.",

Others, such as dwarves, gnomes, and halflings, are deemed fit only for the lash. Manipulative drow delight in exploiting the weak character of humans. While they claim no kinship with fetchlings, the drow harbor a curiosity toward the shadow race, as both are adaptations of races exposed to extreme and dangerous conditions. Finally, the drow's hatred of elves sets these beings apart from all other races, and the dark elves desire nothing more than to ruin everything about their surface cousins.",

Female drow typically assume classes that lend themselves to leadership, such as bards and especially clerics. Both genders have an innate talent for the arcane arts, and may be wizards or summoners.

			"{SOURCE Planar Adventures/230}  ",
			"Duskwalkers are tall, bipedal, gray-skinned beings with a connection to Pharasma's Boneyard. They manifest directly on the Material Plane, incarnating from souls that have earned the honor of a second life. The souls that become duskwalkers have often distinguished themselves in the eyes of psychopomps as guardians of the cycle of birth and death. Other than their gray skin, their physical features bear some resemblance to those they held in their previous lives. As such, a typical duskwalker looks mostly human, other than her unusual coloration. However, duskwalkers whose ancestors belonged to other races can manifest with characteristic features such as pointed ears, hairy feet, or even feathers, horns, scales, or tails - though they rarely manifest smaller or larger than Medium.",
			"",
			"The first duskwalkers appeared as the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps: an olethros mother and a yamaraj. The olethros mother made the case to allow certain souls whose actions helped preserve and protect the cycle of souls, but whose lives had been cut short of what fate had decreed for them to reincarnate once before passing to their final judgment. After a long debate, the yamaraj agreed but imposed a strict limit on the number of duskwalkers that can exist at one time. Whenever this limit has been reached, dead duskwalkers cannot be restored to life. Most duskwalkers accept this limitation and appreciate that the end of their lives opens the door for new lives to begin. Some request that those mourning their deaths also celebrate the birth of a new duskwalker in the near future. The length of time it takes for a new duskwalker to be born when one dies varies, but is rarely more than a year.",
			"",
			"When a duskwalker is born, she appears spontaneously in a sanctified place with a connection to death, most often a graveyard or a temple. Duskwalkers do not experience infancy, instead beginning their lives with the appearance and facilities of a roughly 8-year-old human child. These mysterious children always appear cloaked in simple white robes, with a small satchel of food and water by their sides. Duskwalker children mature at a variable rate depending upon the support they receive. A child adopted into a nurturing family or taken into care at a temple matures at a rate similar to that of a human child and develops a healthy balance between her appreciation for life and her interest in death. While duskwalker children almost always appear near settlements, the unusual circumstances of their creation sometimes lead them to be ostracized to the point where they are forced to fend for themselves. Duskwalker children who endure such circumstances reach physical and intellectual maturity rapidly, but they struggle socially and emotionally.",
			"",
			"Duskwalker naming conventions are varied. Many duskwalkers prefer to select their own names shortly after they manifest. Duskwalkers who have a good relationship with their surrounding community choose names that follow that community's traditions. Isolated duskwalkers make up their own conventions, naming themselves after their accomplishments or values or even just selecting a string of syllables that sounds nice to them.",
			"",
			"The role of duskwalkers has changed somewhat since the beginning of the Age of Lost Omens, when prophecy failed. Prior to that time, only souls that were destined to perform roles that would serve the Boneyard's interests would be reincarnated as duskwalkers. With prophecy in disarray, however, duskwalkers began to shape their own fates. Some duskwalkers receive occasional visitations or messages from psychopomps, intended to steer them toward certain tasks, but they are under no obligation to follow this guidance. Still, because of their origins, most duskwalkers have an innate respect for the cycles of birth and death. They tend to gravitate toward positions and occupations that allow them to protect this cycle, such as hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.",
			"",
			"Because duskwalkers are so rare, the few duskwalker communities that exist are small and form mostly among individuals united by a common goal, such as adventuring bands of undead-hunters. Many duskwalkers go their entire lives without meeting another member of their race. Instead, they usually live among whichever races are most common near the graveyards in which they manifested. Duskwalkers meet with mixed reactions from human communities. Some people look askance at their ashen appearance and the manner of their creation. Others find the way in which duskwalkers relate to death unsettling. Duskwalkers struggle to understand the fear and hesitance with which most other races speak of death, and even cheerful duskwalkers tend toward dark and morbid senses of humor. However, other communities value or even revere duskwalkers for their wisdom, skill at medicine, and proficiency at fighting undead. Duskwalkers get along particularly well with members of other races that share a planar heritage, such as aasimars, aphorites, ganzis, and tieflings, but they share a mutual distrust with dhampirs.",
			"",
			"Despite the prejudices they sometimes face, duskwalkers are typically companionable, open-minded, and accepting of people. They seek friendships and romantic relationships with others of many different races. Many duskwalkers seek to build a family with children at some point in their lives. They grow their families by adopting children from their communities, with a particular preference toward children that other prospective parents may look over. Most have no interest in sexual relationships, though, and no duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological children.",
			"",
			"Duskwalkers are typically neutral in their alignment, like psychopomps themselves. Those who are not neutrally aligned tend toward good alignments over evil ones. Pharasma is the most popular deity among duskwalkers, but Sarenrae and the empyreal lord Ashava also command sizable followings. Members of a growing contingent of evil duskwalkers have been rejecting their inborn nature entirely, throwing in their lot with the sahkils, who delight in such perversion. These duskwalkers can lose the abilities that help them combat undead and gain powers better suited to inflicting fear, but such choices also have a chance of altering their ward against corruption in a particularly unsettling way. Such duskwalkers inevitably find that not only can they become undead, but that their deaths all but guarantee some form of unnatural unlife after death, often coming back as a ghost without such an entity's classic inability to travel far from the place of its death.",

			"Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains and fiercely determined to repel the depredations of savage races like orcs and goblins. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. It could be said that their history shapes the dark disposition of many dwarves, for they reside in high mountains and dangerous realms below the earth, constantly at war with giants, goblins, and other such horrors.",
			"",
			"Dwarves are lovers of history and tradition, and their long lifespan leads to far less in the way of generational shifts in attitudes, styles, fashions, and trends than shorter-lived races exhibit. If a thing is not broken, they do not fix it or change it; and if it is broken, they fix it rather than replace it. Thrifty as a rule, dwarves are loath to discard anything unless it is truly ruined and unable to be fixed. At the same time, dwarves' meticulous, near-obsessive attention to detail and durability in their craftsmanship makes that a rare occurrence, as the things they make are built to last. As a result, buildings, artwork, tools, housewares, garments, weapons, and virtually everything else made by dwarves still sees regular use at an age when such items would be relegated to museum pieces, dusty antique shelves, or junkyard fodder by other races. Taken together, these traits create the impression that dwarves are a race frozen in time.",
			"",
			"Nothing could be further from the truth, however, as dwarves are both thoughtful and imaginative, willing to experiment, if always keen to refine and perfect a new technique or product before moving on to the next one. Dwarves have achieved feats of metallurgy, stonework, and engineering that have consistently outpaced the technological advances of other races, though some non-dwarven races have used magic to supplement and perfect their own creations to achieve the same ends through mystical rather than mundane means. They are also a race typified by stubborn courage and dedication to seeing tasks through to completion, whatever the risks. These traits have led dwarves to explore and settle in extreme environments that would cause other races to quail and retreat. From the darkest depths of the underworld to the highest mountain peaks, from rusting iron citadels along desolate rocky coasts to squat jungle ziggurats, dwarves have established their enclaves and redoubts, holding them against all comers or perishing to the last and leaving only their enduring monuments to stand as their legacy.",
			"",
			"While it is said that dwarves are not venturesome or inventive, it would be more accurate to say that they maintain a focus on and dedication to each task they undertake and every change they adopt, vetting such changes thoroughly before adopting them wholeheartedly. When faced with new circumstances and new needs, they react by applying tried and true tools and techniques systematically, using existing methods whenever possible rather than trying to invent novel solutions for every situation. If necessity requires, however, they throw themselves with equal vigor into developing the next perfect procedure for demolishing the obstacles that get in their way. Once their desired goal is obtained, they focus on consolidating each new piece of territory or conceptual advance. Dwarves thus rarely overextend themselves, but they also may miss opportunities to seize the initiative and maximize the advantages they create.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Dwarves are a short and stocky race, and stand about a foot shorter than most humans, with wide, compact bodies that account for their burly appearance. Male and female dwarves pride themselves on the long length of their hair, and men often decorate their beards with a variety of clasps and intricate braids. Clean-shavenness on a male dwarf is a sure sign of madness, or worse-no one familiar with their race trusts a beardless dwarven man.",
			"",
			"**Society:** The great distances between dwarves' mountain citadels account for many of the cultural differences that exist within their society. Despite these schisms, dwarves throughout the world are characterized by their love of stonework, their passion for stone- and metal-based craftsmanship and architecture, and their fierce hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids. In some remote enclaves, such as those areas where these races are uncommon or unheard of, dwarves' fixation on security and safety combined with their rather pugnacious nature leads them to find enemies or at least rivals wherever they settle. While they are not precisely militaristic, they learned long ago that those without axes can be hewn apart by them, and thus dwarves everywhere are schooled to be ready to enforce their rights and claims by force of arms. When their patience with diplomacy is exhausted, dwarves do not hesitate to adopt what they call \"aggressive negotiations.\"",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Dwarves and orcs have long dwelt in proximity to one another, and share a history of violence as old as both races. Dwarves generally distrust and shun half-orcs. They find elves, gnomes, and halflings to be too frail, flighty, or \"pretty\" to be worthy of proper respect. It is with humans that dwarves share the strongest link, for humans' industrious nature and hearty appetites come closest to matching those of the dwarven ideal.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Dwarves are driven by honor and tradition. While they are often stereotyped as standoffish, they have a strong sense of friendship and justice, and those who win their trust understand that while they work hard, they play even harder - especially when good ale is involved. Most dwarves are lawful good.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Although dwarven adventurers are rare compared to humans, they can be found in most regions of the world. Dwarves often leave the confines of their redoubts to seek glory for their clans, to find wealth with which to enrich the fortress-homes of their birth, or to reclaim fallen dwarven citadels from racial enemies. Dwarven warfare is often characterized by tunnel fighting and melee combat, and as such most dwarves tend toward classes such as fighters and barbarians.",
			"",
			"**Male Names:** Dolgrin, Grunyar, Harsk, Kazmuk, Morgrym, Rogar.",

They receive a check to notice any such features that they pass within 10 feet of, whether or not they are actively looking.  ",
			">**Weapon Familiarity:** Dwarves are proficient with battleaxes, heavy picks, and warhammers, and treat any weapon with the word \"dwarven\" in its name as a martial weapon.  ",
			">**Languages:** Dwarves begin play speaking Common and Dwarven. Dwarves with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.",

These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains.

The Mbe-ke build cities in the mountains of the Terwa Uplands, while the Taralu live in small clans in the eastern jungle. Although there is little contact between the two groups, they share a reverence for and affinity with dragons-most especially cloud dragons' as well as any draconic creature that can be reasoned with, including wyverns. Mwangi dwarves often take the magic resistant or surface survivalist alternate racial traits.

Ouat caste dwarves seek to become closer to divinity by overcoming their mortal limitations. They train themselves and others in the monastic city of Tar Kuata, constantly striving to put aside petty material concerns to focus on spiritual growth.

In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait.

Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait.

While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few - such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold - remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits.

			"{SOURCE Inner Sea Races/236;Advanced Race Guide/20;PRPG Core Rulebook/22}  ",
			"The long-lived elves are children of the natural world, similar in many superficial ways to fey creatures, though with key differences. While fey are truly linked to the flora and fauna of their homes, existing as the nearly immortal voices and guardians of the wilderness, elves are instead mortals who are in tune with the natural world around them. Elves seek to live in balance with the wild and understand it better than most other mortals. Some of this understanding is mystical, but an equal part comes from the elves' long lifespans, which in turn gives them long-ranging outlooks. Elves can expect to remain active in the same locale for centuries. By necessity, they must learn to maintain sustainable lifestyles, and this is most easily done when they work with nature, rather than attempting to bend it to their will.",
			"",
			"However, their links to nature are not entirely driven by pragmatism. Elves' bodies slowly change over time, taking on a physical representation of their mental and spiritual states, and those who dwell in a region for a long period of time find themselves physically adapting to match their surroundings, most noticeably taking on coloration that reflects the local environment.",
			"",
			"Elves value their privacy and traditions, and while they are often slow to make friends at both the personal and national levels, once an outsider is accepted as a comrade, the resulting alliances can last for generations. Elves take great joy in forging alliances with races that share or exceed their long lifetimes, and often work to befriend dragons, outsiders, and fey. Those elves who spend their lives among the short-lived races, on the other hand, often develop a skewed perception of mortality and become morose, the result of watching wave after wave of companions age and die before their eyes.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Generally taller than humans, elves possess a graceful, slender physique that is accentuated by their long, pointed ears. It is a mistake, however, to consider them weak or feeble, as the thin limbs of an elf can contain surprising power. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, and filled with large, vibrantly colored pupils. The coloration of elves as a whole varies wildly, and is much more diverse than that of human populations. However, as their coloration often matches their surroundings, the elves of a single community may appear quite similar. Forest-dwelling elves often have variations of green, brown, and tan in their hair, eye, and even skin tones.",
			"",
			"While elven clothing often plays off the beauty of the natural world, those elves who live in cities tend to bedeck themselves in the latest fashions. Where city-dwelling elves encounter other urbanites, the elves are often fashion trendsetters.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Many elves feel a bond with nature and strive to live in harmony with the natural world. Although, like most, elves prefer bountiful lands where resources are plentiful, when driven to live in harsher climates, they work hard to protect and shepherd the region's bounty, and learn how to maximize the benefit they receive from what little can be harvested. When they can carve out a sustainable, reliable life in deserts and wastelands, they take pride as a society in the accomplishment. While this can make them excellent guides to outsiders they befriend who must travel through such lands, their disdain of those who have not learned to live off the scant land as they have makes such friends rare.",
			"",
			"Elves have an innate gift for craftsmanship and artistry, especially when working in wood, bone, ivory, or leather. Most, however, find manipulating earth and stone to be distasteful, and prefer to avoid forging, stonework, and pottery. When such work must be done within a community, a few elves may find themselves drawn to it, but regardless of their craftsmanship, such \"dirt-wrights\" are generally seen by other elves as being a bit off. In the most insular of elven societies, they may even be treated as lower class.",
			"",
			"Elves also have an appreciation for the written word, magic, and painstaking research. Their naturally keen minds and senses, combined with their inborn patience, make them particularly suited to wizardry. Arcane research and accomplishment are seen as both practical goals, in line with being a soldier or architect, and artistic endeavors as great as poetry or sculpture. Within elven society, wizards are held in extremely high regard as masters of an art both powerful and aesthetically valued. Other spellcasters are not disdained, but do not gain the praise lavished upon elven wizards.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Elves are prone to dismissing other races, writing them off as rash and impulsive, yet on an individual level, they are excellent judges of character. In many cases an elf will come to value a specific member of another race, seeing that individual as deserving and respectable, while still dismissing the race as a whole. If called on this behavior, the elf often doesn't understand why his \"special friend\" is upset the elf has noticed the friend is \"so much better than the rest of his kind.\" Even elves who see such prejudice for what it is must constantly watch themselves to prevent such views from coloring their thinking.",
			"",
			"Elves are not foolish enough, however, to dismiss all aspects of other races and cultures. An elf might not want a dwarf neighbor, but would be the first to acknowledge dwarves' skill at smithing and their tenacity in facing orc threats. Elves regard gnomes as strange (and sometimes dangerous) curiosities, but regard their magical talent as being worthy of praise and respect. Halflings are often viewed with a measure of pity, for these small folk seem to the elves to be adrift, without a traditional home. Elves are fascinated with humans, who seem to live in a few short years as full a life as an elf manages in centuries. In fact, many elves become infatuated with humans, as evidenced by the number of half-elves in the world. Elves have difficulty accepting crossbreeds of any sort, however, and usually disown such offspring. They similarly regard half-orcs with distrust and suspicion, assuming they possess the worst aspects of orc and human personalities.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Elves are emotional and capricious, yet value kindness and beauty. Most elves are chaotic good, wishing all creatures to be safe and happy, but unwilling to sacrifice personal freedom or choice to accomplish such goals. serving as an example of personal artistry and freedom of expressions, rather than seeking some base physical gratification.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Many elves embark on adventures out of a desire to explore the world, leaving their secluded realms to reclaim forgotten elven magic or search out lost kingdoms established millennia ago by their ancestors. This need to see a wider world is accepted by their societies as a natural part of becoming mature and experienced individuals. Such elves are expected to return in some few decades and take up lives in their homelands once more, enriched both in treasure and in worldview. For those elves raised among humans, however, life within their homes - watching friends and family swiftly age and die - is often stifling, and the ephemeral and unfettered life of an adventurer holds a natural appeal.",
			"",
			"Elves generally eschew melee because of their relative frailty, preferring instead to engage enemies at range. Most see combat as unpleasant even when needful, and prefer it be done as quickly as possible, preferably without getting close enough to smell their foes. This preference for making war at a distance, coupled with their natural accuracy and grasp of the arcane, encourages elves to pursue classes such as wizards and rangers.",

Aquatic elves typically live secluded lives, either on their own or in small communities, though groups of aquatic elves that interact with land-dwelling communities are not uncommon.

Ekujae elves reside within the Mwangi Expanse in hidden jungle villages so interwoven with the surrounding trees that the buildings there are overlooked even by travelers passing within a few hundred feet them. Unlike many of the elves of Avistan, the Ekujae remained on Golarion despite the calamity of Earthfall and tell tales of having defeated a \"Great Darkness\" after the disaster. They still hone their skills for war and are ever ready to fight the Darkness if it returns. Due to this ancient responsibility, Ekujae hold to strict traditions in many matters, including the burying of their fallen and the act of swearing oaths and ritualized agreements.",

			"Like other elves, Ekujae have keen intellects and are skilled in magical lore, including what has been passed down through their oral traditions and the numerous secrets of the Mwangi Expanse. They often journey to the [Magaambya](rule/aff_i_school) to study magic or to share their knowledge with that academy's students.

Forlorn elves often watch many of their friends and family die before their first century is past. Some Forlorn have adopted a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, such as recklessness or substance abuse; others develop antisocial tendencies and keep others at arm's length to avoid the pain of loss. Still others learn to accept the brevity of the lives around them, cherishing what time they have with friends while they still have it.",

Jininese elves have adopted many of the customs of their human and samsaran neighbors-Jinin's culture places great emphasis on artistic pursuits, especially those involving mithral, which serves as a national symbol, lucrative export, and treasured cultural relic for Jininese elves. The elves of Jinin are far less isolationist than many other elven cultures, freely permitting outsiders into Jinin; likewise, while most Jininese elves remain there, many travel or settle across the Dragon Empires and beyond.",
