			"Ugoroths are monstrous, sadistic beings created by aboleths in their long war against the surface world. Alongside their smaller cousins, the faceless stalkers, they work to destabilize surface-dwelling civilizations from within. During the war, the destruction of the aboleth city Voshgurvaghol left them leaderless and without direction. Though they have long forgotten the beings that created them, faceless hulks continue their original mission, driven only by a hatred for humanity that was molded into their very bodies. Some believe that ugoroths still serve their veiled masters, even without their own knowledge.",

			"Ugoroths have flexible, boneless bodies that resist various forms of attack. While they prefer to forgo armor whenever possible, they typically use whatever weapons and equipment are most common among the race they are disguised as. Though they lack many of the special abilities that make each giant race unique, they have managed to adapt facsimiles of several, enough to pass the scrutiny of all but the most discerning of observers. Some older ugoroths acquire magical items and artifacts to bolster themselves with abilities they would normally lack.",
			"",
			"They cannot digest solid food even when they assume the forms of creatures with mouths. Instead, they subsist on liquids, especially blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues, which they use to penetrate and lap blood from smaller humanoids.",
			"",
			"Historians are unsure whether aboleths created the first faceless hulks as part of a larger plot to infiltrate the land-dwelling peoples of Golarion or whether the enlarged faceless stalkers simply evolved from their Medium-sized kin over time. Some scholars of ancient Azlant believe faceless hulks were crafted intentionally to infiltrate the cyclopes the Azlanti enslaved (and the cyclopes of the long-extinct kingdom of Ghol-Gan). Others defend the theory of independent evolution, citing the existence of even larger, older ugoroths (ugoloroths, which are described below) as proof that the faceless hulks of today are simply the descendants of an exceptionally large strain of faceless stalkers. Despite their disagreements, sages recognize that faceless hulks and faceless stalkers now form two distinct species.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",

			"Faceless hulks were originally created to sow discord and animosity between giants and other surface-dwelling races, to further weaken both during the war with the aboleths. Toward that end, ugoroths disguised themselves among the various giant races to attack and spread mayhem in humanoid society. A lone faceless hulk may take the form of a fire or frost giant before attacking a humanoid settlement. Others infiltrate giant tribes and raiding parties, living among them for months or years and manipulating them into causing great violence whenever possible. Greater faceless hulks, which prefer to take the shapes of cloud or storm giants, spend decades in disguise, sparking conflicts that can span generations.",
			"",
			"Unlike typical giants, faceless hulks leave very few casualties in the wake of their attacks. Instead, they favor mass destruction, taking special care to level centers of commerce and locations of political import. These attacks also give them the opportunity to take prisoners they may later feed on in private. Faceless hulks have been known to work together with faceless stalkers to great success. Their smaller kin ensure that humanoid settlements are unprepared for giant attacks, and they later whip the survivors into a frenzy, driving them to retaliate against the giants. By working together this way, the two races can transform minor conflicts into explosive wars.",
			"",
			"Some ugoroths believe they are the divine creations of the god Ghlaunder, who reigns over parasites and stagnation, while others cleave to the atheistic nature of their true creators, the aboleths. A few have taken to worshiping chaotic evil giant deities. Strangely, many faceless hulks consider themselves kin to evil giants, favoring them over their own kind. In some rare cases, they willingly choose to spend their entire lives among giants, pretending to be hermits or wandering sages. This is a particularly dangerous lifestyle for an ugoroth-after generations of slavery, many giants are naturally distrustful of those they don't know. If they discover an ugoroth hiding among them, giants hunt it down without mercy.",
			"",
			"### Greater Faceless Hulks",
			"",
			"Known as ugoloroths among their own kind, the largest and most ancient faceless hulks serve as spies and infiltrators within the societies of the largest races of giantkind, including cloud giants, storm giants, and taiga giants. An ugoloroth is a faceless hulk with the advanced and giant creature simple templates. It gains {feat/Combat Reflexes} and {feat/Greater Bull Rush} as bonus feats. It casts spell-like abilities as a 12th-level caster, and gains levitate and undetectable alignment as at-will spell-like abilities. When using its change shape ability, an ugoloroth can take the shape of any Huge humanoid. More so than their ugoroth kin, ugoloroths often take levels in classes such as barbarian, fighter, ranger, sorcerer, and witch to more easily pass as members of various giant races."

This ray deals normal damage to objects, but is still subject to hardness. Alternatively, a faceless whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60-foot cone.

			"Called \"ansiktsloshvals\" in Aklo, and sometimes called \"Darklands whales,\" faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubberlined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly.",
			"",
			"It is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song.",
			"",
			"An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.",
			"",
			"Faceless whales resemble the toothed whales common to the Arcadian Ocean in body structure, possessing a tapered mouth lined with stubby, conical teeth and a streamlined body. Lacking eyes, faceless whales depend totally upon their keen blindsight to navigate, seek prey, and avoid the predations of the Sightless Sea's most horrific inhabitants. Faceless whales prefer to hunt near the bottom of the Sightless Sea, where crushing pressures and freezing temperatures nurture large, sluggish organisms with few places to hide, and where the whales find safety from other menacing predators. Because of the unusual and outright alien composition of the creatures found within the lowest depths, faceless whales developed indiscriminate appetites. A hungry faceless whale consumes virtually any living thing it can gulp into its jaws, including the plentiful aquatic aberrations. Faceless whales can remain submerged for hours at a time, diving to depths of over 7,000 feet. Faceless whales that survive to adulthood in the harsh conditions of Orv live 80 years or longer.",
			"",
			"As predators that spend the majority of their lives in the deepest waters, Darklands whales are rarely spotted. Those who sail upon the dark currents of the Sightless Sea and Lake Nirthran see these beasts only when the whales surface to breathe. When surfacing, a faceless whale breathes for minutes at a time, exhaling and inhaling massive volumes of air in great misty spouts.",
			"",
			"When a faceless whale finds prey it can easily outswim, it plunges downward with its mouth agape, snapping up the morsel before it can react. When pursuing larger or faster prey, the faceless whale becomes a persistence hunter, hounding its quarry at a deceptively leisurely pace. After what often proves to be days of dogged pursuit, the whale's prey becomes too exhausted to swim further. Before the quarry can marshal the last of its strength to defend itself, the faceless whale renders it helpless with a resonant song. When the faceless whale is not in combat, it uses this sonic attack to break through rock and gain access to new hunting grounds within Orv and beyond.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Faceless whales typically hunt and swim alone, except when prey is abundant. When hunting is favorable, faceless whales organize into pods led by the oldest (and typically largest) female. Pods are short lived, often forming only a handful of times within a faceless whale's lifetime. As such, males compete fiercely for breeding rights during these gatherings. Pods last only as long as prey sustains them. Once food becomes scarce, the pod disperses into the Sightless Sea, and individual whales brave the chill waters alone in search of richer hunting grounds.",
			"",
			"Mated pairs of faceless whales remain together only long enough to raise their first calf. This period of nurturing typically lasts no longer than 5 years-just enough time for the parents to teach a calf basic hunting strategies and witness its first unassisted kill. Afterward, the parents part ways, leaving the calf to mature to adulthood or perish in the uncertain depths of the abyss.",
			"",
			"A faceless whale spends the majority of its life in isolation, plumbing the depths of the Sightless Sea in search of prey, the occasional mate, and hunting grounds rich enough to support a temporary pod. When it makes such a discovery, a faceless whale circles the boundary of the new territory, calling out to its fellows with a groaning, dirge-like song that carries for leagues. Whalers who ply their trade upon the Sightless Sea listen for this dirge with fanatical obsession. Faceless whales provide numerous alchemical ingredients, and their bones and teeth make excellent weapons and armor. An adult faceless whale possesses enough of both to make a crew of whalers rich, provided they have the courage and skill to slay the creature.",
			"",
			"Though faceless whales prefer larger meals, they eagerly prey upon humanoids when other food is scarce. A sailor fallen overboard makes an easy snack for an adult or a full meal for a juvenile. Conventional wisdom claims that faceless whales consider seagoing vessels indigestible, but serpentfolk hiss tales of faceless whales of exceptional cunning that capsize or fracture ships and feast upon the drowning crews, plucking them from among the flotsam.",
			"",
			"On rare occasion, a faceless whale finds its way into the oceans of Golarion. Some believe the creatures possess an instinctive knowledge of hidden waterways linking the Sightless Sea to the world above (perhaps all that remains of the migratory instincts that once drove their cetacean ancestors). Those few faceless whales that venture beyond the Darklands typically do so only briefly, breaching the surface on moonless nights just long enough to take in a breath of air free from the fetid staleness of Orv.",
			"",
			"Many sages postulate that the Sightless Sea is bottomless, its deepest trenches connecting to planes of primordial darkness where the pressure is capable of crushing living beings into stone. It is possible that the Sightless Sea is just one of many faceless whale hunting grounds. If this is the case, there is no telling what a faceless whale might bring up from the ebon depths."

			"A fantionette is a servitor outsider for the halfling deity {faith/Thamir Gixx}. It embodies the halfling god's association with assassination and opportunity, presenting itself to loyal followers of the Silent Blade both as a powerful assassin and as impressive support for established murderers. When left to its own devices on the Material Plane, a fantionette is a terrifying stalker of halflings and humans alike, positioning itself among large groups of human children or halflings and selecting adult targets to murder based entirely on whim and opportunity.",
			"",
			"A fantionette stands between 3 and 4 feet high and weighs about 70 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike other auras, a fantionette's aura of revelation serves as a weakness - a range at which creatures can see through its otherwise illusory guise. A fantionette combines its deceptive form with its ability to blend in to crowds, often positioning itself as part of a group of children or adult halflings. Sometimes a child sees through the fantionette's aura, only for the child to be scared away and attempt to warn her parents. The result is almost always the same: the warned parent glances over at the disguised fantionette, too far outside the aura to perceive its true form, and dismisses the child for being foolish. A fantionette thrives on the fear it generates from children - though it is clear from their patterns of attacks that these outsiders are either somehow forbidden from harming children, or simply prefer not to.",
			"",
			"Once a fantionette is ready to strike, or when an unfortunate witness manages to pierce its illusory form, the fantionette attacks in a flurry of claws accented by vicious bites. In its true form, it has a pair of wicked claws, each made of black chitin and pieces of jagged porcelain. The fantionette also sports a similarly serrated bite; its mouth resembles disjointed spider mandibles with a second layer of chipped porcelain. Fantionettes often employ their claws to cruel effect, combining an uncanny knowledge of anatomy with savage rends that tear most opponents into a bloody mess within seconds. Even creatures attempting to flee an unrestrained fantionette soon discover the outsider is capable of instinctually following - in some cases relinquishing itself to its malignant puppet strings, letting an unseen force drag the fantionette to chase down the fleeing target.",
			"",
			"A wide array of divinely granted powers assists the fantionette in its paired roles as assassin and deceiver. These gifts most often manifest in a variety of spell-like abilities, which the fantionette uses as means to overcome targets or as a way of deflecting scrutiny in social settings. The hand of Thamir Gixx is said to hover invisibly over every fantionette in service to the Silent Blade. While fantionettes are free-willed beings, they can temporarily suspend their independence and allow other forces to guide their malignant claws. Such lapses in control manifest in odd last-second movements, such as a claw destined to miss a foe suddenly jolting upward into a disemboweling strike. Other times, a fantionette moves in an oddly contorted manner; these jerks and jostles reveal that it's being guided by its hidden puppeteer.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"First and foremost, fantionettes are servants of Thamir Gixx. Whether directly delivered by their god or summoned to the Material Plane by eager spellcasters using spells such as {spell/lesser planar ally}, fantionettes seek only to spread the chaotic, murderous joy of their patron deity. Like their god, they also offer deference to the followers of Norgorber. Fantionettes are as likely to work alongside a worshiper of Thamir Gixx as they are to take on the role of plucky sidekick to a fanatical devotee of Norgorber. Of the divine servitor races, perhaps none are more closely aligned than fantionettes and their {monster/karumzek} counterparts. Where fantionettes prefer the eventual chaos of revealing themselves to a target, karumzeks prefer to act entirely behind the scenes. The two outsiders complement each other well, as karumzeks provide alchemical tools and poisons to fantionettes operating in service to Norgorber as part of Thamir Gixx's service to that deity.",
			"",
			"A fantionette's patron will inevitably grow weary of its murderous presence and either destroy the outsider or release it into the wild. On their own, fantionettes often assist thieves and murderers - and disenfranchised halflings in particular - establish a violent reputation by grafting their own long trails of murder and theft that lead to these apprentices. In this way, Thamir Gixx's favored servitors create new worshipers for their patron deity, both by taking on new murderous servants and by using their own murderous actions to remind halfling communities of the presence of the Silent Blade.",
			"",
			"When not acting on the Material Plane, fantionettes are found in equal measure in the Abyss and Axis. In the Abyss, they congregate around their deity's mysterious home, operating as guardians or entertainment, depending on the whims of their capricious master. In the lawful realm of Axis, fantionettes fall in line with the mysterious followers of Norgorber, acting in equal roles as assassins, entertainers, and messengers for the ascended deity in his hidden realm in Axis. Left to their own devices on either plane, fantionettes form horrific gaggles. These groups traverse the planes in search of new arrivals or otherwise weak prey, first presenting themselves as lost or stranded children or halflings. In the Abyss, this deception often surprises voracious demons, who see nothing more than a buffet of innocent humanity and are torn apart shortly after realizing the truth of their would-be meal. In Axis, fantionettes are far more cautious in their attacks. They always relocate to another distant portion of the plane after venting their bloodlust, striving to stay one step ahead of the axiomites and their inevitable enforcers."

When burrowing, a feranth uses its rear legs to smash the sides of its burrow, collapsing the passage behind it.

			"The feranths that now roam Numeria are the descendants of a group that were abducted from a far-off planet and brought to Golarion as part of an ill-fated voyage. They remained locked in their containment pods for many years after their arrival on Golarion, but the damage sustained by the pods eventually became too much: they finally failed, releasing the feranths into the unsuspecting world. Using their sharp claws, the creatures burrowed through the structurally weakened hull of the starship in which they were contained, emerging onto the surface of a strange new planet.",
			"",
			"On their native planet, feranths were apex predators that devoured prey with endless appetite, and the few living on Golarion remain true to this behavior. Feranths move on to a new location only after exhausting most sources of available food. While feranths do eventually return to previous hunting grounds, they instinctively wait many years for food sources to replenish before terrorizing those regions once again.",
			"",
			"Because of feranths' highly territorial nature, battles between two rivals are vicious affairs that can take hours or even days to resolve, and almost invariably end with one of the combatants bloodied, limping, and nearly dead. Yet deaths are surprisingly rare during these trials, despite the ferocity with which they are fought. It seems that feranths prefer to simply frighten and weaken their rivals rather than killing them outright.",
			"",
			"When hunting prey, feranths tend to use ambush tactics. They often charge up through the ground once they have pinpointed their prey's location using tremorsense, and then unleash a mighty roar to further discombobulate their victims. Feranths often repeat this tactic many times during an encounter with prey, diving beneath the ground only to erupt back up a few seconds or even minutes later.",
			"",
			"Fortunately for the inhabitants of Numeria, female feranths are rare on Golarion - a fact that keeps the beasts' numbers low. It's uncertain whether this same discrepancy in the ratio between the sexes exists on the feranths' home planet. Females are by far the most ferocious members of the species, especially in the few months following the hatching of their eggs. During this time, a female feranth can be identified by her mottled red-brown skin tone and vicious temperament. For 3 months after their eggs hatch, female feranths have the {umr/blood rage/ universal monster} ability. A female usually mates multiple times during her lifetime, laying two eggs each time. She cares for her offspring for 3 years before the juveniles abandon their mother, leaving in search of their own territories in which to hunt. Juvenile feranths that have just left their families are often about 12 feet tall and 20 feet long.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that feranths' behavior on Golarion is much the same now as it was on their home planet, with one key difference: their range. Rather than roaming great swaths of territory like their ancestors did, feranths on Golarion remain primarily in Numeria. Some of these creatures have wandered into the Worldwound, however, and every now and then one rampages through the northern reaches of the River Kingdoms, across the southern border of Mendev, or along the eastern edge of Brevoy. For unknown reasons, feranths avoid treading into Ustalav.",
			"",
			"Feranths prefer to carve their lairs out of hillsides where they can monitor the passage of potential prey, but they sometimes dig dens deep underground to protect themselves from ambush by rival feranths. It is most common for a feranth to construct its home underground when other feranths threaten its territory, but females of the species also dig underground lairs when they are ready to lay and hatch their eggs. Thus, the presence of an underground feranth lair is a sign of greater danger: either the nearby area is infested with other feranths, or the den belongs to a ferocious feranth mother.",
			"",
			"Crafty Kellid tribes have learned some tricks, such as the use of earplugs or silencing magic, to counteract the beasts' advantages. They also bait feranths into traps or enclosed canyons using livestock or other large animals. The Kellids use these tactics not only to fight these alien beasts, but also to capture them - a few captive feranths have even been trained for combat by various tribes. Powerful alchemical concoctions are mixed and fed to a captive feranth, as it is necessary to cloud the creature's mind to tame it. In this state, the feranth becomes docile and seemingly forgets how to burrow, making it easy for the tribe to keep its prized beast nearby. Once the feranth's mind is clouded, blinders can be attached to limit the creature's field of vision, allowing a brave barbarian rider to guide it in battle. When the time comes for the feranth to fight, a second concoction is fed to the beast to give it a burst of energy, sending it into a rampage.",
			"",
			"The Red Dog tribe in Numeria's Sellen Hills was renowned for many years for its control of a feranth, a feat that its leaders parleyed into an alliance between a number of nearby tribes. This alliance - and the entire Red Dog tribe - ended abruptly when the captive feranth eventually developed a tolerance to the alchemical concoctions used to keep it docile."

Its serene appearance and dreamlike demeanor harken to its origins, for in life it slept away the centuries in a state of magical or technological stasis. Now, whether by accident or malign intent, the fluxwraith's soul lies scattered across the timestream. Demented by its paradoxical consciousness, it yearns to destroy any living being audacious enough to exist within a single point of time.",
			"",
			"Because its appearance depends upon its state when it first entered suspended animation, viewers may sometimes be able to deduce clues about its former life, as well as its motivations for entering hibernation. Some seek interminable sleep while they are in the prime of life, aiming to awaken and embrace immortality as a perfect specimen, while others hope to defer a terminal diagnosis. However, the sleeper's motivations in life seldom define a fluxwraith's outlook, as the process of becoming undead erases all but the most deeply ingrained mortal traits.",
			"",
			"The first hint of the fluxwraith's destructive nature manifests in the caul of energy that winks on and off around it. This ever-shifting network of temporal energy contains fragments of its consciousness, appearing as flickering aspects of itself as a youth, an adult, or a corpse. Scrutinizing these vignettes may provide further clues about the fluxwraith's former existence, although any creature that enters the fluxwraith's aura, or any creature affected by its attacks, may begin to see its own reflections appear within the shards as well. These disturbing images depict a creature not as it is, but as the fluxwraith perceives it in the past or future.",
			"",
			"Fluxwraiths tend to speak ancient or dead languages, often murmuring incomplete or garbled statements that blend past and future tenses in unsettling ways.",

Yet temporal stasis carries many risks, and any damage to the sleeper's pod may kill its inhabitant, or worse. Some types of malfunctions kill the sleeper's physical body but scatter its awareness across the timestream, causing its consciousness to exist in every moment at once. This process shreds the sleeper's sanity but imbues its spirit with terrifying temporal powers, resulting in a fluxwraith.",
			"",
			"The malfunction also causes most fluxwraiths to lose the skills and abilities they had in life. They do retain a sharp intellect, although they see the world through a distorted lens of madness, malice, and heightened temporal awareness. A fluxwraith perceives living creatures as knotted threads of time-bound energy begging to be untied and twisted into more pleasing patterns, and it revels in its capacity to shift victims through time or even freeze them for eternity.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, a demented spellcaster may purposely create a fluxwraith seeking to harness temporal power for her own use. In such cases, the sleeper is usually tricked into entering its slumber with promises of immortality, after which its malice and fury are only increased by the betrayal. A fluxwraith does not remain subservient to any master, and it invariably overpowers its creator.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Though no one knows why, fluxwraiths rarely drift far from the damaged sleeping chambers that spawned them. Some might harbor an unconscious hope that their pods might be repaired, enabling them to return to a more peaceful time-bound sleep; others might simply feel no need for physical movement, since their minds now roam unfettered through the timestream.",
			"",
			"A fluxwraith may prefer solitude, attacking intruders on sight. Others relish the chance to toy with visitors before severing them from the timestream. An ambitious fluxwraith might employ underlings to kidnap living beings, providing it with a steady stream of organic \"puzzles\" to unravel. Occasionally, a system-wide malfunction results in the creation of several fluxwraiths at once. These clusters become monomaniacal, plotting to spread their influence far beyond their lair. Using tantalizing glimpses of the future, they entice evil mortals or lesser undead to scour the world for time-based artifacts in order to vastly boost the range of their innate abilities."
