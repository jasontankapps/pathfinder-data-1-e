			"## Cleric Domains",
			"",
			"A cleric's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that domain. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment domains still applies.",
			"",
			"Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.",
			"",
			"In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, using a domain power is a standard action.",
			"",
			"### Subdomains",
			"",
			"Each subdomain replaces a granted power and a number of spells in the domain's granted spell list. A cleric who chooses a subdomain must have access to both the domain and its subdomain from her deity. If a cleric selects a subdomain, she cannot select its associated domain as her other domain choice (in effect, the subdomain replaces its associated domain). Subdomains are treated as equivalent to their associated domain for any effect or prerequisite based on domains. If a subdomain has two associated domains, the cleric can only select the subdomain for one of her domains. Subdomains can be selected by Druids (except the metal subdomain) and inquisitors (if their deity allows it).",
			"",
			"If a subdomain ability calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's cleric level + her Wisdom modifier.",

This attack is resolved as normal, but it has an additional effect depending on the type of strike chosen. At 9th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, a monk learns an additional style strike. He must choose which style strike to apply before the attack roll is made.

If this second attack hits, it deals damage as normal, but all of the damage is nonlethal. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Flying Kick[^D]** The monk leaps through the air to strike a foe with a kick. Before the attack, the monk can move a distance equal to his fast movement bonus. This movement is made as part of the monk's flurry of blows attack and does not require an additional action. At the end of this movement, the monk must make an attack against an adjacent foe. This movement may be between attacks. This movement provokes an attack of opportunity as normal. The attack made after the movement must be a kick.",

			"**Head-Butt[^D]** The monk slams his head into his enemy's head, leaving his foe reeling. If the attack hits and the foe is of the same size or one size smaller than the monk, the monk can make a free combat maneuver check against the target of this strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the foe is not of the same creature type as the monk, the monk takes a -8 penalty on this check. If the check is successful, the target is staggered for 1 round. Creatures without a discernible head are not affected by this style strike (subject to GM discretion). The monk must attack with a head-butt to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Knockback Kick[^D]** The monk attempts to knock his foe back with a powerful kick. If the attack hits, the monk can attempt a free combat maneuver check against the foe (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the check is successful, the foe is knocked 10 feet directly away from the monk. This distance increases by 10 feet for every 5 by which the check exceeds the foe's CMD, to a maximum distance equal to the monk's fast movement bonus. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The foe stops moving if it strikes another creature, barrier, or otherwise solid object. The creature is not knocked prone by this movement. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Leg Sweep[^D]** The monk attempts to sweep his foe's leg, knocking the opponent down. If the attack hits, the monk can make a free trip attempt against the target of this strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Overbearing Assault[^C]** The monk attacks relentlessly, backing his foe into a corner. If the attack hits, the monk can perform a free reposition combat maneuver against the target of the strike (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe) with a -5 penalty. This reposition attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Rabbit Punch[^E]** The monk gives a sharp blow to the back of a foe's head. The critical threat range and critical multiplier of this strike increase by 1, and the monk gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls to confirm a critical hit with this strike. This increase is not doubled by {feat/Improved Critical} or similar effects. Creatures without a discernible head are unaffected by this style strike (subject to GM discretion). The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Shattering Punch[^D]** The monk delivers a brutal punch that can penetrate defenses. If the attack hits, it bypasses any damage reduction or hardness possessed by the target of that attack. The monk must attack with a fist to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Spin Kick[^D]** The monk spins about, delivering a kick his foe did not expect. The monk makes his attack against the foe's flat-footed AC. Creatures with the uncanny dodge class feature or a similar effect cannot be caught flat-footed by this style strike. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.",
			"",
			"**Throat Crush[^A]** The monk gives a sharp blow to a foe's throat, hampering its ability to speak for 1 round as if it had the [caster croak spellblight](rule/minor_spellblights). Creatures without a discernible throat, or with multiple vocal organs, are unaffected (subject to GM discretion).",

			"Witch patrons are enigmatic entities, sometimes fair minded and other times malevolent. Some are demigods or powerful spirits, such as those that grant shamans their spellcasting. Others are manifestations of cosmic forces, created by the certainty of mortals and the fundamental need for balance in much the same way aeons manifest. While kindly patrons are rare - attracting worshipers more readily than agents - the majority are high-minded and neutral figures. They dispense arcane power to those whose interests and mindsets align with their needs, and once a witch drifts from the cause or refuses to pay the price for such power, her patron divests the spellcaster of her powers and departs. Wicked patrons enjoy longer-lasting relationships, however, manipulating the witches' minds and punishing disobedience in a manner far more personal than an evil god. The familiar of a wicked patron becomes equal parts power source and prison guard, forever studying its charge for disobedience.",
			"",
			"The various published witch patron themes present a wide array of concepts and priorities to align with a large variety of supernatural beings. Some specific patrons, however, might offer variations within the spells they grant. Special patrons swap out the spells normally provided by a patron theme at specific levels, and grant a specific hex and drawback at 1st level. Once a specific patron has been selected, a witch cannot change her patron or raise a hand against that entity without losing her spellcasting, hexes, and familiar. These categories are limited in the patron themes they can provide; their witches must select from one of the four listed for each entry. These patrons are extraordinary examples of their kind, often invested with unique or mythic powers and pursuing long-term agendas measured in centuries or eons.",

			"An iconic ability of clerics is their power to channel positive or negative energy, whether for healing, for damage, or to turn or command the undead. However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. The following categories are examples of alternative channeling abilities based on the nature of a deity's power; for example, a fire deity's negative energy channeling may deal fire damage as part of or instead of the damage from channeling.",
			"",
			"When you create a cleric character, decide whether she uses the standard form of channel energy or a variant presented here based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio. Once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. Variant channeling has the same area of effect, save DCs, uses per day, and other rules relating to channeling energy. Feats and abilities that modify or present alternative uses for channeled energy (such as Command Undead and Turn Undead) work normally with these variant channeling abilities.",
			"",
			"A variant channeling either modifies positive channeled energy when used to heal or modifies negative energy when used to harm. When using positive energy to heal, affected creatures gain only half the normal amount of healing but also receive a specific beneficial effect. When channeling negative energy to harm, affected creatures take only half the normal damage but take an additional penalty or harmful effect; a successful saving throw negates the additional penalty or effect but does not reduce the damage any further. Creatures that would normally ignore the effect of a particular channel (such as undead with respect to a positive energy channel used to heal) ignore the variant effect of that channel.",
			"",
			"Some variant channeling abilities are enhanced when used on particular creature types. Such channeling increases the normal healing or damage from channeled energy by 50% for that creature type, rather than the default half healing or damage for the alternative channeling. For example, a 7th-level cleric normally heals 4d6 points of damage with channeled positive energy; with the Nature alternative channeling, that cleric instead heals only half that amount (2d6) when channeling, but heals animals and fey an additional +50% over the unhalved value (4d6 + 50%).",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise stated, bonuses granted by a variant channeling are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. If an alternative channeled energy provides a \"channel bonus\" on rolls or statistics, the bonus is +1, increasing to +2 at cleric level 5 and for every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5). Likewise, a \"channel penalty\" is initially -1, increasing to -2 at cleric level 5 and every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of -5).",
			"",
			"A character who has the channel energy ability from a class other than cleric may use these variant channeling rules if the class's abilities are tied to serving a deity. For example, paladins can select alternative channeling abilities if they serve a deity, as can oracles with the Life mystery (as they serve many deities), but necromancer wizards cannot.",

If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite.

These claws are natural weapons that can be extended at will and deal 1d4 points of piercing and slashing damage (1d3 if the vigilante is Small). At 11th level, the damage increases to 1d6 (1d4 if Small).[^I]",
			"",
			"**Turnabout (Ex):** A vigilante with this talent can capitalize on any opportunities in combat. Whenever a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the vigilante by attacking or casting a spell, the vigilante can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check in place of the attack of opportunity. If he succeeds at the check, in addition to the usual options, the vigilante can redirect the attack or spell to a new target or area the foe could have chosen.[^N]",
			"",
			"**Unexpected Strike (Ex):** The vigilante gains {feat/Quick Draw} as a bonus feat. At 8th level, he can draw hidden weapons as a swift action (instead of a move action).[^C]",
			"",
			"**Vigilante's Reflexes (Ex):** The vigilante gains {feat/Combat Reflexes} as a bonus feat. If he already has the Combat Reflexes feat, he instead gains another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Combat Reflexes.

			"",

Once per round, before he makes an attack of opportunity, he can declare it to be a vital punishment. If the attack hits, the vigilante can apply the Vital Strike feat. The vigilante can apply the {feat/Improved Vital Strike} or {feat/Greater Vital Strike} feat as his vital punishment instead if he later gains those feats. A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent[^H]",
			"",
			"**Volatile Arrows (Ex):** A vigilante with this talent gains the ability to attach an alchemist bomb to a ranged attack he makes with a bow or crossbow as part of firing the attack. If the attack hits, it deals an additional amount of damage equal to that of an alchemist bomb, using the vigilante's level as his alchemist level to determine the bomb's damage. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. The vigilante can takes this talent multiple times. Each time he does, he can use the ability one additional time per day and he gains one alchemist discovery that can modify bombs, treating his vigilante level as his alchemist level for any prerequisites. He can apply these discoveries to his bombs as normal.[^D]",
			"",
			"**Vortex Splash (Ex):** When in rain or waist deep in water, the vigilante can make a whirling splash as a full-round action, allowing him to attempt a single dirty trick combat maneuver or feint against each adjacent foe. The vigilante can make a separate choice for each target.[^M]",
			"",
			"**Whip of Vengeance (Ex):** The vigilante gains {feat/Whip Mastery} as a bonus feat. If he already has the Whip Mastery feat, he can immediately swap it for another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Whip Mastery. In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he also gains the Improved Whip Mastery feat. He treats his vigilante level as his vigilante base attack bonus for the purpose of meeting prerequisites of feats and abilities that have Whip Mastery as a prerequisite.[^N]",

			"## Monk Vows",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic/50}  ",
			"A monk can discipline his body to hold more ki by upholding the strict tenets of a vow. By adhering to his vow's tenets, the monk's ki pool increases by the amount listed in the vow's description. Every vow comes with a penalty or limitation to offset this increase in ki. A monk can take a vow at any level, but it does not add to his ki pool until he gains a ki pool as a class feature. A monk who takes a vow never gains the still mind class feature, even if he abandons all his vows.",
			"",
			"If a monk knowingly and willingly breaks his vow, his ki pool is reduced to 0 (as if he had spent all of his ki points) and he cannot replenish his pool or use abilities that require ki or a ki pool until he has redeemed himself. Redemption requires a recommitment to his vow accompanied by an {spell/atonement} spell. After the redemption, the monk's normal ki pool (without the bonus from the vow) returns. If he upholds the previously broken vow for a full month, his ki pool regains the additional points from taking the vow, and he can decide whether to continue with his vow or forgo his vow without penalty. Once a monk forgoes a vow in this fashion, she can never gain a ki point bonus from that vow.",
			"",
			"A monk may have multiple vows. Their effects and increase to his ki pool stack. If a monk violates a vow, he suffers the loss of ki described above; redemption means the monk regains the extra ki from his unbroken vows, but the extra ki from the broken vow does not return until he finishes the month-long commitment (in effect, violating one vow does not have an effect on the other vows once the monk redeems himself).",
			"",
			"**Celibacy:** The monk must abstain from all sexual and intimate physical activity. A monk with this vow takes it to an extreme, refusing to even share a room with another person, or sleeping on the opposite side of a camp from other people in a group. A celibate monk is not allowed to touch others or have others touch him (including touch spells from allies). Striking enemies in battle or being struck by enemies is not prohibited, but the monk shuns all peaceful or pleasurable contact. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Chains:** Either out of penitence or to bring attention to the suffering of the enslaved, the monk wears shackles on his wrists and legs. This gives the monk a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC, and reduces his movement by 10 feet. If temporarily unable to wear his chains, he may carry rocks or some other heavy burden (including medium or heavy armor) to simulate this suffering. A monk with this vow increasing his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 3 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Cleanliness:** A monk undertaking this vow must wash daily. He must change into fresh clothes daily or shortly after his robes become dirty. His appearance must be kept immaculate, including either neatly braiding or shaving off his hair (and, for male monks, maintaining a clean-shaven face). His vow forbids him from willingly touching the filthy, diseased, dead, or undead (though he may attempt to cleanse or heal those suffering from disease), though using manufactured weapons to attack these creatures is allowed. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Fasting:** The monk eats nothing but rice (or a similar bland, staple food) and drinks nothing but water. On certain days (usually once per month or on a religious holiday), he may eat a small portion of other simple, bland food to maintain proper nutrition. The monk cannot use tobacco, drugs, potions, alchemical items requiring eating or drinking, or any other thing that could be considered a food or beverage. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Peace:** The monk must strive to attain peace and may only use violence as a last resort. He can never strike the first blow in combat. If attacked, he must use the fight defensively action or the total defense action for the first 2 rounds. He must always give his opponent the option to surrender, and cannot purposely slay another creature that could reasonably be influenced to flee or join a civilized society as a productive member (obviously this excludes many monsters). Many monks who have taken this vow learn how to grapple and pin opponents, tying them with specialized knots that allow them to work themselves free after sufficient effort. Many monks of peace are vegetarians. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Poverty:** The monk taking a vow of poverty must never own more than six possessions - a simple set of clothing, a pair of sandals or shoes, a bowl, a sack, a blanket, and any one other item. Five of these items must be of plain and simple make, though one can be of some value (often an heirloom of great personal significance to the monk). The monk can never keep more money or wealth on his person than he needs to feed, bathe, and shelter himself for 1 week in modest accommodations. He cannot borrow or carry wealth or items worth more than 50 gp that belong to others. He is allowed to accept and use curative potions (or similar magical items where the item is consumed and is valueless thereafter) from other creatures. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 2 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Silence:** The monk must speak no words and attempt to be quiet in his actions. Accidental noises and the sounds of battle (such as the sound of a fist or weapon striking an opponent) do not affect his vow, though most monks with this vow choose their weapons and opponents so as to minimize even these sounds. The monk is allowed to make a non-vocal noise to warn another of danger (such as by stomping or clapping). The monk is allowed to use gestures and motions to communicate with others (including sign language) and is allowed to write. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Truth:** The monk is not allowed to deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, stating half-truths with the intent to deceive, exaggerating, telling white lies, and so on. This applies to all forms of communication. If presented with circumstances where telling the truth would bring harm to another, the monk remains silent. Many monks of this vow also take a vow of silence to show their commitment. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1)."

			"When a character in tune with nature comes upon an area that a {family/kami} could ward but that is lacking a guardian, she has the option of making that area her ward in a symbiotic relationship. Whenever a character with the animal focus class feature is within 100 feet per class level of one of the wards listed below, she can use the associated ward aspect instead of one of the normal options for her animal focus class feature. Hunters can apply the benefits of a ward aspect to themselves, but not to their animal companions.",
			"",
			"If a character with the animal focus class feature spends 30 minutes meditating while within 10 feet per class level of the ward, she attunes herself to that ward. A character attuned to a ward can use the associated ward aspect while within 1 mile per class level. A character can be attuned to only one ward at a time, but depending on her surroundings, she could choose from among multiple wards. A character with the second animal focus class feature can still only use one ward aspect at a time, no matter how many aspects she has available to her.",
			"",
			"The following ward aspects are available to characters who meet the conditions described above.",
			"",
			"*Road:* The creature gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its base speed while running, charging, or withdrawing. This bonus increases to +20 feet at 8th level and +30 feet at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Shrine:* The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Tree:* The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against death effects and effects that deal negative energy damage. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.",

			"*Waymarker:* The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.",
