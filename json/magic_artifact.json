On a failed check, the removal attempt is unsuccessful and cannot be attempted again for 24 hours. Failing this check by more than 5 causes damage to the core and reduces its total number of spell points by 1. Returning a core to an inactive automaton's body to restore the creature requires another Spellcraft check with the same DC.

These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over.

It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed - but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the monkey's paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell {spell/major curse} (DC 25 to remove). This curse manifests as the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple wishes are used before past curses are removed. Once all three wishes are used, the monkey paw plane shifts to a random plane and begins the process anew.",

As the owner would normally age, the portrait appears to age instead. The owner of a soul portrait does not die of old age. If someone benefitting from this effect ceases to be the portrait's owner, she immediately gains all associated physical penalties from her current age, and her appearance changes appropriately; if the owner is past her maximum age, she withers and dies instantly.",

For the purposes of the misdirection, the soul portrait provides results as the owner would have when she first acquired the portrait. Unlike a normal misdirection, this effect is not limited to spells that detect her aura. Whenever it would be beneficial to her, the owner counts as her younger self for any spell or effect that gathers information. For instance, if she denies committing a crime she perpetrated after she commissioned the portrait, all forms of truth magic would reveal her denial as being true. Even spells like detect thoughts would reveal the thoughts of her younger self.",

The soul portrait can be healed of ability damage, ability drain, and negative levels to reduce the accrued maladies by any effects that would normally heal these maladies.",

The large crystal composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh.

The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as well.",

When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion.",

			"This huge, ornate throne, carved from white marble and inlaid with flickering, smoking, multicolored spirals of serpentstone, is uncomfortably tall and thin for most humans, as it is designed to seat a high priest of the serpentfolk. While seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level or higher to cast {spell/dispel magic}. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level may instead cast {spell/greater dispel magic} in place of a spell of 6th level or higher. This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of clerics and druids, but may also be employed by antipaladins, inquisitors, oracles, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied.",

			"The Throne of Ydersius Ascendant can only be destroyed by anointing it with the blood of Ydersius, followed by a successful mage's disjunction spell cast on the throne by a cleric of an Azlanti deity."
