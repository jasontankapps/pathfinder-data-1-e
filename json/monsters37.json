			"These carnivorous marsupials, sometimes called tumblespikes, are irritable desert-dwelling creatures that even predators leave alone. They are aggressive and often attack creatures that are larger than themselves. Pilos plow toward their foes and attempt to gore these foes with their spikes, bellowing a wheezing series of grunts. When provoked by a creature much larger than themselves or a particularly dangerous predator, pilos roll up into a spiny ball to deter attacks. Their aggressive nature means that they often fight until they die or until their opponent perishes or flees. Though pilos are only 3 feet long, their muscular bodies and spikes - which constantly grow - contribute to their 80-pound weight. Like many marsupials, pilos carry their young in a pouch, which they protect by remaining rolled up except when hunting."

Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own.

Nothosaurs are also similar in many ways to seals - they spend much of their time in the water, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is most vulnerable out of the water, but when caught unawares, it can return to the water with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in water of any temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of many months. From head to the tip of its tail, an adult nothosaur is 12 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.",

A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient flukedriven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with.

Only 2d6 hours after death, as long as the majority of the creature's body remains relatively intact, a new protoshoggoth tears itself out of the corpse. This destroys the old body, preventing spells like speak with dead or raise dead from functioning on the remains. A creature slain by an effect such as disintegrate that leaves no body behind can't spawn a proto-shoggoth.

			"**Infect Flesh (Ex)** When a living creature takes damage from a proto-shoggoth's constrict ability, the monster infects the creature's flesh with its alien enzymes. The victim can resist this infection with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. Otherwise, the creature becomes sickened as microscopic fragments of proto-shoggoth tissue infest the victim, slowly transforming it from the inside into proto-shoggoth material. In addition to being sickened as long as the creature remains infected, it must succeed at an additional DC 23 Fortitude save once every 24 hours or it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain as its body begins to consume itself. This is an infestation effect. An infestation is similar to a disease, but it can be cured only through specific means; no matter how many saving throws a target succeeds at, the infestation continues to affect the target. While remove disease or similar spells can halt the progress of this infected flesh as if it were a disease, immunity to disease offers no protection. Application of negative energy can halt this infestation as well; each time an infected creature is reduced to negative hit points by such an effect, the victim can attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save. On a success, the infection immediately ends as the negative energy scours the proto-shoggoth material out of the victim's body. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

In order to do so, each proto-shoggoth must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save - if either fails, both proto-shoggoths become staggered for 1d6 rounds. Those two proto-shoggoths are then incompatible, and can never again attempt to merge with each other, although the individual proto-shoggoths can attempt to do so with other proto-shoggoths in the future.

If approached peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make them flee.",

They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.",
			"",
			"Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 pounds. A pseudodragon egg is the size of a chicken egg, but leathery and spotted brown, and a mating female lays 2-5 eggs every spring. A clutch of pseudodragons (the collective noun-not to be confused with pseudodragons from the same brood of eggs) usually consists of a mated pair and several near-adult offspring."

			"As part of the fallout of a major supernatural phenomenon or mentally disturbing event, the collective unconscious of a population of psychic beings can give rise to a self-aware intellect that's known as a psychemental.

			"While these inquisitive, unpredictable creatures are not inherently evil, they do temporarily absorb fragments of others' minds in order to heal themselves. And though psychementals seek out interactions with intelligent creatures for the pleasures of learning about the world and socializing, an encounter with one can be a dangerous affair if it feels threatened or provoked. Unfortunately, this occurs fairly often, as the upsetting stimuli that prompted a psychemental's creation leave it more easily startled than other creatures. A psychemental's attacks are never lethal on their own - the stolen mental fragments eventually reform themselves within the victim's mind over time - but the potential to leave a victim comatose for an extended period of time can be quite dangerous in its own right. Yet sentient beings who approach a psychemental calmly and without any ill intent find the creatures to be extremely engaging conversationalists, and psychementals' very natures guarantee that they are experts in a variety of esoteric topics. A creature that manages to make a psychemental feel safe may have just earned a highly unusual friend for life."

			"A psychepore is a symbiosis of two different plant creatures - a lurching bit of undergrowth distantly related to the shambling mound and an intelligent cluster of hard fungal growths that possess a malevolent hive mind. On their own, the shambling undergrowth is an unintelligent creature, barely aware enough to move itself to new sources of sunlight and water, while the fungal conks, for their part, are intelligent but immobile. The two pose a serious threat only once the psychic fungus infests the shambling undergrowth, and the creatures transform into the horrifying psychepore.",
			"",

Generally, the only creatures with which these spores can coexist are the shambles that form the base of a psychepore, but these spores also have strange effects on creatures that aren't their typical hosts. Such creatures suffer from delusional visions as their minds try to assimilate or reject the images presented by the alien will of the strange symbionts, and their bodies desperately attempt to force the foreign spores out. Some cultures harvest psychepores to distill their poison into a powerful drug, using it in religious rituals that search for inner knowledge or in dark alleys as a temporary escape from cruel, short lives - or transforming it into a truth serum used during psychological torture and other types of interrogation.",
			"",
			"Most psychepores attack only in vain attempts to procreate, never seeming frustrated by their usually futile efforts, but more intelligent specimens pursue less direct but more fruitful approaches, often serving those who aid in gathering the undergrowth they need to replicate. There are rumors of even more highly developed and intelligent versions of these creatures that learn the secrets of telepathy and how to adjust their poison to replicate possession magic. These superintelligent psychepores become more aware of cultural structures and take great joy in manipulating other forms of life to achieve their goals.",

Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg \"hatches\" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as baleful polymorph with the creature having failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature.

			"The gongorinans are the spawn of the qlippoth lord Yamasoth, although one could be forgiven for thinking of them less as offspring and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an immense, stocky crab, save that it lacks crabs' aquatic adaptations-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical gongorinan has no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that. Each gongorinan has four arms, and each is a different, highly specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or wielding weapons, while the mantis-like claw is used to shred flesh and create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to snatch and hold victims close for oviposition.",
			"",
			"A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder. Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist (and often have additional and even more dangerous arms), but these are quite rare save for in realms where Yamasoth's influence is strong.",
			"",
			"All gongorinans carry a brood of horrific egg masses, yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind (a process governed by a more traditional and nightmarish method best left undescribed). Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans' lord Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs. The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor that's neither tongue nor toothed, prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the oviposition process leaves the horrid qlippoth open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to a lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed.",
			"",
			"Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location for the duration. Victims are often cocooned in webs while the egg gestates. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't hatch so much as it merge with the host, effecting a horrific and permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can influence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful creatures already found in the region, for these \"young\" are loyal to their parent and serve it as guardians or playthings. Victims retain no portion of their previous personality, but those who have been rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of their time as a monstrosity. Many never quite recover from these ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard their life as a monster as having been their true life, and their true form and life as the curse. The most despondent seek the promise of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing to return to the qlippoth's arms.",
			"",
			"Gongorinans are an industrious breed of qlippoth, and wherever they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes in which to live. These gongorinan \"cities\" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers for their transformed children. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but the Material Plane is no stranger to their hive cities",

Treat this as an engulf attack, except that at the start of the iathavos's turn, an engulfed creature must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be transformed into a nyogoth qlippoth that immediately squirms out of the iathavos's body to serve its new master. Creatures transformed into nyogoths are not controlled by the iathavos, but function and behave as if they were typical members of that species - they retain no memories or abilities they may have possessed in their previous lives. Items held or worn by the unfortunate victim remain lodged within the folds of the iathavos's body and can only be retrieved if the iathavos is helpless or dead. A creature transformed into a nyogoth in this manner can be restored to its true shape via break enchantment, miracle, or wish. Otherwise, slaying the nyogoth allows the poor soul to be restored to life via {spell/reincarnate}, {spell/resurrection}, or {spell/true resurrection}. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Each of these beams of energy can be directed at a single target within 300 feet of the iathavos, but no more than one beam may be directed at any one creature. Beams that are not directed at a creature are wasted. The qlippoth must make a +15 ranged touch attack to hit with each beam. Each beam has the same effect as a CL 20th disintegrate (40d6 damage, DC 32 Fortitude partial for 5d6 damage), except a creature killed by this damage explodes in a 5-foot burst of energy, flesh, shadow, and smoke instead of turning into dust. Any creature in this burst must make a DC 32 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures in reach of these strands of ichor must make a DC 32 Reflex save or become entangled. At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures entangled by the ichor take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the qlippoth ends its turn with no hit point damage, the ichor melts away into harmless mist, releasing all entangled creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Believed by many to be a singular entity, a unique qlippoth so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time, the iathavos is often encountered attended by numerous nyogoth qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by its shuddersome passing. These nyogoths are invariably other creatures that the iathavos has absorbed and remade - they represent one of the most heinous fates that could await would-be explorers of the deepest Abyssal rifts.",
			"",
			"The iathavos crusades against the demonic scourge, but the monster does not limit its attentions to seeking out and destroying demons in preparation for the return of the Abyss to qlippoth rule. Indeed, the iathavos has the ability to shift among the various planes of the multiverse, and often travels to Material Plane worlds to systematically scour realms clean of mortal life, thus ensuring that these worlds can no longer provide the raw materials - sinful mortal souls - the Abyss relies upon to create new demons. Worlds visited by the iathavos are notable for the widespread devastation and the unusually large populations of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay the iathavos leaves behind.",
			"",
			"The iathavos can be called via the most powerful spells, such as gate, but its immunity to mind-affecting effects and its vast size ensure that only the most desperate or most insane ever attempt such a self-destructive act. In all known cases, the deliberate conjuration of the iathavos to another world has done little more than draw the attention of the powerful creature to that world, so that even if it is banished back to the Abyss before it can cause too much devastation, the iathavos remembers the visit. It often returns under its own power at a later date to pursue its own goals on the newly discovered world. Only if the iathavos is presented with defenders that prevent it from achieving its destructive ruin does it flee back to the Abyss via plane shift - in such cases, the qlippoth often waits for centuries or even millennia before returning to that world, for there are always easier realms to destroy.",
			"",
			"The iathavos is a powerful and horrifying monster made all the more devastating by its incredible intellect. The creature takes care to plan its major assaults on demonic enclaves or mortal cities, even though it is powerful enough that few creatures in the multiverse can give it pause.",
			"",
			"When the iathavos is slain, the multiverse typically has only a relatively short time before the Abyss births a replacement monstrosity for the defeated qlippoth. This newly born iathavos is an entirely new creature - it does not share the memories of the previous incarnation, nor does it possess any advanced hit dice or class levels the previous monster may have gained, yet its appetite and hatred for demonic life and the sins that create such life remain constant and unending.",
			"",
			"To call such an iathavos a \"newborn\" is somewhat misleading. Although technically a freshly created creature, newborn iathavoses do not undergo a \"childhood.\" They form fully grown, as presented here. Yet with each new incarnation of the qlippoth monstrosity, changes can occur. A new iathavos might have slightly different spell-like abilities, for example, or the nature of its horrific appearance might change from that presented here. As an iathavos continues to hunt and destroy, it grows more powerful - an advanced iathavos typically gains more racial Hit Dice as a result. An iathavos that gains power by taking class levels is not unheard of, but it is quite rare-most who do take levels in sorcerer.",

The Kingdom of New Flesh is populated by the unholy experiments of the qlippoth lord, ravenous monstrosities who feed upon one another and any other beings so foolish or unlucky as to wind up in this accursed place. Some of the most fecund of these experiments are called vexenions, and they have proliferated across the Abyss.

While it is believed that Yamasoth employs these sickening things to gather material for its own endless experiments, the qlippoth lord seems to care little where the vexenions travel. For this reason, the creatures proliferate like a plague across the Abyss. Perhaps this is Yamasoth's ultimate intent.",

			"Vexenions are at home in nearly any environment where they can find flesh on which to feast, though they often lair in places where they might easily ambush prey: demonic crossroads, ruins, and blasted forests where they can use the high limbs and trunks of dead trees to ambulate above their unknowing prey. In fact, this is the qlippoth's preferred method of stalking potential meals: suspended above, employing their impressive climbing skills to move from tree to tree. Caverns of stalactites or the pillars of ruined demon cities can serve the same purpose for them.",
			"",
			"Despite their hideous, almost ooze-like appearance, vexenions are intelligent creatures. They lack the apparatus for speech but delight in telepathically sharing their hungers and the flavors of their food with others around them, impassively inquiring about their victim's favored flavors and meals. The vexenion's unsettling habit of sharing the flavors of a creature it feeds upon with that creature as it digests them is perhaps the qlippoth's most sadistic trait.",
			"",
			"Temples of Yamasoth and other places where his otherworldly and malign presence has infected the world, such as the deeper levels of Hollow Mountain, are no stranger to the predations of the vexenion. Dungeon complexes are well loved by these qlippoth, and despite their prodigious size, their malleable bodies allow them to slither and squirt and force themselves through narrow confines-provided their bodies are not currently engorged upon a still-solid and still-struggling meal.",

When one has consumed sufficient quantities of flesh, it finds a hiding place and goes into a kind of senseless larval state, its eyes and tentacles retreating into itself. The exterior flesh of the thing quickly hardens into a stony shell; in this form, they are difficult to discern from surrounding rocks. After 24 hours, two fully grown vexenion burst forth from the shell, each of which retains the memories of the original. While gestating in this shell, the vexenion stews in a rancid-smelling slurry of amniotic fluid that has strange effects on potions, elixirs, and similar magic items if used as an additional component when creating the magical liquid (merely mixing the fluid with an already created potion or elixir ruins the magic drink). A character can harvest a gestating vexenion's fluids with a successful DC 21 Survival check, after which the fluid must be refined in an alchemical lab over the course of 8 hours with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A single vexenion can supply a single dose of fluid in this manner. Used as an additional resource during potion or elixir creation, the fluid has a 50% chance of causing the resulting potion or elixir to function at a caster level 2 higher than normal, and a 50% chance of instead causing the potion or elixir to function normally but to nauseate the drinker for 1 round after it is imbibed. A single dose of vexenion catalyst, as the prepared fluid is known, is worth 1,000 gp.",

			"Rukhs are foul-tempered creatures related to rocs, except they resemble two-headed vultures instead of raptors. They hunt live prey and carrion, typically gliding high above the desert in search of things to eat. They avoid creatures of their size or larger, preferring easier prey-horses, camels, and humanoids for adult rukhs, or Medium and Small creatures for juveniles. They nest on mountains and in cliffside caves, as they are too large to roost in trees. Few young rukhs reach adulthood, as many tribes and caravans hunt them for meat, often using a lone, weak-looking scout to lure a hungry juvenile into striking distance for an ambush.",
			"",
			"A typical adult rukh stands nearly 35 feet tall and has a wingspan of more than 60 feet. Most are scrawny due to hunger. Coupled with their lightweight bones for easier flying, they rarely top 800 pounds. Juvenile rukhs usually stand about 10 feet tall, with a relatively small wingspan of nearly 18 feet, and weigh about 200 pounds."

These repulsive birds of prey typically glide high above the desert, watching for creatures that might provide a suitable amount of food for them and their young. Horses, camels, and humanoids passing below often attract their attention, though they are careful to avoid creatures of roughly the same size or that most likely would be too powerful for them to best.",

As such, there are seven varieties of rune guardian, each recognizable by its shape-that of the Thassilonian rune representing that specific sin and arcane school. (The Thassilonians did not consider divination a separate school). Unlike golems, rune guardians are intelligent, able to follow complex orders and pursue intruders.

Rust monsters consume metal objects, preferring iron and ferrous alloys like steel but devouring even mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals with equal ease. Any metal touched by the rust monster's delicate antennae or armored hide corrodes and falls to dust within seconds, making the beast a major threat to subterranean adventurers and those dwarven miners who must defend their forges and compete for ore.",
			"",
			"Though rust monsters have no innate tendency toward violence, their insatiable hunger leads them to charge anything they come across that bears even trace amounts of metal, and any resistance is met with unthinking savagery. It's not unheard of for rust monsters in metal-poor areas to track escaped victims for days using their scent metal ability, provided the victims retain intact metal objects. Fortunately, it's often possible to escape a rust monster's attentions by throwing it a dense metal object like a shield and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested with rust monsters quickly learn to keep a few stone or wooden weapons close at hand."

Rust-risen collect such items, which appear to give them some semblance of comfort in their rotting horror of an existence. Rust-risen also seek sources of electrical power, finding them comforting in the same way a warm bath soothes living flesh. If denied access to an electrical power source, rust-risen become sluggish and despondent, but spring to activity as soon as they are exposed to electricity.",

They favor warm climates, preferring to make their lairs in places that are inaccessible to most intruders, such as mountaintop crags, abandoned ruins, subterranean caverns near hidden hot springs, and dense canopies of jungle trees. With wingspans almost three times their height, sabosan are agile and graceful fliers, capable of traveling miles on a single current of air in their dauntless search for prey.",
			"",
			"Although they can see as well as any human in daylight, sabosan hunt at twilight or after dark when their echolocation-based blindsense ability gives them a great advantage. Sabosan can also use their voices offensively, funneling their screeches into blasts of high-pitched sound capable of deafening other creatures. When hunting en masse or attacking foes, a sabosan employs its fell shriek on adversaries while other sabosan use their massive wings to churn up great clouds of dust and debris, rendering foes deaf and blind.",
			"",
			"A sabosan's emaciated frame belies its strength and agility, which are not apparent from its gaunt appearance. Its giant, leathery wings can reach a span of almost 20 feet. Both males and females have red or dark brown fur on their heads, necks, chests, and backs. Sabosan stand just under 6 feet tall and weigh only 150 pounds.",

When a sagari makes its way into a settlement either to wreak havoc or by accident, it can be found hanging from the rafters of a barn or some other structure with a tall ceiling. Stabled livestock are ideal prey for sagaris, who can swiftly kill and devour the flesh of a trapped animal in minutes. A sagari will not attack a creature that it suspects is much stronger, though it will sometimes assault groups of creatures, hoping to sicken enough of its foes to distract them while it attacks the weakest individual.",
			"",
			"Sagaris are thought to have originally come from the vast caverns beneath the world's surface.

Civilization rarely attempts to push far into the deserts, leaving these creatures relatively isolated from other intelligent races. In cases where belligerent settlements threaten the way of life for tribes of saguarois, however, the cactusfolk respond with terrifying violence.",

			"Saguarois live in small nomadic tribes, traveling under the life-giving sun by day and rooting themselves each night in places where they can draw minerals from the pebbly and sandy soil and absorb water. Saguarois produce flowers once a year that go to seed and grow into young saguarois if the adult creatures properly care for them. If planted, a seed must be attended by one or more saguarois over the course of a year before the infant saguaroi sprouts.",
			"",
			"After sprouting, it takes 4 years before the infant saguaroi can uproot itself and move about, and decades more to reach maturity. Some saguarois have lived for hundreds of years, and these old cactusfolk often sprout additional limbs or strange twisting growths stretching out from their cylindrical torsos. Usually these additional limbs and growths are non-functional, but significantly advanced saguarois have been known to learn how to use them as if they were their primary arms and legs."

Among the strongest of sahkils, kimenhuls rarely leave the Ethereal Plane. Aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls are the eldest of all sahkils, and some particularly powerful kimenhuls carve out territory in the Ethereal Plane and rule over legions of other sahkils in much the same manner. Kimenhuls that achieve long-term control are outliers among their kind, however, as the hierarchy among sahkils is more mutable and fluctuating than the rigid order of devils or kytons, or psychopomps' strict adherence to the planar order.",

This may or may not be real, as the terrifying forms stretching out from a kimenhul's body incorporate both images from the viewer's mind and those creatures that have fallen prey to the kimenhul's eternal fear ability. A typical kimenhul stands 25 feet tall and weighs roughly 10,000 pounds.",

These sahkils derive a perverse amount of pleasure from these brief mental interjections, and those that have made their horrific impression on large numbers of beings spend hours of each day engaged in this long-distance abuse.",
			"",
			"This lingering torment often drives a kimenhul's victims insane, or forces them into desperation as they attempt more and more drastic means to rid themselves of the sahkil's influence and predation. Many of these victims end up in the care of others, as their paranoia overtakes any ability to care for themselves and they constantly worry over whether they can actually achieve anything on their own. Doubt and distrust seep into every thought. The victim can't get the denigrating voice out of his head, and self-destruction seems the only thing that can keep it at bay.",
			"",
			"Kimenhuls don't bother with those they consider \"lesser\" minds, unless their intention is to cause havoc or rampant violence. They instead focus on instilling fear in the best and brightest they can find. Kimenhuls appreciate a challenge and even dedicate themselves to breaking down creatures that are immune to fear effects. Kimenhuls delight in tormenting the brave and confident. These cruel outsiders track down great heroes and famed generals - women and men known for courage and righteousness - and infect their otherwise strong minds with the static of constant fear. Kimenhuls share stories of their conquests with each other and any allied sahkils, bragging about the reduction of onceproud warriors to twitchy, frightened children who jump at the slightest noise.",
			"",
			"In combat, kimenhuls combine the use of their spell-like abilities and their physical might. Enemies out of reach fall victim to a host of different effects meant to frighten or weaken, while those nearby are at risk of being trampled or snatched up by one of the kimenhul's fanged mouths.

Having no concern whatsoever for any law, and feeling only contempt for joy and freedom as well as a total disdain for the overarching principles of society, a ximtal uses any insecurities and other weaknesses it perceives in order to slowly erode positive thoughts and actions and keep strong-willed mortals from acting on beliefs that would aid the greater good. They foster the vulgar and abusive voices in all sides of a conflict, subjecting the sensible and sensitive to ill treatment from the loud and malignant. These sinister outsiders instill feelings of dread and hopelessness, and make people feel as if they were alone and unacknowledged even in the presence of their friends and allies.",
			"",
			"Ximtals delight in finding impressionable and aggressive voices to do their work. They know that if they can get someone who thinks she is fighting for a good cause to use terrible tactics in her pursuit of the ideal, they can corrupt that message and seed fear, shame, and dread in what would normally be seen as a constructive endeavor. In this way, ximtals hope to transform the righteous into fanatics.",
			"",
			"More subtly, ximtals sometimes focus their attention on friends and allies of the truly virtuous - their ultimate targets - to indirectly discredit these paragons. In these cases, ximtals encourage associates of a target to misrepresent the target's intended cause. They work their way into the minds and ideologies of people who focus their actions on advertising their ideals and motivations; they gradually corrupt such folk, leading them to treat other voices with barely concealed aggression and contempt and make hasty decisions that run counter to their final goals. Eventually, the ximtals hope, these agents of discord will subvert the paragon's message and mire her in despair and isolation.",
			"",
			"Ximtals tend to remain isolated from others of their kind. They don't often cooperate to target a certain individual or cause unless it holds some fascination specific to individual ximtals or sahkils. Instead, they spread themselves out through the multiverse to focus on divergent ideologies or selective societal crusades. Despite their tendency to be alone, some ximtals work in partnerships with pakalchis, as pakalchis focus on breaking down the bonds of friendship. Working in parallel, these two types of sahkil can destroy not only friendships, but entire families or organizations.",

Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.",

This animal trance effect is entirely visual, so it doesn't have the sonic descriptor or work on blind creatures. As sightless sahuagin are blind, they are immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.

It's not unusual to encounter large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result.",

Sandmen pride themselves as free thinkers, and when given a task by a summoner, often interpret the task as they see fit. Because of their arrogance, usually only the most confident or most desperate mages bother with sandmen. It is not uncommon for sandmen to voluntarily stay on the Material Plane, fiendishly playing with its inhabitants as they wreak silent havoc.",
			"",
			"A sandman takes the form of a rough humanoid about 6 feet tall. Its shape is never quite certain, and its animate muscles constantly shift and flex as it pummels its targets. Sandmen can manipulate their bodies in many ways, but prefer to keep their legs and feet in the form of dusty clouds of sand, so as to easily maneuver about in their preferred environments. Some of these creatures pride themselves on their ability to control their shapes. Just as a mortal artist might sculpt incredible works of art from stone with a chisel, so do these artist sandmen sculpt their own bodies into works of art. Some enjoy using this ability to reshape their appearance to mimic that of their conjurer or their enemies, allowing them an additional level of theatrics by either assuming a beautiful form or by allowing their form to melt away in a hideous manner. Given the combination of their quick imaginations and their natural penchant for cruelty, most sandmen tend to opt for the latter method of tormenting their foes."

This, combined with their unhesitating courage, renders sapphire oozes particularly vulnerable to the hazards of Elysium, as they have no qualms about wandering into any corner of the plane in search of adventure or vulnerable creatures in need of rescue. Of course, in most such cases, the sapphire oozes themselves must be rescued, whether by azatas or by visiting adventurers; wandering azatas are often alert for the bubbling sound of a sapphire ooze's distress calls.",

			"Sapphire oozes that find their way to the Material Plane usually do so by accident. In such cases, the ooze eagerly seeks out novice adventurers or aspiring heroes to share adventures with, using their abilities to protect their allies and inspire them to greatness. They are often quite surprised and confused when they encounter other oozes, which sapphire oozes never expect to be so mindless and such boring conversationalists."
