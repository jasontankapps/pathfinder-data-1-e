Despite its rigid appearance, the rod is surprisingly flexible and can extend in combat - the weapon functions as a +3 keen adamantine halberd that has reach but can still function normally against adjacent foes. As a full-round action up to five times per day, the rod can be used to fire razors. Treat these as +3 keen adamantine arrows fired from a longbow (any feats possessed by the user that function with longbows work with these flechettes).",

Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils.
