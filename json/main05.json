				"An alchemical power component is an alchemical item used as a material component or focus for a spell in order to alter or augment the spell's normal effects. What follows is a sample of these effects; your GM may allow other combinations. Spells followed by an (M) expend the alchemical item as a material component; those followed by an (F) use the item as a focus and do not expend it. In both cases, the alchemical item does not have its normal effect and does not affect any other parameters of the spell. You cannot use the same item as both a focus and a material component at the same time.",

				"**Source:** {source/Alchemy Manual}  ",
				"Alchemical reagents are purified through long processes from their raw states for use in alchemical recipes. They may also be used as an alchemical power component, augmenting the effects of certain spells when used as an additional material component. Using a reagent as an alchemical power component requires a number of doses of the reagent, affects only spells that meet the listed criteria, and augments only an effect the spell already produces (for example, you can use black powder as an alchemical power component only for a spell that deals energy damage). Reagents do not stack with either themselves or one another, and are expended after use.",

				"**Source:*** {source/Potions and Poisons/ pg. 22}  ",
				"Tinctures are alchemical remedies consisting of reagents dissolved in an alcoholic solution. These mixtures produce potent effects beyond those of an ordinary alchemical concoction (see below), but the increased benefits are not without cost. In addition to requiring more expensive components, tinctures tend to cause harmful effects upon being imbibed.",

				"",
				"All concoctions last for 1 hour, even if their benefits are expended before then. Drinking a second concoction before this duration expires causes unpredictable effects as their unstable alchemical compounds mix inside the body. To determine the effects of admixture, roll on the Concoction Miscibility Table. For each additional concoction consumed before the initial duration expires, rolls on the Concoction Miscibility Table take a cumulative -10% penalty. Mixing concoctions outside the body ruins both substances' potency. All concoctions have a Craft DC of 15.",

				"The standard Pathfinder Roleplaying Game campaign takes place in a time period similar to the medieval and early Renaissance age of iron and steel. But even in fantasy campaigns set in this era, some cultures lack steel, and some lack metalworking entirely. Sometimes this deficit is due to geographical remoteness, lack of resources, repression by a strong overlord, or societal taboos. Other campaigns might be set before the medieval era, or in a dark future where apocalypse survivors eke out livings with the best tools they can scavenge. Some might even choose a lower level of technology as a point of pride, for religious reasons, as an assertion of superior martial prowess, or even to honor ancestral warriors by using their bones to make weapons, allowing them to symbolically keep fighting for their tribe or family from beyond the grave.",
				"",
				"Primitive campaigns can be broken into two broad categories based on the level of technology. The first is the Stone Age, where worked metals are all but unknown. The second is the Bronze Age, where metal weapons appear but iron and steel have not been mastered or are rare.",
				"",
				"The following section presents general rules for armor and weapons made of bone, bronze, gold, obsidian, and stone. Most of these materials aren't as strong as steel and refer to the [fragile quality](rule/broken_and_fragile) for weapons and armor.",

				"| [Bronze](/equipment-material/bronze) | Before the advent of iron and steel, bronze ruled the world. |",

				"| [Gold](/equipment-material/gold) | Typically only used for ceremonial weapons and armor and for display, metal equipment made from gold is fragile, heavy, and expensive. |",
				"| [Obsidian](/equipment-material/obsidian) | This black volcanic glass is extremely sharp, and can be shaped into a variety of weapons that deal piercing and slashing damage. |",
				"| [Stone](/equipment-material/stone) | Stone Age weapons almost always utilize stone in some way. |"
