These moments cement the players' commitment to the game by connecting them emotionally to what has just happened, while at the same time hooking them with the promise of future gains. Players revel in the success they've just scored, while also looking forward to the future triumphs their characters will be able to rack up after leveling up, using new gear, or making use of a long-forgotten scrap of lore.",

Some players enjoy constant rewards and actively alter their play styles to maximize the benefits they receive. Others regard them as a bookkeeping necessity they'd rather keep in the background.

As you make decisions affecting reward distribution, seek out the sweet spot of compromise that makes the experience as compulsively entertaining as possible for the majority of your players.",

Older players, especially ones who are squeezed for time and can only meet for short sessions, may prefer to move the rewards process to the background. In this mode, shopping, swapping, and leveling up usually occurs outside of precious session time.",

Any item can be used as the focus of a story. Using a term made famous by Alfred Hitchcock, screenwriters refer to an object that serves as the motivating factor to drive a storyline as a macguffin.[^M] Famous macguffin include the Maltese Falcon, from the book and movie of the same name, and Pulp Fiction's glowing suitcase. Mythological macguffin include the Golden Fleece and Holy Grail.",
			"",
			"Any mission that sends the PCs to find a particular item is a macguffin story, whether a former owner dispatches them to find it or the group finds reference to it in an old tome. Once the group finds the macguffin, it might fade into the background as just another item of treasure, or gradually lead to a more sweeping narrative. Alternatively, you can introduce your big storyline sneakily, by having the item appear as just another piece of dungeon loot. Only after they begin to use it do the adventurers find themselves in a swirl of epic events.",
			"",
			"With or without a macguffin, you can gradually build your magic item storyline until it reaches sweeping proportions. Classic magic item storylines include the following:",
			"",
			"- The object to be destroyed. The item is a work of evil. Disaster looms if it falls into the wrong hands. The PCs must undergo an extensive quest, at the end of which they must destroy the item. Along the way, they must evade pursuers who seek to take it from them. The object grants power if used, but tempts those who employ it to become its slaves.",
			"- The royal symbol. Like King Arthur's Excalibur, the ability to wield this item and awaken its powers indicates that the owner is some kind of chosen one. By taking possession of the item, the group embroils itself in a wider conflict to defend a kingdom, empire, or secret society.",
			"- The weapon of destiny. The item (which need not be a literal weapon) will turn the tide of a great war - if only the heroes can find it and use it correctly. As with the object to be destroyed, enemy pursuers complicate matters, trying to stop the item's arrival at the pivotal battle.",
			"",
			"By making an item central to your storyline, you're granting extra attention to the player whose character wields it. If you make an item usable only by one hero, find reasons for the other characters to also have a stake in the overall objective. You might give the item to a quiet or hard-to-motivate player to draw them into the story, while tying it into existing plot lines for PCs who have already established clear goals. Alternatively, use items that multiple PCs can make use of. Depending on the makeup of your group, a relic could grant one power to a fighter and another to a cleric.",

If an item does a better job of healing than your group's cleric, and it winds up in another PC's hands, the cleric's player might feel eclipsed. Avoid this either by adjusting or removing the trouble item or by making it an item usable only by the class whose abilities it duplicates.",

This approach allows you to maintain an illusion of fictional reality. To avoid player resentment, make sure to contrive in the other direction, too, adding in a compensating plot development or more appropriate item as a replacement for lost treasure.",

			"Outright ownership of land by commoners may be rare in a pseudo-medieval society, but noble patrons often grant property rights. Adventurers typically gain management rights over a section of arable land, which belongs to a noble either as an ancestral claim or a similar feudal grant from a ruler. When it comes to managing and working such land, adventurers may prefer to take a hands-off approach, hiring a bailiff or sheriff to oversee production and taxation. These details may then be left in the background, except when land ownership generates the occasional story hook or perhaps the occasional small profits (nothing rivaling the rewards of adventuring, of course). The PCs may periodically be called on to deal with marauders, repel invading rivals, or quell peasant rebellions."
