Considerably more intelligent than their shambling mound cousins, they claim wide territories - typically swamps, forests, jungles, or other lands thick with plant-life - and brook no insult to their realm. Highly defensive of the life within their lands, especially plants and thinking plant creatures, borutas view themselves as the avengers of those that can't defend themselves, and mercilessly repay destructive invaders with verdurous force.

After draining energy from a foe, a brain mole usually flees rather than staying to fight, and uses its psychic ability to cast expeditious retreat to aid its escape.",

The last 6 months of a brambleblight's life are spent feeding on as much prey as possible in order to store up the energy needed to form seeds. These seeds grow along a specialized tendril that allows the brambleblight to fling its seeds hundreds of feet away in a manner similar to its rain of thorns special attack, though with a much greater range. A brambleblight dies shortly after releasing its seeds.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"While brambleblights prosper in the mutable realm of the First World where they originated, they fare well in only a few environments on the Material Plane. They seem to shun brightly lit places and thrive in dim and dank locations such as deep forests, where the thick canopy shields the forest floor from the sun's rays. They also tend to lair near caves and other underground locations. They are rarely found in open plains or forests with thin canopies because these areas tend to spend long periods exposed to sunlight.",
			"",
			"Brambleblights have no interest in others of their kind, and they must continually maintain their altered environments. They are thus reluctant to move to a new area unless their current location is completely depleted of prey. If a brambleblight uproots itself and moves on to another area, the region it blighted soon returns to its previous state. Likewise, when a brambleblight is killed, its tended patch withers and dies within days, eventually giving way once again to native vegetation.",

It's a move action to remove one thorn (a character can also remove a thorn from an adjacent ally as a move action).",
			"",
			"**Camouflage (Ex)** Since a bramblelash looks like a normal plant when at rest, a successful DC 20 Perception check is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Knowledge (nature) or Survival can be used instead of Perception for this check.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"The bramblelash uses its sharp leaves and thorns to cut animals that stray too close to its patch. Its victims' blood (and the carcasses of those that don't escape) enriches the soil and enables the bramblelash to thrive. The carnivorous plant won't pursue fleeing animals, and its slow speed would make such a course of action fruitless in any case. The bramblelash is content to bleed enemies and then feed off their organic contribution while they escape.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Bramblelashes tend to grow in nutrient-rich, loamy soil that is further enhanced by the plants' attacks. As a result, other plants tend to sprout and thrive around them. The fertile clumps of vegetation attract more animals looking to feed, thus bringing in more targets for the bramblelashes to bleed, establishing a symbiotic relationship between the bramblelashes and the other plants.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, other carnivorous plants grow near bramblelashes to increase their own chance of finding prey. Assassin vines and tendriculoses make for a deadly combination with bramblelashes. Xtabays never grow near bramblelashes, however, as the latter's bleed attacks wake xtabays' victims before they can be consumed.",
			"",
			"A bramblelash has no intelligence and mindlessly attacks anything mobile that enters its reach, even creatures like constructs and undead that can't provide the nutrients the plant wants. The sharp leaves of the plant have rudimentary olfactory organs, small nubs that allow it to \"smell\" creatures within 30 feet. However, its tremorsense is much sharper - it senses any movement within 10 feet and immediately lashes out with its thorny vines. As the plant merely responds to stimuli, it has no fear and never attempts to flee.",
			"",
			"The main stalk of a bramblelash is a sinuous woody trunk, slender but tough. The average stalk measures 2-3 inches wide and several feet long. Mature bramblelashes can grow stalks up to 6 feet long. From the main stalk, up to a dozen thin, flexible vines branch off, each one covered in stiff leaves and small, jagged thorns. These thorns often catch in flesh and tear free of the plant, but the bramblelash quickly regrows missing thorns. A bramblelash's thorns are light brown and hooked at the tip, and its leaves are bright green and waxy. Druids and hunters sometimes collect bramblelash leaves and sew them together to make flexible tunics that blend in with local foliage. A tunic made from bramblelash leaves grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in forests and jungles.",
			"",
			"The bramblelash's thorns contain the creature's seeds. The plant reproduces by attacking animals and lodging its thorns in their hides. When the animals flee, the thorns eventually drop off in new areas and germinate. A newly sprouted bramblelash stays where it grows until its food source dries up (from either a lack of animals traveling through the area or overcrowding in the patch). Once the bramblelash grows hungry enough, it uproots itself and begins traveling slowly through the woods, using its scent ability to follow any traces of fresh blood it encounters.",
			"",
			"If a bramblelash is somehow restrained or sedated, such as by being netted and grappled, a character can safely uproot the plant with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check. Anyone who understands a bramblelash's attack radius can safely avoid being caught in it, and a bramblelash will stay put as long as it's well fed.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Research indicates that bramblelashes are natural plants, not crafted by magic. The plants grow in temperate forests. They can withstand temperatures down to freezing and even survive light snowfalls. The plants do poorly in heat, though, wilting quickly in the summer sun. Bramblelashes can't survive on open plains, even in temperate regions, as the direct sunlight proves too much for them. They thrive in shaded areas beneath larger, overhanging plants.",
			"",
			"Bramblelashes' migrations are guided by instinct, not intelligence. The plants follow the first blood trail they find, regardless of where it leads or what caused the trail. For this reason, bramblelashes sometimes take root on battlefields, by the lairs of dangerous animals, near bandit camps, or even at the scene of a murder. Travelers who can recognize bramblelashes and understand their ecology know to travel carefully in areas where the plants are common, as their presence may signal the activities of larger predators, such as bears and wolves or even owlbears and chimeras.",
			"",
			"### Varieties of Bramblelashes",
			"",
			"Other varieties of bramblelashes exist along with the common temperate variety. Plants similar in appearance to bramblelashes have been spotted in tropical jungles, but these plants are much smaller and have developed a poisonous thorn attack. Some botanists theorize that traders from northern climes sometimes bring bramblelash thorns in their clothes to their southern destinations, and that the bramblelashes there are trying to adapt to their new region. Thus far, the tropical bramblelashes have not spread far beyond Sargava, the Shackles, Mediogalti Island, and coastal cities in the Mwangi Expanse, but they could become common cultivars for those looking to harvest poison.",
			"",
			"Subterranean bramblelashes do exist, but these versions don't have any of the lush greenery that their aboveground cousins do. Instead, these bramblelashes resemble tangles of leafless roots protruding from dirt walls or floors. These underground bramblelashes are easier to spot, but have also developed layers of bark to defend themselves from the predators that hunt in such dark places.",
			"",
			"In areas where magical energy has seeped into the earth - such as in ancient ruins; sacred druidic groves; or spell-tainted wastelands like the Mana Wastes, the Worldwound, and Tanglebriar - bramblelashes can swell to much larger sizes. Magic-fed bramblelashes grow up to 12 feet long and can grab and hold smaller creatures with their vines.",

At the end of the following round, the creature dies if the orchid is still attached.",

Sometimes, breathless orchids live atop other plants, slowly leeching the oxygen they produce.

These plants' brilliant colors serve to lure unsuspecting creatures within striking distance, and also indicate how well the plants have recently fed. Breathless orchids that boast the brightest and most beautiful colors have surely gorged themselves recently on the dying gasps of several creatures."

Any number of brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly.

Yet the evil personified by the bugbear may be the most terrifying, for they actively seek to inflict pain and suffering in the most destructive ways possible. When a hobgoblin kills, it's because of tradition and order. When a goblin kills, it's for fun. But when a bugbear holds its blade, it kills only when it can be assured that the murder will cause maximum pain and suffering to those its weapon does not touch; to a bugbear, the true goal of murder is to strike not at the victim, but at those who held the victim dear."

A typical bloodmage is interested in only spells that cause destruction and pain, plus a few supplemental spells to help her defend herself. Almost no bloodmages learn to create magic items."

Cultists revere gods of battle, particularly demon lords. Their rituals vary wildly, and often involve violent blood sacrifices.

Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Halflings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no halfling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually.",

One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended. Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow - yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely."

Bunyips are quite territorial, and readily attack when intruders threaten their hunting grounds. Bunyips mate annually, during the late spring. During this period, bunyips become even more aggressive. After mating, couples split, with the female wandering off to find a place to birth a small litter of four to six pups. Females watch their pups for a few days, until they become independent enough for the mothers to move on.",

Its upper torso is thick and muscular, with long, fin-like limbs. Some species even have a single, shark-like dorsal fin. The remaining portion of the body extends into a long tail. Those with fur usually only grow a short coat on the upper body in shades of pale gray, brown, or black."

			"",
			"Burstigeits were created by the dwarves generations ago to serve as beasts of burden. Bred to withstand the hardships of the Darklands, these pack animals are an integral part of dwarven culture, especially in communities that rely heavily on trade with surface dwellers.",
			"",
			"Burstigeits are sturdy, quadrupedal mammals with broad shoulders. Like boars, burstigeits have thin tails that hang halfway to the ground; tough, bristly hair on their backs; and tusks jutting from their lower jaws. While vaguely similar to massive boars, their hind legs are longer and thicker than those of their porcine cousins. Burstigeits' hooves are also sharper and stronger than those of a boar, letting them climb nearly as well as mountain goats.",
			"",
			"A typical adult burstigeit stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,600 pounds.",
			"",
			"After the dwarves emerged from the Darklands, they set to work building the Sky Citadels, which served as symbols of their strength and power as well as staging points to conduct trade with and defend against surface dwellers. The increased trade brought the dwarves great wealth, but it also put stress on the supply lines that they had relied upon for generations. Hand carts and pack baskets quickly became insufficient for carrying the large quantities of ore, gems, and fine dwarven crafts demanded by their customers in the world above. Though some creatures in the Darklands could be used as pack animals, few of them were suited for travel aboveground, and transferring shipments from deeper communities onto surface-dwelling beasts cost time and money. Efficiency-minded dwarves began searching for beasts that could be bred to better meet their needs.",
			"",
			"The dwarves living within the Sky Citadels had discovered mountain goats and sheep almost immediately upon emerging from the Darklands. Trade with humans soon also brought them into contact with pigs and cows. They saw the benefit of raising these herd animals and cleared flat areas around their mountain homes where the creatures could be put out to pasture. Dwarves living near the surface learned to harvest valuable resources from these animals, and the cleverest among them realized that these beasts had certain characteristics that could prove useful in transporting goods from the deepest mines all the way to distant surface markets.",
			"",
			"Even so, it wasn't until the rulers of Tar Taargadth established a prize for the person who could breed a pack animal that met such a purpose that dwarven druids and wizards began working on the concept in earnest. This spurred quite a bitter competition, with dozens of failed experiments. The dwarves tried numerous approaches, believing that some kind of surface-dwelling animal must be the right foundation upon which to focus their efforts. Dwarves hold burrowing animals, especially badgers, sacred and avoided experimenting on them. Instead, they looked to animals that were capable of living underground for short periods of time, like wild boars, which sometimes move into small caves or dens to avoid predators, especially when mating.",
			"",
			"Eventually, one family's successes rose above all others, the members' work earning them both the prize money and the prestige that came with it. The beast they created through natural breeding and magical influence was the burstigeit, occasionally referred to as a \"bristled goat.\"",
			"",
			"The use of magic, and perhaps infusions of the strange energies that can influence life in the Darklands, imbued the burstigeit with useful traits, including the ability to carry even greater loads for long periods of time. Burstigeits also developed the ability to tolerate both the extreme heat of forges and deep tunnels and the harsh cold of the high mountains and frozen climes. With these hardy workers to help them, the dwarves could at last carry raw ore from the deepest regions of the Darklands and transport materials and crafted goods all over the world.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Burstigeits are similar to the herd animals from which they were bred. Because they are domesticated, their organization is heavily controlled by their breeders, but they generally follow the social structures common to wild boars. Burstigeit herds are dominated by a single, older female and consist primarily of other females and their young. Adult males are separated from the females, except during breeding season, which is in late fall through early winter (Lamashan through Kuthona).",
			"",
			"Burstigeit young are called piglets - though mostly out of convenience, since they aren't pigs. Unlike their parents, whose fur tends to be a uniform gray-brown, the piglets bear light-and-dark horizontal striping. Piglets reach maturity after about a year, at which point most burstigeits are sold.",
			"",
			"Some underground dwarven settlements do keep normal pigs and goats, but must rely on natural or artificial ventilation to keep the livestock's waste from creating unpleasant and dangerous problems. Fortunately, in the case of burstigeits, dwarven ingenuity overcame this challenge. The dwarves feed the creatures a diet of fungus combined with specially grown algae that reduces the smell and toxicity of their waste.",
			"",
			"Being bred in the Darklands, burstigeits do suffer from sensitivity to bright lights. When they travel on the surface, their dwarven keepers fit them with blinders or special headgear with darkened lenses. This measure keeps them calmer and makes it easier for handlers to manage them, but unfortunately makes it harder for the beasts to see predators or other dangers approaching.",
			"",
			"Burstigeits are slightly more stubborn than a typical donkey, and those prone to stereotyping might say that the burstigeits' personality is a reflection of the dwarves who bred them. However, the creatures are slow to anger and don't startle easily; if something does manage to rile them up, they can be quite dangerous. When disturbed, burstigeits unleash a wailing shriek - halfway between a squeal and a scream - that can be unsettling to those who aren't used to being around them.",
			"",
			"While burstigeits are rarely encountered outside of dwarven settlements, the creatures have existed for thousands of years, and occasionally a beast escapes. If the creature manages to survive long enough, it can go wild, and sometimes small groups of surviving beasts gather together. A herd of feral burstigeits can wreak havoc on a Darklands farming community, devastating fungus crops and causing other damage.",
			"",
			"### Variant Burstigeit",
			"",
			"Burstigeits are mainly used as pack animals, but some breeders have attempted to create versions to use as mounts. A burstigeit's temperament usually dooms such attempts to failure, but there are occasional successes.",
			"",
			"**Burstigeit Warbeast (CR 5):** Warbeasts are advanced burstigeits bred and trained as combat mounts. In addition to its gore attack, a burstigeit warbeast can use its front hooves to make two secondary natural weapon attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage."

A character who displays a Yellow Sign in this manner gains a +5 circumstance bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against a byakhee.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",

			"Byakhees are a race of interstellar aberrations that hail from the distant and alien city of Carcosa, where they serve Hastur. Vaguely humanoid in shape, their bodies combine elements of the forms of carrion birds, insects, and mammals, giving an outward appearance that, while horrific, might at first glance seem possible in the natural world. Yet, those who have studied dead byakhees know this to be a lie, for the creatures' bodies hold bizarre organs and masses of unknown tissue that seem to serve no purpose; the further into a byakhee's body one explores, the stranger its entrails become. The fact that portions of its body appear to be decaying or rotting away even as it lives only adds to the mystery of the creature's peculiar anatomy.",
			"",
			"A byakhee is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars have long argued that byakhees' somewhat humanoid shape suggests a relationship to a less aberrant form of life, and that these creatures may once have even been humans. Indeed, byakhees were created from the original human denizens of the ancient city of Alar. When that city declared war upon its neighbor Carcosa, Alar vanished without a trace on the next rising of its planet's red sun. In truth, the city and its citizens did not disappear - they were absorbed and transformed by Carcosa. Alar's inhabitants became the first byakhees, and ever since, their kind has unwaveringly served the lord of Carcosa, the King in Yellow.",
			"",
			"Although a byakhee longs to consume the blood of the living, it doesn't actually ever suffer the effects of thirst or starvation and can live its entire life without ever tasting a drop of blood. Nonetheless, these creatures still feel something akin to hunger - albeit a sensation driven by a mental impulse other than a biological imperative. Some scholars theorize that this hunger is nothing more than a remnant from the race's past, a sort of ancestral memory of starvation, perhaps, that drives them to drink blood out of a psychological need rather than a physical one. Certainly, byakhees' bloodlust is a powerful driving force; once a byakhee has bitten a foe, it has difficulty thinking of anything other than latching on and drinking its victim dry.",
			"",
			"Byakhees' ability to fly between worlds through the depths of space is shared by several other types of creatures, many of which are tied in similar ways to the Elder Mythos. They are often called upon by spellcasters who use rare or forbidden magic to take advantage of such transport, yet unlike shantaks, who can impart some of their defenses against the depths of space to those they carry through the gulfs between worlds, byakhees can offer no such protection. The creatures delight in carrying ignorant spellcasters into the cold, airless void when foolishly commanded, as they feel no need to warn their would-be passengers of the dangers of interstellar travel.",
			"",
			"A byakhee can live for centuries, although most perish from violence before attaining such an age.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Byakhees serve Hastur, his cult, and the city of Carcosa, driven by an ancient compulsion that is still as much a part of what they are as their claws and wings. The rare byakhees that manage to ignore this urge in order to serve another master - or even more remarkably, to obey no master at all - are particularly hated by other byakhees, and no efforts are spared in the pursuit of such enemies of Carcosa when their existence is exposed.",
			"",
			"Priests of Hastur can conjure byakhees with the proper magic, as can spellcasters who use rare and eldritch spells (such as {spell/contact entity I}, which uses a silver whistle as the material component). Once called to a new world to serve the cult of the King in Yellow, byakhees are quick to establish a colony. Young are hatched from noxious, leathery eggs and grow to maturity over the course of only a few weeks. Yet, once a local byakhee population reaches a few dozen, they lose the drive to procreate entirely. Only in rare cases, such as within the streets of the alien city of Carcosa or on worlds that have fallen fully under Hastur's control, are byakhees encountered in significantly larger numbers.",
			"",
			"Despite their bestial appearance, byakhees are as smart as the typical human and much wiser and charismatic than most. As such, it isn't uncommon for leaders among their kind to grow in power by gaining class levels. Byakhees can excel in most classes, although they tend to avoid taking levels in classes that grant companions, mounts, or familiars' they find the presence of creatures from the natural world unpleasant at best. Most byakhees that take class levels do so as barbarians, clerics of {faith/Hastur}, psychics, or sorcerers with the aberrant or starsoul bloodlines.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"The byakhee has been a staple of Lovecraftian RPGs in large part due to their inclusion in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and it is Sandy Petersen's take on byakhees that largely inspired their Pathfinder incarnation. The creatures first appeared in print in August Derleth's short story, \"The House on Curwen Street.\" They never actually appeared in any of Lovecraft's writings, although Chaosium has taken the description of the nameless creatures from Lovecraft's short story \"The Festival\" as the basis for the monster's strange appearance."

These monsters go by many names among the hags who \"birth\" them, but among civilized races they are known by just one word: caliban.",

Thus calibans learn from an early age to trust only their mothers and to revile anyone else. Those calibans who for whatever reason find themselves apart from their hag mothers are the most likely to shed their evil ways and forge a path of their own, but such individuals are few and far between.",

Camulatz delight in using both their magical ventriloquism and their beautiful plumage to mislead and separate victims before surprising them with diving attacks from above.",

The vivid patterns of a camulatz's feathers also provide some protection to the birds, forming a magical field of clashing colors that can deflect ranged attacks.",

			"A mature camulatz is just over 14 feet in length from its beak to the ends of its tail feathers, but weighs only 300 pounds because of its lightweight bone structure. Each individual camulatz bears its own unique feather coloration, which it can consciously manipulate in set patterns to produce its hypnotic display."

If the vine tendril is severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new grapple is established.",

If one of these vines is destroyed, the canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to bring it to bear in combat.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semi-sentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.",
			"",
			"The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.",
			"",
			"Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper.",
			"",
			"While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.",
			"",
			"A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures - such as small monkeys - can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size.",
			"",
			"Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouflage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape.",
			"",
			"A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures."

Most carrionstorms understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and superstitious communities."

With their advanced psychic powers and combat abilities, these elite individuals range farthest from the hive in their search for esoteric knowledge, or directly guard and care for their hive's chrestomath. Yet while this might seem like a case of the most important jobs going to the most powerful individuals, the truth is in fact the opposite: subsisting on the best psychic energy or remaining in closest proximity to the intense volume of thoughts that constantly passes through a chrestomath empowers individual caulborn, allowing them to grow into full thoughtkeeper status. Physically, thoughtkeepers resemble other caulborn - they bear no special markings or badges of office, and in fact are treated no differently by their peers outside of their utilization, as within the hive mind they're simply seen as stronger appendages of the same greater being.",

			"The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races.

			"",
			"Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder - and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive's massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they've stolen from others. Indeed, it's possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race's mysterious origins.",
			"",
			"A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk. These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as mage hand to affect their surroundings.",
			"",
			"Every caulborn colony has at least one chrestomath, but these creatures are made, not born. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn select several of their own members via criteria unique to each colony. These chosen individuals are promptly disassembled and rendered down in a solemn ritual, their living organs melded together into a single blob of curdled flesh. The resulting protoplasmic sack has no outside sensory organs or useful manipulating appendages, only a massive intelligence whose psychic abilities increase even as the world around it loses relevance, the isolation honing its intellect.",
			"",
			"Once the brain sack is complete, the caulborn seed it with every fact and record at the colony's disposal, usually copying knowledge over from other chrestomaths. Though their psychic abilities give chrestomaths the ability to float sluggishly through the air, most caulborn consider this a waste of the organic thinking machines' time, and instead assign teams of humanoid caulborn to carry the living data centers around in palanquins or set them up in vast chapels.",
			"",
			"Chrestomaths are completely dependent on their kin for survival. Just as normal caulborn consume the psychic energy of other races through stolen ideas and concepts, chrestomaths are unable to feed directly from the source creatures, instead requiring their less intelligent brethren to regurgitate the predigested knowledge for them, sometimes also injecting them with additional nutrients and magical concoctions.",
			"",
			"While any caulborn within range may access a chrestomath's memory, this information can be devastating to other creatures. In addition to its normal telepathy and mind-reading, a chrestomath confronted with dangerous creatures can establish a psychic link through which it pushes huge amounts of information. The recipients of this attack find their brains overloaded by the tidal wave of knowledge, rendering them catatonic or violently insane.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"While most chrestomaths have very little personality, any traces of identity being consumed by oceans of information, some eventually grow to control the data stored inside them and reestablish some semblance of self. One of the best such examples is Anamnesis, the One That Watches. As the heart of Xavorax, the city of caulborn and vampires deep below Kaer Maga, Anamnesis may well be one of the most learned entities on the face of Golarion, its thoughts and motives far beyond human comprehension. To outsiders, the thousands of pounds of flesh might seem barely sentient, capable only of shifting its colors to reflect emotions. Yet whether it's slave or master - or perhaps both - the lord of the Quivering Palace influences all the residents of Xavorax, watching over them as the central relay of their hive mind and the repository of all their race holds dear.",
			"",
			"While parasitic by nature, caulborn are not necessarily predatory, and aren't above trading for the sustenance they need. When they do so, it's often as prophets, a role in which chrestomaths are singularly important. Left with nothing but godlike memories and an ability to analyze information, chrestomaths are often able to extrapolate from trends and make logical connections that result in uncannily accurate predictions about future events."

			"",
			"**Warping Field (Su)** A cauldron bloom draws prey close with invisible arcane strands, which it projects in one of two forms: diffuse or targeted. Projecting diffuse strands is a swift action, and forces each creature within 120 feet of the cauldron bloom to attempt a DC 23 Reflex save. A creature that fails the save is teleported 60 feet toward the cauldron bloom; if this would bring a creature or object within 30 feet of the cauldron bloom, it is instead teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Projecting targeted strands is a standard action and forces one creature within 360 feet to attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it is teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Targets must be at least one size category smaller than the cauldron bloom, and this ability attempts to teleport the closest creature first.

			"Cauldron blooms are immense, slow-moving subterranean plants that maintain their arcane metabolisms by consuming massive quantities of blood. They dwell in cold environs, typically along the migration routes of herd animals, and slowly teleport to new locations in search of food. Feeding cauldron blooms generally erupt from the ground in the midst of such herds. The animals' panicked cries are cut short when the terrified individuals wink out of existence, reappearing a moment later inside the cauldron bloom's otherworldly guts. Arcane winds within the cauldron bloom's stomach rapidly draw the blood from ingested prey, shred their bodies, and leave nothing behind. A particularly hungry cauldron bloom can systematically consume entire herds of animals, or sequester one individual - such as an unlucky giant or megafauna - inside its stomach. The prey's blood fuels the plant's magical physiology, casting flickering arcane light as it distributes throughout the cauldron bloom's body.",
			"",
			"Typically, cauldron blooms live for hundreds of years. Their bodies are around 15 feet in diameter and weigh upward of 80 tons.",
			"",
			"Cauldron blooms do not feed in a traditional sense. Instead, they wrap potential prey in invisible threads of magical energy. Snared creatures are teleported directly into the blooms' stomachs, where interior winds swirl in a roaring arcane centrifuge that forcibly extracts prey's blood and quickly renders any mundane organic material to a fine powder. Equipment and magical oddities are left behind, however, meaning clouds of manufactured shrapnel circulate within most older cauldron blooms.",
			"",
			"Cauldron blooms most often dwell in cold regions. A consistent diet of blood is necessary for them to maintain a healthy and elevated internal temperature. They use their innate teleportation abilities to jump between subterranean points in pursuit of herding prey. Cauldron blooms give little sign of their presence while beneath the ground, and their senses are highly attuned to surface vibrations.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Curiously, despite their warm-blooded nature and massive size, cauldron blooms don't exude heat. This allows them to go largely undetected between feedings. Their petals are also dexterous and quiet enough that their slow burrowing doesn't alert surface-dwellers. Intelligent, meticulous planners, most of these giant plants use their stealth to actively cultivate herds of prey animals. Cauldron blooms may divert water, manage predator populations, and engage in similar protective activities to ensure a long-term food supply.",
			"",
			"The plants' unique method of locomotion means their habitats are pocked with incongruous subsurface materials. A marsh, for instance, may have a stand-alone deposit of dense stone, and a few settlements are even founded on such locations. A dead cauldron bloom, however, may be a hazard to the local environment, as its decay slowly turns the area into a giant sinkhole; a hole above a particularly ancient cauldron bloom eventually reveals a treasure trove of collected objects within the dead creature's gut.",
			"",
			"Their heightened intellects mean that cauldron blooms are generally quite knowledgeable about local terrain, fauna, and even historical events, though such information is presented through the unique filter of a subterranean carnivorous plant. One historical record even describes a cauldron bloom with heightened telekinetic abilities working alongside smaller beings to build and protect an entire city; the report's veracity is the subject of ongoing and lively academic debate."

A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by making a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament is AC 14 (touch 12), has 5 hit points, and has DR 15/slashing. An application of liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal solvent) dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament.

			"The cave fisher is a highly specialized predator that dwells in caves. The creature's mode of hunting is unique - it clambers up a cave wall to settle on a ledge or in a crack, typically at a height of at least 30 feet. Ledges overlooking bridges and lower ledges overlooking chasms are favored hunting grounds for the cave fisher. The creature lies in wait until prey approaches within 60 feet, at which point it extrudes a thin cord of silk at blinding speed, lashing at the target as with a whip. The filament is incredibly sticky, and once the fisher strikes food with it, it reels in its meal to feed, trusting its position on a higher ledge to prevent any allies the meal may have from molesting it as it eats. Collections of bones and lengths of discarded filaments are sure signs of cave fisher habitation.",
			"",
			"A cave fisher produces its filament from glands in its body; when it reels in a victim, it generally eats the filament along with its meal. It's impossible to harvest new filaments from a dead cave fisher, but filaments harvested from living ones are incredibly light and strong, functioning as silk rope once the sticky adhesive on a length decomposes (which generally takes 3d6 minutes). A cave fisher's filament glands are useful in constructing sovereign glue and similar sticky magical items. A single cave fisher's glands count as 100 gp worth of raw materials, offsetting the total cost of the item's final creation.",
			"",
			"Although cave fishers have many superficial similarities to crabs, they do not fare well in water and aren't very good swimmers. Nevertheless, many cave fishers lair upon ledges overlooking swift-flowing subterranean rivers, giving them a relatively steady stream of food, especially in cases where such rivers are used as trade routes. Those who ply these rivers frequently travel with a few spare slaves or some unwanted livestock, and when they approach a known cave fisher haunt, they send down the unfortunate animal or slave on a raft to distract the monster's hunger.",

			"A cave fisher is 7 feet long and weighs 400 pounds."
