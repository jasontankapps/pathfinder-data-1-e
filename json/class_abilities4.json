					"The first time a summoner calls his {sidekick/unchained_<eidolon}, he must decide on its subtype. The eidolon's subtype determines a number of its base statistics and abilities, as well as its overall look and theme. The subtype also determines what sort of {ability/unchained_<evolutions} the summoner can select for his eidolon using the evolution pool. Once the choice of subtype is made, it cannot be changed.",

					"**Name:** This is the name of the eidolon's subtype. The eidolon gains this as a subtype, but unless otherwise noted, it does not gain any of the features, abilities, or weaknesses of that subtype.",
					"",
					"**Description:** This gives a basic overview of eidolons of this subtype, including general guidelines on appearance and personality.",
					"",
					"**Alignment:** The eidolon is a creature of this alignment. If its alignment is chaotic, evil, lawful, or good, it gains that subtype.",
					"",
					"**Base Form:** Eidolons of some subtypes are restricted in their choice of base form. Restrictions are spelled out here. The evolutions listed here are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's evolution pool.",
					"",
					"**Base Evolutions:** This describes the base evolutions possessed by all eidolons of this subtype. Following the entry is a list of evolutions gained as the summoner gains levels; these evolutions are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's evolution pool. In some cases, eidolons of certain subtypes will gain abilities that are not evolutions. Unless otherwise noted, such abilities function as described in the [Universal Monster Rules](main/umr).",

					"",
					"Generally, the summoner controls the actions of his eidolon, even during combat, either through verbal commands or through the link ability, but this does not mean that the eidolon is a puppet that follows every command without question. Eidolons have been known to refuse actions that are against their ethoses or alignments (subject to the GM's discretion) and are quick to chide the summoner about such requests. In addition, should the action of the summoner cause a shift in alignment such that the summoner's alignment is more than one step away from the eidolon's, the eidolon refuses the call of the summoner (although the summoner can still use his summon monster class feature). If the summoner manages to restore his alignment, the eidolon returns to his service."

			"## Medium Spirits",

			"A medium's spirits are entities from the Astral Plane - the clinging echoes of heroes and villains from the distant past, sustained throughout time by myths and legends. The number of spirits is countless, and each has its own idiosyncrasies that make it distinct. Nonetheless, all spirits arise from one of the following six legends: {spirit/archmage}, {spirit/champion}, {spirit/guardian}, {spirit/hierophant}, {spirit/marshal}, or {spirit/trickster}.",
			"",
			"### Legendary Spirits",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Occult Realms}  ",
			"The spirits a medium can channel draw their power both from the tales told about them and from their own souls, which echo with the remarkable deeds they performed in life. All spirits have stories - and some arise from people whose deeds shook the world and whose testaments have endured throughout the ages. These beings are legendary spirits, and they possess great power they can share with mediums who gain their favor.",
			"",
			"Attaining the ability to channel a legendary spirit involves traveling to a certain location or performing a certain deed, swearing an oath, performing a ritual, and succeeding at an ability check. The type of check depends on the spirit, but the DC is always equal to 10 + 1/2 the medium's level. If the medium breaks the oath, the spirit will no longer answer when he calls. If the medium attempts to call another spirit of the legendary spirit's legend, the legendary spirit similarly departs forever.",
