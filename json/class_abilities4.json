			"## Subtypes",
			"",
			"The first time a summoner calls his {sidekick/unchained_<eidolon}, he must decide on its subtype. The eidolon's subtype determines a number of its base statistics and abilities, as well as its overall look and theme. The subtype also determines what sort of {ability/evolutions} the summoner can select for his eidolon using the evolution pool. Once the choice of subtype is made, it cannot be changed.",
			"",
			"As a summoner gains levels, his eidolon gains specific evolutions based on its subtype. Each subtype entry below includes the following information.",
			"",
			"**Name:** This is the name of the eidolon's subtype. The eidolon gains this as a subtype, but unless otherwise noted, it does not gain any of the features, abilities, or weaknesses of that subtype.",
			"",
			"**Description:** This gives a basic overview of eidolons of this subtype, including general guidelines on appearance and personality.",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** The eidolon is a creature of this alignment. If its alignment is chaotic, evil, lawful, or good, it gains that subtype.",
			"",
			"**Base Form:** Eidolons of some subtypes are restricted in their choice of base form. Restrictions are spelled out here. The evolutions listed here are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's evolution pool.",

			"**Base Evolutions:** This describes the base evolutions possessed by all eidolons of this subtype. Following the entry is a list of evolutions gained as the summoner gains levels; these evolutions are gained automatically, and do not cost points from the eidolon's evolution pool. In some cases, eidolons of certain subtypes will gain abilities that are not evolutions. Unless otherwise noted, such abilities function as described in the [Universal Monster Rules](main/umr).",

			"#### Eidolons and Alignment",
			"",
			"Generally, the summoner controls the actions of his eidolon, even during combat, either through verbal commands or through the link ability, but this does not mean that the eidolon is a puppet that follows every command without question. Eidolons have been known to refuse actions that are against their ethoses or alignments (subject to the GM's discretion) and are quick to chide the summoner about such requests. In addition, should the action of the summoner cause a shift in alignment such that the summoner's alignment is more than one step away from the eidolon's, the eidolon refuses the call of the summoner (although the summoner can still use his summon monster class feature). If the summoner manages to restore his alignment, the eidolon returns to his service.",

While most summoners call upon outsiders from the Great Beyond, some discover the secret to summoning alien entities from strange corners of the Material Plane. These summoned minions are known as aberrant eidolons. Aberrant eidolons share many abilities and physical features with the nonoutsider aberrations that dwell in forgotten or nameless reaches of reality, but these malformed entities are still outsiders like any other eidolon for the purposes of determining which spells affect them.[^A]",

A target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 14 + the eidolon's Charisma modifier). For each target that fails its save, the eidolon can affect one other creature within 30 feet as good hope. The caster level equals the eidolon's Hit Dice, and the save DC is equal to 10 + half the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Charisma modifier.

These bonuses last until the end of the monk's next turn (or his current turn if he uses this ability on his own turn).

A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Blocker (Su)** ([^D]) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a free action before making an unarmed strike against a foe.

If the monk successfully damages the target of his attack, that opponent's cost to activate abilities with ki increases by 1 ki point for 1 hour. If the monk spends 2 points from his ki pool, he can use this ability to affect the target's arcane pool, arcane reservoir, grit points, inspiration, or panache points instead of its ki pool.

The monk rolls one saving throw for each designated ally, using his bonus instead of the ally's. For each successful saving throw, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had succeeded at the saving throw, and for each saving throw failed, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had failed the saving throw. If the monk fails any of the saving throws (including his own original saving throw), the monk treats the effect as if he had failed the saving throw. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",

			"**Ki Meditation (Su)** ([^F]) A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points to meditate as a full-round action, as if using Combat Meditation. Alternatively, he can spend 4 ki points to meditate as a move action instead.

The monk must have the {feat/Combat Meditation} feat before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Metabolism (Su)** ([^D]) A monk with this ability uses his ki to control his metabolism. As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, the monk needs to eat and drink only 1/4 as often as normal, needs only 2 hours of sleep each night (including to replenish his ki pool), and can hold his breath for up to 1 hour per point of Constitution. As a move action, he can spend 1 ki point to enter a state of suspended animation, falling unconscious and appearing dead to all senses. At the time he enters this state, he indicates a preset period of time or a triggering condition, after which he awakens.",
			"",
			"**Ki Mount (Su)** ([^D]) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a standard action to grant 2 temporary hit points per monk level he possesses to his mount for 1 hour per monk level.

A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Range (Su)** ([^D]) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to increase the range increment of any thrown monk weapon by 20 feet. Apply this benefit before doubling the range increment with the {feat/Far Shot} feat.",

			"",
			">**Bare-Hand Block (Ex)** ([^B]) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as an immediate action when attacked with a manufactured weapon to attempt an unarmed sunder combat maneuver check against it. If he successfully sunders the weapon and grants it the broken condition, the attack deals no damage. He can spend an additional 1 ki point when using this ability to activate ki sunder as a free action. A monk must be at least 8th level and have the ki sunder ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Visions (Su)** ([^D]) A monk with this ability often sees visions of spirits or hears the voice of his departed mentor in his dreams. On any given night during which the monk dreams, he can use this ability to gain the benefits of a {spell/divination}. If he does, he spends 2 ki points from the next day's total. A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this ki power.",

			"**One Touch (Ex)** ([^G]) As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, as a standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against a foe as a touch attack.

			"",
			"**Quivering Palm (Su)** ([^G]) A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 ki points, and the monk must announce his intent to use this ability (and spend the ki points) before making the attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any time within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action); unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it can still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than one quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous one is negated. A monk must be at least 16th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Racing Current (Su)** ([^E]) A monk with this ki power can create a wave to help him maneuver allies upon the battlefield, as if using the spell {spell/slipstream}.

			"",
			"**Slow Fall (Su)** ([^G]) A monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent by expending 1 point from his ki pool. When he uses this ability, he takes no damage from the fall (as if using {spell/feather fall}), but he must be adjacent to a wall for the length of the fall (although this can be used to reduce the damage from a fall if only part of it is adjacent to a wall).",
			"",
			"**Sudden Speed (Su)** ([^G]) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself a sudden burst of speed. This increases the monk's base land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute.",
			"",
			">**Branch Runner (Ex, Su)** ([^C]) A monk with this ability adds half the base speed bonus from his fast movement ability to his racial climb speed. In addition, when he uses the sudden speed ki power, he adds the base speed bonus from that ki power to his racial climb speed for 1 round. The monk must have the sudden speed ki power before selecting branch runner.",
			">",
			">**Ki Hurricane (Ex)** ([^D]) As a full-round action, a monk with this ability can move up to twice his speed. At any point in that movement, the monk can spend 1 ki point to make the first attack in his flurry of blows. He can later spend another ki point to make the next attack in his flurry of blows, and so on, until he either stops spending ki points or has exhausted all the attacks from his flurry of blows. A monk must be at least 10th level and possess the sudden speed ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Water Sprint (Su)** ([^G]) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to gain the ability to walk on water, as if under the effects of {spell/water walk}.

			"",
			"{SOURCE Occult Origins/16;Occult Adventures/63}  ",
			"At 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a psychic can choose one of the following major amplifications in place of a phrenic amplification.",
			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Deflection Field (Su):** Whenever the psychic casts a linked spell that grants her a deflection bonus to AC, she can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to automatically reflect the first ranged attack that misses her (as long as the linked spell remains active) back at the attacker. This reflected attack uses the original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychic's caster level.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Pulse (Su):** The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted {spell/dispel magic} spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.",
			"",
			"**Dual Amplification (Ex):** When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.",
			"",
			"**Mimic Metamagic (Ex):** When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.",
			"",
			"**Space-rending Spell (Su):** The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as {spell/dimension door}). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Subordinate Spell (Ex):** The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own {rule/concentration} check.",
			"",
			"**Synaptic Shock (Su):** The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Targeting (Su):** By spending 2 points from her phrenic pool, the psychic can target any creature with which she is in telepathic communication (whether via her *telepathic bond* ability, a creature's telepathy ability, or another effect) with the linked spell, even if the creature would normally be out of range. The linked spell must have the mind-affecting descriptor and must have a range of touch or greater.",
			"",
			"**Turning Shield (Su):** The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of {spell/spell turning} for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell."

			"Swashbucklers spend panache points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the swashbuckler a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longerlasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, but do not require expending panache to be maintained. A swashbuckler can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the swashbuckler has or spends the required number of panache points to perform the deed.",
			"",
			"::h3[1st-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Derring-Do (Ex):** At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her Dexterity modifier (minimum 1).",
			"",
			"**Dodging Panache (Ex):** At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a dodge bonus to AC equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no armor, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.",
			"",
			"**Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex):** At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an attack of opportunity to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an attack roll as if she were making an attack of opportunity; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a -2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature's result, the creature's attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature's attack is announced, but before its attack roll is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an immediate action make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.",
			"",
			"::h3[3rd-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Kip-Up (Ex):** At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can kip-up from prone as a move action without provoking an attack of opportunity. She can kip-up as a swift action instead by spending 1 panache point.",
			"",
			"**Menacing Swordplay (Ex):** At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, when a swashbuckler hits an opponent with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can choose to use Intimidate to demoralize that opponent as a swift action instead of a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Precise Strike (Ex):** At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not natural weapon attacks), adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her off hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to sneak attacks is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.",
			"",
			"As a swift action, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike's damage bonus on the next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost. This deed's cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the {feat/Signature Deed} feat).",
			"",
			"**Swashbuckler Initiative (Ex):** At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, if she has the {feat/Quick Draw} feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and she has any single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that isn't hidden, she can draw that weapon as part of the initiative check.",
			"",
			"::h3[7th-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Superior Feint (Ex):** At 7th level, a swashbuckler with at least 1 panache point can, as a standard action, purposefully miss a creature she could make a melee attack against with a wielded light or one-handed piercing weapon. When she does, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC until the start of the swashbuckler's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Swashbuckler's Grace (Ex):** At 7th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she takes no penalty for moving at full speed when she uses Acrobatics to attempt to move through a threatened area or an enemy's space.",
			"",
			"**Targeted Strike (Ex):** At 7th level, as a full-round action the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to make an attack with a single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that cripples part of a foe's body. The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack's normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn't have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to targeted strikes. Items or abilities that protect a creature from critical hits also protect a creature from targeted strikes.",
			"",
			"- Arms: The target takes no damage from the attack, but it drops one carried item of the swashbuckler's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet cannot be chosen.",
			"- Head: The target is confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Legs: The target is knocked prone. Creatures with four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.",
			"- Torso or Wings: The target is staggered for 1 round.",
			"",
			"::h3[11th-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Wound (Ex):** At 11th level, when the swashbuckler hits a living creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon attack, as a free action she can spend 1 panache point to have that attack deal additional bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage dealt is equal to the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier (minimum 1). Alternatively, the swashbuckler can spend 2 panache points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage instead (swashbuckler's choice). Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",
			"",
			"**Evasive (Ex):** At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains the benefits of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her swashbuckler level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.",
			"",
			"**Subtle Blade (Ex):** At 11th level, while a swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she is immune to disarm, steal, and sunder combat maneuvers made against a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon she is wielding.",
			"",
			"::h3[15th-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Dizzying Defense (Ex):** At 15th level, while wielding a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon in one hand, the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to take the fighting defensively action as a swift action instead of a standard action. When fighting defensively in this manner, the dodge bonus to AC gained from that action increases to +4, and the penalty to attack rolls is reduced to -2.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Thrust (Ex):** At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can as a full-round action make a perfect thrust, pooling all of her attack potential into a single melee attack made with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon. When she does, she makes the attack against the target's touch AC, and ignores all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Swashbuckler's Edge (Ex):** At 15th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can take 10 on any Acrobatics, Climb, Escape Artist, Fly, Ride, or Swim check, even while distracted or in immediate danger. She can use this ability in conjunction with the derring-do deed.",
			"",
			"::h3[19th-Level Deeds]{jl}",
			"",
			"**Cheat Death (Ex):** At 19th level, whenever the swashbuckler is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, she can spend all of her remaining panache to instead be reduced to 1 hit point. She must have at least 1 panache point to spend. Effects that kill the swashbuckler outright without dealing hit point damage are not affected by this ability.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Stab (Ex):** At 19th level, when the swashbuckler confirms a critical hit with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, in addition to the normal damage, she can spend 1 panache point to inflict a deadly stab. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or die. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the swashbuckler's level + the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not grant the swashbuckler a panache point.",
			"",
			"**Stunning Stab (Ex):** At 19th level, when a swashbuckler hits a creature with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can spend 2 panache points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the swashbuckler's level + the swashbuckler's Dexterity modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect."

This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.",

			"**Vengeful Heart (Ex):** Some swashbucklers are driven by vengeance above all else. At 1st level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's resolve class feature, treating her swashbuckler level as her samurai level. Whenever the swashbuckler spends a use of resolve, she must also spend a point of panache or a use of charmed life, or the use of resolve has no effect. This deed replaces the derring-do deed and one other 1st-level deed.",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Hilt Hammer (Ex):** Precise strikes with a slender blade do little to hinder amorphous or incorporeal creatures; when encountering such threats, some swashbucklers abandon precision in favor of brutish strikes. At 3rd level, the swashbuckler can activate this deed before rolling the attack roll when making an attack that would benefit from precise strike. An attack altered this way deals only half the normal damage from precise strike, but this damage is not treated as precision damage. This deed alters (but does not replace) the precise strike deed and replaces one other 3rd-level deed.",

			"### 7th-Level Renowned Deed",

			"**Dodging Dance (Ex):** The swashbuckler moves around her opponents' attacks to open them up for strikes. At 7th level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to move up to half her speed as a move action. If a creature makes an attack of opportunity against her due to this movement, she can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the attacking creature's CMD. If she succeeds, the attack of opportunity misses, and the swashbuckler can make an attack of opportunity against the attacking creature instead. She can attempt to evade multiple attacks of opportunity during this movement, but the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 2 for each additional opponent that makes an attack of opportunity against her during this movement. If the swashbuckler has an ability that grants her additional attacks of opportunity, she can use them to respond to multiple missed attacks of opportunity with her own attacks. This deed replaces the swashbuckler's grace deed and one other 7th-level deed.",

			"**Vengeful Soul (Ex):** Sometimes vengeance can take years or even decades, forcing the aggrieved swashbuckler to push the limits of her endurance. At 11th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's greater resolve class feature. At 19th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's true resolve class feature. The swashbuckler must have the vengeful heart renowned deed to select this deed. This deed replaces the subtle blade and cheat death deeds, plus an additional 11th-level deed."

A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it&mdash;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks.
