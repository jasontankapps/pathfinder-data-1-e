The berserkers also gather lichens from the center of the island-not for nourishment, but because these can provide euphoric visions or fuel the berserkers' battle rage.

This is usually fatal unless she's able to stave off the condition with extremely stimulating circumstances.",

A bleachling recovers almost entirely from the Bleaching's wasting effects and gains an intuitive connection to nature. In addition, having thwarted death once, the bleachling does not visibly age until death claims her several centuries later. Bleachlings rarely exhibit the same excitability and curiosity that marks other gnomes, though some retain a singular obsession from earlier in life. Most gnomes find bleachlings extremely unsettling-living reminders of the undesirable fate that awaits if they're idle.",

These bleachlings serve as mystics, and ban all creatures but themselves from entering the mysterious Shay Citadels, as the citadels unpredictably phase out of existence, leaving all non-bleachlings behind at unknown destinations when they phase back into the Material Plane."

Their militaristic overlords offered little to the freedom-loving forest-dwellers of Nirmathas that Imperial Cheliax hadn't, and so, led by a skilled half-elven ranger named Irgal Nirmath, the people of the Fangwood rebelled against their Molthuni oppressors. After 7 hard-fought years at war and a number of victorious skirmishes, Nirmathas at last prevailed and earned its freedom.",
			"",
			"Now, nearly 60 years later, the war for Nirmathi independence is over, but violent conflict between the nations of Molthune and Nirmathas continues. In the dense woods of the southern Fangwood, a region known as the Chernasardo, Molthuni armies constantly seek to regain territory lost in the prior war and in skirmishes since its official end, marching garrisons of troops into various parts of the Fangwood on a nearly daily basis. But the highly regimented, heavily armored soldiers of Molthune are not well equipped for maneuvers in the deep forest, and the people of the Chernasardo use this to their advantage.",
			"",
			"The woodsmen of Nirmathas continue the hit-and-run tactics that worked so well for their fledgling nation's namesake. Generally working in teams of six or fewer, these elite snipers, trappers, and scouts are both stealthy and prudent enough to ambush large contingents of Molthuni soldiers and escape without ever being spotted. Each sniper is usually equipped with a number of specialty arrows designed for use in specific situations. This makes the snipers both unpredictable and deadly, a combination that never ceases to frustrate the commanders of Molthune's army as they attempt to bring the people of Nirmathas - whom they still see as rebellious citizens of Molthune rather than foreign nationals - to heel."

			"On the isle of Flintyreach amid the Ironbound Archipelago of the Steaming Sea, half-orcs from across Avistan have built a community to call their own: Averaka. Though the inhabitants of Averaka have set aside the most self-destructive behaviors of their orc ancestors, they remain fierce and deadly warriors. Amid the mountains in the island's interior, however, lurk a great threat to this community: hill giants, ettins, and trolls, both in independent clans and under the sway of the hill giant war chief Gorgnak. Thus the half-orcs who call Averaka home have dedicated themselves to the eradication of their violent, monstrous neighbors. Some believe such channeling and focusing of their aggression represents the human side of the half-orcs winning out over the bloodthirsty instincts of their orc blood, though a few worry about where that aggression might be pointed next if they manage to defeat their giant enemies.",
			"",
			"While as proud as any Ulfen of the Linnorm Kings, the half-orcs of Averaka welcome anyone who shares their hate of giants and acknowledges their right to self-rule. A handful of dwarves and humans call Averaka home as well, but most inhabitants not of orc descent find the town's chaotic mix of customs unsettling.",
			"",
			"One of the easiest ways to arouse the ire of an Averaka giant slayer is by associating or consorting with giants and their kin. No allowance is given for supposedly friendly or tame giants, even benevolent cloud and storm giants. Beyond this, voicing any doubt about the wisdom of a half-orc community will also result in a tongue-lashing and often a harsh beating from any resident of Averaka who overhears.",
			"",
			"Would-be giant slayers from across Golarion make pilgrimages to Averaka to learn from the dedicated half-orcs there, though such tutelage generally lasts only a few months at the most unless the pupil decides to settle in Averaka and take up the residents' cause."

Flowery words and flattery are tiresome to her, and her closest friends are those who speak to her openly and honestly, as she would to them. She enjoys the company of druids and rangers, appreciating their respect for animals and feeling only slight envy because of her inability to control the magic they wield.",

She is disgusted by the idea of butchering horses for meat, would rather starve than eat a horse, and won't permit any in her company to do so. When a warhorse dies, she buries its heart and head with honor and burns the rest, unwilling to let a noble companion be eaten by scavengers. Seeing someone mistreat a horse drives her into a frenzy, and she has been known to tackle and beat a peasant or merchant she spots whipping a horse to get it to work. (She is wise enough to not do this to an officer or noble, but if by some inaction on her part that person dies in combat, so much the better.) She especially dislikes goblins for their cruelty toward horses, and enjoys skewering them on her lance, leaving the corpses on her lance for follow-up attacks to better intimidate their allies.",

All of these agents are people she believes she can trust not to violate any laws in the pursuit of information, for one slip-up can invalidate her entire case and-worst of all-embarrass her professionally. An agent who shows a lack of discretion or discipline in this matter is cut off and disavowed; depending on the infraction, she might bring her litigious powers to bear against that person, in which case it is usually best for the target to flee the city, change his or her name, and attempt a new life somewhere else."

While many removed their masks and now do all they can to pursue a normal life, the most fanatical and psychologically scarred spread throughout Varisia, into some parts of Cheliax, and to more distant lands. Without a leader but knowing little else beyond service and violence, these remaining Gray Maidens seek new names and purposes in a world they no longer feel connected to. In Korvosa itself, Sabina Merrin (LN female human fighter 14) - the order's founder and Queen Ileosa's former consort - works to right the wrongs committed by the Gray Maidens, though many in the city are still understandably wary of her intentions. Elsewhere in Varisia, however, the former Gray Maiden Oriana (CN female human fighter 8) leads a devout group of fellow dishonored maidens who are unrepentant of their actions under Ileosa. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but Oriana and those faithful to her are believed to be working toward retaking Korvosa in Queen Ileosa's honor, though what means they plan to use remain as shrouded as their scar-marked faces.

Her former master is long dead, but she has taken his lessons to heart, becoming a bold and competent killer. These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training. Though much of her knowledge is loudly proclaimed to be a \"trade secret,\" she has often been known to boast of its central maxim: \"Hit first, hit hard, and don't stop till you're painted red.\"",

Though an assassin and mercenary by trade - one who might easily be hired by any villain and sent against the PCs - Lylin disdains anonymity, and would prefer to finish her kills in public (though she isn't averse to starting with a sneak attack from the shadows).",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Lylin's master taught her social graces, but even when diplomatic and pleasant, she is always sizing up potential opponents, and feels no qualms about taking life at the slightest provocation. She is far more likely to ally with a party that contains other halflings, though those who rely too much on racial camaraderie may be surprised by how quickly her backslapping friendship disappears if they dare question her methods."
