(Doing either of these counts as one use of this discipline.) Where the armor appears from or vanishes to can be anywhere the Hellknight designates, but it must be a place the Hellknight has seen on the same plane of existence where she is, or be in an extradimensional space she controls, such as a bag of holding. This armor is a specific suit of {eq-armor/Hellknight plate} that the Hellknight designates when she selects this discipline. The Hellknight can attune this ability to a new set of armor, but doing so takes 1 week."
