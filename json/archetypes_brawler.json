Sargava's alliance with the Shackles has led to a proliferation of the art there, and battle dancers are often found among Mwangi-descended pirates.",

If she is unable to move 5 feet, she can't attempt any further attacks or combat maneuvers. She can't exceed her maximum speed. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity if the brawler would be able to take a 5-foot step normally; if she would be unable to (for instance, if she were in difficult terrain), the movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless she succeeds at the appropriate Acrobatics checks.

The attack is still resolved normally, even if the battle dancer's movement takes her out of the triggering attack's reach. This movement is not a 5-foot step and provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures other than the one that triggered this ability, though the battle dancer can attempt an Acrobatics check to avoid provoking the attacks.

If either the opponent or the ally moves more than 5 feet before the ally's attack, the flanking bonus is lost. This ability works only if the ally is on the opposite side of an opponent during the battle dancer's attack, not if a flanking bonus is gained in some other way, such as through {feat/Gang Up}.

Creatures that do not need to breathe, are immune to critical hits, or are immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, a strangler can use this ability twice per day.

Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. At 20th level, the strangler can attempt this as a move action instead of a standard can.

Many guests and visitors have witnessed these tournaments over the years, and as a result, the style has spread throughout Golarion.",

Unwrapping a hand is a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level, as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a strong-side boxer can dip her wrapped hand in resin and then crushed glass or small metal spikes, which remain on her wrapped hand for 1 hour. If she chooses crushed glass, she can deal slashing damage with her unarmed strikes; if she chooses spikes, she can deal piercing damage with her unarmed strikes for the duration. Whether she chooses crushed glass or metal spikes, she deals an additional 1 point of bleed damage with her unarmed strikes. At 7th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d4. At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to 1d6. At 15th level, the bleed damage increases to 2d4. At 19th level, the bleed damage is multiplied on a critical hit.
