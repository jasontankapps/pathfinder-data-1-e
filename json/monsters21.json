Its head and body share a common pool of hit points but are otherwise treated as different creatures while separated.

They have little personal identity and barely remember events more than a few hours old. While they are intelligent enough to converse and recognize their own kind, other servitors of the Pallid Princess, and daemons, they tend to think of other creatures as either threats or food. Sarcovalts sometimes work together to kill larger prey, but are usually content to eat scraps left behind by more powerful outsiders.",
			"",
			"A sarcovalt resembles an enormous fly with a vulture's neck - but instead of a fleshy head, its head is the naked skull of a vulture with glistening black eyes. When its skull is detached, its bald neck ends in a stump of tattered flesh. It savors the opportunity to drink blood, but cannot swallow it, and therefore its skull is normally painted with the life-fluid of its victims. In their eagerness to shred bodies, especially living flesh, these eager scavengers often get small treasure like amulets, rings, and other equipment worn close to the body trapped within their skulls. After letting such items rattle around in their heads for a few days, they unceremoniously vomit them up coated in the vile remains of their last several meals. Sarcovalts use their skulls similarly to how psychopomps wear masks, and the first sarcovalts might have been created in mockery of Pharasma's servants.",
			"",
			"Servants of Urgathoa frequently summon sarcovalts to serve either as scouts and sentinels, or as menaces to sow fear and disease in places they seek to terrorize. In the best cases, a single sarcovalt can spread disease resulting in the deaths of dozens, giving Urgathoa's priests ample bodies to raise as undead or use in more terrible plots when they reveal themselves.",

The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches' stealth is their distinctive odor - a pungent, musky scent that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches themselves are not apparent.",
			"",
			"The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a world where dragons and sea monsters are real, many urban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall in a forest makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and \"knocking\" - the act of striking a solid surface (like a tree or boulder) with a club or stone - and thus tends to blend in with the ambient sounds of a forest.",

			"Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey indigenous to the Verduran Forest, which straddles the borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt. They are well known throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the pleasantly sweet aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their name. Though the human population surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures deep into the fey wood for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords and ladies during their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River, playing songs from the river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard."

A saumen kar's brands can be removed by the spell erase as though they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar's Hit Dice.

			"",

			"",

			"",
			"This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as \"men of snow.\" A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands - though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"These solitary creatures eke out a bitter existence across the equally bitter landscape of the Crown of the World, their origins a mystery even to themselves. They are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion's share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind.",
			"",
			"Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar's lair contains crude ice replicas of common Erutaki implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments.",
			"",
			"The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar's flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some Erutaki elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: \"favored.\" The runes' powers lead many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the North, such as Hshrha, the Duchess of All Winds; the Empyreal Lord Tolc; or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands' protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world's summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The Crown of the World is an unforgiving place, and the saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars' antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male's and favorably disposed female's paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the North rather than any specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant influenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of the Erutaki languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings.",
			"",
			"Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet."

Academics speculate that the similarities in this creation process are what form the connection that allows sceaduinars to telepathically command sceazirs.",

Their six manyjointed, insectile legs, terminating in jagged claws, give them an unnerving, skittering appearance when moving across the ground. In flight, their wings vibrate at a speed not easily discernible by the mortal eye, so they appear to be completely still even as they swoop down on victims. Their speed, stealth, and ability to sense living creatures make them highly efficient predators.",

			"As bestial creatures driven primarily by instinctual hatred, sceazirs do not have anything that could properly be called a society of their own. They are often influenced more by sceaduinars than their own inclinations. Though the egg formations containing sceazirs arise spontaneously, sceaduinars residing in the area typically tend them to ensure the eggs hatch safely. This process also ensures that the newly birthed sceazirs bond to the attending sceaduinars, providing a ready source of mounts when needed. A sceazir is loyal to its sceaduinar rider, although the bond is not necessarily exclusive; sceazirs take commands from any sceaduinar, provided they do not conflict with the commands of a sceaduinar that is already commanding them. It is unusual to see more than a single sceazir and sceaduinar together, however, and the presence of multiple pairs always indicates they are joining together against something they consider to be a significant threat.",
			"",
			"Sceazirs birthed into the harsh wilds of the Negative Energy Plane are left to their own devices unless found by a sceaduinar with a need for their service. These sceazirs roam the plane hunting for prey, often forming packs. Packs have a loose hierarchy, with the strongest sceazir in the group acting as the leader, without other defined roles. Although they have no real need to eat, they enjoy seeking out both living and undead creatures to devour, gleefully tearing their prey to pieces. The relative rarity of intruders to the Negative Energy Plane means that sceazirs eagerly track down any new arrivals they detect in their territory. They especially loathe those capable of using positive energy and target such foes with particular ferocity.",
			"",
			"Whether they are solitary or part of a pack, sceazirs mark their territory by digging nests out of the entropic substance that forms the Negative Energy Plane's environs. Sceazir nests generally take the form of caves or deep pits, and they can be identified by the swirled, geometrical patterns of claw marks across the ground and exterior. These patterns are unique to each sceazir or pack, and they cause a disturbing sense of vertigo to living creatures who look into them for too long.",
			"",
			"Curiously, sceazirs seem to have an inborn terror of the Negative Energy Plane's other inhabitants, nightshades. This aversion goes far beyond that of sceaduinars, who despise nightshades and avoid them unless they have sufficient power or numbers to ensure success in the ensuing conflict. Sceazirs will not approach a nightshade or its territory under any circumstances, even if directly commanded to do so by a sceaduinar rider. Speculations regarding the reason for this vary. Some scholars believe it is a simple matter of practicality, as the majority of sceazirs are not powerful enough to survive a conflict with a nightshade. Others, however, suspect the phobia may have a deeper cause, with suggestions ranging from an energy given off by nightshades that sceazirs cannot tolerate to an ancient war ending in the sceazirs' defeat and devolution to the bestial creatures they are now. Some have even suggested that nightshades are capable of commanding sceazirs just as sceaduinars are, but use that ability to keep sceazirs away rather than work with them."

Lacking forelegs with which to tear apart a meal, scitalises allow their kills to ripen for a day or so in their lairs before eating them. They keep some treasure and can be bribed, burying what they do attain in the walls and floors of their nests.",

These eggs sell for 5,000 gp in large cities, and juveniles can command prices of 8,000 gp. Scitalises coexist with wyverns, but detest basilisks and griffons, which regularly devour the scitalises' eggs when they run across them.",

The items stuck to a scrapshell grant it a +4 armor bonus to AC. A weapon that strikes a scrapshell becomes stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds at a DC 17 Reflex save. A creature adjacent to the scrapshell can pry off a stuck weapon with a successful DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature that becomes stuck to a scrapshell via a natural attack gains the grappled condition, but the scrapshell does not. A successful critical hit on a scrapshell not only avoids this defensive mechanism (and thus the attacker has no chance of becoming stuck to the shell) but also bypasses its damage reduction. If a scrapshell takes more than 10 points of damage from a single fire attack, its sticky mucus is burned away. A dose of {magic-wondrous/universal solvent} or similar fluid automatically removes a scrapshell's sticky shell ability. It takes a scrapshell 24 hours to secrete more sticky mucus, and during this time, it does not gain the advantages of this ability, and it loses its armor bonus to AC.

The scrapshell's penchant for lairing in or near submerged shipwrecks and other coastal detritus and for adorning its shell with interesting (and often highly valuable) debris makes it a tempting target for scavengers of all sorts. Any treasure found in or near a scrapshell generally consists of weapons stuck to its shell or the large and uniquely colored pearls the creature produces - these dazzling and iridescent pearls are highly prized. Scrapshell mucus loses its sticky quality soon after the creature's death. A scrapshell measures about 10 feet across and weighs 800 pounds."

			"The feral sea cat (sometimes referred to as the sea lion, sea tiger, or sea leopard) is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastal predators in tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical great cat - a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah - complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water.",
			"",

Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often influenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; the most common sea cats, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water, though most live in the ocean, where they can hunt a varied and consistent supply of food. A sea cat's diet typically consists of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals (including seals and otters), but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators like sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell watch vigilantly for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line.",
			"",
			"Sea cats breathe air, not water. When not hunting they can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe.",
			"",
			"The sea cat's low intelligence and high level of ferocity make it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, though pirates and aquatic races have been known to try, with limited success."

Due to the sea serpent's hermitic nature, many sailors take to ascribing the sighting of such a beast to an omen, although whether the sighting portends peril or providence depends as much upon the ship's morale as it does anything else - the sea serpent itself has little interest in prophecy, and only its hunger determines how dangerous its proximity to a curious ship can be.",

			"Elder kin to satyrs, seilenoi are primeval fey bound to the basest emotions, including lust, joy, surprise, aggression, and fear. These fey wander the world, indulging in any excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings. New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy, honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious than satyrs for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged animal magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.",
			"",
			"Like satyrs, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds where they revel in the passionate emotions of the fey and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of the forest often flock to seilenoi in small troupes or even traveling courts. Satyrs, leanan sidhe, and muses enjoy the artistry of a seilenos's storytelling. Centaurs and maenads revere seilenoi for inspiring irresistibly passionate, ecstatic rage. The seilenos acts as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of fey culture and secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on ichthyocentaurs as seafaring guides and honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their courts eventually, either because their fey followers move on to more sedate leaders or because the seilenos feels stifled and drunkenly wanders off in search of a change of pace.",
			"",
			"Seilenoi who do not lead their own fey courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries, unpredictable generals, or companions for fey lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield, as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory sheets of roaring flame. Others enjoy deflating the egos of powerful fey (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly insightful satire.",
			"",
			"In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new kinds of indulgence and distraction among mortals, in which case these fey generally prove themselves amiable, though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can't talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion. Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with polymorph magic to avoid undue attention.",
			"",
			"Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new opponents as to explore the body of a new lover. Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they become a terrifying force. A seilenos never faces combat alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and hides an ever-shifting mirage arcana while rallying allies and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements with which a seilenos is familiar, from fantastical mazes of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to transform especially vexing foes into harmless animals or useful plants.",
			"",
			"Although their wide range of moods tends toward joy and frivolity, all seilenoi at times indulge in the insidious thrill of violence, hatred, or madness. When filled with these dark passions, a seilenos might provoke a battle among evenly matched friends to watch the tense contest or dive headlong into the confused heart of a fray.",

Males and females come together briefly during their spring mating season, and thereafter each female finds a secluded cave or beach to birth a single pup, which is abandoned after 2 to 3 years. Younger selkies then form packs with others of their kind until they can strike out on their own. Some selkies live among humanoids to assuage their loneliness, and may marry land dwellers.

			"Even though the Age of Serpents has long since passed, serpentfolk reclaimers have retained a small fraction of the psychic magic over which their people once held mastery. Serpentfolk claim they once shared a powerful psychic connection with their god, Ydersius. Though that connection has grown weaker since the fall of their patron deity, reclaimers now hold sway over spirits and the dead, a consequence of Ydersius's half-living state. As such, a reclaimer can use psychic magic to affect undead that are normally immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"Serpentfolk reclaimers are determined to restore both their empire's former glory and the potent psychic magic their people once wielded, and have long moved past any squeamishness about how they accomplish their goals. They find the degeneration of their kind deeply offensive, and perform occult experiments on their degenerate kindred, attempting to uplift them to greater intelligence. These procedures usually kill their subjects, or drive them mad, but the reclaimers consider this a small price to pay - their kin's degenerate state is humiliation beyond imagining, and those who die in a reclaimer's attempts to elevate them are spared the agony of such a wretched existence. Some reclaimers seek to make mental contact with the still-living head of Ydersius, hoping to revive him or merge their psyches with his, perhaps giving him the psychic strength to reinstate the connection he once had with his people. Some adherents, however, believe their god's fleshless state is an evolution in his existence, and that his mind is now free of physical restraints.",
			"",
			"Many serpentfolk see reclaimers as paragons of their kind, and are eager to aid them in rebuilding the great civilization they lost.

			"",
			"Reclaimers are too few in number to risk their lives needlessly. They prefer to beguile, confuse, and enthrall their opponents whenever they can, turning their foes into their unwilling allies. If forced to fight, they let undead allies or degenerate serpentfolk take the brunt of the attack, fleeing if they feel they are in danger. When cornered, they are ruthless, for their poisonous bite saps their foes' strength, allowing the reclaimer to finish them off with less risk to itself.",

While most serpentfolk spies describe their professions in terms of analyzing weaknesses and preparing for the eventual large-scale assault on the surface world, the truth is that many spies (and their masters) have immediate goals in mind. Spies often stake out powerful priests and arcanists, posing as fellow scholars or simple servitors, in order to gain access to knowledge and arcane lore not readily available in their subterranean caverns. Given their long life spans and reptilian patience, these individuals may infiltrate an organization and stay implanted there for years, waiting for a choice artifact or tome to present itself. Once it does, the spy absconds with the relic and retreats back to the serpentfolk city of its paymasters-killing any warmbloods who stand in its way."

			"Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is not one that has been created or influenced by humankind. Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods' hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature, marked with snake-like features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion's ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.",

			"",
			"Though serpopards are most common in the deserts of northern Garund, travelers in such far-off locales as the Meraz Desert in Qadira, the Cinderlands of Varisia, and the vast expanse of Shaguang in Tian Xia to the east have spotted creatures matching the serpopards' description. Some sages hypothesize that the most powerful or ancient serpopards can cross greater distances with their dune step ability, and thus travel through it to distant deserts across Golarion. Such experts say it's therefore likely that all deserts hold populations of serpopards, though they may be few in number or very isolated.",
			"",
			"Serpopards are largely nocturnal, preferring to hunt at night when they can use the cover of darkness to approach prey undetected. When hunting, they rely on their speed and powerful claws to take down large quarry, and then use the additional reach provided by their unusually long necks to defend their kills from scavengers and competing hunters. Serpopards are not averse to eating intelligent beings, and hunt humanoids if the opportunity or need arises, but they aren't cruel; serpopards gain no pleasure from such acts beyond the satisfaction of a fresh meal.",
			"",
			"On average, serpopards have a lifespan of about 50 years, but rumors exist of serpopards living much longer than this. One town along the northern coast of Rahadoum claims a single serpopard has visited its outskirts once every decade for the past 100 years.",

			"Serpopards are mainly solitary creatures. Very rarely do they travel in pairs, and then only during mating season or in the case of littermates who chose not to separate at adulthood. When living as mated pairs, the father stays only until the cubs are able to run, but the mother stays with the cubs much longer, teaching them how to hunt and use their special ability to travel between the dunes. Mothers also pass on to the cubs their understanding of the land, instructing them as to which areas are good for hunting or exploring, what kinds of places to avoid, and how to find fresh water. Young serpopards separate from their mother individually, leaving as soon as they mature and feel confident navigating their way through the desert alone.",
			"",
			"When traveling, serpopards range anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per day, stopping only to hunt, rest, or (more rarely) explore some aged ruin. No one knows what fascination these ancient works hold for the serpopards, but the creatures' interest in such locations is undeniable. An old poem involving serpopards claims that the creatures visit these ancient ruins because they are pining for the lost empire of Ancient Osirion.",
			"",
			"Serpopards are clever liars and frustrating conversationalists, and hold a reputation among other races as skilled deceivers. In rural parts of Osirion, those with a gift for deception are often said to have \"the tongue of a sedja,\" while young children caught in a lie are warned that their \"necks are growing\" with each lie they tell. Despite this potential untrustworthiness, many people still seek the aid of serpopards. Few creatures know the deserts of Osirion as well as serpopards, and for the right price many are willing to guide groups of people across the desert. It's usually best to ensure the serpopard is well fed before undertaking such a journey, however, for a hungry serpopard may turn on its traveling companions if it thinks it can make a quick meal out of them. Serpopards have little use for gold and rarely accept it as payment for their services, though some apparently take a liking to jewelry, as travelers report the creatures as frequently wearing necklaces and bracelets when encountered. Food and hospitality are always acceptable payments, for those two things are in short supply in the harsh expanse of the desert. For those wishing to earn a serpopard's true faith and loyalty, however, one form of compensation stands above all others-divination magic. Serpopards are unceasingly curious about what their futures hold, and put great stock in the words of those who can tell fortunes or predict events to come.",
			"",
			"Serpopards attack most sphinxes on sight, often fighting at least long enough to get in a few solid blows before retreating between the dunes to safety. The only exception to this is androsphinxes, which most serpopards fear for some unknown reason. Only the bravest or most desperate serpopards face down such creatures in combat without aid; most flee immediately once they spot these mighty sphinxes. Sphinxes are aware of this antipathy and treat serpopards accordingly. Perhaps as a consequence of their antipathy toward sphinxes, serpopards also hate riddles and word games, and prefer to twist their words with lies and omissions rather than making a game out of conversation. Ignorant travelers who confuse the two creatures and try to engage the serpopard in a bout of riddling can find themselves in a dangerous predicament."

Intelligent enough to form their own culture, many serus live entirely separate lives from serpentfolk enclaves. Even so, many serpentfolk wizards still seek out serus to bind them as familiars. A spellcaster must have the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat, be of an evil alignment, and be an arcane caster of level of 7th or higher to gain a seru familiar.",

			"Serus are natural predators that prefer to track prey by scent. When ready to strike, they spit venom into the eyes of a victim and use ambush tactics to wear down their targets.

Such constructs can be identified by two different gems (matching the two spirits that animate them) fitted into their headpieces. An elevated Set guardian can also be animated with two elemental spirits of the same type, though the construct is easily mistaken for a standard Set guardian because its gemstone eyes are the same color.",

The head of the preserved giant must be severed cleanly at the shoulders and the headpiece then bolted on.
