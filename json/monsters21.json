			"**Detach Head (Su)** A sarcovalt can survive without its head. Attacks that sever its head (such as those of a vorpal weapon) do not kill it. If attacked by multiple creatures, it grapples one opponent, detaches its head (which continues to drain blood), and uses its body to continue attacking with spell-like abilities. Its head and body share a common pool of hit points but are otherwise treated as different creatures while separated. The head is AC 19, touch 15, flat-footed 16 (+3 Dex, +4 natural, +2 size) and can fly at the creature's normal speed. The head cannot initiate attacks on its own, and if removed from a target, it flies back to the body on its next turn.

			"Sarcovalts are disgusting carrion-eating servants of Urgathoa that pick over the filth and the remnants of devoured souls in her planar realm. They have little personal identity and barely remember events more than a few hours old. While they are intelligent enough to converse and recognize their own kind, other servitors of the Pallid Princess, and daemons, they tend to think of other creatures as either threats or food. Sarcovalts sometimes work together to kill larger prey, but are usually content to eat scraps left behind by more powerful outsiders.",
			"",
			"A sarcovalt resembles an enormous fly with a vulture's neck - but instead of a fleshy head, its head is the naked skull of a vulture with glistening black eyes. When its skull is detached, its bald neck ends in a stump of tattered flesh. It savors the opportunity to drink blood, but cannot swallow it, and therefore its skull is normally painted with the life-fluid of its victims. In their eagerness to shred bodies, especially living flesh, these eager scavengers often get small treasure like amulets, rings, and other equipment worn close to the body trapped within their skulls. After letting such items rattle around in their heads for a few days, they unceremoniously vomit them up coated in the vile remains of their last several meals. Sarcovalts use their skulls similarly to how psychopomps wear masks, and the first sarcovalts might have been created in mockery of Pharasma's servants.",
			"",
			"Servants of Urgathoa frequently summon sarcovalts to serve either as scouts and sentinels, or as menaces to sow fear and disease in places they seek to terrorize. In the best cases, a single sarcovalt can spread disease resulting in the deaths of dozens, giving Urgathoa's priests ample bodies to raise as undead or use in more terrible plots when they reveal themselves.",

Yet despite its enormous size and ungainly shape, the sard is in fact a swift and agile monster. It can move with unsettling grace and speed, crawling across the ground on long spidery roots like an immense insect. It attacks either with a single slam of its immense trunk or by launching volleys of foot-long thorns that inject the creature's poisonous, electrified sap.",

The extent of this illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer.

A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk.",
			"",
			"Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step."

Left to their own devices, sasquatch families are perfectly content to live their lives in the deep woods, leaving behind little to no trace of their passing save for the periodic big footprint in the ground.",
			"",
			"Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are incredibly stealthy creatures, capable of moving through forests in particular with astonishing grace and efficiency. The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches' stealth is their distinctive odor - a pungent, musky scent that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches themselves are not apparent.",
			"",
			"The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a world where dragons and sea monsters are real, many urban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall in a forest makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and \"knocking\" - the act of striking a solid surface (like a tree or boulder) with a club or stone - and thus tends to blend in with the ambient sounds of a forest.",
			"",
			"A sasquatch is 8 feet tall and weighs 570 pounds. Rural populaces often have fond nicknames for these creatures, such as wild men, skunk apes, and perhaps most popularly, simply bigfoot."

Children born from such encounters are always full-blooded satyrs, and are generally spirited away by their riotous kin soon after birth."

Though the human population surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures deep into the fey wood for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords and ladies during their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River, playing songs from the river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard."

			"**Frostbite Brands (Ex)** A saumen kar's brands infuse the creature with intense cold, so much that it gains resistance to fire 20 and its touch deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. A saumen kar's metallic weapons also conduct this chill. A saumen kar's brands can be removed by the spell erase as though they were magic writing with a caster level equal to the saumen kar's Hit Dice. If the brands are removed, the saumen kar loses both its fire resistance and its ability to do additional cold damage, until the following dawn when the brands re-etch themselves upon its body.",
			"",
			"**Snowstorm (Su)** In mimicry of its unforgiving environment, a saumen kar can transform into a living snowstorm of lethal power. This ability lasts as long and operates like the whirlwind special attack with the following changes: Creatures within the area of the snowstorm take 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of slashing damage and take a -20 penalty on Perception checks. A saumen kar gains a fly speed of 40 feet (perfect) while in this form.",
			"",
			"**Stun (Ex)** While a saumen kar's horns are not large enough for a gore attack, they extend under the skin to form a bony plate. A creature struck by a saumen kar's headbutt must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"This leathery-faced creature stands tall and upright, with long, simian limbs and a shaggy coat. Intelligent and powerful, saumen kars are not naturally aggressive, but the hostility of their environment forces them to defend the land that supports them with ferocity, even to the death. Their natural coloration and snow-packed fur make saumen kars almost invisible among the drifts of their icy homes, leading many arctic races to refer to them as \"men of snow.\" A long-forgotten deal made by their race in its infancy still brutally scars the body of each saumen kar, marking them with their distinctive frostbite brands - though if this debt is already paid, lapsed, or growing ever greater, none can remember. An adult saumen kar stands 12 feet tall and weighs almost 2,000 pounds, but the ice and snow matted to its fur for both insulation and armor add another 1,000 pounds to its bulk.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"These solitary creatures eke out a bitter existence across the equally bitter landscape of the Crown of the World, their origins a mystery even to themselves. They are nomadic, roaming the wastes to settle temporarily where they are lucky enough to find food, shelter, or both. They are omnivorous, but the climate dictates that the lion's share of their diet is meat, and saumen kars consume the flesh of any creature but their own kind.",
			"",
			"Generation to generation, saumen kars pass down the ice crafting techniques that supply them with weapons, tools, and art. Occasionally a saumen kar's lair contains crude ice replicas of common Erutaki implements, from storage jars to skinning tools, or even heavy-lidded ice chests. Finding their frozen works among the possessions of another race is rare, however, since saumen kar ice artifacts rarely last long outside of arctic environments.",
			"",
			"The crude frostbite brands that mark every adult saumen kar's flesh are the gruesome expression of an ancient pact with an otherworldly being, still honored by saumen kars for both spiritual and practical reasons. The specifics of the pact are long forgotten, but some Erutaki elders believe the men of snow protect something in the wastes that they have themselves forgotten. While the meaning of the brands may have become lost to their wearers, scholars of language recognize the runes as a form of ancient Giant. Even still, only one well versed in linguistics can identify the sole rune still rendered well enough to read: \"favored.\" The runes' powers lead many to believe the saumen kars owe their protection to one of the numerous powers of the North, such as Hshrha, the Duchess of All Winds; the Empyreal Lord Tolc; or entities mysterious to natives of more temperate lands, though the implication of the runes being an ancient form of the Giant language also creates an unsettling link between these arctic warriors and the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie. Whichever way other races choose to speculate, the saumen kars believe the brands' protections come from their reverence for the deadly forces of the world's summit, and they display their scars proudly, wearing no clothing or armor but the snow matted into their dense fur.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The Crown of the World is an unforgiving place, and the saumen kars have learned that survival is best achieved alone or in very small groups. It is rare to meet more than one of their kind at a time, although folklore does tell of handfuls of saumen kars banding together against a particularly serious or wide-ranging threat. Wandering the wastes alone, they throw up temporary lairs wherever food or ice cliffs can be found, moving off when they have taken what they can from the land. A typical lair is little more than a rough-walled igloo or ice cave built by hefting large amounts of snow and packing it tight around the hemispheres of ice they create, before the magical effect expires.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars' antisocial behavior is what keeps them rare, and indeed mating is almost incidental, occurring when a male's and favorably disposed female's paths happen to cross. New families rarely stay together for long, and for a creature with a lifespan of up to 300 years, their offspring grow at an alarming rate, and learn to fend for themselves early in life.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars worship the land and the powers of the North rather than any specific deity, leading to a druidic dominance of their spiritual lives. In their final days, some saumen kars travel to sites of great natural beauty or power to die in a place where the blackened bones of many generations are tumbled together beneath ever-shifting ice and snow. From what little outsiders can gather, they are a loosely shamanic people, and some carry crude family reliquaries of teeth, bones, and fur for ancestral protection and guidance.",
			"",
			"Saumen kars speak a dialect of Giant influenced by Druidic, though they rarely communicate with other races. Some saumen kars, through necessity, have picked up smatterings of the Erutaki languages and even a word or two of Common, but their knowledge of such languages never extends beyond a handful of crude threats and warnings.",
			"",
			"Survival in the wastes is about understanding its dangers, environmental or otherwise, and despite their primitive, animalistic appearance, saumen kars are canny combatants. Over thousands of years their proud race has learned patience and silence from the glaciers. Rather than risk a frontal assault, they utilize their natural coloration to hide in snow banks and their ability to summon powerful ursine aid to scare off enemies or track those who trespass upon their lands. Only if interlopers prove a match for their summoned allies will they cautiously join the fray, trapping physically stronger creatures in icy hemispheres or separating groups with freezing planes. They then wade in, the field rearranged to their advantage, to use their imposing size, savage axe blows, and incapacitating headbutts to cut down weaker opponents, or take snowstorm form to shred dangerous spellcasters with blinding, razor-sharp sleet."

They are unnaturally fast, moving with equal ease on the ground or through the air. Due to sceazirs' speed and skill at tracking, sceaduinars often use them as mounts or beasts of burden. Sceazirs can understand the commands of a sceaduinar rider through a telepathic bond and carry out such commands obediently, but they almost never accept non-sceaduinar riders.",

			"",
			"Scholars are unsure of the exact catalysts that cause the \"births\" of the Negative Energy Plane's strange entropic creatures, and due to the plane's hostile environment, attempts to study the subject are difficult and limited. Like sceaduinars, sceazirs are born from crystalline formations made of the Negative Energy Plane's hypersaturation of negative energy, hatching fully grown from egg-like cocoons. Academics speculate that the similarities in this creation process are what form the connection that allows sceaduinars to telepathically command sceazirs.",
			"",
			"Sceazirs' bodies are formed of dark purple crystal, and their heads are somewhat wolflike, though with mouths far wider than those of any mortal canines. Their six manyjointed, insectile legs, terminating in jagged claws, give them an unnerving, skittering appearance when moving across the ground. In flight, their wings vibrate at a speed not easily discernible by the mortal eye, so they appear to be completely still even as they swoop down on victims. Their speed, stealth, and ability to sense living creatures make them highly efficient predators.",
			"",
			"It is rumored that even larger and more powerful sceazirs inhabit the dark reaches of the Negative Energy Plane, though if such creatures do exist, none who have encountered them survived to verify these rumors.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As bestial creatures driven primarily by instinctual hatred, sceazirs do not have anything that could properly be called a society of their own. They are often influenced more by sceaduinars than their own inclinations. Though the egg formations containing sceazirs arise spontaneously, sceaduinars residing in the area typically tend them to ensure the eggs hatch safely. This process also ensures that the newly birthed sceazirs bond to the attending sceaduinars, providing a ready source of mounts when needed. A sceazir is loyal to its sceaduinar rider, although the bond is not necessarily exclusive; sceazirs take commands from any sceaduinar, provided they do not conflict with the commands of a sceaduinar that is already commanding them. It is unusual to see more than a single sceazir and sceaduinar together, however, and the presence of multiple pairs always indicates they are joining together against something they consider to be a significant threat.",
			"",
			"Sceazirs birthed into the harsh wilds of the Negative Energy Plane are left to their own devices unless found by a sceaduinar with a need for their service. These sceazirs roam the plane hunting for prey, often forming packs. Packs have a loose hierarchy, with the strongest sceazir in the group acting as the leader, without other defined roles. Although they have no real need to eat, they enjoy seeking out both living and undead creatures to devour, gleefully tearing their prey to pieces. The relative rarity of intruders to the Negative Energy Plane means that sceazirs eagerly track down any new arrivals they detect in their territory. They especially loathe those capable of using positive energy and target such foes with particular ferocity.",
			"",
			"Whether they are solitary or part of a pack, sceazirs mark their territory by digging nests out of the entropic substance that forms the Negative Energy Plane's environs. Sceazir nests generally take the form of caves or deep pits, and they can be identified by the swirled, geometrical patterns of claw marks across the ground and exterior. These patterns are unique to each sceazir or pack, and they cause a disturbing sense of vertigo to living creatures who look into them for too long.",
			"",
			"Curiously, sceazirs seem to have an inborn terror of the Negative Energy Plane's other inhabitants, nightshades. This aversion goes far beyond that of sceaduinars, who despise nightshades and avoid them unless they have sufficient power or numbers to ensure success in the ensuing conflict. Sceazirs will not approach a nightshade or its territory under any circumstances, even if directly commanded to do so by a sceaduinar rider. Speculations regarding the reason for this vary. Some scholars believe it is a simple matter of practicality, as the majority of sceazirs are not powerful enough to survive a conflict with a nightshade. Others, however, suspect the phobia may have a deeper cause, with suggestions ranging from an energy given off by nightshades that sceazirs cannot tolerate to an ancient war ending in the sceazirs' defeat and devolution to the bestial creatures they are now. Some have even suggested that nightshades are capable of commanding sceazirs just as sceaduinars are, but use that ability to keep sceazirs away rather than work with them."

Their heavy scales have an elliptical shape, and grow ragged and thicker as the scitalises age. A scitalis glows from within, its scales and frill lighting up like a stained-glass window and projecting mesmerizing patterns that the dragon uses while hunting.",
			"",
			"Scitalises covet territory and food more than the gold and gems that true dragons prize. They live in caves, forest grottoes, and rocky crags, and mark their territories with a combination of musk and their sour, bile-scented sedative. Scitalises often range up to 5 miles from their nests every few days to hunt large herd animals and livestock. Lacking forelegs with which to tear apart a meal, scitalises allow their kills to ripen for a day or so in their lairs before eating them. They keep some treasure and can be bribed, burying what they do attain in the walls and floors of their nests.",
			"",
			"Scitalises lay clutches of one to three eggs, and males and females share duties guarding the nest. The pair remains together until the juveniles reach maturity after 2 years. These eggs sell for 5,000 gp in large cities, and juveniles can command prices of 8,000 gp. Scitalises coexist with wyverns, but detest basilisks and griffons, which regularly devour the scitalises' eggs when they run across them.",
			"",
			"An average scitalis is between 14 and 18 feet long and weighs approximately 2,500 pounds."

A dose of {magic-wondrous/universal solvent} or similar fluid automatically removes a scrapshell's sticky shell ability.

Any treasure found in or near a scrapshell generally consists of weapons stuck to its shell or the large and uniquely colored pearls the creature produces - these dazzling and iridescent pearls are highly prized. Scrapshell mucus loses its sticky quality soon after the creature's death. A scrapshell measures about 10 feet across and weighs 800 pounds."

			"",

			"",
			"**Soul Tome (Su)** Whenever a scrivenite deals Intelligence damage, the stolen knowledge manifests as a soul tome in its possession. A new soul tome is created for each different creature that a scrivenite damages in this way, and further Intelligence damage dealt to that creature causes the soul tome to swell and become more elaborate. This Intelligence damage can be restored naturally over time, by magic, or by a creature reading from its own soul tome in order to restore the stolen memories. Every 30 minutes spent in study heals 1 point of Intelligence damage. ",

			"",
			"Any creature can spend 30 minutes reading a soul tome in order to learn the secrets and knowledge that the target once possessed. A soul tome is always written in the target's native tongue. No check is necessary to read the book. The contents of a soul tome can vary wildly. Some may contain only minor trivia about the creature's life, while others might contain important secrets. Soul tomes have hardness 0 and 5 hit points. They crumble to dust once the stolen knowledge within them has been reclaimed or restored. The soul of a creature whose memories are recorded in a soul tome is not prevented from going on to the afterlife.",

In this form, a scrivenite can take 20 on Stealth checks to hide in plain sight as a normal book. A scrivenite in tome form can still use its spell-like abilities, but it loses its ribbon lash attacks and the deflection bonus granted by its clever defense ability, and its speed is reduced to 5 feet.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hailing from Axis, scrivenites act as the historians, cartographers, and archivists of the multiverse. They are literally woven together from knowledge, and every scrivenite contains a deep need to record anything and everything around it in excruciating detail. Terse and introverted in the extreme, scrivenites eschew the frippery of emotion and poetic license in order to preserve objectivity, and they detest the bias and constant revisions applied by fickle mortal minds to stated history. Most scrivenites refuse to see the big picture, and instead focus on minute details, only later collecting the individual facts in their vast libraries. They rarely measure the human suffering or triumph in any particular event. To them, the what, when, and where is more important than the who and why. By scrivenites' estimation, weather can have as much impact on a nation's ultimate fate as its leader, so both factors must be given equal merit.",
			"",
			"Simply existing around information feeds and empowers a scrivenite; they take in the written word as effortlessly as a human breathes. Their understanding of memory and knowledge is so intuitive that scrivenites can extract whatever information they please from the minds of living creatures, binding these facts into elegant tomes unique to each \"contributor.\"",
			"",
			"Scrivenites can manifest as large, sturdily bound books. Perusing their pages reveals swirling, ethereal wisps of text covering their forms. When active, they craft humanlike bodies from their own folded pages and can use their silken bookmarks as weapons. Scrivenites wear the open covers of their tomes as expressive masks. Though their sizes can vary greatly, most scrivenites stand taller than a halfling, but shorter than a human. Though they are made of pages upon pages of dense paperlike material, they weigh less than 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scrivenites are outsiders, forged from souls in the strange crystalline monoliths of Axis. While similar conceptually to the axiomites they serve, scrivenites are partially woven from written words and recorded events rather than abstract mathematics, tying scrivenites to the past while axiomites contemplate the future. Only the most pedantic souls, mired in the past and endlessly obsessed with objectivity, eventually become scrivenites. Ironically, because coming to Axis as a petitioner wipes away all mortal experiences, many scrivenites obsess over their previous identities, tracking whatever information they can as personal projects even if they no longer feel emotional connections to these past lives.",
			"",
			"Effectively immortal with no need to eat or rest, scrivenites fill their time making notes about everything they observe, from the movements of great armies to ambient temperatures across a city. What moments they don't spend recording the world are instead invested into organizing that information or reviewing the work of other scrivenites for accuracy.",
			"",
			"Scrivenites visit other planes with a mix of excitement and loathing. They find the chaos of other worlds deeply upsetting. But keeping to their routines also breeds ignorance, and travel exposes a scrivenite to vast swathes of unrecorded experience that it can eagerly absorb. They answer summons and make forays into other worlds because they need (and secretly relish) these unexplored places.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Less a society of their own and more a client race of axiomites, scrivenites work to support the infrastructure of the Eternal City of Axis. Left to their own devices, the awkward outsiders form sprawling libraries and scriptoriums to collect and organize their ever-expanding works. While such libraries gather limitless knowledge, mortal scholars find the collections dense and impenetrable. Scrivenites' records are written in a cold, passive tone lacking any flourish or interpretation. Although scrivenites hate the interruption caused by visitors, they nonetheless welcome guests - or more specifically, new knowledge - and allow newcomers free access to their libraries so long as these visitors donate more information than they expect to learn. Those unfortunate scholars too foolish to bring any additions to the collection may instead find themselves a part of it."

Whatever the case, scyllas are fortunately quite rare, enough so that many consider them nothing more than tall tales told by sailors deep in their cups.",

The hideous monsters are intelligent creatures, though half-mad with hunger and self-loathing. They normally do not use weapons, but when they do, they prefer to fight with light weapons wielded by their human-sized upper arms. However, they much prefer to keep their hands free to utilize magic items like wands, staves, and other powerful devices."

In some churches, these transformations are displayed on ceremonial occasions so the faithful can marvel at the shifting forms of these beautiful and deadly pieces of art.",

Though certain details of the glass insects' structures vary greatly from creator to creator, a guiding principle in their design is to use flat segments that can unfold and combine into a flat window surface.

A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds.",

Due to the sea serpent's hermitic nature, many sailors take to ascribing the sighting of such a beast to an omen, although whether the sighting portends peril or providence depends as much upon the ship's morale as it does anything else - the sea serpent itself has little interest in prophecy, and only its hunger determines how dangerous its proximity to a curious ship can be.",

Certainly, the sea is a vast and mysterious place more than capable of supporting whales and other such leviathans, and tales of sea serpents that exceed lengths of 300 feet or more are not unheard of. You can generate statistics for a sea serpent of such tremendous size by applying the advanced simple template or the giant simple template to the statistics presented here.

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Elder kin to satyrs, seilenoi are primeval fey bound to the basest emotions, including lust, joy, surprise, aggression, and fear. These fey wander the world, indulging in any excuse to experience or inspire passionate feelings. New spectacles of beauty, physical adventure, and psychoactive plants and alcohol draw their attention, and they encourage creatures they encounter to be equally experimental. Seilenoi particularly enjoy luring stodgy, honorable, or self-important beings into grandiose acts of foolishness or indulgence. Although less notorious than satyrs for sexual exploits, seilenoi possess a rugged animal magnetism and an appreciation for all sorts of carnal pleasures. They are particularly renowned for their insight and skill as storytellers and playwrights.",
			"",
			"Like satyrs, seilenoi prefer to keep to untamed wilds where they revel in the passionate emotions of the fey and beasts that live, grow, and play there. Creatures of the forest often flock to seilenoi in small troupes or even traveling courts. Satyrs, leanan sidhe, and muses enjoy the artistry of a seilenos's storytelling. Centaurs and maenads revere seilenoi for inspiring irresistibly passionate, ecstatic rage. The seilenos acts as a mercurial judge, jocular keeper of fey culture and secrets, and sometimes self-centered celebrity to these groups. Seilenoi traveling across the ocean often take on ichthyocentaurs as seafaring guides and honor guards. Most seilenoi get separated from their courts eventually, either because their fey followers move on to more sedate leaders or because the seilenos feels stifled and drunkenly wanders off in search of a change of pace.",
			"",
			"Seilenoi who do not lead their own fey courts sometimes serve as jesters, emissaries, unpredictable generals, or companions for fey lords, deities, or other mighty beings. Seilenoi prove surprisingly dangerous on the battlefield, as they dash about scattering scores of enemies with every cutting joke and inspiring monologue. When dealing with more numerous foes, they confound the battlefield with seemingly natural barriers and illusory sheets of roaring flame. Others enjoy deflating the egos of powerful fey (and, occasionally, mortals) with bitingly insightful satire.",
			"",
			"In their wanderings, seilenoi sometimes seek out new kinds of indulgence and distraction among mortals, in which case these fey generally prove themselves amiable, though gruff. Seilenoi can charm almost anyone with raucous affection or witty commentary. Those they can't talk into joining the revelry, they generally ply with alcohol or psychotropic plants to lower the inhibitions of civilization and enable a freer expression of raw emotion. Bored seilenoi occasionally take it upon themselves to mentor mortals with exceptional self-awareness and power. Sometimes they do so while disguised with polymorph magic to avoid undue attention.",
			"",
			"Seilenoi are passionate creatures, as thrilled by the chance to have a drunken brawl with new opponents as to explore the body of a new lover. Usually, seilenoi view combat as a sort of hunting or wrestling game, but if they recognize true hostility, they become a terrifying force. A seilenos never faces combat alone; it summons allies to distract foes if necessary and hides an ever-shifting mirage arcana while rallying allies and keeping foes off balance by manipulating their emotions. Its illusions represent the natural elements with which a seilenos is familiar, from fantastical mazes of writhing vines to confusing clouds of spores. It is particularly amused by exchanging the appearances of enemies and allies. Seilenoi have also been known to transform especially vexing foes into harmless animals or useful plants.",
			"",
			"Although their wide range of moods tends toward joy and frivolity, all seilenoi at times indulge in the insidious thrill of violence, hatred, or madness. When filled with these dark passions, a seilenos might provoke a battle among evenly matched friends to watch the tense contest or dive headlong into the confused heart of a fray.",
			"",
			"Seilenoi are about the same size and weight as male humans, although they tend toward the heavier end of that range."

In its natural form, a selkie has webbed, clawed hands and a muscular trunk ending in broad flippers. A selkie's head is a blend of human and seal, with large eyes and a mouth full of curved teeth. Selkies grow to a length of 6-1/2 feet, but can weigh up to 300 pounds. Selkies typically live up to 75 years.",
			"",
			"Most selkies use their shapechanging abilities for mischief. A favorite selkie tactic is to take the shape of a young woman or child and then pretend to be drowning, reverting to its natural form when a person approaches.",
			"",
			"Selkies are solitary for most of their lives. Males and females come together briefly during their spring mating season, and thereafter each female finds a secluded cave or beach to birth a single pup, which is abandoned after 2 to 3 years. Younger selkies then form packs with others of their kind until they can strike out on their own. Some selkies live among humanoids to assuage their loneliness, and may marry land dwellers. Offspring from these marriages resemble their non-selkie parents but have a yearning for the sea."

			"Even though the Age of Serpents has long since passed, serpentfolk reclaimers have retained a small fraction of the psychic magic over which their people once held mastery. Serpentfolk claim they once shared a powerful psychic connection with their god, Ydersius. Though that connection has grown weaker since the fall of their patron deity, reclaimers now hold sway over spirits and the dead, a consequence of Ydersius's half-living state. As such, a reclaimer can use psychic magic to affect undead that are normally immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"Serpentfolk reclaimers are determined to restore both their empire's former glory and the potent psychic magic their people once wielded, and have long moved past any squeamishness about how they accomplish their goals. They find the degeneration of their kind deeply offensive, and perform occult experiments on their degenerate kindred, attempting to uplift them to greater intelligence. These procedures usually kill their subjects, or drive them mad, but the reclaimers consider this a small price to pay - their kin's degenerate state is humiliation beyond imagining, and those who die in a reclaimer's attempts to elevate them are spared the agony of such a wretched existence. Some reclaimers seek to make mental contact with the still-living head of Ydersius, hoping to revive him or merge their psyches with his, perhaps giving him the psychic strength to reinstate the connection he once had with his people. Some adherents, however, believe their god's fleshless state is an evolution in his existence, and that his mind is now free of physical restraints.",
			"",
			"Many serpentfolk see reclaimers as paragons of their kind, and are eager to aid them in rebuilding the great civilization they lost. Others, however, distrust reclaimers due to the contempt in which they hold their degenerate kinfolk, as well as their willingness to spend the lives of those they consider their inferiors.",
			"",
			"Reclaimers are too few in number to risk their lives needlessly. They prefer to beguile, confuse, and enthrall their opponents whenever they can, turning their foes into their unwilling allies. If forced to fight, they let undead allies or degenerate serpentfolk take the brunt of the attack, fleeing if they feel they are in danger. When cornered, they are ruthless, for their poisonous bite saps their foes' strength, allowing the reclaimer to finish them off with less risk to itself.",

			"A serpentfolk spy monitors activity in surface settlements, noting authority figures, defenses, and those who could be bribed or coerced into serving the serpentfolk empire. While most serpentfolk spies describe their professions in terms of analyzing weaknesses and preparing for the eventual large-scale assault on the surface world, the truth is that many spies (and their masters) have immediate goals in mind. Spies often stake out powerful priests and arcanists, posing as fellow scholars or simple servitors, in order to gain access to knowledge and arcane lore not readily available in their subterranean caverns. Given their long life spans and reptilian patience, these individuals may infiltrate an organization and stay implanted there for years, waiting for a choice artifact or tome to present itself. Once it does, the spy absconds with the relic and retreats back to the serpentfolk city of its paymasters-killing any warmbloods who stand in its way."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Avistani naturalists named this creature serpopard because they saw it as possessing features of both a leopard and a serpent, though this creature is also widely known by its Osiriani name sedja, meaning \"one who travels from afar.\" Serpopards earn this appellation because of their supernatural ability to leap from one dune to another, an ability they call \"one who travels from afar.\"",
			"",
			"Some scholars speculate that the pharaohs of old bred this ability into the serpopards in order to create scouts and messengers able to cross the harsh terrain of their vast empires quickly and efficiently, but this creature is not one that has been created or influenced by humankind. Though rare, serpopards are naturally occurring beasts native to the deserts of northern Garund. Superstitious folk who believe that the gods' hands touch everything beneath the blistering Osirian sun see the serpopard as a cursed creature, marked with snakelike features by Apep and forced to wander eternally through the desert, never to find rest or sanctuary. On the other hand, carvings on ceremonial plates, on uncovered artifacts, and in ruined temples make it clear that the god-kings of Ancient Osirion once kept serpopards as pets or servants, as depictions of these creatures in the oldest of Osirion's ruins often show them chained or collared, bowing obediently to human masters.",
			"",
			"Serpopards stand approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulder; when their necks are fully extended, they can measure up to 20 feet long from nose to tail. Serpopards weigh anywhere from 150 to 200 lbs.",
			"",
			"Though serpopards are most common in the deserts of northern Garund, travelers in such far-off locales as the Meraz Desert in Qadira, the Cinderlands of Varisia, and the vast expanse of Shaguang in Tian Xia to the east have spotted creatures matching the serpopards' description. Some sages hypothesize that the most powerful or ancient serpopards can cross greater distances with their dune step ability, and thus travel through it to distant deserts across Golarion. Such experts say it's therefore likely that all deserts hold populations of serpopards, though they may be few in number or very isolated.",
			"",
			"Serpopards are largely nocturnal, preferring to hunt at night when they can use the cover of darkness to approach prey undetected. When hunting, they rely on their speed and powerful claws to take down large quarry, and then use the additional reach provided by their unusually long necks to defend their kills from scavengers and competing hunters. Serpopards are not averse to eating intelligent beings, and hunt humanoids if the opportunity or need arises, but they aren't cruel; serpopards gain no pleasure from such acts beyond the satisfaction of a fresh meal.",
			"",
			"On average, serpopards have a lifespan of about 50 years, but rumors exist of serpopards living much longer than this. One town along the northern coast of Rahadoum claims a single serpopard has visited its outskirts once every decade for the past 100 years.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Serpopards are mainly solitary creatures. Very rarely do they travel in pairs, and then only during mating season or in the case of littermates who chose not to separate at adulthood. When living as mated pairs, the father stays only until the cubs are able to run, but the mother stays with the cubs much longer, teaching them how to hunt and use their special ability to travel between the dunes. Mothers also pass on to the cubs their understanding of the land, instructing them as to which areas are good for hunting or exploring, what kinds of places to avoid, and how to find fresh water. Young serpopards separate from their mother individually, leaving as soon as they mature and feel confident navigating their way through the desert alone.",
			"",
			"When traveling, serpopards range anywhere from 50 to 100 miles per day, stopping only to hunt, rest, or (more rarely) explore some aged ruin. No one knows what fascination these ancient works hold for the serpopards, but the creatures' interest in such locations is undeniable. An old poem involving serpopards claims that the creatures visit these ancient ruins because they are pining for the lost empire of Ancient Osirion.",
			"",
			"Serpopards are clever liars and frustrating conversationalists, and hold a reputation among other races as skilled deceivers. In rural parts of Osirion, those with a gift for deception are often said to have \"the tongue of a sedja,\" while young children caught in a lie are warned that their \"necks are growing\" with each lie they tell. Despite this potential untrustworthiness, many people still seek the aid of serpopards. Few creatures know the deserts of Osirion as well as serpopards, and for the right price many are willing to guide groups of people across the desert. It's usually best to ensure the serpopard is well fed before undertaking such a journey, however, for a hungry serpopard may turn on its traveling companions if it thinks it can make a quick meal out of them. Serpopards have little use for gold and rarely accept it as payment for their services, though some apparently take a liking to jewelry, as travelers report the creatures as frequently wearing necklaces and bracelets when encountered. Food and hospitality are always acceptable payments, for those two things are in short supply in the harsh expanse of the desert. For those wishing to earn a serpopard's true faith and loyalty, however, one form of compensation stands above all others-divination magic. Serpopards are unceasingly curious about what their futures hold, and put great stock in the words of those who can tell fortunes or predict events to come.",
			"",
			"Serpopards attack most sphinxes on sight, often fighting at least long enough to get in a few solid blows before retreating between the dunes to safety. The only exception to this is androsphinxes, which most serpopards fear for some unknown reason. Only the bravest or most desperate serpopards face down such creatures in combat without aid; most flee immediately once they spot these mighty sphinxes. Sphinxes are aware of this antipathy and treat serpopards accordingly. Perhaps as a consequence of their antipathy toward sphinxes, serpopards also hate riddles and word games, and prefer to twist their words with lies and omissions rather than making a game out of conversation. Ignorant travelers who confuse the two creatures and try to engage the serpopard in a bout of riddling can find themselves in a dangerous predicament."

			"In the days of Ancient Osirion, when temples to the old gods still stood throughout the nation, worshipers of Set protected their places of worship with imposing constructs.

The headpiece would then be lacquered a glossy black, and set with expensive gemstones indicative of the type of elemental spirit used to animate the construct. After the headpiece was crafted, the preserved desert giant would be decapitated and the headpiece affixed to its shoulders.",
			"",
			"The towering constructs stood within the sanctuaries of Set's great temples across the empire, and were often posted at the temple's exterior doors when the faithful were called to worship. The laity always assumed that the constructs were undead servants crowned with metal helms of their god, and the clergy did nothing to disabuse them of this conceit. Indeed, adventurers often make the same mistake. Opponents can use Knowledge (religion) to identify a Set guardian's true nature and learn about the construct's unholy weaknesses.",
			"",
			"During the dark decades of Hakotep's reign, the guardians were a common - and for many, terrifying - sight, for the pharaoh used them as tools to threaten and cow the priesthoods of cults opposed to his religious reforms favoring Set. Today, these constructs have fallen out of favor in ecclesiastical circles-few of the modern cults employ them, though a couple of the surviving temples formerly dedicated to Set still boast one of these giant wardens. Most encounters with Set guardians today are reported by archaeological parties exploring lost temples or the tombs of long-buried nobles who had some devotion to the god in life.

			"Clerics of Set wishing to create more powerful constructs to guard their temples experimented with many different methods and finally came upon a process that resulted in the creation of an elevated Set guardian. These constructs went through a preservation process that utilized more expensive materials than those of the standard guardian, and were animated with two separate elemental spirits. Such constructs can be identified by two different gems (matching the two spirits that animate them) fitted into their headpieces. An elevated Set guardian can also be animated with two elemental spirits of the same type, though the construct is easily mistaken for a standard Set guardian because its gemstone eyes are the same color.",
			"",
			"Elevated Set guardians are at least CR 15, have the advanced creature simple template, and their elemental conduit ability is keyed to two different energy types.

Explorers report that seeing a sha's eyes glowing in the dark night is often the only indication of an impending attack.

Standing at chest height to most humans, shas weigh between 100 and 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"When alone, a sha spends its days trekking the vast wastelands of the desert, prowling among lost monuments of ancient times. While wandering the deserts, shas attack small convoys or groups of nomads along the desert fringes. Using their innate ability to conjure sandstorms, shas close in on the unsuspecting groups and try to bite as many different enemies as possible, then retreat before their foes can regroup. By doing this, the shas ensure that survivors return to civilization mad with disease and then spread the sickness to others or act on their insane urges.",

A shadow collector can also steal a living corporeal creature's shadow with the steal combat maneuver; the shadow doesn't count as fastened to its owner. Until the shadow is returned, the victim has no shadow or reflection and gains 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels can't be removed otherwise, even with magic that usually removes negative levels. When a shadow collector steals a shadow, it gains 2 shadow points. A shadow collector must expend 1 shadow point to use any of its spell-like abilities. A shadow collector generally begins an encounter with 1d3+1 shadow points. A shadow collector can release a stolen shadow as a standard action. A creature can touch the shadow collector to regain its stolen shadow, as long as the shadow collector is helpless or dead.

Though not as intelligent as an average human, shaghals are cunning creatures that work with one another to chase down prey, and they are smart enough to understand complex orders from their handlers. Shaghals don't have the ability to speak, but they can understand the languages of fiends. Those who converse with shaghals via telepathy report that the creatures communicate morose and fatalistic messages, and that their only wish is to witness and partake in death and ruin.",

When shaghals encounter packs of jackals, they intimidate and cow them, bringing the animals under their influence. Shaghals bolster the confidence of these otherwise cowardly beasts, and take over control of their packs in order to lead them to remote villages, protected oases, and even defended settlements to terrorize the humanoid populaces.",
			"",
			"With each step, ash and dust fall from shaghals' coats like dander, and the beasts can cough forth clouds of this grime to incapacitate their enemies. As servitors of daemons, shaghals spread disease, hunger, death, and savagery wherever they go. While they are most plentiful in the wastelands of Abaddon, shaghals may occasionally find themselves on the Material Plane, where they doggedly hunt down mortals. They believe, falsely, that the souls of all the mortals they kill and devour are sent directly to Abaddon."

During this time, the shalkeshka regains hit points at a rate of 5 hit points per hour. While in this state, the creature can't move, doesn't have to eat or drink, and is considered flat-footed for the first full round of combat if interrupted from its dormancy.",
			"",
			"**Pit Surge (Ex)** A shalkeshka can burrow into dirt, sand, or loose soil to lie in ambush 30 feet beneath the surface. It monitors the area above it using tremorsense, awaiting a victim's movement into the area. When it detects prey, the shalkeshka can surge to the surface as a standard action and make a single bite attack. This action creates a 30-foot-deep pit where the shalkeshka was laying in wait. All creatures standing in the area above must succeed at a DC 18 Reflex save to jump to safety in the nearest open space to the edge of the newly formed pit. Creatures that fail this Reflex save fall into the pit, taking damage as normal. The pit's walls have a climb DC of 25. The shalkeshka (along with any creature it may have grappled) can stay above ground by making a successful saving throw, or voluntarily fall back into the pit. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A dangerous nuisance in northern Garund, a shalkeshka is a strange burrowing predator that inhabits fertile soil near rivers, oases, and (most destructively) farmland. This creature's anatomy is reminiscent of an insect or some sort of lizard, and when burrowing it tears into the earth with its claws, swimming through sand and soil. Since the creatures spend most of their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.",
			"",
			"Squat and powerfully built, a shalkeshka stands only 5 feet tall, but is 8 feet wide and weighs almost 2,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although shalkeshkas are predators, they have a unique ability to derive nutrition from the ground itself if unable to find prey. This serves the creatures well in the lands of northern Garund, where desert travelers are few and far between and the harsh sun and unforgiving terrain keep roaming fauna to a minimum. While burrowed, a shalkeshka can enter a state of hibernation wherein it can sustain itself by absorbing minerals from the soil. A shalkeshka absorbs nutrients through the tufts of hair distributed across its long body, each of which is capable of leeching valuable sustenance from the very ground. This method of feeding can sustain a shalkeshka for extended periods of time-anywhere from a few hours to weeks, or even years-without the need to hunt. A shalkeshka breaks its hibernation only when it senses prey or during the rare times it succumbs to the urge to reproduce.",
			"",
			"A shalkeshka's bristly hairs also serve as one of the creature's sensory organs, allowing it to sense subtle vibrations in the ground. Its compound eyes provide it with excellent vision, and the third eye on the center of its forehead enables it to see in even the darkest of lighting conditions. Its enhanced senses ensure that a shalkeshka remains a constant threat to those who intrude on its territory, regardless of time of day or whether its prey is above or below ground.",
			"",
			"A shalkeshka ambushes its prey with impressive speed, bursting from beneath the sand and snatching unwary foes with its mandibles. Once engaged in combat, a shalkeshka fights with unrestrained ferocity. When it encounters groups of prey while hunting, a shalkeshka burrows beneath the ground to stealthily follow them until a member splits off from the group. The shalkeshka then emerges, grabs the straggler, and dives back into the sand to devour its newly acquired meal. If unable to snag its target, a shalkeshka remains above ground until it has subdued or slain its prey. They are powerful creatures, but lack the intelligence to make strong tactical decisions when it comes to engaging a target. However, if the tide of battle turns against a shalkeshka, it doesn't hesitate to burrow away to safety.",
			"",
			"Shalkeshkas can live for over 300 years, though most of this time is spent hibernating underground. Shalkeshkas experience periods of fertility only a few times in their lives, during which they lay their eggs in hidden tunnels in the desert. Shalkeshkas stay near their eggs during the yearlong incubation period, sometimes even letting prey pass by untouched in order to conceal the eggs' location. In rare circumstances, however, a pair of shalkeshkas that are both about to lay their eggs will tolerate each other's presence, instinctually recognizing the need for extra defense during the process. Such mutual defenses are dangerous for other intruders in the region, as the two shalkeshkas can then work together to bring down larger prey.",
			"",
			"Once the young hatch, they emerge from their leathery eggs in a larval stage that lasts for a year, culminating in a cocoon stage. During their larva stage, shalkeshkas subsist solely on nutrients in the soil as their mature mouthparts have yet to form. Shalkeshkas feel little kinship with their broodmates and soon begin splitting off from the group. As the cocoon stage nears, the parent shalkeshkas leave the area, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Any shalkeshkas still living in close proximity to their broodmates when they reach adulthood often cannibalize their siblings in great burrowing clashes until only one or two shalkeshkas hunt in the immediate vicinity.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Many wandering shalkeshkas travel throughout the great deserts of Osirion, stopping only once they have claimed a lush territory for themselves. Though they can live in the deepest desert, shalkeshkas prefer territory with a source of water, for prey is more plentiful there, and while lying in wait enjoy the abundant nutrients in the soil; the creatures are notorious for setting ambushes near riverbanks or in oases. A single small oasis can sustain a shalkeshka for its entire life.",
			"",
			"When adult shalkeshkas encounter each other, violence soon follows. A shalkeshka that has claimed a territory defends it to the death against intruding shalkeshkas seeking to claim it; these vicious fights often leave both opponents injured. Shalkeshkas also frequently battle ankhegs, as they often share similar environments. Many a caravan has had to alter its path after happening upon a clash between these two burrowing beasts.",
			"",
			"These are not the only times a desert caravan must be watchful of shalkeshkas. The creatures grow most aggressive when far from fertile soil, and a train of packed camels and their riders driving across the desert serves as an enticing meal for shalkeshkas in nutrientpoor lands. These attacks inspired the Osirian saying \"claimed by the shalkeshka,\" which is used to describe someone who has gone suddenly missing or a caravan contract that never pans out."

			"",
			"Shamblers are frighteningly stealthy in their native environments. Blending in with the surrounding terrain, they can lie in wait for days on end without moving, waiting patiently for a potential meal. A shambler could be almost anywhere at any time, attacking without warning and not caring whether it leaves any survivors, so long as it acquires its next meal.",
			"",
			"Shambling mounds normally lead solitary, nomadic existences in deep forests and fetid swamps, although they can also be found underground living among damp fungal thickets. Disturbing rumors persist, however, of shamblers gathering in strange congregations around great earthen mounds in the depths of marshes and jungles, often during the height of violent electrical storms. Their reasons for doing so are unknown, and many sages have wondered whether there is some obscure and alien purpose at work."

It then uses the intense cold generated from this heat absorption to trap its prey. A shasalqu is 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.",
			"",

This could account for shasalqus' ability to sap heat from their surroundings even after they die. Because of their sandy environs and the drops of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus' bodies are often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus are often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a distance - a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret.",
			"",
			"Shasalqus who settle near oases make their lairs far enough away to escape immediate notice, allowing them to sneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreat to their lairs with little risk. Shasalqus that find a trade route within their territory also digs lairs far enough away to prey on travelers without betraying their presence.",
			"",
			"Regardless of their locations, shasalqu lairs are often extremely damp since the desert's heat melts the accumulated ice that crusts on the creatures' hides. This makes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety of mosses and plants, especially those that can withstand colder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become too mossy and cool for shasalqus, forcing them to leave in search of new dens. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple dens within their territory and rotate between them."

The ink cloud persists for 2 rounds before dispersing. A shell sentinel can create a poison cloud like this no more than once per minute.",
			"",
			"**Sense the Masters (Su)** Every shell sentinel has the ability to sense the presence and direction of its creator, others of its creator's race, and any creatures that are under its creator's magical control (although not those controlled by others of the creator's race). Most shell sentinels were created by aboleths, but the secret of their construction has been stolen and used by other aquatic races. A shell sentinel never attacks its creator, others of its creator's race, or creatures magically controlled by its creator, unless it is attacked first or its creator gives it direct orders that countermand this. A shell sentinel's locate creature spell-like ability functions only to divine the location of these creatures, and is not blocked by running water.",
			"",
			"**Sharpened Edges (Su)** A shell sentinel's component shells are supernaturally sharp. In addition to being the source of its talons' enhanced threat range and bleed effect, these edges give the creature a dangerous defense. Each time a creature damages a shell sentinel with a natural weapon or attempts to grapple it, the creature takes 1d4 points of slashing damage; if the creature takes the maximum amount of damage from the sharpened edges, it also takes 1 point of bleed damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Shell sentinels are constructs designed specifically for use by the veiled masters or by those talented slaves with whom the veiled masters deign to share their secrets. These constructs often serve aboleths, skum, faceless stalkers, and cults of dominated humanoids as guardians, particularly of captured prisoners or other living victims. Unlike constructs whose traditions are mired in humanoid magical tradition, the typical shell sentinel appears more like a streamlined froglike creature with flippers instead of feet and a set of four talons on stalks in place of a head. A shell sentinel is composed entirely of razor-sharp shells, and the binding matrix that holds its form together and gives it its rudimentary but foultempered intelligence is a slithery black sludge distilled from the rotted flesh of unwanted slaves. The methods of extracting and preparing this slime requires living victims, and the decidedly painful and vile rendering process not only poisons the resulting construct's personality with an appetite for misery and cruelty, but also imbues poison into its form. Contact with this toxin, which runs throughout a shell sentinel's form, causes intense pain and clouds the minds of living creatures unfortunate enough to be subjected to it.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The veiled masters of the aboleths built the first shell sentinels, but the method of their creation has been hard to keep secret because of the common practice of teaching the formulas to talented slaves. When such slaves are rescued, they often craft shell sentinels for others. As a result, it's not uncommon to find shell sentinels serving tribes of gillmen or merfolk-while these constructs are petty and vile in temperament, their inability to harm those who share the race of their creators makes them unusual but safe guardians for many tribes.",
			"",
			"Shell sentinels can easily cross between marine and freshwater environments, and given proper protections can even endure in hostile liquid environments such as acid. Out of the water, shell sentinels can function, yet they lose their ability to create poison clouds and can move about only with an awkward flopping motion - as a result, they tend to stay submerged at all times.",
			"",
			"Sometimes shell sentinels lose their original purpose following many years of inactivity. Typically, this is the fate of shell sentinels that happen to outlive their creators. After several decades of idleness, the constructs might abandon their assigned tasks and begin to wander, staking out their own territories and attacking any creatures that enter these arbitrary domains. Especially talented spellcasters can attempt to gain control over these rogue constructs if they have the Craft Construct feat, but doing so requires the targeted shell sentinel to be restrained (or to otherwise be made a willing participant) for the 1d4 days it takes to imprint a new \"creator\" into the construct's primitive mind. This process requires the expenditure of 2,000 gp in resources and, at the end of the 1d4 days, a successful DC 20 Spellcraft check. If the spellcaster fails this check, she can attempt it once more, provided she spends the time and resources again.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"A shell sentinel's body consists of 200 pounds of shells, each of which must be polished and ground so that its edges are as sharp as razors. The shells must then be laid out in a pattern roughly corresponding to the creature's final shape, and then anointed with a thick and vile necromantic reduction from the living flesh of a creature afflicted with the slime of an aboleth or of a veiled master. Other rarer alchemical reagents can be substituted for this reduction (such substitutes are required if the creator wishes the final construct to be nonevil). The entire process must take place while submerged in water, and the total cost of the components is 2,000 gp.",

As the devotion of a captain to his ship compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Water sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of Water, see boats as perversions enabling landlubbers' insistence on venturing where they do not belong. These water spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the water spirit at the helm claims victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring.",
			"",
			"A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds.",
			"",
			"Model ships in bottles stand prominently on shelves in the quarters of captains and admirals, usually made to perfectly replicate their creators' ships. Once brought to life by a water spirit, a ship in a bottle maneuvers through the air on waves of mist. The strings of its miniature ballistae winch with enough tension to fire, and the water spirit turns a tribute into something that is both a weapon and a parody at once.",
			"",
			"Not all ships in bottles are captained willingly. Captains or admirals who desire more dramatic tributes to the ships they have commanded sometimes have mundane ships in bottles seemingly brought to life via magic. Through either great devotion or greater gold, they gain access to the magic necessary to bind water spirits to their model ships. The magic binding a water spirit to a ship in a bottle also enchants the elemental spirit into believing it is the captain and crew of a typical vessel. Magically bound water spirits follow the orders of either the caster who bound them or the maker of the ship in a bottle, treating him or her as their admiral.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A ship in a bottle's life is on the high seas, and its water spirit captain sets sail toward the nearest body of water. Its mission is to seek and destroy land creatures on the seas, and tales of ships in bottles' voyages rarely speak of glory. When a ship in a bottle manages to survive long enough to log journeys, what can be extrapolated from its miniscule logbook makes for fascinating insight into the elemental mind. The ways in which the water spirit captain justifies the world as seen from its viewpoint reads like a mix of mythology and a child's bathtime story.",
			"",
			"The spirit inhabiting this construct determines the nature of the crew and replicates tiny sailors on deck. These are solely to unnerve onlookers, as the spirit operates the ship in a bottle's sails and weaponry hydraulically. A water spirit magically bound to a ship in a bottle agains its will often crews the vessel with manifested sailors based on the bottle's owner, or his descriptions of the original ship's crew.",
			"",
			"A ship in a bottle sails alone only when it has no other choice, and usually welcomes the opportunity to join, form, or lead a fleet with other water spirits, flying tiny flags designed seemingly at random. Usually unbound water spirits captain all the ships in a bottled armada, although sometimes an unbound water spirit takes advantage of naive bound water spirits.",
			"",
			"A chance meeting between individual ships in bottles is not the only manner in which fleets form. Water spirits sometimes conspire to commandeer multiple ships in bottles together, and nautical museums have reported dozens of ships in bottles flying off shelves and out to sea.",

			"",
			"A ship in a bottle can be created through a binding ritual undertaken by a powerful spellcaster. The ritual requires a masterwork model ship in a bottle that must be built from materials worth 100 gp, and DC 30 Craft (woodworking) skill checks made over 2 consecutive weeks.

When the area of a bottled shipyard is entered, the haunt animates a ship in a bottle (using the stats on the facing page) each round for as many rounds as there are ships in bottles to animate (usually 1d6+1). Although any ship in a bottle that the haunt animates can be attacked and destroyed as a creature, only positive energy used against the constructs damages the haunt. Destruction A model ship animated by the haunt but not destroyed must be caught, brought to a large body of water, and released to sail the seas."

It can only detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact with the ship, even if they are within the ability's 100-foot radius.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ship sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship's captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel's crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics.",
			"",
			"A ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"A ship sentinel's form is carved and shaped by skilled woodworkers, but cannot truly be brought to \"life\" without offerings from the sea. Most spellcasters who endeavor to create these guardians crush a mixture of sand, shells, and valuable pearls and mix it with saltwater and oils, creating a grainy varnish. The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain.",
			"",
			"Although resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ship sentinels are solitary creations, and a single construct is capable of defending even the largest of ships. Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard - though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets.",
			"",
			"In combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind - usually a spear, rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain.",
			"",
			"Ship sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their construction also makes them vulnerable to fire - their greatest weakness - and any magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile brittleness.",
			"",
			"### Variant Ship Sentinels",
			"",
			"Ship sentinels can be crafted in a wide variety of forms and are often embellished and customized similarly to mundane figureheads. The following are some of these constructs' most common customizations.",
			"",
			"**Ballista Marksman:** Some ship sentinels have a light ballista built into their forms; these sentinels are usually designed to look like an archer with an oversized bow, a beauteous lillend, or a cruel erinyes. Such ship sentinels rarely have a melee weapon, resorting instead to slams if unable to use their ballistae to make ranged attacks. Statistics for ballista marksmen are modified as follows: Ranged light ballista +12 (3d8 plus salted wound /19-20). See [here](rule/siege_engines_uc) for additional details on siege engines.",
			"",
			"**Mariner's Muse:** Sculpted to resemble harp-playing angels or armored heralds, a mariner's muse ship sentinel can use the inspire courage effect of a bard's bardic performance once per day for 5 rounds as if it were a 5th-level bard. It always uses all 5 rounds of its performance at the same time and can never use the performance multiple times in 1 day for any duration.",
			"",
			"**Sea Sorcerer:** These ship sentinels are often crafted to resemble wizards, sea serpents, or abstract orrery-like sculptures, and possess limited spell-like abilities. They can only use these abilities while onboard a sailing vessel. These spell-like abilities can each be used 3 times per day, and include animate objects, grease, and obscuring mist.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"A ship sentinel is built from 400 pounds of wood. The creator or a hired artisan must then shape the creature into the desired likeness, usually after a fashion common to the nautical vessels of the region. Afterward, a special varnish is made from a mixture of sand, seawater, crushed pearls and shells, and magically treated oils - the varnish is worth a total of 250 gp and is applied to the entire form.

			"**Container (Ex)** A shipmind dwells within an immobile container of partially organic material grown by its Dominion masters. This container functions somewhat like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness 10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to the shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind container makes it vulnerable to shatter spells, and sonic damage bypasses the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.",
			"",
			"**Immerse (Ex)** When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence damage - a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Limited Mobility (Ex)** Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the shipmind as its \"skin.\" While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level per hour.",
			"",
			"**Plasma Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals 10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.",
			"",
			"**Ship Interface (Ex)** As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via clairaudience/clairvoyance for as long as the shipmind concentrates. While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the walls.",
			"",
			"**Thought Disruption (Su)** The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"The enigmatic shipminds are painstakingly engineered creations of Dominion fleshfarms, molded and formed over the course of years to pilot the massive organic spacecraft the aliens use to navigate the Dark Tapestry.",
			"",

			"",
			"A shipmind resides within a specially designed containers on a craft, connected to the ship's greater workings via varying forms of physical interface. These oozes generally follow orders from superiors stationed on their spacecraft, though coaxing is sometimes necessary in order to get these strange creatures to follow direct orders. This is due in part to the fact that these engineered creatures are fanatically devoted to the Dominion's inscrutable faith, with rigid beliefs regarding orthodoxy. Rumors persist of especially radical shipmind oozes going beyond defiance and actually slaying their passengers, a task made frightfully easy due to the mastery each ooze has over every aspect of its spacecraft's function (such as life support and internal security appendages and creatures). Some have been known to plunge their vessel into a star or black hole in moments of defiance or religious ecstasy, leaving the rest of the ship's crew helpless and unable to convince the shipmind to abandon its actions.",
			"",
			"As a shipmind reaches more advanced age, it becomes increasingly pedantic and difficult to control. Such oozes often demand small offerings, sacrifices of lesser creatures, or the powering down of ship's systems they deem superfluous or \"unpure.\" At a certain point, the shipmind is recycled, poured from its container into vats to serve as nutrients for the cultivation of a replacement. Fragments of the previous shipmind's intellect and skills carry over into the newly created ooze, ensuring that a sort of entrenched memory and institutional knowledge persist through the generations.",
			"",
			"### Deteriorating Shipmind (CR -1)",
			"",
			"In cases where a shipmind isn't recycled in time, as often happens in abandoned ships or in cases where a Dominion crew neglects the shipmind for too long, a shipmind can begin to deteriorate while still within its container. Deteriorated shipminds are sometimes encountered on Dominion drop ships after the vessel has landed on a planet and been left to rot. In such cases, the shipmind slowly goes insane, serving almost as a sort of living haunt within the decaying ship and bringing madness and pain to any creatures exploring its decks. Most deteriorating shipminds survive for only a few years, or a decade at most - in the majority of cases, the Dominion drop ship decays into filth and sludge long before then.",
			"",
			"A shipmind that is deteriorating has slightly different statistics than the typical shipmind. You can create stats for one of these shipminds by applying the deteriorating shipmind simple template to the statistics above. The quick rules and rebuild rules for a deteriorating shipmind are the same.",
			"",
			"Quick/Rebuild Rules: -2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and to special ability DCs. The shipmind's container is broken and has only 120 hit points. A deteriorating shipmind can only use its plasma bolt once every other round, and gains negative levels at a rate of 1 per round immediately after it leaves its container."

			"These fabled four-armed giants are native to a low-gravity planet and renowned across several worlds for their ferocity in battle. Most shobhads are born and come of age in fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the \"soft living\" practiced by many other humanoid races - they believe the abandonment of nomadic culture is a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhadneh constantly vie for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor.",
			"",
			"Though considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other shobhads, and the Shobhad-neh see \"lesser\" races as little more than sheep to be culled.",
			"",
			"Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons in place. When they wear clothing, its either practical such as hide armor and wrappings that protect against biting sandstorms, or ceremonial like the brightly colored skins and feathers chieftains and shamans wear.",
			"",
			"Though shobhads can be found on occasion working as lone mercenaries in cities, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. Shobhad shamans preach that in human cities, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by no one. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-neither by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a shobhad is made truly immortal.",

A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and hesitant creature - but when several of them gather they become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own size.",
			"",
			"A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe.",
			"",
			"Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company. Kept in pairs or larger numbers, captive shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing electrical ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers who aren't themselves immune to electricity."

No creature met these requirements better than the shotalashu, large reptilian creatures that maintained a relatively high place in their ecosystem's food chain and yet were strangely receptive to the lashunta's initial friendly overtures. Once incorporated into lashunta society, the shotalashu and their riders quickly became iconic symbols of lashunta culture.",

Once linked, a shotalashu carries out the will of its rider effortlessly, often seeming to anticipate her desires and directions before she conveys them.",
			"",
			"While it's common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashu throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount for life. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashu who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years. Though they might accept other riders for short periods of time, the bereaved creatures don't seem to communicate as well until they have ceased grieving and bonded with a new rider, and might even be withdrawn and uncommunicative with other shotalashu during their grieving period.",

A shredskin may attack on its own and try to squeeze the life out of a living humanoid to use it as a body, or it might control another undead such as a skeleton, zombie, or ghoul, covering it like a morbid costume. In either case, it abandons its borrowed body if it finds a better one or the old one is destroyed. A shredskin is usually recognizable by creatures who knew it in life.",

			"",
			"When Runelord Alaznist first learned the art of fleshwarping from the qlippoth lord Yamasoth, she and her assistants created myriad abominations that have survived into the modern day. Among these wretched creations are the spider-like {monster/shriezyx}, which remain a constant threat to explorers venturing into the heart of Hollow Mountain, the ruins of Xin-Bakrakhan at the mountain's base, and the Irespan in the nearby city of Magnimar. While shriezyx made excellent soldiers and guardians, they made poor servants, in part because of their unnatural fear of fire (a particular problem for Alaznist's armies and devotees, who relied heavily on evocation magic). The same immunity to mental control that defended them against enchantments from the rival realm of Eurythnia also made them impossible to magically control by their own general. To solve this problem, Alaznist's skilled fleshwarpers created a superior version of the shriezyx - a queen that could serve as commander to lesser shriezyx and ensure complete loyalty among the verminous minions.",
			"",
			"A typical shriezyx queen is roughly 8 feet in length and weighs as much as 1,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although its name is something of a misnomer due to the shriezyx's method of asexual reproduction, a shriezyx queen nevertheless maintains a position among other shriezyx analogous to that of a bee or ant queen. Rather than existing to grow the hive, a shriezyx queen was instead created to control, command, and - when necessary - overpower lesser shriezyx. A shriezyx queen exudes a strong supernatural pheromone that calms her subjects, especially around fire. A shriezyx queen is also singularly capable of using mind-affecting effects on other shriezyx, to work them into a frenzy before a battle or to ensure their obedience.",
			"",
			"A shriezyx queen can use her incendiary webs to turn her fire vulnerability against enemies that may hope to employ flame against a shriezyx hive. Many alchemists and evokers have fallen victim to a shriezyx queen's oily webs when deploying fire attacks.",
			"",
			"Shriezyx queens are inveterate schemers, with intellects far superior to those of standard shriezyx. Although shriezyx queens use this intellect to protect their hive, they also work to obscure knowledge of their existence. Only the most learned Thassilonian scholars know that a queen caste exists above the common shriezyx. While dozens of shriezyx hives exist throughout western Varisia - most known to locals for the threat they pose - only the queen of the hive living at the base of Hollow Mountains has ever revealed herself to civilized peoples.",
			"",
			"A shriezyx queen refers to her hive as her brood, despite not being the genetic matriarch of the lesser members of her species. A queen replicates herself via asexual reproduction in the same manner a standard shriezyx does-with an unfertilized egg that produces an identical spawn - but she often keeps her dormant egg in a secure place deep in the heart of the hive's lair for centuries before it hatches. Thus, the number of shriezyx queens in existence at any time remains fairly static. Upon a queen's death, her hive generally turns feral or breaks up entirely before her replacement hatches from its well-hidden egg. The newly hatched queen retains some of the memories of her predecessor in the form of racial instincts to cultivate a hive, but she must spend the first dozen or more years of her life reuniting the remnants of her predecessor's brood. When a predecessor's hive has been entirely eradicated - such as in the wake of Earthfall or another cataclysm - the new queen instead seeks out all the dormant eggs she can find to revive the shriezyx from the brink of extinction.",
			"",
			"Larger and stronger than the average shriezyx, a queen requires more food and thus often sends her brood to hunt for her. All shriezyx have preternaturally variable metabolisms, which provide them rapid regeneration from wounds and also the ability to go long stretches with very little sustenance. A queen's appetite is as much a function of her role within the hive as it is her physiology, and even the smallest shriezyx queen appears corpulent when compared to her smaller minions.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Despite their influential role within hive society, shriezyx queens live solitary lives, forever unique among their kin. Two shriezyx queens rarely meet one another, each tasked by their design with managing disparate hives. Shriezyx queens limit contact with underlings, except to issue orders or to orchestrate attacks during times of open conflict with the hive's enemies. A queen spends her solitary hours stewing on her plots for returning her hive - or herself - to a position of prominence in the region, but she invariably produces convoluted, overwrought plans that she never finds the opportunity to act on.",
			"",
			"A queen that does interact with members of another species - whether they're allies of fallen Bakrakhan (normally demons, giants, or {monster/sinspawn}) or members of modern societies now living in or near the shriezyx's ruined lair - is likely to be quite verbose. After centuries of loneliness, most queens are overwhelmed by the idea of conversing with an intellectual equal, and they see such opportunities as a rare chances to implement long-delayed plans. Humanoids often find such conversations off-putting, both because the shriezyx are such horrific works of arcane mutation and because few adventurers would ever expect to encounter chatty monstrosities when exploring millennia-old ruins."

			"",
			"**Illusion Sense (Ex)** Shrike worms can sense illusion magic, rendering it less effective against them. A shrike worm gains a bonus on saving throws against illusion spells and effects equal to its Charisma bonus, and it does not need to examine or interact with an illusion in order to attempt a saving throw to disbelieve it.",
			"",
			"**Impale (Ex)** If a shrike worm begins its turn with a creature grappled with its tentacles, it can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check as a free action to try to impale the grappled creature on one of the spines on its back. If the shrike worm succeeds, the grappled creature takes 6d6+18 points of damage and is pinned. Once a creature is impaled, it loses the grappled condition and the shrike worm can use all of its tentacles without penalty. A shrike worm can have up to six Medium or smaller creatures impaled on its spikes at a time. An impaled creature can remove itself from a spine by succeeding at a combat maneuver or Escape Artist check as normal. A creature that is removed from a shrike worm spine (either by its own efforts, those of its allies, or magic) takes 3d6 points of bleed damage and is sickened for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Impossible Form (Su)** Any creature within 100 feet of the shrike worm that can see it must succeed at a DC 27 Will saving throw or become fascinated for as long as the creature remains within range of this ability. A creature that fails its save believes the shrike worm is a hallucination or an illusion; the shrike worm's approach does not constitute an obvious threat and does not break this fascination effect. The fascination effect ends as normal if the shrike worm attacks or interacts with the affected creature or its allies. A creature that saves against a shrike worm's impossible form aura is immune to it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Phantasmal Slime (Sp)** As a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a shrike worm can spew from its mouth a 30-foot cone of scintillating color that infects the minds of those it touches. This functions as per phantasmal web (DC 21), except that a creature that fails its save believes it is caught in threads of sticky, luminous slime infested with diminutive shrike worm larvae. The shrike worm can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. A creature that realizes the slime is illusory gains a +4 bonus on saves to resist subsequent uses of this ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Shrike worms are insidious creatures from the edges of reality, and are able to blur the boundary between what is real and unreal in order to take their prey by surprise. Also known as hallucination worms, they are most often called shrike worms due to the method by which they kill their prey. When a shrike worm catches a creature in its tentacles, it then impales its victim on its iridescent back spines, pinning the creature in place in order to prolong its prey's suffering as much as possible.",
			"",
			"Shrike worms grow to over 25 feet long and, despite weighing upward of 16,000 pounds, carry themselves about with surprising grace on their long legs. This lends their movements an unearthly quality, which is further enhanced by their magical abilities.",
			"",
			"Shrike worms are superficially similar to mundane velvet worms, though they are much larger and exhibit a cruel intelligence that their mundane cousins lack. Much like velvet worms can spray sticky slime to capture prey or fend off predators, shrike worms can emit phantasmal slime, which entangles and sickens the weak minded. Shrike worms use this ability when overwhelmed or surprised, trapping potential aggressors in their own delusions until the shrike worms can either regain the upper hand or flee.",
			"",
			"However, shrike worms' primary hunting tool is their bizarre appearance. Shrike worms are so strange looking and so suffused with illusion magic that they appear to be illusions to most creatures. The worms take advantage of this trait to keep potential prey from fleeing or attacking before the worms can move into an ideal attack position. A worm's victim realizes its error only in time to feel the worm's grasping tentacles lifting it toward the terrible spines along the creature's back.",
			"",
			"Much like shrikes, shrike worms impale their prey because they have trouble consuming fresh corpses. Their mouths are small and poorly adapted to chewing through skin and bone, so they impale their prey on their back spines and wait for it to decompose and soften. This can take some time, particularly as creatures may not die immediately upon being impaled - but the shrike worm is capable of going without food for long stretches of time and does not mind waiting for its dinner to ripen. Even when more palatable food is available, shrike worms prefer to hunt hardier creatures, for they savor the suffering that comes with the creatures' prolonged and painful deaths.",
			"",
			"Shrike worms do not reproduce sexually and have no gender. When a shrike worm achieves sufficient size, it splits itself, producing two identical offspring. These two spawn shrike worms are ravenous upon formation, and usually part ways so as not to compete for food as they mature. However, sibling shrike worms often seek each other out once they've reached adulthood, almost as though they feel incomplete in each other's absence.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Though they are often encountered alone due to their rarity, shrike worms are not overly solitary creatures. They seem to enjoy each other's company, although it isn't clear whether, or to what extent, they can communicate. Their fondness for company may be a matter of hygiene, as groups of shrike worms preen each other, picking pieces of bone and rotting flesh from the gaps in their carapaces. In this way, shrike worms display their social hierarchy, with the oldest and strongest worms being the recipients of the most attention from their peers.",
			"",
			"Shrike worms lair in remote places, often seeking out areas exposed to powerful or long-lasting illusions. For example, permanent hallucinatory terrain or large illusory wall effects attract shrike worms like moths to a flame. Shrike worms are also often found in areas afflicted by legacies of madness, such as abandoned insane asylums or villages destroyed by plagues of mental illness. Some believe that shrike worms are actually responsible for such bouts of insanity, claiming that repeated exposure to the sight of the impossible worms can shatter minds and drive people mad.",
			"",
			"While shrike worms enjoy each other's company a great deal, they treat almost all other creatures as mere food. They understand Aklo and are willing to deal with wicked fey or other powerful tricksters, but they never offer their services to such creatures for free. Those who wish to employ a shrike worm's abilities must pay, usually by providing the worm a steady supply of victims.",
			"",
			"Derros are an exception to this trend. As creatures of madness, derros attract shrike worms whenever they dwell in one place for too long or build large communities. While some shrike worms simply devour the derros en masse, cleverer worms take advantage of their ability to dominate the smaller creatures and instate themselves as false gods among the derros. These shrike worms use their illusory magic to answer their subjects' prayers and to relay their commands, and they tend to grow fat and lazy as the derros supply live sacrifices to placate their strange and impossible gods."

Proud and territorial, the disk-riders use their intimate understanding of astral forces to drive interlopers from their territory.",
			"",
			"Shulsagas live in a simple but far from primitive hunter society, based around drifting villages that float upon stray chunks of elemental detritus and astral protomatter. They often train the massive beasts of their native plane (such as astral leviathans) to pull and defend their unfettered homes. Because shulsagas endlessly face the deadly beings that travel the Astral Plane, most communities attack strangers rather than risking their lives trying to distinguish friends from foes. Shulsagas speak a raspy dialect of Auran.",
			"",
			"A shulsaga is born genderless. It reaches maturity when it's a century old, and can then will its body toward a gender it will have for the rest of its life. Shulsagas can live to be over 500 years old, but most die earlier in hunts or planar upheavals. They average 7 feet in height and weigh about 240 pounds. Many have levels in ranger or summoner."

A creature subjected to this telepathic wail must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Jaunt (Sp)** As a standard action, a misery siktempora can vanish into the time stream, reappearing in another location. This ability functions as {spell/dimension door} (so a typical misery siktempora can jaunt up to 880 feet), but the siktempora can take other actions that round after reappearing, and the destination must be in a location the siktempora could reach normally by walking. Temporal jaunts are not true teleportation - the misery siktempora simply travels to a later point in the time stream - so the ability can be used in areas that bar teleportation effects; however, in such areas a siktempora can travel only a distance equal to its speed.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Sense (Ex)** A misery siktempora can sense all the possible futures of the coming seconds. This grants it an insight bonus on its Initiative checks and to its Armor Class equal to its Wisdom bonus (+5 for most misery siktemporas). A misery siktempora born from someone who damaged the time stream can use {spell/discern location} at will as a spell-like ability to pinpoint its progenitor's location.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"All emotion goes somewhere; that energy does not simply vanish, sent into the void to be lost. Feelings lurch between places and congeal in the endless corners of time. The things they birth have many names, but are collectively known as siktemporas. Most siktemporas never leave the Dimension of Time, dwelling forever in their own isolated mindscape-like fugues, where they bask in the emotions that created them. Yet among the siktemporas, one variety has a penchant for traveling beyond the eerie borders of its home dimension - those born of misery.",
			"",
			"Misery siktemporas are personifications of silent suffering. Hideous to behold, wracked in such constant pain that they can endure any agony, and with alien minds incapable of forming any other thought apart from various forms of self-loathing and despair, misery siktemporas find themselves drawn out of the Dimension of Time to seek out those who spawned them and inflict miserable vengeance.",
			"",
			"A misery siktempora vaguely resembles a slender human with a body wrapped in black rags and scarfs. It has no arms, and its six exceptionally long spiderlike legs each end in a nearly skeletal looking claw. It has only empty black eye sockets in its narrow faces - no mouth, ears, or nose - and from those empty sockets trail constant rivers of black tears.",
			"",
			"Just as physical evidence of rot and decay can remain, staining the landscape, after a creature rises from death as undead, so to can its thoughts and emotions. These mental energies, not bound by physicality, can instead stain the time of death.",
			"",
			"Siktemporas can form in another way as well - when a mortal creature interferes with the flow of time, either by traveling back in time to create paradoxes or manipulate past events, or by attempting to move forward in time to eras yet unknown, the creature's passage can stain time with the full breadth of its emotional history. This causes the source creature no harm, but can result in the formation of dozens of siktemporas elsewhere on the Dimension of Time.",

			"**Family:** {family/Siktempora}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"On the Demiplane of Time, when enough of these \"emotional stains\" accumulate at one point in space and time, a siktempora can form. Those born of misery are the most common, for not only do misery and death often travel hand in hand, but alone among the siktemporas, miseries enjoy exiting their home dimension to travel the Material Plane. They have no intrinsic way of returning to the dimension of time, so for them this journey is one-way, but once they arrive, they seek only to spread their own misery.",
			"",
			"### Other Siktemporas",
			"",
			"Other types of siktemporas exist, but they are rare outside of the depths of the Dimension of Time and are almost always encountered when obscure spells or ancient rituals conjure them to other planes.",

			"**Compelling Knock (Su)** A waldgeist is preternaturally drawn to the sound of knocking on wood. If a waldgeist is within 15 feet of a creature that knocks on a wooden object (for example, a tree or an item primarily made of wood, such as a wooden shield), it must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or it is compelled to move toward the creature for as long as the knocking persists. While the waldgeist is moving toward the knocking creature, each time the waldgeist is attacked or is the target of a harmful effect, it receives a new saving throw. Once it is adjacent to the knocking creature, the waldgeist can act freely. Whether it succeeds at or fails its initial Will saving throw, a waldgeist is immune to that creature's knocking for 24 hours. Knocking on wood can draw a waldgeist out of a possessed tree, but not more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded area.",
			"",
			"**Lignify (Su)** When a waldgeist deals damage to a living non-plant creature with its incorporeal touch, it also deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as it begins to transform the target to wood. A creature reduced to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a nonmagical tree, as per the flesh to stone spell, but the wooden creature has hardness 5 and vulnerability to fire. In addition to stone to flesh, a restoration spell can reverse this effect.",
			"",
			"**Nature Dependent (Su)** A waldgeist cannot travel more than 50 feet from the edge of a forest or other large, wooded area. A waldgeist that is forced outside of this boundary is instantly destroyed. A waldgeist receives a +4 racial bonus on saving throws to resist teleportation or other effects that would force it outside of its forest.",
			"",
			"**Possess Tree (Su)** Once per minute as a standard action, a waldgeist can possess a Large or smaller nonmagical tree and animate it as if using animate objects, except the waldgeist merges with and controls the tree. The waldgeist cannot speak, move, or use its own attacks or special abilities while possessing the tree. When the tree is destroyed, or when the waldgeist ends the possession as a free action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the waldgeist appears in a square of its choice adjacent to the tree. (See below for an example of a tree animated in this way.)",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A waldgeist arises when a gnome who was a woodlands dweller or who had a deep spiritual connection with such an area dies while in a large forest. The gnome's spirit is twisted and bound to the trees, infused with hatred of living intruders and a need to protect the area that sustains it. A waldgeist appears as a translucent gnomelike figure surrounded by a faint, green glow, its facial features full of anger and malice.",
			"",
			"Waldgeists become incredibly violent when faced with creatures that intrude upon their homes or that they see as threats. In combat, waldgeists attack using the forest itself, entwining despoilers' legs with roots and vines, and animating nearby trees to smash intruders with thick branches. A waldgeist is typically 3-1/2 feet tall.",
			"",
			"Gnomes who exult in woodland life are often just as fascinated with new and exciting experiences within their demesnes as others of their kind. Unfortunately, given the dangers inherent in many primeval forests, such an outlook can be dangerous. When a woodland gnome's fanciful tree-climbing expeditions or unprepared sylvan explorations lead to disaster, sometimes her soul becomes heavy with melancholy and bitterness, and she arises again as a waldgeist. If a gnome's death can be blamed on an intruder-perhaps she was tracking an interloper when her fatal accident occurred-this undead fate is nearly assured.",
			"",
			"Though animated by negative energy, a waldgeist must constantly remain within its forest home to maintain its form. To a waldgeist, nothing exists outside of the forest in which it died. If it is somehow transported away from a wooded environment, it completely disintegrates with an anguished howl. A waldgeist's connection to the forest grants the spirit a measure of power over its surroundings, including the ability to possess trees and bring to them a measure of life.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because of the highly specific circumstances required for their formation, waldgeists are rare and found only in large, old-growth forests, where the trees grow tall enough to block out the sun. Even more rarely, a tragedy of unthinkable proportions happens to a group of gnomes, and multiple waldgeists arise simultaneously. When this happens, the spirits often drift away from one another to haunt separate areas of the forest. Waldgeists are solitary creatures, hiding their presences from the other creatures of the woods, especially fey such as dryads. Although both creatures exhibit a certain protective possessiveness over nature, dryads see the undead waldgeists' capacity for violence as terribly brutish.  ",
			"",
			"While waldgeists tend to shun forest natives, they hate and hunt down creatures they see as intruders in their woods. In reality, such individuals might be innocent travelers simply passing through the forest, or they may be loggers who pose a legitimate threat to the natural surroundings. To waldgeists, such distinctions are non-existent; they view any creatures not native to their homes as enemies. In battle, waldgeists are cunning. If a waldgeist faces a group of enemies, it tends to use its magic to enhance the surrounding foliage, entangling creatures with the plants that heed its call. While its enemies are distracted, the waldgeist then possesses the nearest tree and uses its branches to wreak havoc on any within its reach.  ",
			"",
			"Luckily for most adventurers, though, these wicked creatures can be easily distracted. Waldgeists are attracted to sound of knocking on wood, as it reminds them of the possibilities of interesting visitors, opening doors, or other things that once intrigued them in life. A waldgeist that fails to resist the temptation of this noise ceases its current actions in order to \"greet\" the knocker, even going as far as abandoning the tree it had been possessing. Usually, this allows the other individual whom the waldgeist was previously harassing a chance to escape. In rural communities near forests haunted by waldgeists, the practice of knocking on wood for luck arises from ancient tales of waldgeist encounters.  ",
