			"Frequently masters of divination and enchantment - which aid them in business dealings ranging from prospecting to negotiation - prophets of Kalistrade generally see magic as a means to an end rather than as a goal to be attained in and of itself. The accumulation of knowledge about magical artifacts, whether of arcane or divine power, is typically valued more in terms of how much such items can be sold for to the right buyer rather than for any scholarly purpose. Prophets take a similar view of just about everything in life, from their political and social alliances to the very jewelry and ornamentation they wear so proudly on their persons. The more value one can amass, the more power one can wield over those who value such splendor."

Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent in illumination to that of a torch for 1 round.",

			"Though most androids realize they are born of strange technology, few recall their birth into the world. They seek a better connection to themselves, and thus they eschew all technology and rely only on their own bodies and abilities to find their place in the world. These androids train their bodies and minds to forge themselves into weapons, and they rely on their training more than they make use of their nanite surge ability. They study the physical form of opponents and focus their attacks on the weak areas, grappling combatants and wrenching their limbs in ways calculated to break bone and inflict excruciating pain. Though many Numerian ascetics seek a path of enlightenment, they remain dangerous adversaries to those they cross in the barbaric lands of Numeria - especially the tyrants of the Technic League."
