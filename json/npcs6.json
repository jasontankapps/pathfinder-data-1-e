The accumulation of knowledge about magical artifacts, whether of arcane or divine power, is typically valued more in terms of how much such items can be sold for to the right buyer rather than for any scholarly purpose. Prophets take a similar view of just about everything in life, from their political and social alliances to the very jewelry and ornamentation they wear so proudly on their persons. The more value one can amass, the more power one can wield over those who value such splendor."
