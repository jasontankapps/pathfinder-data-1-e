To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to hear you. This effect persists as long as the enemy is within 30 feet and you use a move action each round to continue your doomsaying. This ability cannot cause a creature to become frightened or panicked, even if the target was already shaken from another effect. This is a mind-affecting fear effect that relies on audible components. At 15th level, continuing your doomsaying each round is a swift action instead.

			"",
			"*Dust to Dust (Su):* Once per day as a standard action, you can cause the weapons around you to shatter in their wielders' hands. When you use this ability, attempt a single sunder combat maneuver, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your Charisma modifier in place of Strength.

You take 1d4 points of fire damage when you activate this ability and again at the beginning of your turn until you end the effect. Any creature that begins its turn adjacent to you takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the fire spreads, plus 1 additional point of fire damage for each previous round you have had this ability active. For example, adjacent creatures take 1d6+5 points of damage if you have had this ability active for 5 rounds. You can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level, and you can end this ability as a free action. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use this ability one additional time per day.",

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.",

Whenever you confirm a critical hit against a creature (including with a melee, ranged, or spell attack), as a swift action you can curse the target of your attack, as the bestow curse spell, except the target doesn't receive a Will saving throw to negate the effects and spell resistance does not apply against this ability."

Additionally, it uses spells from the cleric spell list, not the magus spell list. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.",
			"",
			"*Rapid Convalescence (Su):* You reduce the number of consecutive successful saves needed to recover from a disease or poison by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

			"*Gift of Claw and Horn (Su):* As a swift action, you gain a natural weapon. The natural weapon lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your oracle level (minimum 1). You must choose a bite, claw, or gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a creature of your size. At 5th level, your natural weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. This bonus increases by +1 at 10th, 15th, and 20th level. At 11th level, you gain two natural weapons at a time. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"*Mantle of Moonlight (Su):* Your innate understanding of the moon renders you immune to the curse of lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt a lycanthrope's connection to the moon with a successful touch attack. This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into its humanoid form, in which it must remain for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use this ability to force others into a rage, as the spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for every 5 levels above 5th.",
			"",
			"*Moonbeam (Su):* You can fire a ray of moonlight as a ranged touch attack at any creature within 30 feet. This ray deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 for every 2 oracle levels you possess. In addition, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",
			"",
			"*Moonlight Bridge (Su):* You summon a bridge of moonlight. The 10-foot-wide span touches the ground at a point adjacent to you. It can extend from this point in any direction for 10 feet per oracle level. The path persists until you have crossed over the bridge or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. You may summon a moonlight bridge a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Should the bridge be attacked, treat it as a wall of force.",
			"",
			"*Moonlit Script (Su):* Once per night while you sleep, your hands produce mysterious writing that pertains to the future. At 1st level, the prophetic writing manifests as an augury spell with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, the writing takes the form of a divination with 90% effectiveness. At 8th level, the writing manifests as a casting of commune with no material component required.",
			"",
			"*Primal Companion (Ex):* You gain the service of a faithful animal of the night. You can select from a bear, boar, crocodile, shark, tiger, or wolf. This animal functions as a druid's animal companion, using your oracle level as your effective druid level.",
			"",
			"*Prophetic Armor (Ex):* You are so in tune with your primal nature that your instincts often act to save you from danger that your civilized mind isn't even aware of. You may use your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) as part of your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma, instead.",
			"",
			"*Touch of the Moon (Su):* The exact effects of this revelation depend on whether you cast inflict or cure spells. If you cast inflict spells, these spells carry with them the taint of madness. Subjects who take damage from your inflict spells are also subject to confusion, as the spell, except the duration of this effect is a number of rounds equal to the level of the inflict spell. The save DC against this effect is 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier. Alternatively, if you cast cure spells, these spells are potentially more effective but entirely in the target's mind. Whenever you cast a cure spell, you can cast it as though it were enhanced with the Empower Spell metamagic feat by expending two spell slots, except these hit points are temporary. This does not increase the level of the spell. Hit points healed this way expire after a number of minutes equal to half your oracle level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
			"",
			"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become an avatar of the primal world - part humanoid, part beast. Once per day, you can transform into a lycanthrope of your choice for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier, gaining all the powers of a natural lycanthrope of that type, including the ability to change shape between human, animal, and hybrid form. In addition, you become immune to mind-affecting and language-dependent effects, as well as effects that specifically target only humanoids."

			"*Steel Scarf (Su):* As a swift action, you can harden a scarf, sleeve, cloak, or other piece of your clothing into something as hard as steel that stretches out to be up to 30 feet long. You can then strike outward with it as if it were a weapon making a melee attack. For the purpose of this ability, you are proficient with this weapon. You can use the weapon to perform combat maneuvers. Make a melee attack roll against a creature within 30 feet; you may use {feat/Weapon Finesse} with this attack. If you hit, the weapon deals 1d8 points of slashing damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. After this attack, the clothing returns to its normal length and hardness. You do not threaten an area with this weapon and cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",

			"",
			"*Nature's Whispers (Ex):* You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.",
			"",
			"*Speak with Animals (Ex):* Choose a specific kind of animal (eagle, fox, dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse with that type of animal as if you were under the effects of speak with animal. You gain the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 oracle levels you have attained.",
			"",
			"*Spirit of Nature (Su):* When in a natural setting, whenever you are reduced to negative hit points, you automatically stabilize.

This effect acts as the spell polymorph any object, working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, it cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect.

			"",
			"*Return to Dust (Su):* You call upon the inexorable ravages of time and entropy to damage an object or undead creature within 30 feet, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 2 oracle levels you have, ignoring hardness and damage reduction. If used against an undead creature or an object in another creature's possession, the undead creature or the creature possessing the object can attempt a Reflex saving throw to halve the damage. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"*Spectral Spells (Su):* You gain {feat/Ectoplasmic Spell} as a bonus feat. In addition, once per day, you can cast a spell with the {feat/Ectoplasmic Spell} metamagic feat as a standard action that does not increase the level of the spell. You can use this ability one additional time per day at 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter.",
			"",
			"*Spirit Touch (Su):* As a standard action, you can touch one weapon to grant it the {magic-enhancement/ghost touch} special ability for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, you can spend two uses of this ability to grant it the ghost touch and [undead bane](magic-enhancement/bane) special abilities. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"*Terminal Aura (Su):* You gain an aura with a 10-foot radius; any creature within that has fewer than 0 hit points but is stable must succeed at a Will save or be affected by the spell {spell/bleed}. A dying creature within range of this aura does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize unless it succeeds at a Will save, but it can still be healed as normal. A creature with fast healing or regeneration must also succeed at a Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. You can suppress and resume this aura as a free action. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
			"",
			"*True Death (Su):* Those slain by your spells or by one of your attacks that deals negative energy becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring such a creature back from the dead using {spell/raise dead} or similar magic must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + your oracle level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. A successful casting of {spell/remove curse} (DC = 10 + your oracle level) before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead suppresses this effect for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"*Final Revelation:* Upon 20th level, you are a true reaper of death and no soul can escape your sight. You automatically confirm critical hits and creatures automatically fail Fortitude saves against your coup de grace attempts. In addition, you can notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if you had the blindsense ability. This sense does not allow you to detect objects, but it does allow you to notice living things that are not creatures."

This ability functions as shadow projection except as follows. Your shadow has the outsider type and the phantom subtype instead of the undead type. As a result, this ability does not have the evil descriptor and your shadow cannot be turned or affected as undead (though it can be affected as an outsider). You can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half your oracle level. These hours don't need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments.

Your solar wind deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 for every 2 oracle levels you possess.

The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a {rule/primal magic/ event} of a CR equal to your caster level.

In addition, the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",

A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 11th level and 15th level.

			"",
			"*Enhanced Cures (Su):* As per the life oracle mystery revelation of the same name.",
			"",
			"*Enhanced Inflictions (Su):* You recognize that harming your enemies is sometimes the only way to help your allies, and so your wrath is particularly fierce. Whenever you cast an inflict spell (a spell with the word \"inflict\" in the name), the maximum amount of damage dealt by the spell is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of succor with this revelation can cast inflict light wounds to deal 1d8+11 points of damage instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.",
			"",
			"*Perfect Aid (Ex):* You can effortlessly give aid to your allies, whether that means providing them with help attacking or defending them in the heat of combat. You gain {feat/Bodyguard} as a bonus feat, and whenever you use the aid another action to provide a bonus on attack rolls or to AC to one of your allies, the bonus you provide increases by 1.

			"*Pitiful Foe (Su):* You can temporarily curse one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making it pitiful and ineffective in battle. While this ability is in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 7th and 15th levels.",

This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1). You can confer the benefits of a teamwork feat you have a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",

You can apply any one of the following metamagic feats to any spell you cast that targets one or more of your allies without increasing the level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell.

The oracle gains a +4 bonus to natural armor. Her attacks with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, and metal-hafted weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage. Any creature that strikes the oracle with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, or that succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check against her, takes 1d6 points of fire damage.
