After your oath is done, kneel on one knee with your weapon resting against your shoulder. Recite your victories in battle in a sonorous voice until the time for your obedience is done. If you should be attacked while conducting your obedience, slay the creature who dared test your might. (You may be assisted by allies, but you must strike the killing blow.)

Your illusions are especially convincing and persistent. Spells you cast from the figment or glamer subschools last twice as long, as if extended with the {feat/Extend Spell} feat.

You have learned to use the spider's patient guile in combat, trapping your foes within the spider's web. You gain {feat/Net Adept} as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. If you already have {feat/Net Adept}, you instead gain a +1 sacred or profane bonus on attack rolls with a net. When fighting with a net as a one-handed weapon and wielding nothing in your off hand, you also gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.",
			">3. **Binding Strike (Su)** You allow no chances for your foes to escape once you have the advantage. Those enemies you fell are bound and ripe for your stewpot, should you feel less than charitable in victory. When you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can forgo any additional damage to immediately bind your foe in sticky webs, paralyzing it and pinning it in place. This functions as a {spell/hold monster} spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",

If it fails, the target is driven mad by thoughts and concepts far beyond what the brain can handle, as if the workings of Thassilonian magic were revealed to a common ant; it is affected as if by the insanity spell.

Once per day, you can activate your cloak of curses as a standard action, and maintain it for up to 1 minute per Hit Die you possess. While the cloak is active, creatures of the animal and vermin type will not approach within 5 feet of you and move away if you approach them. Attacks from all other creatures suffer a 20% miss chance. This miss chance increases to 30% if the attacking creature is lawful or good (this miss chance does not stack).

			">3. **Never Suffer Alone (Ex)** Misery is a gift you have received far too much of, and you have learned to reflect it onto others. Three times per day, when an opponent successfully deals hit point damage to you, you can immediately make an attack of opportunity against the creature that damaged you, even if you could not normally make an attack of opportunity. You can attack normally with this attack of opportunity or target the triggering creature with one of the spells granted by the malice boon above (though doing so provokes an attack of opportunity if an opponent is in melee with you). You can use this ability only once per round.",

The target of this ability can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect.

One week after interment, a creature entombed by this ability breaks free from its sarcophagus as a chaotic evil ghast with all class levels it had in life; these ghasts are not under your control, but are often friendly toward you.",

Instead of a gemstone, you must be carrying a piece of jewelry (such as a bracelet, ring, or torc) of adequate value to contain the target's soul. (Value derived from magical properties counts for this purpose.) A single piece of jewelry can hold only one soul, but if you are restored to life, you can release a trapped individual as a standard action by holding the jewelry out before you, which causes the target to reappear prone in that square.

If you already have one or more slam or claw attacks, those attacks deal damage as though you were one size category larger. This does not affect the size of manufactured weapons you can wield, but you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with manufactured melee weapons.",

You can cast {feat/extended} {spell/giant form II} once per day as a spell-like ability. While under this effect, your gear resizes to fit your giant form.
