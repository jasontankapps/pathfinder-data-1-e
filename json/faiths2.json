After your oath is done, kneel on one knee with your weapon resting against your shoulder. Recite your victories in battle in a sonorous voice until the time for your obedience is done. If you should be attacked while conducting your obedience, slay the creature who dared test your might. (You may be assisted by allies, but you must strike the killing blow.)

Those enemies you fell are bound and ripe for your stewpot, should you feel less than charitable in victory. When you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can forgo any additional damage to immediately bind your foe in sticky webs, paralyzing it and pinning it in place. This functions as a {spell/hold monster} spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",

			"Groetus presides over the end times - the demise of the world, or perhaps the destruction of the multiverse itself. Having silently witnessed billions of souls from countless worlds filter through the Boneyard, he is unconcerned with the fates of individual heroes, villages, or even civilizations. Despite his chaotic alignment, he is an agent of inevitable fate, ensuring that all things pass. He chose this role for himself, the dispassionate observer in balance against the dispassionate judge.",
			"",
			"Groetus's role is to close the book on this reality when the final page of its story is told. He knows only how the story ends, and uses that knowledge to piece together what is yet to come - a conflict occurs, this entity survives until the end of the story, this other entity does not, and so on - and what to do next once the tale is finished. His attention is on the final goal and the cosmic dynamics that may enable or delay that goal: the subtle movement of planes against each other, the brooding thoughts of rising gods, and the births and deaths of stars in the remote expanse of space.",
			"",
			"Groetus rarely appears in human form, but a few records from ancient Azlant describe him as a tall, slender man wearing a gray, cowled robe that hangs heavily to the floor. He is slightly bent at the neck, as if bearing a great weight on his head, with ashen skin, hollow eyes, and long, smooth hands. His voice is the dry whisper of old paper, his laughter low and breathy, and his inflection archaic or foreign. His feet are bare and covered in soot, as if he had walked through an extinguished fire.",
			"",
			"Most of Groetus's priests bear some kind of {rule/in|sanity>_and_madness} (e.g. amnesia, mania, and paranoia). They can still function in society, but their broken minds hear whispers of the god's will, and they hold beliefs that no sane being would embrace. Note that Groetus's priests are insane even though none of their mental ability scores have been reduced to 0. Also, followers of the god do not see this insanity as an affliction; rather, they see this connection to Groetus as a gift worth celebrating. A priest's insanity can be cured, but unless she immediately rejects Groetus as a patron deity, she relapses in a matter of hours or days.",

If the target fails its Will saving throw against this effect, it recognizes you as its afflictor.

This is a curse effect.",
			">3. **Mother of Curses (Su)** The rage within your heart shields you against harm and turns it back on others.

Once per day, when a spell fails to penetrate your spell resistance, you can reflect it back on its caster, as if using {spell/spell turning}.",

Once per day, upon committing an evil act or casting a spell in front of witnesses, as a free action you can enchant all onlookers to believe another person known to them committed that act. If you know a creature's full name, you can name it specifically as the culprit. Otherwise, each onlooker sees a random friend or family member committing your actions. Onlookers who succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) are not fooled, though they might still be fooled by concealing clothing or mundane disguises you may be wearing.

Once per day, you can activate your cloak of curses as a standard action, and maintain it for up to 1 minute per Hit Die you possess. While the cloak is active, creatures of the animal and vermin type will not approach within 5 feet of you and move away if you approach them. Attacks from all other creatures suffer a 20% miss chance. This miss chance increases to 30% if the attacking creature is lawful or good (this miss chance does not stack). Creatures that succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) are not affected by your cloak of curses.",

Three times per day, when an opponent successfully deals hit point damage to you, you can immediately make an attack of opportunity against the creature that damaged you, even if you could not normally make an attack of opportunity. You can attack normally with this attack of opportunity or target the triggering creature with one of the spells granted by the *malice* boon above (though doing so provokes an attack of opportunity if an opponent is in melee with you).

			"Few sources agree on Gyronna's origin, and her cults quietly hunt anyone who investigates it. Many place her origins in the First World, as a malicious fey princess who delighted in manipulation for her own amusement. After crossing a powerful rival - {monster/Baba Yaga} or {faith/Magdh}, by most accounts - the immortal dilettante was punished with deformities and cast into the mortal realm. Other stories describe her as a trio of bickering sisters who befell the same fate, and were so mutilated that they were forced to lean on one another to even stand, eventually growing together into one loathsome, hateful whole. In the wake of such exile, kindness and civility are, to her, dribbles of poisoned honey, and Gyronna would burn all the world to ash to eradicate such mockery and deception.",
			"",
			"Gyronna's complete figure is rarely depicted; she is more often represented as the same bloodshot eye her followers use as their unholy symbol. Her rare manifestations are chaotic, shifting form mid-conversation - sometimes decrepit, other times vibrantly young, beautiful, withered and dead, jubilant, weeping, or raging. According to ancient tales, the Angry Hag has no true form beyond the singular bulging eye through which she sees the shadows cast by even the brightest lights. Only her gender remains constant - though she presents vastly differing images of womanhood - as do the ragged vestments in which she wraps herself."

			"Many believe that Haagenti, known in some circles as the Whispers Within (a conceit some inventors and alchemists liken to a form of external but mysterious muse that manifests as soft voices in the back of the mind) is among the least destructive and most reasonable of the demon lords. Of course, this impression is largely smoke and mirrors, for Haagenti is as cruel and sadistic as any demon lord. He simply masks his evil through alchemical creations and wondrous inventions that, while seeming beneficial, subtly influence the development of a society toward destruction. Transmuting lead to gold may seem like a financial miracle, but applied too often, it can destroy a nation's or even a world's economy. The power to bring back the dead may seem like the ultimate mercy, but most beings restored to life via Haagenti's gifts end up as sadists or demon-worshiping villains. The greatest secret he has revealed to mortals is the method of transmuting lead into gold using a {magic-artifact/philosopher's stone} (a revelation he granted the wizardly rulers of ancient Thassilon - that these rulers went on to become cruel and sadistic tyrants can be no mere coincidence), but he is the author of other secrets as well, such as the method of creating {monster/retriever/s} and the principles underlying drow fleshwarping. Scholars believe Haagenti has been responsible for guiding many of humanity's greatest minds to discover new methods of inflicting destruction and pain on each other.",

He often appears as an especially attractive member of whatever race he interacts with, particularly in a shape that others will find seductive or pleasing to be around. Regardless of his form, he maintains a dark sense of humor and irony, incorporating some unsettling feature to reflect his demonic nature and mock the form he took. This could be obvious: horns, a hoofed foot, or demonic wings; it could instead be something more subtle, such as eyelids that blink sideways, fingernails on the undersides of his fingers, or a navel in the small of his back. In such cases, he might take pains to hide his \"defect,\" only to reveal the truth after a victim has profited from the nefarious secrets Haagenti revealed.",

			"Clerics of Hanspur, who are indoctrinated in the deeper mysteries of his faith, know that their god was not merely murdered by a traveling companion. The companion was a priest of the daemonic harbinger {faith/Corosbel}, and the murder was a sacrificial ritual intended to consign Hanspur's soul to the Horseman of Death, {faith/Charon}, with whom Corosbel wished to gain favor. However, the ritual sacrifice did not proceed as planned. Though the details of what went awry are unclear, Hanspur's clerics believe {faith/Gozreh} subtly interceded, preventing Corosbel from claiming the entirety of Hanspur's soul for Abaddon. The remainder was bound within Hanspur's dire rat companion, Ashkaelae. Hanspur returned from death a week after the attempted sacrifice, rising from the Sellen River as a demigod with his latent mortal soul fractured. This transformation left him callous and cold. It is unclear whether Gozreh intended for Hanspur to emerge from the waters as a divine being or merely as a divine servitor; the inscrutable nature deity's lukewarm support of Hanspur suggests either that she did not intend for the Water Rat to ascend or that she is not entirely pleased with Hanspur's subsequent actions and attitudes.",
			"",
			"Hanspur's mortal identity is a matter of contention among his priests, with different sects of his faithful claiming he was born to their people. Most notably, among Hanspur's Kellid followers, he is depicted as a legendary and ancient Kellid king whose death and attempted sacrifice signaled the fall of the Kellid people and the coming encroachment of southerners. Such followers of Hanspur believe that he ruled the region of the world now known as the River Kingdoms, and that by conquering the rivers in his name, they can reclaim their lost lands for themselves.",

The posthumous son of {faith/Osiris} and {faith/Isis}, Horus faced off against the usurper {faith/Set}, and with his victory over the Lord of the Dark Desert, Horus became the rightful heir of Osiris. Horus took his father's place as king and ruled Osirion with his consort {faith/Hathor} during the Age of Anguish, becoming also a god of kings and pharaonic rule.",

His symbol, the eye of Horus, is used to ward off evil, and the symbol commonly appears on protective amulets and trinkets. As a sun deity and god of kings, Horus lends his support to {faith/Ra}, and aids him in his continuous battles against {faith/Apep}. An ally of Osiris and Isis, Horus is a steadfast enemy of Set, and the two have fought countless battles over the ages.",
			"",
			"Horus is worshiped by kings and pharaohs, as well as by hunters, paladins, rangers, and warriors. He is sometimes venerated as part of a triad with Osiris and Isis, or as one-half of a royal couple with his consort Hathor, but there are temples dedicated solely to Horus as well. Though rare in this age, Horus' clergy gets along well with the faithful of {faith/Abadar}, as both churches value leadership and law. Temples to Horus are still found in the larger cities of Osirion."

As these godlings increasingly sought out Iblydan monsters, the harpy Ekriathae sought some means of defending her inhuman kin. Using her songs, she wooed a trio of cyclopes from their acropolis and coaxed them into granting her a prophecy of her own. Upon fulfilling its terms and attaining mythic power, she became a force of vengeance, tracking and slaying those who purposefully hunted monsters. She perished of old age in -422 AR, surrounded by followers from dozens of species whom she entreated to consume her body that she might be reborn again in a time of need.",

Six different monsters over the ages have received the cult's endorsement as her reincarnated successors, each born with mythic potential far exceeding their mortal form. The monsters of Iblydos rejoiced in 4702 when the bestial infant Iapholi received the cult's blessing.",

			"Raised almost entirely in Dhuraxilis, the young Iapholi (female half-fiend human oracle 4/hierophant 9) has embraced a philosophy of exalting and empowering monstrous creatures that matches the city-state's cosmopolitan ideals. As a result, the archipelago boasts a growing number of piously pensive and proud magical beasts less eager to provoke their humanoid neighbors. However, a strong contingent of traditionalist monsters chafes under the outwardly pacifist doctrine and urges Iapholi to drown the Iblydan city-states, which they see as invaders, in a wave of bloodshed once and for all. Numerous factions have sent assassins to snuff out Iapholi, hoping to either prevent a monstrous demigod from unifying the many beasts or use her death to rally a terrifying army.",

			"While most commonly associated with mass deaths, Imot was born from mortal guilt and the desire for hindsight in the wake of tragedy. Rather than cause loss of life directly, their machinations precede large disasters, though as the penultimate usher of order, they also arrange for disasters when mortal cultures are too slow in dying. A compulsion buried deep within Imot compels them to hide clues to every disaster in the natural world before the event transpires, wrapped in confounding symbolism and boggling equations. These vague hints and hidden meanings inspire anxiety in most mortal minds. To those unaware of the true nature of these premonitions, this takes the form of subconscious unease; to those aware of the usher's omens, these clues provide a means of averting disaster that is often found far too late. Because of this, Imot is also the usher of dread, paranoia, self-blame for unavoidable disasters, and the omnipresent fear of personal failing.",
			"",
			"Imot's nature makes them the natural patron of mathematicians - especially those who press the boundaries of mortal understanding - and the bearer of souls that perished due to seemingly inevitable ends or that died en masse. People plagued with uneasy premonitions, be they true glimpses of impending tragedy or simply figments of the mind, are sometimes drawn toward the worship of Imot. Prophets who seek accurate omens in an age of lost prophecy are drawn to Imot's complex and hidden portents, seeking to painstakingly unravel the usher's hidden clues to look into the future. The Symbol of Doom's own predictions aren't divine in nature, however, and are simply the result of their own infinitely complex calculations.",
			"",
			"Imot manifests as a golden, four-sided pyramid with a wing sprouting from each of their facets. They have great difficulty expressing themselves verbally and instead conjure images and symbols to communicate. Those who serve the Symbol of Doom for many years eventually learn this unique language, but mortal parishioners and young psychopomps find this unique communication frustrating. Because even fellow ushers find Imot challenging, Imot rarely leaves their domain in the Tetravia, a mass of crossroads and towers situated between the Eight Courts, from which the Symbol of Doom observes the mortal world and Outer Planes, ever in search of new patterns and secrets."

Indeed, she despises non-werewolf lycanthropes and charges her worshipers with seeking out these \"heretics\" for particularly grisly sacrifices in which all manner of silvered torture implements worshipers use with horrifying creativity. Good-aligned lycanthropes in particular provoke Jezelda's ire, and sacrificing them almost always curries her favor."

			"Of the demon lords whose influence can be felt on Golarion, Jubilex may be the one least concerned with maintaining a cult. His favored {monster/omox} demon minions do more to spread his cults than he does - in fact, it's debatable whether Jubilex even realizes he has worshipers. Only among the drow is his faith particularly pervasive; they regard him as a patron of poison and toxins and often consider him a competitor to {faith/Haagenti}. However, even those who worship him tend to think of him not as an entity to be venerated so much as a source of power to be tapped. Yet despite the Faceless Lord's lack of interest in his faithful, he enjoys absorbing the bodies of unwilling mortals from the Material Plane into his protoplasmic bulk, and never turns away any of the sacrifices his worshipers render unto him.",
			"",
			"Jubilex appears as a shapeless, green mass of ooze marbled with dark ribbons of tar and hundreds of glaring red eyes the size of a man's head. In combat, he can lash out with several acidic and poisonous tentacles. The nature of these poisons shifts and changes even between strikes, such that it is difficult - if not impossible - to prepare for their ravages ahead of time. The fact that Jubilex's toxins can affect even creatures that usually can't be poisoned only further secures his role as a lord of poison. The acid secreted by his immense body is particularly potent against flesh and bone, and is likewise capable of damaging creatures normally immune to acid. But assaulting his enemies with irresistible poisons and supernaturally potent acids are only the simplest of the horrors Jubilex is said to be able to unleash. Some who have confronted the Faceless Lord and lived to tell the tale speak of Jubilex drawing fluids like blood and tears from a living creature's body and investing the fluid with the malevolent destructive nature of an ooze before returning the stolen fluids to the donor so that it is consumed, painfully, from within. Others speak of the Faceless Lord's ability to turn the very air into a thick, cloying suspension that is as unpleasant as it is difficult to move through. Even when the air surrounding Jubilex isn't thickened, the overwhelming stink of his presence can kill plants and strip flesh from bone. Surely the demon lord has other foul methods of attack as well - atrocities that none have yet survived to warn the world of."

			"It is said that when the first humanoid (an elf, it so happened) to feed upon the flesh of his brother died, he was reborn in the Abyss in the reeking bowels of a vast necropolis that the plane created in his honor. This first ghoul abandoned his previous life and embraced his new undeath, becoming the demon lord Kabriri. For his first few centuries of existence, he traveled among the worlds of the Material Plane, sampling like a gourmand the contents of graveyards and spreading the infectious \"word\" of his condition to any who would listen - in effect, infecting the inhabitants of innumerable worlds with the first and strongest strain of ghoul fever. Yet wherever Kabriri traveled, he took pains to avoid the burial grounds of elves, and did not spread his word among their kind. Whether his restraint was due to a fragment of shame over his first act of cannibalism or fear of confronting even a tiny fragment of the life he'd left behind, Kabriri left the elven people alone. Repercussions of his avoidance continue to this very day, as the touch of ghouls cannot paralyze elves. In contrast, other humanoids who succumb to the disease find their ears growing long and pointed, as if in some cosmic mockery of the elven form.",
			"",
			"Kabriri appears as a muscular ghoul with pointed ears, sharp teeth, a long tongue, and pale gray flesh. His eyes are beady and red, his hands are talons, and his feet are hooves. (Strangely, the ghouls who revere him generally sport humanoid feet, while it is the ghouls of Leng who walk upon hooves.) His favored weapon is a two-headed flail of iron and bone, its twin heads made from skulls wrapped in strips of spiked iron. This weapon is capable of transforming those it strikes into ghouls, and causes the flesh of the living to rot away. Kabriri's breath can also transform the living into ghouls, and his gaze can instill an unholy cannibalistic hunger that can drive sane folk to go on murderous, gluttonous rampages."

			"Although philosophers often confuse decay for the onslaught of entropy, the faithful of Kerkamoth understand that natural decay on both a visible and atomic level is key to a healthy multiverse. That which is empty has its own order and potential to form great things. Just as a toppling tree leaves space for new growth, so too does the deterioration and controlled demolition of civilization leave fallow realms just waiting to be filled by fresh innovation. For creation to continue, there must be regulated emptiness. Above all, these processes must be silently calculated, predictable, and systematic; the wanton destruction inflicted by the likes of {family/daemon/s}, {family/demon/s}, and {family/protean/s} threatens the entire process."

As the sun rises in the morning, so do the peasants who work all day with little reward, and Khepri is their divine embodiment, promising freedom from toil and reward for their labor in the afterlife. He is also a mischievous prankster, breaking up the tedium of the long days with his antics and poking fun at those who consider themselves the commoners' betters.",

As a solar deity, Khepri works closely with {faith/Ra} and {faith/Horus}, is friendly with {faith/Hathor}, and is opposed to {faith/Apep} and {faith/Set} and their evil machinations. As a trickster, Khepri is close friends with {faith/Bes}, and he relishes the distaste that his strange appearance, his pungent aroma, and all that he represents elicit in more refined and civilized gods such as {faith/Bastet}, {faith/Maat}, and {faith/Thoth}.",
			"",
			"Khepri seldom has dedicated temples, but as the patron of peasants, his priests can be found anywhere the common folk labor. Temporary shrines to the scarab god often spring up next to fields or at building sites, where workers make small offerings of a bite of their food or a sip of their beer, and ask Khepri to grant them an easy and productive day of work."

			"Kostchtchie was born of Ulfen parents, and he became a murderer when his father forced him to kill his mother and sisters. Unsatisfied with the fleeting rush of energy and excitement afforded by these slayings, Kostchtchie proceeded to murder his father as well. After this, the man's taste for bloodshed only grew. But with each murder he committed, Kostchtchie grew more and more concerned that some day, he would himself be slain. Later in life, after he had become a ferocious warlord, Kostchtchie confronted the Witch Queen {monster/Baba Yaga} and tried to force her to grant him immortality. The witch agreed, but she twisted his form, turning him into a hideous giant and hiding the last fragment of his mortal soul in a magical torc. Kostchtchie fled to the Abyss to hide his shame and nurture his hatred, eventually finding a new purpose as a patron of those {monster/frost giant/s} who turned away from the god {faith/Thremyr} in search of an even more warlike deity. His worship is common not only in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, but also in distant Iobaria and the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World far to the north.",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie appears as an immense, deformed frost giant with twisted legs, tiny white eyes, and a thick, matted beard into which he has woven dozens of skulls: trophies of slain kings and priests of rival faiths. He is never seen without his warhammer, an {eq-material/adamantine} maul of such prodigious size that even the strongest frost giant would have trouble wielding it, but which appears almost weightless in Kostchtchie's grizzled hands. This nefarious weapon can destroy nearly any object it strikes, and it stuns all but the largest creatures to suffer its crushing blows."

			"About 300 years ago, Kurgess was merely a strapping farm boy from Taldor, and his mortal life is well-documented. Born to unknown parents, Kurgess was abandoned as an infant upon the doorstep of a Taldan couple who took him in. His extraordinary strength manifested before he even reached puberty - by the age of eight, he could pull a sleigh loaded with his brothers and sisters back and forth across a field all afternoon. One day, Kurgess spotted a traveling merchant on the road who had gotten his carriage stuck in a ditch. The selfless youth shook hands with the stranger before disconnecting the carriage from its train and heaving the entire vehicle out of the ditch unaided. Impressed by the boy's wondrous brawn, the merchant extended an offer: Kurgess could join him in his travels, and together they would roam Taldor, with Kurgess competing in contests of strength and speed. By the time Kurgess turned 20, he was packing stadiums with peasants as well as aristocrats eager to see the so-called Strong Man best time-honored champions at their own games. Unfortunately, Kurgess's vast talent and good-natured sportsmanship earned him the jealousy and bitterness of many of his more unscrupulous rivals.",
			"",
			"Kurgess's final act as a mortal took place at the third annual Raptor Run in Taldor's capital of Oppara. Before the competition, Kurgess's enemies laid down a vicious trap for the Strong Man and any competitors unfortunate enough to be riding alongside him. Kurgess caught wind of the scheme and sacrificed himself, crashing his chariot onto the trap and saving the other athletes. When the clerics pronounced the gladiator dead, the entire city mourned for the champion, and Kurgess became a martyr.",
			"",
			"As legends of his sporting victories and his noble death spread across the Inner Sea region - and even other planes - athletes began looking to Kurgess as a role model, and competitions were often dedicated to him as the embodiment of honor and athleticism. Shortly thereafter, {faith/Cayden Cailean} and {faith/Desna} raised Kurgess to godhood, crowning him with deific powers. Why they did this remains up for debate, but more than a few scholars whisper that Kurgess might actually be the two deities' half-mortal son. He stands as patron of and inspiration for all who engage in physical challenges.",
