If the creature is not within earshot of a similar elemental manifestation, you can maintain your concentration to wait until the creature comes close enough to such a feature.

In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile.
