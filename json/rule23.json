			"Everyone knows the story of the blacksmith's son who, after taking up arms to defend his village, continues on to become a renowned adventurer. And of the young elf who spends years studying musty tomes and practicing simple spells before she heads out into the world to seek ancient lore. These are the stories of everyday adventurers, risen from the ranks of the common folk to make a name for themselves in places harsh and unforgiving.",
			"",
			"But these are not the only stories of heroism. Some adventurers are beyond exemplary - their stories forge the greatest sagas of history, and their every deed births a legend. From the children of gods, blessed with the divine spark, to the lucky heroes born under auspicious stars, these characters are destined to greatness. They are mythic: possessed of unparalleled heroism and capable of astounding acts.",
			"",
			"To be mythic means to draw upon a power that few even dare to understand, and even fewer hope to wield. An air of destiny surrounds mythic characters, and each choice they make shapes the world at large. Their story is intertwined with the great events of the day, and their actions are central to the outcomes. Mythic characters are more resilient and powerful than others, and as a result are awe-inspiring in ways their non-mythic counterparts could never match. Other adventurers might balk at taking on a dragon that plagues a village, but mythic heroes would not only take on the dragon, but also clear the entire region of threats.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the story of mythic heroes is defined by the challenges they face. The GM has a number of new and awe-inspiring tools with which to confront mythic player characters, ranging from immense and deadly mythic monsters to vile and cunning mythic villains. Mythic monsters are unique creatures or remnants of a bygone age when such terrifying beasts ruled over the land. They now dwell in the lost places of the world, waiting for their time to bring great terror. Mythic villains have many of the powers of mythic characters, but they use their abilities selfishly - to subjugate kingdoms, slaughter the innocent, and bring ruin to the world. Unless heroes rise to stop them, mythic villains can cause destruction and chaos on an unimaginable scale.",
			"",
			"Even with such great power, mythic characters are not invulnerable, just more able to deal with the dangers of the world around them. If a mythic character dies, her loss is a great tragedy to the world, as the light of one of its true champions has been extinguished. This is what makes a mythic story exciting: these heroes might fall, just as non-mythic heroes might succumb to lesser threats. And when they do succeed, their victory often comes at a high cost, and usually leaves them scarred.",
			"",
			"The rules herein give players and GMs the tools they need to run mythic adventures. The mythic rules add to the base rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, either as part of an adventure in which the PCs attain mythic power for a limited time, or as the backbone of an entire campaign charting the legend of a group of mythic characters."

			"In a world of might and sorcery, with dragons and elves, what does it mean to be \"mythic\"? Being mythic means possessing a degree of might unusual even in a fantasy world. Scenes turn more dramatic, the enemies are more lethal, and the consequences of the heroes' actions make a far-ranging impact. Being mythic means invoking a sense of wonder and awe even in those already accustomed to the strange and unusual.",
			"",
			"The way this section portrays the mythic narrative isn't solely about stories at 20th level and monsters with high Challenge Ratings - it's about the surprising and unfamiliar regardless of power and scale. Even 1st-level characters could be imbued with mythic power and become forces to be reckoned with. Similarly, lesser monsters such as ogres and skeletons that become mythic transform into terrifying foes with unknown powers, changing the nature of the story you're playing - and startling those accustomed to their non-mythic ilk.",
			"",
			"Not only the characters take on unexpected forms in mythic adventures; the setting does as well. The vistas are more dramatic, featuring flying islands and keeps that float in raging volcanoes. The colors are brighter, the sounds are more mysterious, and all of the other stimuli are sharper and more vibrant. Where the non-mythic hero would encounter a crumbling keep filled with familiar monsters, a mythic hero faces a towering citadel that builds itself from the bones of would-be invaders and is inhabited by cruel and malign creatures of nearly god-like power.",
			"",
			"Besides the setting, the challenges that face mythic characters are far more harrowing than usual. Enhanced abilities allow mythic characters to take on threats beyond the reach of those without such power. They can face with ease foes both powerful and numerous. The real challenge is when they take on mythic creatures that possess the same resilient nature and abilities similar in potency to those they themselves rely on. When a mythic hero comes face to face with a mythic monster, the battle is truly legendary.",
			"",
			"Finally, mythic adventures feature difficult choices and far-reaching consequences. As the characters progress through the story, they're tasked with taking on challenges that seem impossible even to them, and might be tempted to wander from their path. As mythic heroes, they're the first to respond to cataclysmic events, just as they're the last bastion to stem the tide of evil and darkness that threatens to wash over the world. Their successes and failures leave marks on the world for centuries to come."

			"",
			"***Ascension:*** The [moment of ascension](rule/mythic_ascension) is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.",
			"",
			"***Boon:*** When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a [boon](rule/mythic_boons). A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.",
			"",
			"***DR/Epic:*** A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.",
			"",
			"***Mythic:*** With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See {rule/Mythic versus Non-Mythic}.)",
			"",
			"***Mythic Path:*** (Often referred to just as a \"path.\") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her [mythic path](rule/mythic_paths)-archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Power:*** Each mythic character can call upon this [base mythic ability](rule/base_mythic_abilities) to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Rank:*** (Often referred to just as a \"rank.\") Similar to tiers, {rule/mythic rank/s} are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Tier:*** (Often referred to just as a \"tier.\") Mythic characters advance in power by {rule/gaining tiers}, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Trial:*** (Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A [trial](rule/gaining_tiers) is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.",
			"",
			"***Non-Mythic:*** Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.(See {rule/Mythic versus Non-Mythic}.)",
			"",
			"***Surge:*** Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed."

Whichever path is chosen influences how you create your mythic character.",

In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power - such as its source - to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.",

Use [Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR](rule/evaluating_monster_statistics) to evaluate whether the monster's abilities are appropriately challenging for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities complement its non-mythic abilities particularly well, that mythic creature may be too powerful for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities don't interact with its non-mythic abilities, that creature may be too weak for its final CR. If either of these situations occur, make adjustments to the monster so it better fits the intended CR.",

			"While *Mythic Adventures* touches on the subject of mythic characters gaining there power as a result of being directly descended from deities, this section expands on that idea by offering rules options for godling characters. While the mythic power gained by the son or daughter of a deity is comparable to that gained from other means of ascension, godlings are unique in that they have close ties to the deities with which they are associated. Most godlings come to appreciate their divine roots and become proud scions of their deific parents, though some scorn the source of their unasked-for power, and rise to epic heights of power in hopes of one day defeating their immortal progenitors. Depending on the individual and the deity, a godling may be in near-constant contact with the divine or may be kept completely in the dark as to his progenitor's motives. Most lie somewhere in between, receiving only occasional and cryptic guidance from the beings that granted them mythic power.",
			"",
			"The three godling sections in this section detail what godlings of the various Pathfinder deities might be like, as well as provide a new universal path ability for a godling of each deity. Unless otherwise specified, a mythic character can only select one godling path ability.",
			"",
			"In some cases, it doesn't always make sense for a deity to parent a godling by forming a physical union with a mortal. Some deities instead use their divine power to simply bless a child from birth or sow the seeds of mythic fate in entirely unsuspecting mortals. Choosing heralds from mortal ranks is not unknown for inscrutable deities like Pharasma or Gozreh, and godlings descended from these less direct entities typically realize their ascension to mythic power later in life, such as when they come of age.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Tier Godling Path Abilities",
			"",
			"***Barbs of Ecstasy (Su) [{faith/Zon-Kuthon}]:*** Barbs and spikes grow out of you - piercing your flesh, ripping through any armor or clothing, and filling you with exquisite pleasure but your enemies with pain. These spines function as +2 armor spikes. Any creature striking you with a natural weapon or grappling with you takes 1d6+2 points of piercing damage. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to give these spikes the unholy weapon special ability for 1 round per tier.",
			"",
			"***Drunken Luck (Su) [{faith/Cayden Cailean}]:*** You can expend one use of mythic power to gain an insight bonus equal to double your tier to your AC against a single attack, or on your saving throw against a single effect. Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. After using this ability, you are staggered for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Fires of Dawn (Su) [{faith/Sarenrae}]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to burst into flames. You are protected as though by fire shield (warm shield), except the flames deal a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d8 + double your tier to attackers. A creature wielding a melee weapon with reach is still affected by this damage. These flames last for 1 minute per tier or until you dismiss them as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Gozreh's Grace (Su) [{faith/Gozreh}]:*** As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to surround yourself with wind or waves for 1 minute per tier. If you choose wind, swirling winds surround you, guarding you from ranged weapons as though you were protected by wind wall and increasing the effective caster level of any spells you cast that have the air descriptor by 2. If you choose waves, rippling water manifests and swirls around your body, giving melee attacks against you a 20% miss chance, reducing any fire damage taken by 50%, and making it impossible for you to catch on fire.",
			"",
			"***Mantle of the Inheritor (Su) [{faith/Iomedae}]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to automatically rid yourself of any one disease, fear, or poison effect affecting you. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rid an ally within 30 feet of an effect of one of these types.",
			"",
			"***Prior Claim (Su) [{faith/Asmodeus}]:*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to delay the effects of a mind-affecting effect for a number of rounds equal to your mythic tier. You can continue to delay the effects each round with further expenditures of mythic power as a free action. Any mind-affecting effect already affecting you or any mind-affecting effect to which you are exposed during this ability's duration does not affect you until the ability's duration has expired.",
			"",
			"***Roar of Triumph (Su) [{faith/Gorum}]:*** As a free action when you kill an enemy or render it unconscious, you can expend one use of mythic power to give voice to a fearsome roar that rattles the very essence of any foes who hear. Non-mythic enemies within 30 feet are deafened and shaken for 1 round per mythic tier you possess (Will halves this duration; DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier). Using this ability on creatures that are already shaken increases the duration; it does not create a stronger fear condition.",
			"",
			"***Savored Sting (Su) [{faith/Calistria}]:*** As a free action after making a successful melee attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to poison the target. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Con modifier) negates the poison. This poison deals 1d3 points of Dexterity damage and 1d3 points of Charisma damage per round for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The duration is halved for poisoned mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"***Still the Blade (Su) [{faith/Shelyn}]:*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to prevent a single creature within 30 feet from attacking another creature (Will negates; DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier). The target doesn't lose the action and can take any other action that doesn't directly cause harm to another creature. This effect can affect only creatures with fewer mythic ranks or tiers than yourself.",
			"",
			"***Tempered Steel (Su) [{faith/Torag}]:*** As a swift action while wearing armor, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain DR 5/adamantine. Once this effect has prevented a total of 20 points of damage per tier you possess, the protection ends. For example, a mythic character with 3 mythic tiers could prevent a total of 60 points of non-adamantine damage with this effect.",
			"",
			"***Wanderer's Touch (Su) [{faith/Desna}]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue a weapon in your hand with the throwing and returning weapon special abilities. These weapon special abilities apply only to you, and this effect lasts for 1 minute per tier. By expending one use of mythic power as part of a full attack, you can will the thrown weapon to slice through multiple foes in 1 round, allowing you to make up to your full number of attacks that round against multiple opponents. The weapon strikes the first foe, then bounces to the next, and so on, before returning to you at the beginning of your next turn.",
			"",
			"***Way of Knowing (Su) [{faith/Erastil}]:*** As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and name a creature to determine what direction it lies from you. You must choose a creature you have encountered before and can unambiguously identify. If this creature is on another plane, you instead become aware of this fact, but not which plane. This effect doesn't reveal the distance to the selected creature. This ability can be blocked only by effects that can also block discern location.",
			"",
			"***World Breaker (Ex) [{faith/Rovagug}]:*** As a free action after you confirm a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can expend one use of mythic power to shatter the ground beneath your foe. This creates difficult terrain in an area centered on your target with a radius equal to 10 feet &times; your tier. You movement is not impeded by the difficult terrain created by this effect. By expending two uses of mythic power when you use this ability, you can create an additional shock wave that extends beneath your target's feet in a cylinder with a depth equal to 5 feet &times; your tier. If this shock wave breaks the surface of the floor (such as if you used this ability on the second floor of a building), the area beneath the target collapses entirely and anyone in the area lands prone on the level below (possibly incurring falling damage in the process).",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Tier Godling Path Abilities",
			"",
			"You must be at least 3rd tier to select these path abilities.",
			"",
			"***Birth Nightmare (Sp) [{faith/Lamashtu}]:*** As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power while violently ripping open your belly and revealing the unholy horrors within. You take 3d6 points of damage as a horribly deformed creature of shadow crawls forth. This shadow merges with a creature of your choice within 30 feet, affecting the target as though with a phantasmal killer spell (DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier) with a caster level equal to double your tier. This ability can only affect creatures with fewer mythic ranks or tiers than yourself.",
			"",
			"***Blackfingers' Blessing (Su) [{faith/Norgorber}]:*** You can expend one use of mythic power to instantly coat your weapon and your allies' weapons in a poison that you are carrying on your person. This ability only applies poison to the weapons your allies are currently wielding (the weapons they are merely carrying are unaffected), and there is no chance of accidentally poisoning yourself or your allies. You must be carrying a number of doses of poison equal to the number of weapons you wish to apply the poison to, and the doses of poison are consumed in the process of using this ability. Only willing allies can have their weapons affected by this ability.",
			"",
			"***Blade of the Undying (Su) [{faith/Urgathoa}]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to transform one of your arms into a scythe of bone, blood, and sinew. This weapon does damage as a +1 scythe of your size, and lasts for 1 round per tier. By expending one additional use of mythic power, your blade gains the wounding ability. Although it only uses one hand, the scythe deals damage as though wielded with two hands. When you activate this ability, whatever you are holding in your hand is melded with your body for the duration of this effect. Any weapon used in your other hand counts as an off-hand attack, regardless of which arm you transform. You can only transform one limb at a time in this fashion.",
			"",
			"***Claim the Price (Su) [Any Lord of Evil]:*** Whenever an adjacent enemy confirms a critical hit against you, you can expend two uses of your mythic power to imprint some of your blood on that creature and force it to carry out some action or course of activity, as determined by you. This effect is similar to that of a lesser geas spell, but can affect any creature with fewer Hit Dice than your character level plus your mythic tier. Creatures with mythic ranks or tiers equal to or greater than your mythic tier are unaffected by this ability.",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Insight (Su) [{faith/Nethys}]:*** The arcane might of Nethys infuses your every use of magic. The save DCs of any metamagic spells you cast are determined according to the level of the spell slot they occupy after applying the metamagic feat. As a free action while casting a spell prepared with one of more metamagic feats, you can expend one use of mythic power to replace those metamagic feats with any other metamagic feats you know as long as the spell's effective spell level is no higher than it was before.",
			"",
			"***Final Rest (Su) [{faith/Pharasma}]:*** You can always sense the presence of undead creatures as though using detect undead (this ability can be suppressed at will). As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee touch attack against an undead creature that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d10 &times; your tier. Mythic undead and any undead whose Hit Dice are equal to or greater than your character level plus your mythic tier receive a Will save to halve this damage (DC = 10 + your Wis or Cha [whichever is higher] + your tier). Undead whose mythic rank or tier equals or exceeds your own are unaffected by this ability.",
			"",
			"***Shadow of the First Vault (Ex) [{faith/Abadar}]:*** Magic items you touch gain a portion of the essence of the perfect representation of that item in Abadar's First Vault. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When activating a spell from a spell completion or spell trigger magic item, you may expend an amount of mythic power as a free action to imbue the spell being cast from that item with one metamagic feat you have access to. The number of uses of mythic power you must expend when doing so is equal to the number of levels by which the chosen metamagic feat increases the spell's level.",
			"",
			"***Tip the Balance (Su) [Any Lord of Equilibrium]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make your weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes count as any alignment needed to overcome a foe's alignment-based damage reduction for 1 minute per tier. During this time, your alignment also counts as the most favorable possible for spells or effects that are based on alignment.",
			"",
			"### 6th-Tier Godling Path Abilities",
			"",
			"You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.",
			"",
			"***Champion of Weal (Su) [[Any Empyreal Lord](main/faiths_pantheons)]:*** You can show the path of light to those who are tainted by evil. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to attempt to temporarily redeem a non-mythic evil creature within 30 feet. If the target fails its Will save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier), its alignment immediately changes to lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good (your choice) for a number of minutes equal to your tier, and for the duration of this effect the creature pursues a path of righteousness in keeping with its new alignment. Creatures with the evil subtype are immune to this effect. Regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful, a creature can't be affected by this ability more than once in 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Transcendent Self (Su) [{faith/Irori}]:*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant yourself a +1 sacred bonus to all ability scores for 1 minute per tier. You can expend two additional uses of mythic power to increase this bonus to +2, or four more to increase this bonus to +3. If you have a ki pool, you can substitute ki for mythic power on a one-to-one basis when activating this ability, as long as you expend at least one use of mythic power."

If they succeed, they'll be the subject of tales and epic ballads for generations to come.",

While that is certainly part of it, creating a mythic atmosphere is just as important. The world itself and the structure of the story need to change to make room for the mythic to exist alongside the normal. This change doesn't require you to reinvent the world, but mythic creatures and their environments should feel as if they are part of the world; they may be hidden, but they should still be tied to the mundane events and lands around them.",

For example, a flying castle with a 1,000-foot-tall tower at its heart, drifting through the air on a thunderous storm cloud, is certainly a dramatic sight, but only when compared to the pastoral farmland and grime-covered town in its shadow. Picture the same floating castle in a world of towering volcanoes, and 500-foot-tall fortresses and the castle just becomes another extreme element in a world of extremes. If your game is set on Golarion (or some other established world), inserting contrasting mythic elements is easy, since the world already has a specific feel. Making your game mythic simply requires you to push beyond the boundaries of the setting, identifying hidden places where mythic elements have always dwelled, waiting to be discovered."

Ultimately, it's up to the GM to decide how much influence these rules have on the campaign and world as a whole. The following types of scale are provided to give GMs an easy guideline for incorporating mythic rules into their games.",

The PCs are not themselves mythic in this type of campaign, but throughout their travels, they may be up against a mythic creature at the conclusion of a noteworthy quest.

For the duration of an adventure or short campaign arc, they can wield this power to further their goals. Unfortunately, it's fleeting, and they soon become normal once again, perhaps with a few remnants of power they might call on in a future time of need.

			"",
			"***Uncommon:*** Mythic creatures and characters are uncommon in this scale of game, but not wholly resigned to the whispers of legend. The PCs also get mythic power, but their advancement in tier is slow. The GM can control this by limiting the number of trials that are presented. Likewise, mythic foes are still not pervasive, but are found with some regularity - leading secret cabals, harassing quiet villages on the edge of civilization, and dwelling in the dark places of the world.",
			"",
			"***Common:*** In the common scale, mythic characters and monsters are an everyday part of life. This doesn't mean that every town has a group of mythic heroes defending it, but that such characters are known to exist and their deeds are common knowledge. Nobles, priests, and other powerful people call upon the PCs for help against those dangerous monsters and villains others are powerless to fight. In this type of campaign, the PCs begin play with mythic power and see it grow as they gain levels, roughly at the rate of one mythic tier per two character levels."

			"Campaigns and adventures come in many forms, taking shape organically with the whims of the players and the needs of the Game Master, but the key to running a successful mythic campaign or adventure involves a little more planning. The following structure is a guide to help GMs in planning out their mythic experience, regardless of length. This formula can work for a single session, where the PCs gain mythic power at the beginning and lose it by the end. Or you can apply it to an entire campaign, where the PCs gain mythic power early on and retire after of dozens of adventures.",
			"",
			"Many mythic stories follow a common narrative structure (see [The Monomyth under Mythic Themes](rule/mythic_themes)). This structure is divided into five parts: the contact, the awakening, the journey, the return, and the life after. In the contact, the PCs encounter a threat too great for them to handle. In the awakening, they're granted mythic power to handle this threat. In the journey, the heroes quest to increase that power and gain what they need to vanquish that threat. In the return, they finally encounter the threats as equals (or near-equals) and have the opportunity to forever right the world. In the life after, the mythic heroes deal with the aftermath of their trials, and either become normal characters once again or hold onto their new power.",
			"",
			"This structure isn't set in stone. GMs should improvise details to suit the campaign. The steps represent story ideas that might reveal themselves in one or more encounters.",
			"",
			"### The Importance of Failure",
			"",
			"In a mythic game, failure can play an important role in motivating the characters. Failure doesn't need to mean death, but instead that the PCs' efforts aren't enough to solve all problems before them. They might win the battle, but find that around them the town was destroyed, or someone close to them died during the conflict. This failure is a story opportunity - it can be used as motivation to continue on their journey, even against loss and extreme adversity. This also illustrates that the PCs' enemies have power similar to theirs, and that challenges ahead will test the heroes' limits and resolve.",
			"",
			"### Starting Off Mythic",
			"",
			"A key part of the mythic narrative is that the characters don't start out as mythic heroes. Even if they gain their powers during the opening scenes of their first adventure, each character has an ordinary life before their ascension. This helps to ground them in the world and gives them a framework by which they can understand the magnitude of this change within them. That's not to say the seed of mythic power couldn't have been a part of them since birth, but such latent power should be hidden from them until the appropriate time."

This gives them a chance to experience life as mundane heroes, struggling to earn enough gold to keep themselves fed and allowing them to explore the normal world around them.",
			"",
			"When the PCs first come in contact with something truly wondrous, the mythic campaign starts in earnest. They learn that there's much more to the world around them than they first realized. This can take the form of some great, emerging danger that the PCs cannot hope to defeat as they currently are. Perhaps an incredibly powerful dragon threatens the land, a long-dead god returns to the world, or the fearsome tarrasque reawakens. The PCs are drawn into this story as their lives are forever changed by this unchallengeable threat. These low-level characters should not combat such a beast, but they might be in a town ravaged by the threat, leaving them with no choice but to flee along with everyone else or perish. After that event, they're linked to the threat, but right now have no means of dealing with it."

By the end of this part of the story, the PCs have had their [moment of ascension](rule/mythic_ascension), whether together or separately, and are now mythic. They are not yet ready to face their primary challenge, but the first steps down the path to victory should be revealed at this point.",
			"",
			"Often, the source of this power gives them a clue to their journey. For example, the {monster/tarrasque} is tearing through the countryside, devouring entire towns. The PCs are forced to flee into a secluded valley near where the beast was slumbering, only to find that the valley contains an ancient seal recently broken. A guardian spirit explains to them that it has failed in its duty to keep the beast contained, and beseeches the PCs to intervene if they are brave enough. Giving the last of its strength, the spirit imbues the PCs with mythic power. As the spirit fades away, it tells them to seek out a legendary blade capable of ending the tarrasque.",
			"",
			"After receiving aid, the PCs are ready to begin their journey, but first they must leave their old world behind. Make this a painful choice for them, as the PCs must leave loved ones and comfort to venture into the unknown and ready themselves against true danger. This is a good time to present their first major challenge, so they can fully grasp the power they now command. The GM should also mark this point with some sort of loss or setback, to emphasize the gravity of the situation and the need for the PCs to undertake their quest. In the example above, the PCs might leave the valley only to find that their hometown is completely gone, devoured by the tarrasque. Before the PCs have a chance to mourn, they're beset by a group of cultists who helped to weaken the seal. After a deadly fight, the PCs see that they must leave to retrieve the blade if they're going to save other towns from this horrible fate."

The PCs, now enhanced with mythic power, must contend with various trials and dangers. Although these tests can take many different forms, there are some common types.",
			"",
			"One type of test is that of the heart, compelling the PCs to struggle for something they care about other than themselves. These tests provide the PCs with a goal other than their own well-being and power. There should be something threatened if they fail, which serves to give the PCs resolve, a reason to carry on. As they visit a city in the path of the monster, the PCs might encounter people who remind them of home, or of friends lost. Or they could find a child in the clutches of a enemy, only to learn that he's the key to their diabolical plan, and the PCs must succeed if they're to save him in time. If the threat is powerful enough, the PCs may even come to learn that their own survival is secondary their quest's completion.",
			"",
			"Temptation is another type of test, one that has different twists. Some temptations are obvious, and you expect the heroes to refuse, such as discovering a bucolic valley where they could forgo their journey and retire in peace, or a dubious stranger offering them a shortcut through a cursed forest. Such temptations are important to a mythic tale because refusal defines the characters and shows us their limits. Then there are the subtle temptations, ones that heroes might actually consider - either because the price seems small (or even non-existent) compared to the gain or because the source seems trustworthy: taking food from an evil witch after starving for days, or choosing to give up a child they're protecting in exchange for an entire city's safety. Keep in mind that forces of good and evil are equally likely to test the heroes, to either reveal their mettle or lead them down the path of corruption. In any case, the PCs might be tempted a number of times along their journey and they must find the resolve to carry on and stay on the path.",
			"",
			"The PCs will eventually come to a point where they must confront the source of their own power, which provides another form of test. During their travels, they learn more and more about that source, ultimately revealing the truth about its nature. This might lead to a confrontation with the source of their power, after which the PCs feel they are equals to this source rather than its servants. For example, the PCs might learn their power comes from a divine source, and that deity is using them for its own ends. At great risk, they confront an aspect of the god to find answers. At the conclusion of the conflict, the PCs realize that while they're only a piece of the god's grand scheme, they're no mere pawns. Just as the god is using them to achieve her ends, they're using the god to achieve theirs.",
			"",
			"At the end of their journey, the PCs find their ultimate goal just within reach. Achieving this should be their most difficult test yet. Some foes are there to cull the unworthy, while others are agents of evil set to destroy the PCs. This last step in the journey should include a reward the likes of which the PCs have never seen, the culmination of their entire journey. With our earlier example, the PCs arrive at the resting place of the legendary sword capable of ending the tarrasque. Retrieving the sword from its ancient tomb is no easy task though, as the weapon is guarded by a host of mythic monsters and deadly traps. With the sword in hand, they must return to defeat the danger."

This gives them a chance to fully appreciate their power, and use it to defeat foes that would have been truly dangerous not long ago.",

			"Beyond the story, there are a wide variety of elements you can add to give your campaign a mythic feel. These elements are different ways of looking at various parts of an adventure. A mythic adventure should contain some of these, though not necessarily all at once.",
			"",
			"***Cunning Foes:*** The enemies mythic characters face should be cunning and devious in their plans. Unlike normal monsters that tend to wait around to be fought, a cunning foe is proactive in its efforts to defeat the PCs. Such enemies use the environment to their benefit, utilize their abilities to the fullest, and have at least one contingency plan. Cunning foes frequently escape a losing battle to regroup and prepare another attack. After the PCs' first encounter with a cunning enemy, their foe learns from that experience and uses new tricks and tactics to neutralize the PCs' strengths. The foe might even do research or conduct reconnaissance before the fight, pitting the PCs against her minions while she watches silently, noting the PCs' capabilities.",
			"",
			"***Hard Consequences:*** With all the incredible power at characters' fingertips, it's easy to forget that the heroes are still people - complicated and flawed. Mythic heroes suffer or witness dramatic consequences in stories all the time, and it's those moments that define a hero and help us connect with her. There are different ways to bring about consequences. Failure is one option, whether it is failing a combat or skill check or to failing to make the right decision (see [The Importance of Failure under Mythic Story Structure](rule/mythic_story_structure)). There are other ways to bring about consequences, though, such as having something unforeseen happen because of the PCs' actions. Imagine watching the countryside burn because you used a {spell/mythic |fireball} to defeat a foe. And there is always the classic story moment of presenting a hard choice, where no option is without cost. It's through suffering and reacting to such consequences that the true nature of these mythic heroes emerges.",
			"",
			"***Impressive Settings:*** The world of mythic adventures is enormous and dramatic. While a large keep is certainly impressive, one with a 200-foot-tall tower at its heart is more suitably awe-inspiring. This applies to natural environments as well, such as an entire forest with plants five times the normal size, waterfalls more than 100 feet high, or an immense volcano erupting at its heart. This might also take the form of a location with supernatural effects, such as a lake that is perfectly calm even when disturbed, or a swamp that is preternaturally dark. These places should appeal to all the senses, making them vibrant and memorable.",
			"",
			"***Legendary Creatures:*** Some creatures the PCs face should be legends in their own rights. While those that are drawn from ancient myth (such as the minotaur and the medusa), are likely candidates, any monster can fit into this category given the proper backstory. A random encounter with a dire wolf in the wilderness isn't especially legendary, but if the PCs visit the nearby town first and learn that there's a feral monster that's been feeding on townsfolk for a decade, and there are many local myths about the beast, that same encounter gains a legendary quality. Defeating such foes adds to the mythic characters' story, making these moments important to a mythic adventure.",
			"",
			"***Otherworldly Influence:*** Whether from artifacts, ancient magic, or the gods, mythic power is beyond that of the mortal realm. When the PCs gain such power, they attract the attention of mysterious forces that seek to control or otherwise influence them. This can take many forms, from a deity speaking to them through a cryptic seer, a strange sign from the stars, or gifts left in a tranquil glade to aid the heroes on their journey. Not all such influences will be beneficial - the PCs might be hammered by powerful storms, led astray by a constantly changing map, or attacked by agents of an evil power. The PCs should feel like their quest has caught the attention of powerful forces, even if they do not understand their sources or motives.",
			"",
			"***Powerful Enemies:*** Foes should have powers and abilities far beyond those the PCs normally expect to face. Through their mythic abilities, the PCs have the tools to defeat these challenges, but such foes are powerful and dangerous nonetheless - more than capable of bringing pain to the world if not defeated. Battles with powerful foes make it clear that the PCs truly need their mythic power to survive. Of course, not every fight should be against a powerful foe; lesser foes give the PCs a chance to show off their talents.",
			"",
			"***Supernatural Events:*** Strange and wonderful events surround mythic characters, events that twist and alter the world around them. Such events might be local (a perpetual blizzard in a small valley) or they might cover a vast area (a gloom that covers the sun). These supernatural events are in some way tied to the story of the characters. Perhaps the blizzard is the sign of a mystical frozen water elemental seer who is trying to get the heroes' attention. Or the gloom covering the sun is caused by a mythic demon seeking to bring ruin to the surface world."

This could be always visible, or manifest only as a character uses mythic power. Alternatively its nature could be subtle and felt rather than seen.

Even a 1st-level/1st-tier character is worthy of respect. That doesn't mean you have to throw away the quests you've planned, but you should present them to the PCs (and players) as something worth a mythic character's time and energy.",

			"The true powers in the world, whether the raw power of angels and demons or the political power of kingdoms and churches, recognize the potential in the mythic heroes. Wise ones know to be polite to low-tier heroes today, because in the future they will be formidable allies or devastating foes.",

			"On the flip side, mythic power is an alienating force. Very few people have it, and many of those who do are threats, not friends. So the people the heroes encounter will look at them with reverence, fear, or even resentment, but never with familiarity and ease.

			"Designing a mythic encounter is a lot like designing an encounter in any other adventure. During play, the PCs will face a variety of challenges: monsters, NPCs, traps, and more. The difference is that during a mythic adventure, the challenges are far deadlier. It's important to stress to the players, through the encounters that they face, that these are dangers beyond what they might normally expect in the game. Much of this comes through the design of the encounters, which can vary greatly depending on the PCs and how you want to challenge them. In the most basic terms, the mythic rules can be used in one of two ways: to challenge normal PCs and to challenge mythic PCs.",
			"",
			"***Encounters for Normal PCs:*** If the PCs aren't mythic, then these rules can be used to present challenges of an unexpected nature. Mythic creatures and villains are more powerful than their normal counterparts, making encounters significantly more dangerous. See Adjusting CR and Level below.",

			"Normal PCs should be rewarded with experience points and treasure based on this adjusted CR. This means the PCs will face creatures that would normally be below them in terms of their original CRs, but whose strange abilities make them true threats.

			"",
			"***Encounters for Mythic PCs:*** Mythic adventurers are ready for challenges beyond those normally expected for characters of their level. (See Adjusting CR and Level below.) When designing encounters to challenge these characters, roughly one-third of the encounters should use their adjusted APL, one-third should use the characters' original APL, and the remaining should fall somewhere between those two values.",
			"",
			"Of course, individual encounters can vary from these numbers as normal (such as a challenging encounter versus an easy encounter, as noted on [Table 12-1](rule/designing_encounters)). When facing a mythic foe, add half its mythic rank to its original CR to determine the foe's adjusted CR (as above).",

That means some of their encounters are rather easy (allowing them to dominate foes using their mythic power), some are of average difficulty, and some truly push them to their limits. The challenging encounters should be against other mythic foes, forcing the PCs to confront enemies with similar power.",

In the game, these events denote the stages of the mythic character's journey. Think of trials as an important plot point, one that is intrinsically tied to the legend of the characters.",

These trials are the true tales of mythic heroism, representing the culmination of an entire adventure or campaign arc in which the PCs overcome a terrifying challenge or achieve some fantastic victory. The trial can be anything the GM imagines, but it's not accomplished until some major goal is completed - be it to defeat a monster, save a town, or recover an artifact. So while an entire adventure might be a trial, it does not count toward advancement until the heroes complete it.",

			"The rate at which these trials are accomplished determines how quickly the PCs gain mythic tiers. As a guideline, the PCs should face a number of trials equal to the amount needed to gain a tier in the time it takes for them to gain two character levels. This should keep the character's mythic tier roughly equal to 1/2 the character's overall level. (Of course, the GM can alter this rate to suit the campaign.) That means if the PCs attain their first mythic tier at 1st level, they should probably face only a single greater trial by the time they reach 4th level, so that they reach 2nd tier at that time. Conversely, higher-level characters that gain mythic power later in their careers might face a number of trials in quick succession to gain tiers quickly, or they might even start with multiple tiers right away to get them closer to the average. [Table 1-2](rule/gaining_tiers) lists the number of trials a character must overcome to gain a new tier, but this number is subject to GM discretion and the needs of the story.",

			"When designing a trial, GMs should keep the following points in mind. Trials represent important stories in the legend of mythic characters. Unlike an anecdote about particularly nasty fight or dangerous trap, trials are lengthy tales of multiple dangerous encounters, against mythic foes and unimaginable adversity.

			"The following trials should give GMs ideas of the various challenges mythic characters need to face to gain tiers. Use these as is or as inspiration for designing your own. Some of these suggest a mythic origin as well, but can be reworked for other mythic characters. Note that some of these are larger in scope and might represent an entire campaign arc. At the GM's discretion, such longer events might represent several trials.",
			"",
			"***A Noble's Mind Overthrown:*** A great king or emperor succumbs to a strange madness, either from some unforeseen disease or a villain's magical corruption. In the ensuing mania, the ruler declares war on followers of the major religions, hitherto great supporters of the crown and a boon to the common people. Not wanting to provoke outright war between the crown and the faiths, the mythic characters are charged by their patron to discover the cure for their monarch's besieged mind.",
			"",
			"***Abyssal Parasite:*** A powerful interaction of multiple mythic spells destroyed the body of a powerful demon, but in its place created a vengeful spirit neither dead nor alive. The spirit is capable of possessing others and infusing its host with demonic powers, using this as an opportunity to gather evil allies and gain strength. A celestial being that opposes demonkind calls the upon PCs to stop the vile being. They must then track the demon spirit as it moves from victim to victim, until the heroes can eradicate the demonic shade.",
			"",
			"***Aftermath:*** The kingdom has been ravaged by a terrible battle with an invading force. The king's armies suffered a pyrrhic victory - the realm is all but destroyed. The PCs must help restore the domain to its former glory by rooting out remaining enemies, tending to the suffering people, rebuilding the cities, striking deals with neighboring nations for aid, and protecting the kingdom against further attack by emboldened foes.",
			"",
			"***First Steps:*** The PCs are normal adventurers who come to the aid of a strange creature beset by vicious enemies. Unfortunately, by the time the PCs fend off the attackers, the gravely wounded creature is drawing its last breaths. Just before dying, it bestows mythic power upon the heroes and entrusts them with a quest that it was not able to complete. With their new abilities, the PCs can finish the mission, avenge their fallen benefactor, and take their first steps into a larger world of challenges and foes greater than they ever knew existed.",
			"",
			"***For Those Who Must Follow:*** The PCs are heroes in the days before a coming apocalypse at the hands of a dark divine or even extraterrestrial power. Unlike a campaign where the PCs must stop a cataclysm, in this trial they have no hope of averting the impending disaster. Instead, they must draw on mythic power to lay a foundation for future heroes to save the world. Their adventures will lead them to create secret repositories containing knowledge and small slivers of their own mythic power. While doing this they also attempt to form deep alliances with disparate groups the world over, laying the groundwork for the heroes that will one day rise and change the fate of a world that they themselves had not time enough to save.",
			"",
			"***Into the Abyss:*** The PCs go on a quest to the Abyss, and must endure a harrowing expedition through the infinite layers of that chaotic evil realm. They're tasked to rescue an important mortal sold into demonic slavery, retrieve a soul that was condemned to the Abyss by mistake, or topple a particularly destructive demon lord. Whatever the reason, the adventurers face challenges that push their new abilities to the limit.",
			"",
			"***Lost Souls:*** The souls of the dead are not reaching their final destinations, but are instead trapped in a state of waiting. The PCs must discover what is powerful enough to interfere with this cosmic process - and for what dark purpose. Worse, the denied souls are being twisted into monstrous forms, causing pockets of corruption and instability, and presenting other threats to the world. The PCs struggle to unravel the mystery and defeat the furtive villain behind it all.",
			"",
			"***Mirror through the Multiverse:*** A sudden magical event, like an arcane earthquake, shreds the barrier between parallel worlds. The divine powers of each realm perceive the others as threats and seek to do away with the rival \"mockeries\" of their own world through their ascended champions. The PCs are selected on behalf of their world's pantheon of gods while searching out their opponents, some of whom might be eerily similar to them. GMs can offer players the choice of vanquishing their opponents or of allying with them in a joint effort to stop this cosmic bout.",
			"",
			"***Proving Grounds of the Great Beyond:*** The PCs are captured and taken to a grand arena where they must fight against other legendary creatures for the amusement of powerful planar entities. Each round of the competition proves more deadly than the last, as it becomes clear that only one team will survive this tournament. If the PCs are victorious, a great boon might be bestowed upon them, so when the chance to escape presents itself, they must decide whether or not to continue.",
			"",
			"***Redemption:*** Pursuing a once-strong champion of goodness like a fallen angel or an antipaladin, the PCs use mythic power not to oppose their enemy but to discover the source of his defection in the hopes of turning him back to the light. Or they must cleanse a relic that's been polluted by some festering malignancy. The corruption is so deep-seated that the PCs must journey to a distant place of renown that can be reached only by heroes wielding the strongest of mythic powers.",
			"",
			"***Revenge Unyielding:*** Some legendary warrior or powerful monster returns, like a dragon or giant once imprisoned in stasis, petrified, or under an enchanted sleep. Finding its world gone and all of its family and kin perished at the hands of heroes long since past, its mind collapses into madness. The creature vows revenge on all its foes' descendants, or perhaps even the entire world, and slaughters in blind rage. The heroes must find a way to stay the avenger's madness or put the tormented soul to rest.",
			"",
			"***The Culling Plague:*** A rare disease has stricken one of the great races of the world. Giants, dragons, even outsiders might be victim to this debilitating plague. The oldest members of the afflicted species beseech the adventurers to stem this horrible contagion. Such a quest could take the PCs to far-flung parts of the world (and perhaps even beyond) searching for rare ingredients to concoct a cure. Alternatively, a sickness that strikes a species spread across the spectrum of good and evil, like outsiders or dragons, might make the PCs unlikely peace brokers between angels and devils or chromatic and metallic dragonkind while trying to find the cure.",
			"",
			"***The Giving Rain:*** The flensed flesh of a deity executed for unknowable crimes falls in a gory rain across the land. The areas with the highest concentration exhibit bizarre, troubling effects. The PCs, being close to one such place, gain mythic powers. Drawn to other epicenters as if pulled by the godflesh, the heroes must deal with the changes wrought by the storm. This includes putting down monsters that have likewise gained strange new abilities, hunting down masses of godflesh that are hidden deep underground or atop the highest peaks, and restoring peace to kingdoms that have gone to war over possession of these divine blessings.",
			"",
			"***The Old Guard:*** The PCs inherit a grand duty from a group of aging heroes with a sacred and momentous charge. This might be guarding a rift in the multiverse, manning the prison of a dreaded lich or even an elder god, or preserving the first teachings of arcane magic or a hallowed fighting style. The aging guardians deputize the PCs and charge them with a sacred quest to find others able to wield mythic power and take over for the august veterans when their time has come, or grant the PCs a chance to become the new guardians themselves. In the latter case, the older heroes direct the PCs toward quests and accomplishments that will increase their mythic power to the levels needed to replace the retiring guardians. Perhaps the PCs don't even realize they're being vetted for this crucial role as they undergo their adventures.",
			"",
			"***To Challenge a God:*** An evil deity and its minions are making a play for ultimate power in the mortal realms. Other gods, prevented from interfering in the matter by a divine compact, task the characters to oppose the usurper. The PCs must disrupt the schemes of the deity's minions and work their way up through the ranks, breaking the chain one link at a time, until they finally confront the ambitious god.",
			"",
			"***Uniting the Armies:*** War rages across the land. Disparate humanoid and monstrous races fight with one another, oblivious to a rising threat that will soon endanger them all - and that might have orchestrated their conflicts in the first place to keep their armies occupied. The heroes alone learn the truth and must use their mythic powers to unite the warring groups - but doing so means facing a series of challenges of diplomacy, intrigue, and brute force. Only by banding together will the land be able to fight off their immense foe in the ultimate battle."

			"Recurring villains are a staple of fantasy fiction and with a little careful planning you can make your mythic villains memorable opponents your players to remember and talk about for years to come. With the heroes possessing extraordinary power, the villains that defy them should also possess a measure of that power. A memorable, iconic villain will bump elbows with the PCs over and over again. Such a villain builds tension - for even as the PCs foil her plans, they're kept frustrated by failing to permanently stop this fiend. Creating such nasty villains is challenging as heroes grow stronger and get better at killing off persistent foes. To ensure the mythic villain survives, make use of noncombat encounters, ensure your villain always has an escape plan, and don't be afraid to reintroduce her after the players think she's had been finished off.",
			"",
			"Noncombat encounters help players develop a connection between their PCs and the villain in a way that doesn't risk the villain's life (or the PCs'). Early on, she can appear as a harmless or even helpful NPC. Or, if the PCs have already fought the villain, she can leave notes or use magic to taunt them. Various mythic powers, the Disguise skill, or even simple magic like {spell/disguise self}, {spell/glibness}, or {spell/nondetection} can be used to help a villain blend in and rub elbows with the heroes all while seeming innocuous. Later, once the villain is revealed, she can work behind the scenes, using minions and other allies to accomplish her ends, all the while making it plain to the PCs that she's continuing to thwart them.",
			"",
			"In a world where powerful creatures are hunting you, paranoia and the willingness to abandon plans and allies are key to survival. If you want your villain to fight the players, plan an early exit. It's okay for a villain to flee even if she might win a confrontation, as her plans are a long game and require that she survive to see them through. There are many spells, mythic powers, and class abilities that give the villain the ability to get away in a hurry. She should use more mundane escape methods when possible, concealing her iconic escapes as much as possible so they're more difficult for the PCs to counter.",
			"",
			"Should the villain be killed, don't be afraid to have her revisit your campaign for a little posthumous mockery and mayhem. There are many ways to reintroduce a dead villain - sometimes it's as simple as having a minion cast {spell/raise dead} or {spell/resurrection}, but there are other, more sophisticated options. You can introduce a new recurring villain who tracks down one of the PCs' dead foes and brings him to some semblance of life in the form of an undead minion or possessed item, or who uses {spell/speak with dead} to learn the deceased foe's secrets."

If you don't ingest that food or drink at least once per day, you begin to lose your mythic powers. After the first day of absence, you can no longer regain uses of mythic power. After the second day, you lose all the powers and abilities granted by your mythic path.

When an effect of that type is used against you, it is always treated as though it's from a mythic source.",

			"***Furious Rage:*** Your rage is a beast, one that you can barely control. Whenever you are hit by a critical hit or demoralized by the Intimidate skill, you go into an uncontrollable rage. This functions like the {class/barbarian/'s rage class feature}, but you don't gain a bonus to your Strength or Constitution score (even if you have the rage class feature). This limits the actions you can perform and gives you a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus your mythic tier, but you aren't fatigued after this duration expires.

Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against an effect that would have caused you to gain the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you instead gain the staggered condition for a duration equal to the duration of the effect that you saved against, as you spend part of each round boasting about your prowess. If you instead fail a saving throw against such an effect, that effect's duration is doubled as you're also confronted with doubt or shame.",

			"***Material Weakness:*** There is one material that can penetrate even your toughest defenses. Select cold iron, silver, or wood. Weapons made primarily from that material automatically confirm all critical hits against you and the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons made primarily of that type always bypass that reduction.",

			"***Mercurial Mind:*** The power that you wield speaks to you, and it befuddles your mind at critical moments. Whenever you're hit by a critical hit or fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or special ability, you also gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"***School Aversion:*** Despite your power, there is one type of magic that is foretold to be your undoing. Those that wield it are of great danger to you. Select one school of magic (except divination). Whenever you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect of that school, you take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The effects of such spells (if harmful) last twice as long if you fail the saving throw. In addition, all spells and effects of that school used against you are always treated as though they're from a mythic source. You also may not benefit from spells and effects from the selected school, subject to GM discretion.",
			"",
			"***Weapon Weakness:*** The prophecies say that one weapon will be your doom. Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapons. Weapons from the selected group gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you. If a weapon from the selected group scores a critical hit against you, the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons from that group always bypass that reduction."

Each idea includes a basic synopsis of the plot, a list of some of the challenges the heroes could face, a look at the primary adversary, and ideas for further adventures.

It's tempting for many GMs to make that a part of a mythic campaign. While you can certainly use such a plot device in your game, the loss of power must be handled carefully to avoid turning an otherwise fun string of adventures into something no one wants to play anymore. Here are a few tips to make this idea work in a fun way.",

If the heroes are of a lower tier, they haven't used their mythic power enough to make the powerlessness storyline interesting. If they're of a higher tier, the gulf between their mythic story and the story being told now is so great that it may break the flow of the story.",

			"Powerlessness arcs should last no more than a couple sessions, lest the temporary loss of power start to seem like a permanent disability.",
			"",
			"Causes of the PCs' powerlessness need to be explainable- and either the characters know about it beforehand or someone informs them of the cause after they've lost their powers. It could be an event that comes to pass, like a lunar eclipse or a great volcano's eruption disrupting the flow of power in the world. Or a foe might enact a ritual to nullify the heroes' power. The PCs might even be responsible for their own loss of power, especially if the divine being who granted the powers doesn't approve of their recent activities.",
			"",
			"Solutions to the PCs' plight should make sense from a story perspective. Events pass, reinstating the PCs' mythic power (in which case, the PCs need merely to wait, and possibly fight to survive until then). The foe's rituals are undone by the temporarily normal PCs. Or penance can be granted as the PCs show that they're still worthy.",
			"",
			"Drama happens between the cause and solution: foes that should have been easy before become challenges again, and those the heroes have angered can now retaliate, whether they are monstrous foes or slighted townsfolk. The rewards acquired during this time should reflect the difficulty of the challenges the PCs face."

			"When a mythic creature creates a legendary item (using the [legendary item universal path ability](rule/universal_path_abilities), 1st tier), the item can have up to three additional abilities, but no more than the number of tiers possessed by the creature bonded to it. This maximum increases to six if the bonded creature selects the legendary item universal path ability twice, and then to 10 if the bonded creature selects the ability three times (again, the maximum cannot exceed the bonded creature's number of tiers). These abilities are added at the rate of one per day. Once selected, these abilities cannot be changed.",

The item becomes impossible to remove by any creature not bonded to it unless by means of a {spell/wish} or {spell/miracle} cast by a mythic creature of higher tier than the bonded creature.

If the creature who placed the eternal bond comes back to life or becomes mythic again, and this item is bonded to another, the bond reverts back to the eternally bonded creature at any time the eternally bonded creature wishes. Reinstating a bond in this way is a free action. If this item is broken, the bond is temporarily severed, but is reinstated when the item is repaired.

It can speak Common plus a number of additional languages based on its Intelligence score.

This metamagic feat is applied spontaneously and without changing the casting time. This ability can be placed only on a head, headband, staff, ring, or rod legendary item.",

			"***Powerful:*** An item with this ability has two additional uses of legendary power per day. This ability can be taken up to three times. The item must be a minor or major artifact to take this a second time, and a major artifact to take this a third time. This is a persistent ability.",
			"",
			"***Rejuvenating:*** The bearer of this item can expend uses of legendary power to rejuvenate her body. As a standard action, she can expend one use of legendary power to heal herself of 10 points of damage per mythic tier she possesses. Alternatively, as a standard action she can expend two uses of legendary power to remove a single condition affecting her.",

The item must be on the same plane as the bonded creature for this ability to function. This ability can be taken a second time, allowing the item to cross planes to return to the bonded creature. The item must be a major artifact to take this ability again.",

			"",
			"An item must be a weapon and be a minor or major artifact to have this ability.",

			"",
			"***Upgradable:*** This ability grants the bonded creature the ability to more easily increase the non-mythic magical power of the legendary item. If the base magic item has a version with a higher bonus or greater version (such as a +1 longsword, a +2 light steel shield, a {magic-wondrous/cloak of resistance +3}, an {magic-wondrous/amulet of mighty fists +4}, or a {magic-ring/minor ring of inner fortitude}), the bonded creature can improve it by performing a special ritual. She must spend a number of gold pieces equal to half the difference between the cost of the legendary item's current, non-mythic base item and the greater version she wishes to upgrade the item into. For example, she would pay 3,000 gp to upgrade a +1 longsword into a +2 longsword.",
			"",

			"A monster's mythic rank (MR) is a game statistic for monsters that's roughly equivalent to a mythic tier; monsters with only a little mythic power are 1st rank, and the greatest mythic monsters are 10th rank. Unlike PCs, monsters usually start with a specific mythic rank and that rank never changes. For example, a mythic troll is 2nd rank and is always going to be 2nd rank, unless the GM has a reason for its rank to increase - like if a tribe of trolls has an artifact that grants the trolls mythic power, and the longer it takes the PCs to deal with them, the more powerful the artifact makes these monsters.",
			"",
			"In terms of power, mythic ranks and mythic tiers are similar, but not exactly the same. For any ability, spell, magic item, or other rule that requires a mythic tier or interfaces with the tier rules, a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier. For example, a sword that gains additional abilities when wielded by a character of 3rd tier or higher gains those bonuses when wielded by a monster of 3rd rank or higher. A few mythic monsters have mythic tier abilities identical to those available to PCs; a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier for any effects dependent on tier. For example, a monster with the parry spell {rule/guardian/ path ability} uses its mythic rank to determine the level of spells it can parry with that ability.",
			"",
			"It is possible for a low-CR creature to have a high mythic rank, or for a high-CR creature to have a low mythic rank. For a typical monster that's acquired mythic power, its rank is equal to half its original CR. For example, a CR 4 owlbear that becomes a mythic creature should be 2nd rank. To determine a mythic monster's final CR, add half its mythic rank to its original CR. For example, a 2nd rank mythic owlbear's final CR is 5 (2 &times; 1/2 + 4). See {rule/Designing Encounters} for more details. All the monsters presented use this typical MR value.",

For example, a mythic creature that gains the {template/vampire/ template} has a mythic tier, and a non-mythic creature that gains the {template/mythic vampire/ template} has a mythic rank, but a mythic creature that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tier and gains ranks instead, as explained in the mythic vampire template.

Because you rarely check the Feats entry for a monster when rolling initiative, it would be easy to forget that ability when using the monster. As a reminder of this ability, a monster with that feat will have a footnote after its initiative modifier, pointing to this ability. The listed initiative modifier already includes the additional bonus from the {feat/Mythic |Improved Initiative} feat.",
			"",
			"***Feats:*** The creature's feats are listed here. Most mythic feats improve non-mythic feats, and have the non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. In these cases, the non-mythic feat isn't listed along with the mythic feat.",
			"",
			"***Special Attacks:*** All of the monsters presented have the {rule/mythic subtype}, which grants them the {umr/mythic power/ universal monster ability}, allows them to expend uses of mythic power to add surge dice to d20 rolls, and may add other abilities as well. When running a monster with mythic power, always remember that it can use the surge ability - especially because some mythic creatures don't use mythic power for anything else, so that ability is necessary for the monster to keep up with and challenge mythic PCs. (Plus, part of the fun of using mythic rules is getting to use mythic surges, and the GM should get to do that, too.)",
			"",
			"***Environment:*** The mythic monsters presented here list the same environment as the non-mythic version of the creature - by default, mythic trolls prefer cold mountains like common trolls do, and mythic owlbears prefer temperate forests like common owlbears do. Of course, you can change the environment of a mythic monster to anything appropriate for your campaign, especially if the mythic monster is unique. For example, if you want the one mythic hydra in your world to live in the desert instead of in marshes like non-mythic hydras, that change serves to make the mythic hydra even more unusual and iconic.",
			"",
			"***Organization:*** The mythic monsters presented here list the same information on organization as the non-mythic versions of the creatures. These stat blocks make no assumptions about the uniqueness or rarity of these mythic monsters in your campaign. This allows you to adapt existing encounters in printed adventures to a mythic campaign by replacing one, some, or all non-mythic creatures in a specific encounter with their mythic equivalents. For example, to challenge a group of mythic PCs in an adventure featuring an encounter with six trolls, you could replace any number of those trolls with mythic trolls - perhaps just the leader is a mythic troll, creating a slightly more difficult encounter, or perhaps all of them are mythic, resulting in a much harder challenge.",
			"",
			"***Treasure:*** Most of the mythic monsters presented here use the same treasure notation as their non-mythic counterparts. For example, trolls have standard treasure, so mythic trolls also have standard treasure. However, a mythic monster's CR will be higher than its non-mythic equivalent, so when awarding treasure you should account for the CR increase and adjust the monster's treasure accordingly. A mythic troll encountered with non-mythic trolls should have slightly better treasure because of its higher CR (just as a fiendish troll encountered with a gang of normal trolls should have better treasure). If a monster normally has NPC-type treasure (like an ogre does), the mythic version of that monster usually has better treasure than its non-mythic counterparts, since its CR is higher.",
			"",
			"Mythic monsters - especially intelligent ones - may be more likely to use magical treasures found in their lairs, perhaps out of some instinctive cunning about the item or because the item was given to the monster by the entity that granted the monster its mythic power. For example, a mythic hydra with an amulet of mighty fists +1 in its treasure hoard could be a sacred guardian created by the god of snakes, and the amulet could have been granted to the hydra by the god, giving the creature the full benefit of the item.",
			"",
			"***Special Abilities:*** These monsters include descriptions of the non-mythic monster's special abilities, so you don't need to reference the non-mythic monster in another book to use the mythic monster. In some cases, these descriptions are simplified or shortened to make room for the mythic monster's new abilities. If you have questions about how a monster's special ability works, refer to the full text of the non-mythic monster's original description in the Bestiary.",
			"",

Unless otherwise stated, a mythic monster lives and acts very much like its non-mythic counterpart."
