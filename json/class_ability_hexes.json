Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision."

This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion) effect."

When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead.
