			"Barring the use of magic, swimming is the main way to travel in an aquatic adventure. However, the Swim skill was written from the perspective of a primarily land-based campaign.",
			"",
			"### The Basics",
			"",
			"The basics of the [Swim skill](skill/swim) are the same in an aquatic campaign. When a creature uses a move or full-round action to swim, it attempts a Swim check against the appropriate DC based on how calm the water is and other local factors. On a success, it can move up to one quarter of its land speed with a single move, or half its land speed with a double move. On a failure, it doesn't make any progress, and on a failure by 5 or more it goes underwater. This last part, however, doesn't make any sense if the PC is already underwater. Instead, if a PC fails her check by 5 or more while underwater (or doesn't spend any actions to swim, thus not even attempting the check), she sinks or rises based on her {rule/buoyancy}.",
			"",
			"While swimming, a PC can't normally use the run or charge actions or take a 5-foot step. Every hour of swimming requires a successful DC 20 Swim check to avoid fatigue. Even on a success, an hour of swimming is still at least as strenuous as marching for an hour, and extensive swimming eventually requires a PC to attempt checks as per [forced marches](rule/overland_movement). Similarly, continually taking a double move to swim at half land speed counts as hustling. A creature can also walk on the ocean floor, lake bed, or other solid ground underwater as long as its buoyancy is swiftly sinking. When it does so, it moves at half its land speed without needing to attempt a Swim check.",
			"",
			"***Swim Speed:*** Creatures with a swim speed have a variety of advantages underwater. First of all, they can swim through normal water at their full swim speed without needing to attempt a Swim check. They can use the run and charge actions and take 5-foot steps with their swim speed. When they do need to attempt Swim checks to deal with a hazardous situation or perform a special action, they benefit from a sizable +8 racial bonus on their Swim checks. There might be an unusual circumstance where a creature has a swim speed that's actually slower than one-quarter of its land speed (for instance, a monk using the spell {spell/monkey fish} to gain a swim speed of 10 feet). Such a creature can swim at one-quarter of its land speed instead, but it sacrifices the benefits of its swim speed on rounds when it isn't using its swim speed."

		"description": [
			"When a creature fails its Swim check by 5 or more, or when it doesn't spend any actions to swim (whether voluntarily or due to paralysis or similar conditions), it either sinks or rises based on its buoyancy. There are three normal states of buoyancy: sinking, rising, and neutral. If a creature's buoyancy is sinking, it naturally sinks; if its buoyancy is rising, it naturally rises to the surface; and if its buoyancy is neutral, it hangs in place unless it expends effort.",
			"",
			"Land-dwelling creatures generally have a sinking buoyancy unless they are carrying a substantial amount of low-density gear (like wooden items, at least until they become waterlogged) and little or no high-density gear (such as items made from metal or stone). [Air tanks](equipment-misc/air_tank) in particular make it much easier to change your buoyancy to rising. It's also possible to adjust an air tank to hold just enough air to achieve a neutral buoyancy - but once a creature has done so, if it picks up other objects or uses the tank to breathe underwater, it loses its neutral buoyancy until it readjusts (which may require returning to the surface to refill the air tank).",
			"",
			"In addition to these three normal states of buoyancy, there are two extreme states: swiftly sinking and swiftly rising. If a creature is swiftly sinking, it and its gear are so dense that it can walk on the bottom of the body of water, but it also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to swim towards the surface or to stay off the bottom. A creature carrying plenty of dense stone or metal items gains this buoyancy state. If a creature is swiftly rising, it needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to submerge itself and stay submerged; a sizable air tank or other flotation device, or the help of magic, is needed to achieve this state.",
			"",
			"***Aquatic and Water Creatures:*** Most naturally aquatic creatures (those with the aquatic subtype) have some form of air bladder or other organ that allows them to adjust their buoyancy on the fly, enabling them to maintain neutral buoyancy as a free action on their turn (unless they are carrying something large with particularly high or low density), and creatures with the water subtype naturally have the same buoyancy as water.",
			"",
			"***Buoyancy Speed:*** A creature begins to sink or rise at the end of its turn the first time it badly fails (or does not attempt) a Swim check, moving up or down as appropriate at a speed of 10 feet; this speed increases by 10 feet each subsequent round unless the creature is stopped, to a maximum speed of 30 feet after 3 rounds. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. While sinking or rising because of its buoyancy, creatures are considered [off-balance](rule/off_balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"Once per round, a creature sinking or rising because of its buoyancy can stop its momentum by succeeding at a Swim check as a move action. A creature that chooses to continue moving in the direction of its buoyancy under its own power, rather than through uncontrolled rising or sinking, can do so with a successful Swim check without needing to stop first.",
			"",
			"If a creature's buoyancy changes instantly while sinking or rising from buoyancy (such as via jettisoning something it's holding or using magic), its buoyancy speed adjusts by 10 feet in the new direction each round. A creature that fails the DC 20 Swim check to move against its buoyancy while swiftly sinking or swiftly rising moves 30 feet in the appropriate direction immediately.",
			"",
			"***Moving Against Buoyancy:*** Much like flying upwards uses up twice as much of a flying creature's movement, each square of movement swimming in the opposite direction of a creature's buoyancy costs twice as much movement as normal (see {rule/Thinking in Three Dimensions} for more details). Creatures with a neutral buoyancy ignore this hindrance.",
			"",
			"***Drag:*** Sometimes, because a PC might want to alter her buoyancy (or simply because she wants to drag a particularly large piece of treasure back home), she might swim with an item that has significant surface area, like a giant treasure chest. In these cases, her speed is reduced by half (or more, at the GM's discretion). If the object is narrower in one dimension, like a pole, she can avoid drag by turning it so the narrow side faces the direction she wants to move; however, this adjustment requires a move action, so it slows her down if she needs to turn often."

			"While flying creatures can add a third dimension to land-based combat, such creatures are an exception rather than the rule. The main challenge three-dimensional adventuring presents is representing a creature's vertical position during combat. This challenge is tougher than usual because most flying in adventures still involves encounters relatively close to the ground, rather than in the open sky, but plenty of encounters in an underwater adventure may occur in open water, nowhere near the surface or bottom. Typical solutions for flying creatures like using stackable tokens or transparent dice boxes to elevate the flying creature all depend on the main map being a consistent bottom altitude, but in an underwater fight, the combatants could just as easily move farther down.",
			"",
			"One way to avoid physically representing the third dimension is to use your imagination instead of a battlemap, but given that it's even harder to keep track of all three dimensions in your head, it becomes difficult to keep accurate relative distances that way. Another simple way to handle it is to mark a creature's depth relative to its starting depth, either on a small token you move along with the creature or directly on the battle map. This solution doesn't involve as much work as creating a complicated three-dimensional representation of the battle, but it isn't always easy to judge the relative vertical position without looking at the numbers and thinking about them. In the end, use the solution that works best for you whether that's judging distances in your head or crafting elaborate physical representations.",
			"",
			"***Flanking:*** All the usual rules for flanking still apply in three dimensions, but now there are far more ways for a target to potentially be flanked. It also means a larger number of weaker creatures can gang up on a stronger creature, since there are 26 valid spaces adjacent to a given square, rather than 8.",
			"",
			"***Flexible Movement:*** In a normal adventure, particularly before magical flight becomes easily accessible, it's easier to predict a character's exact path. For instance, on land, to get to a cave in the woods, the characters have to walk through the woods, and they are likely to use a forest trail that allows them to move quickly, rather than heading off into the deep foliage. Particularly in a dungeon, denizens can place traps with the expectation that characters will step in very particular places, and in all likelihood, a character will do so. However, underwater, all bets are off. If the PCs need to get to a cave in a kelp forest, they can just swim over the kelp forest until they are directly above the cave and then swim down, barely spending any time in the kelp forest at all.",
			"",
			"Even in an underwater dungeon, unless both the ceiling and walls narrow to 5 feet (which could be a giveaway that the characters are being channeled into a trap), the characters have significant more leeway in where they move, which means that dungeon denizens should set proximity traps covering a wider radius, rather than depending on a particular square. The third dimension also makes it harder to blockade or patrol a perimeter, since there are so many more ways to slip past; essentially, defenders are patrolling along the surface of a sphere instead of the perimeter of a circle."

		"description": [
			"One of the most immediately noticeable differences when fighting underwater is that slashing and bludgeoning attacks are made with a -2 penalty and deal half damage, making piercing weapons the best bet for an underwater adventure. If you're off-balance (see {rule/Off-Balance and Prone Underwater}), your attacks with piercing weapons also take a -2 penalty and deal half damage. {spell/Freedom of movement} can negate these penalties entirely and has [a variety of other effects](rule/freedom_of_movement). Additionally, {feat/Aquadynamic Focus} can specifically assist with this situation. Creatures with a natural swim speed from the aquatic or water subtype don't take these penalties with their inherent natural attacks. For instance, a kraken's bludgeoning tentacle attacks don't take penalties, but if it took the ectoplasmatist {class/spiritualist} archetype and gained two slashing ectoplasmic lash attacks, those would still take the penalties. Attacks that deal bludgeoning damage by pushing water, such as a {class/kineticist/'s} water blast, also take no penalty and deal full damage underwater.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Attacks:*** Traditional physical ranged weapon attacks underwater are much more challenging due to the increased drag from the water compared to air. Ranged attacks normally take a -2 penalty for every 5 feet of water, in addition to the normal penalty for range increments. The exceptions are the underwater light crossbow and underwater heavy crossbow, which ignore the penalty for ranged attacks underwater but have a significantly reduced range increment underwater. Thrown attacks don't usually work underwater at all, but if you can move directly above your opponent, you can throw a properly prepared piercing weapon (one made of stone, metal, or another particularly dense material) straight down, counting on its sinking buoyancy to propel it to its target.",
			"",
			"Hypothetically, you could do the reverse with a weapon of extremely low density, but achieving such a low density while still having a shape that allows for throwing and enough mass to damage would generally require an unusual material or magical assistance. At the end of a downward-thrown object's maximum range, it continues to sink, but its trajectory is far too unpredictable to hit anything with its dangerous end.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuvers:*** Most combat maneuvers work underwater, although you take a -2 penalty on {rule/grapple} combat maneuver checks if you don't have a Swim speed (a successful damage action taken as part of a maintained grapple deals full damage, even if your unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage). Even [tripping](rule/trip) is possible underwater with [special rules](rule/off_balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"***Cover from the Surface:*** Due to water's surface tension, creatures attempting to attack through water's surface count its surface as [total cover](rule/cover) (if a creature is partially submerged, it gains proportionally less cover); this applies even to spells that require attack rolls. The exception to this rule is attacks that deal piercing damage: these can penetrate the water's surface but take a -2 penalty to do so. This is a change from the [rule on cover](rule/underwater_combat) from the water's surface in the Core Rulebook, but it allows actions like spearfishing and firing harpoons from whaling ships."

		"description": [
			"***\"Off-balance\"*** is a special state (though not technically a condition) that is listed in the [Combat Adjustments Underwater table](rule/underwater_combat). A creature off-balance in the water loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it, and attacks it makes with piercing weapons are made at a -2 penalty and deal half damage. A creature typically becomes off-balance by failing a Swim check, which makes it off-balance for a round, even if it has a neutral buoyancy and doesn't sink or rise.",
			"",
			"***Tripping Underwater:*** While flying creatures specifically can't be tripped, the Core Rulebook doesn't specify whether the same is true of swimming creatures. Being prone doesn't mean much for a swimming creature, so instead, a successful trip against a swimming creature forces that creature to attempt a Swim check at a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check to trip; failing the Swim check causes the creature to become off-balance. Many aquatic creatures can't be tripped or have a high Swim bonus and thus can always take 10, so this tactic isn't always effective, but when it is, it can make dexterous foes much easier to hit. However, being off-balance doesn't affect most of the target's attack rolls, and the target can regain its balance simply by succeeding at a Swim check to move on its next turn as normal."

Thus, a creature benefitting from freedom of movement can swing weapons without penalties (though objects that leave its possession, like thrown weapons or ammo from ranged weapons, lose this benefit), lift objects without drag, and walk along the bottom at full speed. The creature automatically succeeds at all Swim checks as the water offers no significant resistance to its movement. If the creature has the ability to do so, it can fly or use spells like {spell/air walk} to freely move around as if it were in air.

			"While various spells have different effects underwater, the most fundamental hindrance to spellcasting, at least at low levels, is the fact that a creature holding its breath must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast a spell at all, whether or not the spell has a verbal component. If the spell has a verbal component, expelling the air needed to incant the spell reduces the creature's remaining number of rounds of breath by 3 (which stacks with the reduction from performing a standard or full-round action; see the [Drowning section](rule/drowning_aa)), and a creature can't finish the spell if it doesn't have enough breath left. Spells that have verbal components and casting times of swift or immediate actions instead decrease the caster's remaining number of rounds of breath by 1.",
			"",
			"Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater as long as they're stored in watertight containers, and aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use underwater. The Core Rulebook describes the effect of [fire spells underwater](rule/underwater_combat); some other spells exist that function differently.",
			"",
			"***Acid Spells:*** Conjuration (creation) spells that conjure nonmagical acid, like {spell/acid arrow}, don't work properly underwater, as the water dilutes the acid harmlessly. Evocation spells that deal magical acid damage, like a {spell/fireball} affected by the {feat/Elemental Spell} metamagic feat, work normally underwater.",
			"",
			"***Cloud and Weather Spells:*** Cloud spells such as {spell/fog cloud} and {spell/obscuring mist} specifically say that they don't work underwater, though the {feat/Murky Spell} metamagic feat can create equivalent mist spells underwater. Other spells that create weather that would be appropriate only on land, like {spell/ice storm} and {spell/sleet storm}, do not function underwater at all. {spell/Twilight haze}, however, is an illusion and thus works underwater.",
			"",
			"***Cold Spells:*** Spells that deal cold damage but don't normally conjure ice, like {spell/cone of cold}, instead deal half cold damage and half piercing damage, as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater. This has no effect on spells that already create ice, rather than just cold damage.",
			"",
			"***Electricity Spells:*** While normal electricity, such as that from a natural thunderstorm, tends to disperse in all directions underwater, magical electricity spells hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, with one exception: visible and audible lightning bolts and sparks are the result of combusted air, and they don't happen underwater. Because of this, creatures that fail to identify an electricity spell that requires a ranged touch attack are flat-footed against the first such ranged touch attack during a fight, as they don't realize they need to dodge the invisible projectile (unless they otherwise have reason to expect it, like a spellcaster who can cast such spells). This doesn't apply to melee touch spells like {spell/shocking grasp}, since the creature can still see the spellcaster's hand moving towards it.",
			"",
			"***Fire Spells:*** While normal fire (including alchemist's fire) and most supernatural fire can't burn underwater at all, fire spells have a chance to transform into steam instead. Whenever you cast a fire spell underwater, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to channel the heat into the water and create steam, dealing the same amount of fire damage as normal but without secondary effects of fire, like igniting combustibles. A fire spell must be either entirely steam or entirely fire, which means that if it covers an area that would normally extend beyond the water's surface, you must choose whether to affect the region above the water or below, and the surface blocks line of effect for the rest of the spell. A spell or spell-like ability with the fire descriptor that already creates steam (like a {class/kineticist/'s} steam blast) doesn't require the caster level check to create steam; only spells that would normally create an actual fire require the check. The {feat/Steam Spell} metamagic feat makes it easier to cast fire spells underwater.",
			"",
			"***Invisibility:*** Underwater, an invisible creature still displaces water, making it possible to spot and target it as if it had only concealment, as per the description of {spell/invisibility}. The {spell/invisibility bubble} spells hide the displaced water and thus allow effective invisibility underwater.",
			"",
			"***Sonic Spells:*** While sound travels four times faster and farther in water than air, it also takes more energy to do so, so in the end sonic spells have the same results underwater as they do on land. At the GM's discretion, a spellcaster can choose to instead double the range or area, halve the damage, and decrease the DC by 2 for sonic attacks."

			"Drowning is one of the most obvious dangers of underwater adventuring. As creature can typically hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. Whenever a creature takes a standard or full-round action, it expends 1 additional round of breath, so practically speaking, if a creature wants to fight or double move each round, it can do so only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. Intentionally exhaling breath expends 1 to 3 rounds for each exhaling action - generally 1 round for a small exhalation, and 3 rounds for an extended exhalation like singing a song or casting a spell. Certain magic, like the {spell/suffocation} spell, can expel all of a creature's held breath.",
			"",
			"Once a creature has used up these rounds of safety, it lives on a knife's edge between life and death. Each round, the creature must succeed at a Constitution check, with a DC starting at 10 and increasing by 1 each round after the first. Once it fails this check, the creature begins to drown, falling unconscious (and dropping to 0 hit points if it currently had more), dropping to -1 hit points on the next round, and dying on the round after that. At any point, if the creature becomes able to breathe (perhaps because someone dragged it out of the water or cast a spell to assist it), it ceases drowning but doesn't regain any lost hit points. Note that if a creature holds its breath in a situation where it could normally breathe, it won't fall unconscious if it fails its Constitution check.",
			"",
			"Because of the prohibitive limitations of holding one's breath, underwater explorers from the surface use a variety of techniques to extend their ability to breathe underwater. The most common is {spell/water breathing}, which is extremely long-lasting and can protect an entire group with one casting. A simpler, short-term solution is {spell/air bubble}, which can protect a single creature for a few minutes - but not usually enough for an underwater adventure. The most powerful option is {spell/life bubble}; while its duration is half that of water breathing, it also protects against many other underwater hazards such as extreme temperature and pressure. Those who prefer a mundane alternative to ephemeral (and dispellable) magic tend to use [air tanks](equipment-misc/air_tank) to store additional air, but characters hoping to stay underwater find that carrying around more than a few extra breaths of air sets their buoyancy to swiftly rising, almost like wearing a giant life preserver, so this solution is effective only for a strong swimmer or someone with access to magic to alter buoyancy."

Some oceanographers add a fifth zone, the Abaddonian zone, which describes areas 20,000 feet and below in the deepest ocean trenches.",

			"***Pressure:*** Most aquatic creatures have adapted to depths corresponding roughly to one or more of these zones in particular, and ignore pressure damage while within their native depth range unless they instantaneously transport from one depth to another, as with {spell/dimension door}. [Pressure damage rules are found here.](rule/water_dangers) Surface creatures, on the other hand, treat depths of 0 to 100 feet as their native zone. For every minute spent below their native zone, a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every additional 100 feet beyond the first. The DC is initially 15, and it increases by 1 for every minute after the first. After five successful Fortitude saves (consecutive or not), the creature adapts to the pressure. If a creature is within its native depth range but experiencing pressure dangers due to instantaneous travel, this adaptation to the new pressure happens all at once. If the creature is outside its native range, this adaptation adjusts its native range down or up by 100 feet, as appropriate. A surface dweller swimming downward may adapt to the new depth, but will then experience pressure hazards when it ascends back to the surface.",
			"",
			"For instance, if Valeros swims down 220 feet, he is 120 feet outside his native range of 0 to 100 feet, so he needs to attempt a Fortitude save every minute to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage. If he succeeds at five Fortitude saves, his native range shifts to 100-200 feet, and he must attempt Fortitude saves to avoid taking 1d6 points of damage each minute. After five more successful Fortitude saves, his native range is now 200-300 feet, and he takes no further damage from pressure, but if he ascends back to the surface, he must resume attempting Fortitude saves to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage from the reversing pressure. Because of the dangers of changing pressure, aquatic explorers find it safest to adjust their depth gradually unless they have special means of avoiding pressure hazards. Spells like {spell/freedom of movement} and {spell/life bubble} prevent pressure damage. {spell/Pressure adaptation} and {spell/stabilize pressure} are more focused and lower-level options.",
			"",
			"***Temperature:*** Immersion in water can cause hypothermia in land-dwelling creatures at temperatures that would normally be perfectly safe on land. Generally, creatures in water that is 80&deg; F or higher are safe from hypothermia. Water from 60&deg; to 80&deg; F is equivalent to cold weather (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage; [see here](rule/cold_dangers) for information on determining the DC). Water from 40&deg; to 60&deg; F functions like severe cold (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage). Water from 32&deg; to 40&deg; F acts as extreme cold (dealing an automatic 1d6 points of lethal cold damage each minute). Water below 32&deg; F (which is generally possible only in areas with high levels of salt) deals an automatic 2d6 points of lethal cold damage per minute.",
			"",
			"Sea creatures are adapted to the water temperature in their native zones. The {spell/endure elements} spell protects its target from water as cold as 32&deg; F (rather than -50&deg; F in air), which is generally enough to cover temperature extremes in the ocean. By contrast, water rarely becomes warm enough to provide heat dangers except in the presence of a hazard like a hydrothermal vent, as even the most extreme temperatures in the sunlight zone tend to cap at around 104&deg; F.",
			"",
			"***Sunlight Zone:*** The sunlight zone contains all aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis, so it's home to both phytoplankton and seaweed. It's also the home of most marine mammals, many sharks, some jellyfish, and most of the fish familiar to fisherfolk. The visibility estimates in the {skill/Perception} rules assume sufficient light levels (or a means of seeing in the dark), which are typically present only in the sunlight zone. The water temperature in the sunlight zone varies based on the surface conditions, anywhere from over 100&deg; F to below 30&deg; F.",
			"",
			"***Twilight Zone:*** In the twilight zone, only about 1% of the light from the surface remains: not enough for photosynthesis. This also isn't enough light for a creature with normal vision to see, but creatures with low-light vision can still see to a distance of around 60 feet as though in dim light. Many creatures living in this zone either have darkvision or rely on precise senses other than sight to guide them, while others are bioluminescent. Roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. The temperature in the twilight zone ranges from about 68&deg; F at the top to around 39&deg; F at the bottom, with very few variations at any given depth.",
			"",
			"***Midnight Zone:*** The midnight zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, requiring darkvision or nonvisual senses for any creature that doesn't have its own source of light. Fueled by the detritus that sinks from above, many types of {monster/squid/s} and [octopuses](monster/octopus) and some {monster/kraken/s} live in this zone, along with some large {monster/whale/s} and other creatures of the deep, but it's harder for fish to survive here. The temperature in the midnight zone is generally 39&deg; F throughout. The midnight zone usually extends to the bottom.",
			"",
			"***Abyssal Zone:*** In regions where the ocean floor is more than 13,000 feet below the surface, the Abyssal zone lurks beneath the midnight zone, a region that's dark and cold even compared to the midnight zone, and devoid of even the falling detritus scavenged by midnight zone denizens. Named for {rule/the Abyss}, this zone contains unnatural and horrific creatures mixed in with other fauna. [Giant squids](monster/giant_squid), {monster/kraken/s}, and other tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, despite the 35&deg; to 39&deg; F temperature. Other creatures congregate around the warmth of the zone's hydrothermal vents, gaining nourishment from the vents' expulsions.",
			"",
			"***Abaddonian Zone:*** Some scholars, particularly among deep-sea races, utter dark whispers of a fifth and final zone that exists only in the depths of the deepest ocean trenches, over 20,000 feet below the water's surface. Supposedly, pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface world, combined with low temperatures and ambient magic, create within these trenches a nightmarish tableau that hardly seems it could exist on the Material Plane. Amorphous creatures like jellyfish, sea cucumbers, and tube worms cling to life in this inhospitable environment, eking out a life amidst beings of unfathomable malevolence. While scholars have funded expeditions to gather information on the Abaddonian zone, there are few, if any, survivors to give their accounts of those expeditions, and certainly none who remained sane."

			"Currents in the ocean (or a similarly large body of water) work similarly to [rivers](rule/aquatic_terrain). Each current has a particular speed (measured in feet per round), width, and direction, and at the beginning of a creature's turn, the current pushes it that distance. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to creatures not in the same current. A creature can try to swim against the current's flow on its turn to stay in place, but it's usually a better idea to swim perpendicular to the current to reach the edge and exit the current. Fortunately, while rivers can reach speeds up to 90 feet per round, the fastest natural ocean currents are usually not much faster than 50 feet per round in the sunlight zone, and are slower the deeper one travels. This is because currents are mainly influenced by the weather near the surface and tiny discrepancies in temperature far below the surface, and the effects of the latter are not as strong. Currents always count as at least rough water ({skill/Swim} DC 15), and faster currents count as at least stormy water (Swim DC 20).",
			"",
			"The majority of the ocean does not count as running water, but currents do. Thus while the spell {spell/locate creature} functions underwater, it rarely extends to its full range, since even an extremely slow current blocks the spell. Likewise, {template/vampire/s} tempt fate in the ocean by exposing themselves to the risk of an unexpected current."

The most powerful whirlpools can reach a maximum current speed of around 200 feet per round, spinning in a circle and generating a centripetal force to pull nearby creatures and objects into the whirlpool and prevent those caught in the whirlpool from leaving. Whirlpool movement doesn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity, because no one caught in the current is in a position to make one.",
			"",
			"Conditions are so rough in maelstroms that Swim checks reach DC 40 or higher. Creatures caught in a whirlpool take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round for every 50 feet of the whirlpool's speed.

			"Many spells can place curses on unfortunate victims. Their effects are usually simple and can be ended with the right spell (but never {spell/dispel magic}). All curse spells have the curse descriptor. The most well-known is {spell/bestow curse}, which allows the caster to invent her own effect in line with the listed options (no worse than a 50% chance of losing actions, a -4 penalty on checks, or a -6 penalty to an ability score). Effects in line with that power level include the following, though ultimately they are limited only by the caster's imagination and the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"- When the victim is adjacent to the area of a damaging spell or spell-like effect (even one he created himself), the area expands to include the victim.",
			"- The victim can't heal naturally, and magical healing heals the victim by only half the usual amount (minimum 1 point). The victim's fast healing and regeneration, if any, are likewise halved.",
			"- The victim is plagued by cacophonous sounds and strobing lights that only she can hear and see. She is distracted (-5 penalty on Perception checks), cannot take 10 on skill checks, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + spell level) to successfully cast spells.",
			"- Any time the victim picks up or retrieves an object (including drawing a weapon or ammunition), there is a 50% chance that she immediately drops it. If she drops ammunition while attempting to make a ranged attack, that particular attack is lost.",
			"",
			"***Save DCs:*** The stat block for a curse lists the save DC. For curses that can be created by a spell, this usually represents the minimum DC. If a spell is used to create a curse in your game, calculate the DC using the caster's ability score and the spell level as normal.",
			"",
			"***Optional Rule:*** Spontaneous Curses",
			"",
			"Although spellcasters can curse targets more easily than others, in times of great emotion and the need for vengeance, other creatures can channel divine or arcane energy to create a spontaneous curse. A curse can be improvised only under great stress, whether by the deepest indignity, seething hatred, cold revenge, or as a dying act (all at the GM's discretion), though in any case, never more than once in a month. Spontaneous curses are most commonly placed upon those who violate a taboo or a sacred or unholy place. Sometimes gods or other supernatural beings curse mortals who fail tests of character or who trespass where they are not welcome.",
			"",
			"If the GM allows a creature to place a spontaneous curse, that creature must have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or (religion). Such a creature can attempt to use a curse with a listed DC less than or equal to 10 + its number of ranks in the skill. Creatures with a curse ability, as well as some creatures closely associated with curses (such as angels, fey, hags, and undead), can curse a target without meeting this requirement. Improvising a curse reduces the cursing creature's Charisma score by 2, and this decrease remains as long as the curse lasts; the cursing creature cannot dismiss its improvised curse."

			"The most conventional way to rid a victim of a curse is the spell {spell/remove curse}, occasionally with the aid of other or more powerful magic. When making a new curse, especially one with a strong story background, consider novel ways to remove the curse beyond just casting a spell, as with the spell {spell/conditional curse}. Robbers might be cursed until they return every ill-gotten coin, while a haughty aristocrat might suffer until she cleans the feet of a dozen beggars. In these cases, it's best to make the victim vaguely aware of how to end his torment, but let him discover the specific details on his own through either research or trial and error. Curses with story-based remedies are often hard to break with {spell/remove curse} and {spell/break enchantment}. Increase the DC for removal by 2, 5, or even 10 based on the power of the curse. Particularly powerful curses resist {spell/remove curse} and {spell/break enchantment} entirely, requiring either specific conditions for removal or the application of {spell/limited wish}, {spell/miracle}, or {spell/wish}.",

A simple cleansing ritual might suffice to remove them, which the PCs could discover through exploration, research, or a successful Knowledge (religion) check. Such curses could even fade over the course of days or weeks. While many NPC casters offer curse removal with no questions asked, it is common knowledge that curses are rarely picked up accidentally. Some of these casters might want to know the circumstances behind the curse (often employing Sense Motive or even divination magic during the discussion). Good-aligned churches might expect acts of atonement or charity as at least partial payment for removing a justly gained curse."

			"***Effect*** If the disease deals ability damage, each time the affected creature fails a saving throw to resist the disease's effects by 5 or more, 1 point of that ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain instead. If the affected creature rolls a natural 1 on a saving throw to resist the disease's effects, all of the ability score damage becomes permanent ability score drain.",

If the diseased creature fails four consecutive saving throws, it is nauseated until the next time it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the disease's effects. These penalties are in addition to any other effects of the disease, and cannot be removed as long as the creature remains diseased. Even if the creature is normally immune to the sickened or nauseated condition, that condition still applies; only immunity to diseases protects against gaining the condition from a virulent disease."

			"The following diseases blend the [traditional style of diseases](rule/afflictions) found in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook with the [disease progressions](rule/diseases_and_poisons). Each of these diseases progresses through a series of stages, from carrier to terminal, and each stage comes with its own horrifying symptoms. The DC listed for each disease is a baseline for the most common form of the disease, but higher-DC strains of these diseases exist, especially in the vicinity of disease-bearing monsters and plague-worshiping cultists.",
			"",
			"These diseases do not have onset periods. When the affected creature fails its initial save and becomes infected with the disease, it immediately moves into the first stage of the disease, which is carrier, though it doesn't suffer the disease's effect. After this, the affected creature attempts subsequent saving throws at regular intervals, defined by the disease's frequency, just like any other disease. Whenever the affected creature fails a subsequent saving throw against the disease, it suffers the disease's listed effect and also moves to the next stage of the disease (progressing from carrier to early, early to moderate, and so on). As long as the affected creature remains diseased, it suffers all of the effects listed for its current stage, as well as the effects of any previous stages. When the affected creature reaches the terminal stage, it can no longer fulfill the cure condition without magic; most creatures don't survive long at this stage. Whenever the affected creature fulfills the cure condition listed for the disease, it moves to the previous stage of the disease. If this would cause it to move to a stage prior to carrier, it is completely cured of the disease. Any effect that would normally completely cure the affected creature of a disease (such as a {spell/remove disease} spell) similarly moves the affected creature to the previous stage of the disease instead.",
			"",
			"Several of these diseases impose certain conditions at various stages. These conditions can't be cured as long as the affected creature remains at that stage or a worse stage, even by effects that would normally be able to do so. These effects typically end automatically once the creature is cured of the disease or moves to a less severe stage. Only immunity to disease can prevent these conditions; no other immunities apply against these conditions. Occasionally, a disease might even have an effect that is permanent, and persists once the disease is cured. In these cases, the effect's description states what measures (if any) can undo the effect, but these measures are generally effective only once the disease has been cured.",

			"***Early:*** The affected creature's skin darkens, and the creature's attitude worsens, making it prone to violent outbursts. The affected creature gains a +1 alchemical bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, and takes a -2 penalty to its Armor Class. Its tainted blood is unable to clot, and rushes out of even minor wounds. Whenever the affected creature takes at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, it also takes 2 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with other bleed damage, including itself. Whenever the affected creature takes bleed damage in this way, a thin but far-reaching spray of blood erupts from the wound, exposing all creatures in a 15-foot cone (pointing toward the source of the attack) to the disease unless they succeed at Reflex saving throws at the disease's DC.",
			"",
			"***Moderate:*** Blood begins to ooze through the affected creature's pores, coating its skin in a thin, red sheen. The alchemical bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls increases to +2, and the penalty to the creature's Armor Class becomes -4. Whenever the affected creature takes damage, it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or fly into a berserk rage, in which it is compelled to attack the nearest creature each round for 1 minute, regardless of whether it's a friend or foe. The amount of bleed damage the affected creature takes after being dealt 5 or more points of piercing or slashing damage increases to 5.",
			"",
			"***Severe:*** The affected creature is constantly staggered. Additionally, the berserker rage caused by the disease clouds the mind of the affected creature, which is constantly compelled to attack the nearest creature. The affected creature can attempt a Will save at the disease's DC as a free action to suppress this effect for 1 minute, but if it fails this save, it can't try again for 1 hour; even if it succeeds, it must continue to attempt a save whenever it takes damage to avoid flying back into a berserk state.",
			"",
			"***Terminal:*** The affected creature can no longer attempt a saving throw to suppress its rage. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even on a successful saving throw, the affected creature takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain. If the affected creature dies at this stage, its body explodes in a shower of gore, exposing all creatures within 20 feet to the disease unless they succeed at Reflex saves at the disease's DC.",

			"",
			"***Early:*** The affected creature's mind is flooded with calming chemicals, which put the creature in a tranquil, calm state. The affected creature cannot gain any morale bonuses or penalties, and it takes a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Additionally, the creature takes a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks, as the brain moss interferes with critical thinking.",
			"",
			"***Moderate:*** The affected creature becomes placid and incredibly impressionable. It cannot take hostile actions, although whenever another creature takes a hostile action against the affected creature, it can attempt a Will save at the disease's DC to suppress this effect for 1 minute. Additionally, whenever anyone makes a request of the affected creature, it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or be compelled to perform the request, similar to a creature that failed a saving throw against the {spell/suggestion} spell, except this suggestibility is a nonmagical disease effect (not a spell, spell-like ability, enchantment, or compulsion).",
			"",
			"***Severe:*** The fungus begins to cause intense hallucinations in the affected creature, making it constantly confused. Additionally, once every 1d4 hours, it has a hallucination that causes it to be dazed for 1 minute, after which time it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or be compelled to perform an act chosen by the GM or determined at random, as a result of the delusions (similar to the effect at the moderate stage).",
			"",
			"***Terminal:*** The fungus begins to consume the brain tissue of the affected creature, whose brain can no longer control its body. The affected creature falls unconscious and remains unconscious for as long as it remains at this stage of the disease. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even if it succeeds at a saving throw at this stage, it takes 4 points of Constitution and Intelligence damage.",

			"",
			"This rare, tropical disease causes living creatures to turn into feral, ghoul-like entities, and when fatal, often causes the affected creature to rise as a ghoul. The creature's metabolism rises at an incredible rate, forcing it to devour untenable amounts of food. Eating only further fuels the disease, and all victims of this affliction quickly develop an emaciated, corpselike appearance.",

			"",
			"***Early:*** The affected creature's skin turns a deep shade of yellow, while the creature's temperature begins to rise. Additionally, the affected creature's ravenous appetite worsens. As long as it remains at this stage of the disease or worse, it treats each hour as though it were a full day for the purposes of the frequency and amount of food it must eat in order to avoid starvation (including time spent sleeping). Finally, it develops a strong craving for raw meat, and must consume at least 4 ounces of uncooked meat per hour or become sickened until it does so.",
			"",
			"***Moderate:*** The affected creature's body begins to quickly waste away, as muscle and fat are consumed to feed its growing hunger. Further, its body begins to constantly exude a stench of rotting meat, which cannot be removed with any amount of bathing. The affected creature is constantly sickened. Additionally, whenever the creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it takes 3d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6. Finally, whenever it comes within 10 feet of any amount of meat, including the bodies of slain creatures, it must succeed at a Will save against the disease's DC or be compelled to spend 1 minute gorging itself on the meat.",
			"",
			"***Severe:*** The affected creature's teeth begin to grow and twist painfully, fusing together to form four massive fangs. The creature gains a primary bite natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small). Further, its hunger-addled mind drives it to favor this attack over all others. It can no longer cast spells or use other activated special abilities, nor can it use manufactured weapons; it is able to make only full attacks with its bite and other natural attacks. Finally, whenever the affected creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it takes 6d6 points of damage, rather than 1d6.",
			"",
			"***Terminal:*** The affected creature completely loses control. It is compelled to attack any living creature it encounters in an attempt to devour its victim's flesh, preferably while still alive. Player characters who reach this stage are under the GM's control until they are cured. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes nonlethal damage from starvation, it also takes 2 points of Constitution damage. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. A creature that dies while at this stage of the disease rises as a ghoul (or ghast, if it had 5 or more Hit Dice) after 24 hours.",

			"### Gore Worms",
			"",
			"These parasites derive their name from their habit of devouring their hosts from the inside, leaving them as putrid sacs of blood and worms. Gore worms release their microscopic eggs in sporelike clouds that make their way into the bloodstream when inhaled. Eventually, the eggs anchor themselves within a host's body and grow until they reach nearly 2 inches in length. Adults burrow out through the host's skin and release their eggs into the air. The worms cannot survive outside of a host for more than a few hours, though they can inhabit corpses as easily as living creatures.",

			"***Carrier:*** The gore worm eggs travel throughout the creature's body via its circulatory system. The affected creature doesn't suffer any particular symptoms at this stage.",
			"",
			"***Early:*** The affected creature develops swelling, blisterlike growths that ooze blood and are incredibly painful when touched. Whenever the creature takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, it takes 1d6 additional points of nonlethal damage. Additionally, if the creature is wearing armor, then whenever it takes a standard action, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, or 2d6 points if wearing heavy armor.",
			"",
			"***Moderate:*** The gore worms hatch. The affected creature can feel them writhing and moving beneath its skin, and others can even see the worms moving occasionally. The affected creature is constantly sickened. Furthermore, whenever it takes more than a single standard or move action in a round, the worms roil angrily, causing the host to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds afterward. Finally, magical healing greatly agitates the worms, and whenever the affected creature is the target of a spell with the healing subschool, the worms whip into a frenzy, dealing 2 points of Constitution damage.",
			"",
			"***Severe:*** The gore worms burrow holes through the affected creature's skin and extend portions of their bodies out into the air, giving the appearance that the affected creature's body has been covered in dozens of tiny gaping mouths with serpentine tongues. The affected creature is constantly staggered and exhausted.",
			"",
			"***Terminal:*** The gore worms begin devouring the affected creature's internal organs. The affected creature is constantly nauseated. If it fails a saving throw against the disease's progress at this stage, it dies. Even if it succeeds, it takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain, in addition to the disease's normal effects.",
			"",
			"---",

			"### Skin Wastes",
			"",
			"This disease brings intense itching, then hardening and cracking of the skin, and eventually the transformation of all soft tissue to bone.",

			"",
			"***Carrier:*** The affected creature suffers from itchy, irritating skin, and localized, splotchy rashes. At this stage, the disease has no mechanical effect.",
			"",
			"***Early:*** The affected creature's skin becomes gray and flaky. The itchiness caused by the disease worsens, and the creature must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC each waking hour or frantically spend much of that hour scratching away at its skin. For each failed Will save after the first in the same day, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage, as its scratching begins to break the skin and leave bloody gouges.",
			"",
			"***Moderate:*** The itching intensifies, and the amount of damage dealt by scratching increases to 1d8. Additionally, during combat and other stressful situations, the affected creature must scratch its skin each round as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each round, the affected creature can suppress the need to scratch that round with a successful Will save at the disease's DC, but if it attempts the saving throw and fails, it spends the entire round scratching.",
			"",
			"***Severe:*** The affected creature's skin becomes cracked and broken, and even moving is incredibly painful. As long as the creature remains at this stage, the affected creature is sickened and staggered. Additionally, whenever the affected creature takes damage, it takes double the amount of damage it normally would.",
			"",
			"***Terminal:*** The affected creature's skin and organs slowly transform into solid bone, until eventually the creature is effectively petrified. The creature is constantly nauseated. For the first 24 hours at this stage, its Dexterity score is reduced by 1 each hour. During this time, its skin and organs transform into a single, solid mass of bone. Once its Dexterity score reaches 0 or after 24 hours have passed, it is petrified. A {spell/stone to flesh} spell can undo the petrification, but the creature must immediately succeed at a Fortitude save against the disease's DC to survive the change. Even if it does, its Dexterity is again reduced by 1 each hour, and it eventually becomes petrified once more unless cured of the disease."

			"",
			"The following locations have particular features that fit well in the context of a horror game, such as minor unusual magic or creepy special effects. Though they might not be directly threatening like the hazards in the next section (and thus don't possess their own CR), they nonetheless add an ambience of horror and a sense of unease to the game, and sometimes make the journey through the surrounding area much less pleasant.",
			"",
			"***Divining Water:*** Certain special bodies of water grant insight into the spirits of those reflected in them. The reflections of creatures that appear in divining water show each creature as though it were viewed with {spell/true seeing}, bypassing any illusions or polymorph effects and revealing the creature's true form. However, either right away or after establishing their divinatory properties, the reflections sometimes shift to show images of horrific creatures (generally undead and evil outsiders) instead of creatures' true forms, especially when the viewer is in a state of fear or mental turmoil.",
			"",
			"***Faceless Statue:*** These specially created stone statues are humanoid in appearance and elegantly carved, but they stand out because of their completely blank visages, which appear as though the sculptor simply forgot to give them faces. Whenever a character casts {spell/project image} within range of such a statue, she can project her image onto the statue, instead of creating the spell's normal effect. This causes the statue's blank face to transform into that of the caster, and the statue mimics the caster's actions, rather than a projected image doing so. The statue has a movement speed of 0 feet, but a caster projecting her image through the statue can direct it to make up to two slam attacks per round as a full-round action, using the caster's base attack bonus. The slam attacks each deal 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. A {spell/project image} spell cast in this way has a duration measured in minutes, rather than rounds, and the caster isn't required to maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. A faceless statue can also be affected by {spell/enter image}, causing the faceless surface to transform into an image of the caster's face for the duration of the spell, instead of producing the spell's normal effects. The statue's hardness is based on the type of material from which it is made. Dealing an amount of damage to the statue equal to double the caster's caster level ends either of the special spell effects channeled through the faceless statue.",
			"",
			"***Godless Void:*** Godless voids are pockets of altered reality that typically infest ruined temples, forsaken battlefields, and churches that fell from grace through the blasphemous deeds of corrupted worshipers. Even the divine might of deities is denied influence within these voids. The radius of a godless void is usually 1d6 &times; 100 feet. Within lesser godless voids, divine spells become more difficult to cast, and a divine caster must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the level of the spell) for a spell to function normally. If the caster fails, the spell doesn't function, but the prepared spell or spell slot is still lost. In addition, the DC to resist channeled energy of all sorts is reduced by 4. Greater godless voids are more troublesome, as all divine magic melts away within them, so divine casters must operate totally cut off from their god, as if within an {spell/antimagic field}.",
			"",
			"Selective godless voids exist, though they are rarer still than their normal counterparts. Such blasphemous sites affect divine casters of alignments opposed to the void's influence or who worship a deity or belong to a religion opposed to the void's influence. For instance, evil lesser godless voids impede good-aligned casters' access to spells and weaken their ability to channel positive energy as described above, while evil greater voids totally cut off spells and class abilities from good-aligned divine casters or casters who gain their powers from good-aligned deities. Good-aligned godless voids, or those aligned to law or chaos, are less common. Godless voids created by a great blasphemy against a particular deity might affect only that particular deity's power.",
			"",
			"***Grave:*** Macabre reminders of mortality, a grave could be found among many more within a necropolis or alone on a windswept hill. Digging a grave (4-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet deep) in typical soil takes 1d4 hours, while digging a grave in frozen or otherwise harder-than-average soil takes 2d6 hours. Without standard digging equipment, these times are doubled. Climbing out of an open grave usually takes a move action and a successful DC 5 Climb check (plus another move action to stand if the creature started out lying down).",
			"",
			"Careful examination of the surrounding area can reveal the presence of an unmarked grave or provide insight into how long ago a grave was dug. A successful DC 15 Perception check allows a character to notice an area of recently disturbed earth. For every week since the soil was disturbed, and for every day of rain since the soil was disturbed, the DC increases by 1. A successful DC 20 Profession (gardener, gravedigger, or other similar profession) or Survival check allows a character examining a patch of recently disturbed earth to determine roughly how long ago it was disturbed, as long as it was disturbed no more than 1 year ago.",
			"",
			"If a character is buried alive, perhaps by the [buried alive haunt](haunt/buried_alive), the [rules suggestions](rule/buried_alive) give an idea of what that character needs to do claw her way out of an early grave.",
			"",
			"***Holy Ground:*** When first constructed, most good-aligned churches, temples, and holy sites are consecrated by the religion's clergy in elaborate and expensive blessing ceremonies, culminating in the casting of a {spell/hallow} spell. This effect permanently wards the site with a {spell/magic circle against evil} effect, bolsters channeled positive energy while reducing the effects of channeled negative energy, and protects interred bodies from turning into undead abominations. The magic circle prevents intrusion by evil summoned creatures, and GMs may rule that other evil creatures refuse to trespass on holy ground. This {spell/hallow} spell also carries the protection of an additional spell for the first year - most often {spell/aid}, {spell/bless}, {spell/death ward}, {spell/dimensional anchor}, or {spell/zone of truth}. The temple's attendants usually renew this spell in a special ceremony each year on the anniversary of the blessing ceremony, but the effect isn't in place for churches that have fallen into disrepair or been abandoned by their faiths. However, the remaining lingering {spell/hallow} effect in a ruined holy site might still provide sanctuary for those seeking respite from dark forces.",
			"",
			"The lingering presence of evil in or near a holy site can slowly undermine and eventually dispel the {spell/hallow} effect. This usually takes years or decades, and even a small amount of resistance by pure-hearted attendants can protect the site.",
			"",
			"Evil denominations also perform rituals to increase the power of their unholy sites, but with the exact opposite effects, replacing {spell/hallow} with {spell/unhallow}, and providing similar protections against good creatures. Evil clergy are more likely to utilize detrimental additional effects like {spell/bane} or {spell/cause fear} to discourage trespassers on their unholy ground or even more powerful spells like {spell/dimensional anchor} to ensure the trespassers will never leave.",
			"",
			"***Lost Halls:*** The corridors of some decrepit mansions can mislead those who seek to discover their hidden secrets. Within these lost halls, doors vanish, corridors impossibly twist and turn, staircases climb endlessly, and passages appear and disappear to confuse explorers. Creatures caught in lost halls find themselves temporarily trapped in an extradimensional labyrinth. For each round spent exploring the twisting turns, an affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check as a full-round action to find its way back to the point where it originally became lost. During this time, others might hear it calling out, but can't see or detect the lost creature. The phenomenon is short-lived, so if the creature finds itself hopelessly lost, 10 minutes later it finds its way back to the point where it first disappeared. This phenomenon can affect multiple creatures at once, in which case they can hear the disturbing echoes of other lost creatures trying to extract themselves from the twisting halls, but they can't otherwise interact with or assist their allies in any way. Unlike most of the other locations in this section, a lost halls phenomenon is normally harmless, if extremely unsettling, but when populated with creatures that target the separated characters, lost halls can substantially alter the threat of encounters."

			"",
			"***Animating Fog (CR 6):*** Arising from polluted cemeteries and other recesses of stagnated evil, these areas of heavy, corpse-gray fog reek of rot, and seem to have a strange and malevolent sentience. These fog banks act as [normal fog](rule/fog), but usually have a radius of 1d4 &times; 50 feet and creep along with the wind at a rate of 10 feet per round. When the fog comes into contact with a mostly intact corpse, that corpse is immediately animated as a {template/zombie} and attacks nearby living creatures, as if under the effect of {spell/animate dead}. This animation is temporary, ending 1d4 rounds after the zombie leaves the fog. Corpse fogs can animate up to 30 Hit Dice of corpses in this manner at any one time, and they have no limit on the total number of Hit Dice of zombies they can animate over time.",
			"",
			"Some particularly foul and virulent variations of this fog (CR 7 instead of CR 6) produce plague zombies instead of normal zombies. Creatures slain by the plague zombies' zombie rot who rise as zombies don't count against the fog's limit on the number of Hit Dice it can animate, and they remain zombies after the mist passes. Diseased animating fog also exposes every living creature within the fog bank to zombie rot each round as an inhaled disease (Fortitude DC 15 negates).",
			"",
			"***Apocalypse Fog (CR 12):*** An apocalypse fog is an augmented and highly dangerous form of animating fog often called into being by some foul deity. Its radius is 20 times wider than that of an animating fog and has the same ability to animate the mostly intact corpses within itself, but the apocalypse fog can move 10 feet in a direction of its own malign choice, rather than being subject to the whims of the wind. The dread energies that birth the mists bolster the undead within, granting the zombies the benefit of an aligned {spell/desecrate} spell: a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per Hit Die. Apocalypse fog can animate up to 100 Hit Dice worth of corpses at any one time.",

			"***Bat Colony (CR 2):*** Bats often congregate in large colonies in underground areas. Though bats are mostly harmless and bat colonies generally have little interest in adventurers or humans in general, if they are disturbed, they can prove dangerous to inexperienced adventurers. Any Small or larger creature moving within 30 feet of a bat colony must succeed at a DC 15 Stealth check each round or use wild empathy or a similar ability to keep the bats calm, or else there is a 50% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed. Additionally, each round the bat colony is exposed to normal or brighter light conditions or loud sudden noises, there is a 30% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed.",
			"",
			"If the bat colony is disturbed, the bats begin to fly about, shrieking and milling in an oversized swarm. When disturbed, the colony takes up a 20-foot-radius area. A creature that ends its turn in the area takes 1d6 points of damage, and is affected by the distraction and wounding special abilities of a {monster/bat swarm}. The colony remains disturbed for 1d4+1 rounds (or until the swarm is dispersed by damage), after which the bats either return to their previous position or flee the area, depending on whether they feel a threat is still present.",
			"",
			"***Blood Moon (CR 3):*** Two situations give rise to the infamous occurrences known as blood moons: astronomical alignments that result in a calendar month having a second full moon, and atmospheric phenomena when pollution and toxins hang heavy in the air, distorting the rising moon and giving it a blood-red cast and a seemingly larger size. Both types of occurrences are considered bad omens, and are revered as unholy events by worshipers of deities of filth and decay. While the light of a blood moon shines, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and creatures exposed to its light take a -2 penalty on saving throws against diseases, curses, {main/corruptions}, and [madnesses](rule/madness). Certain foul occult rituals related to such magic must be performed on blood moons. Blood moons caused by astronomical alignments last as long as the moon is risen, while blood moons that result from atmospheric distortions last 1d4 hours, fading as the moon rises higher in the night sky and casts off its ruddy sheen.",
			"",
			"***Bottomless Pit (CR 9):*** A bottomless pit is a yawning chasm that appears to be a perfectly natural fissure in the earth, other than the fact that it appears too deep to see the bottom. In actuality, bottomless pits are entrances to extraplanar spaces filled with nothing but endless empty void. A creature that falls into such a pit (whether it is pushed, runs afoul of a trap that conceals the bottomless pit, willingly dives into it, or enters the pit in some other fashion) falls endlessly in inky darkness at a rate of 500 feet per round. Other than its depth, the extraplanar space's dimensions match those of the pit's entrance, and the falling creature can attempt to catch itself on the wall, using the Climb skill (DC = 20 + the wall's Climb DC, as normal for catching yourself when falling), and can attempt to climb out of the pit from there. The wall's climb DC typically matches the type of terrain the opening was in, so a rocky chasm has a Climb DC of 15, for example. The creature can attempt to catch itself once per round. Because the creature falls endlessly, it can rest and even prepare spells while falling (although it must be careful not to drop any possessions, since it will likely fall at a different speed than the possessions do, causing it to lose them forever). If a campaign uses the [sanity system](rule/sanity), for each hour a creature falls in the bottomless pit, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1d4 points of sanity damage.",
			"",
			"***Captivating Reflection (CR 3):*** Some narcissistic people need little encouragement to stop and admire their visage in the surface of the water, but occasionally this behavior comes from the bizarre supernatural influence of the water itself. A creature that sees its reflection in the surface of this captivating water must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or become fascinated by the reflection for 1 minute, after which it can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect and look away. A creature that fails the second saving throw is fascinated for another minute, kneeling by the surface of the water and staring at its reflection, its nose nearly touching the surface. At the end of this time, the creature can attempt a third saving throw to end the effect. If the creature fails this third and final saving throw, it is compelled to plunge its head under the water, at which point the fascination suddenly ends, but the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute, unable to hold its breath because of paralysis and therefore immediately forced to attempt Constitution checks to avoid {rule/drowning}.",
			"",
			"The creature's allies can pull its head from the water, but meet with surprising resistance, and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength check to do so, regardless of the paralyzed creature's own Strength score. If the creature avoids drowning by the end of the third minute, it can thereafter act normally, and is immune to the effects of this particular captivating reflection hazard for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Corpsefruit Tree (CR 5):*** This gnarled, twisted tree grows only from ground containing the corpse of an intelligent creature (a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher), providing an insidious tether that binds that creature's spirit to the world of the living and twists it toward malevolent spite. The tree is shrouded by a veil of illusion, which causes intelligent creatures that see the tree to believe it bears a heavy bounty of ripe, succulent fruits, and such creatures are compelled to eat the tree's fruit unless they succeed at a DC 15 Will save. In fact, the tree's fruits are brown, shriveled, and rotten, and any creature that succeeds at the Will save can plainly see this.",
			"",
			"Creatures that consume the fruit also consume a tiny portion of the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree, forging a spiritual connection between the deceased and the unfortunate victim. The next time the creature rests, it is affected as though by the {spell/nightmare} spell (DC 17). The tree is treated as having a body part of the creature's, and the tree uses the appropriate modifier based on the knowledge the spirit that nourished the tree has of the creature: typically none. The victim continues to be affected by {spell/nightmare} for 3 days, or until it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the spell. Further, if the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree has become an incorporeal undead of any kind, the creature that consumed the fruit takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist the spells and spell-like abilities of that undead creature.",
			"",
			"***Exploding Window (CR 1):*** Whether from supernatural influence or simply from more mundane physical forces, windows can sometimes explode in a rain of glass shards. When this occurs, for each 5-foot square containing an exploding window, the shattered glass blasts out in a 15-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage to each creature in the area (Reflex DC 12 negates). A creature caught in more than one of these cones (either from multiple simultaneous exploding windows or one large exploding window) takes a cumulative -1 penalty on its saving throw for each cone beyond the first, but attempts only a single saving throw and takes only 1d6 points of damage if it fails, regardless of the number of cones whose areas overlap on the creature's space. Additionally, the glass shards remain on the ground, functioning as {equipment-misc/caltrops} until they are cleared away.",
			"",
			"***Field of Bone (CR 6):*** This supernatural hazard usually plagues those who trespass on old battlefields still littered with the bones of soldiers who have never been laid to proper rest. These 30-foot-radius patches of strewn bones are considered difficult terrain, and they spring to a foul mockery of life 1 round after a living creature enters the area, causing 1d6 {template/skeleton/s} to animate and attack, as if subject to an {spell/animate dead} spell. A field of bone can animate up to 24 skeletons in this manner from any single instance of trespassing (regardless of how many living creatures trespass into the area at once), at a rate of 1d6 skeletons per round. The skeletons continue to animate until all are destroyed, all living creatures leave the area, or the field of bone reaches its animation limit, whichever of these conditions comes first.",
			"",
			"***Gnarled Tree (CR 5):*** Some trees become poisoned and malignant, tainted by the corrupt land around them, and spring to a macabre semblance of animation to attack those who trespass on their dark realms. Gnarled trees animate in the presence of living creatures, and attack indiscriminately for as long as creatures are within range. The victims' spilled blood seeping into the ground further feeds the trees' corruption. Gnarled trees appear as twisted, or even dead, trees of great age and a variety of species, and they blend in with the surrounding forests. Spotting one as an anomalous growth requires a successful DC 17 Perception check (the DC may be higher, depending on the prevalence and condition of local trees). Though a gnarled tree is stationary and can't move from its rooted spot, it attacks as if it were a {monster/treant}. The gnarled tree doesn't gain the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities, but does have the treant's vulnerability to fire. When all living creatures move more than 30 feet away from the gnarled tree, it immediately returns to its normal, non-animated state, until a potential target appears within range once more and provokes the corrupted tree's ire again.",
			"",
			"***Grasping Graves (CR 4):*** Treading on the burial sites of the unquiet dead can be treacherous, as the buried dead seek to drag the living down into their restless graves. These patches of shallow graves are often found near sites of mass burials, such as those that follow plagues or famines, and are typically 60 feet across. Once a creature enters the area, rotting, grasping hands rip from the earth, turning the entire patch into difficult terrain and targeting each creature inside with a grapple combat maneuver check each round at the end of that creature's turn. The hands don't provoke attacks of opportunity, and have a CMB of +12 (with a base attack bonus of +8 and a +4 bonus due to their Strength). This check is attempted each round for every creature in the hazardous area.",
			"",
			"If the hands successfully grapple a creature, that creature takes 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage, gains the grappled condition, and is unable to move without breaking the grapple first. The grasping claws receive a +5 bonus on grapple checks against creatures they are already grappling, but can't move or pin foes. Each round the grasping claws succeed at a grapple check, they deal 1d6+4 additional points of damage. The skeletal hands have a CMD of 22, hardness 5, and 5 hit points each. The hands take full damage from channeled positive energy (no save). However, destroying a particular set of hands doesn't harm the overall hazard, which generates new skeletal hands to grasp all creatures freed in this way on the following round. The only way to evade the hazard is to move out of the affected area, after which the unquiet spirits that animate the grasping graves become dormant once again.",
			"",
			"***Grasping Undergrowth (CR 2):*** In many forests, undergrowth is thick and tangled enough that it seems to be attempting to hinder travelers, but in some places, whether due to a malevolent spirit or the ire of nature itself, it actually is. Whenever a creature moves through an area of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a trip combat maneuver check (with a CMB of +5) against that creature. Tripped creatures fall prone in the first square of grasping undergrowth that they entered that round, and lose the rest of their movement. Creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at half their speed (after factoring in any reduced movement speed for being in a forest) gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against trip combat maneuver checks from the grasping undergrowth, and creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at a quarter of their speed gain a +8 bonus.",
			"",
			"If a creature begins its turn prone in a square of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against it, dealing 1d6 points of damage on a successful check and preventing the creature from moving from the spot until it breaks free of the grapple. The undergrowth can't move or pin the grappled creature on subsequent rounds, and has a CMD of 17. For their own cryptic reasons, some patches of grasping undergrowth grant safe passage to characters of certain alignments or races.",
			"",
			"***Insidious Domicile (CR 4):*** The dwellings of some powerful evil creatures impose pervasive effects on those who disturb the restless hate that dwells within. These areas are typically single structures - a castle, a tower, or a home - infested with spite and malice. Creatures that enter the structure must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be infected with overwhelming hate toward another creature, as if under the effects of {spell/malicious spite}. For each day spent within the domicile, the target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage if it doesn't act to subtly and indirectly slander, abuse, blame, extort, or cause mortal violence against the target of its spite. The {spell/malicious spite} effect ends if the creature leaves the location, but resumes if the creature returns. Affected creatures get a saving throw every 24 hours to negate the effect. If the effect ends, the target remembers the spiteful behavior, but not the motivation for it.",
			"",
			"If a campaign uses the [sanity system](rule/sanity), the target takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of taking Wisdom damage.",
			"",
			"***Misleading Echoes (CR 2):*** Some places create supernatural echoes that seem to come from random directions, or even all directions at once. An area suffused with misleading echoes imposes a -4 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks, and a listener must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check whenever she detects a noise, or else she believes the noise came from a random direction instead of its actual direction. Further, the misleading echoes can replicate the effects of {spell/ghost sound} (DC 11) once per minute. Any creature that fails a Wisdom check or Will save to resist the effects of the misleading echoes takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects for as long as it remains in the area of the misleading echoes, and for 1 minute thereafter.",
			"",
			"***Misleading Path (CR 3):*** When the surrounding trees begin to move and change the paths when creatures aren't looking, and the towering branches above even block out the sun, it can be difficult indeed to stay on track. In other environments, shifting dunes or underground tunnels can have the same effect. The DC for Survival checks to avoid becoming lost within an area of misleading paths increases by 2d6. Characters that become lost either travel in random directions, as normal, or are led by a strange intelligence toward a specific location, at the GM's discretion. Because travelers appear to be on a path as they travel, the DC of the Survival check to identify that they are lost increases to 25.",
			"",
			"***Pervasive Gloom (CR 4):*** Some locations ooze dread and foreboding, whether from old evils left to stagnate or the presence of some lingering psychic residue from years of torture or oppression. The locations can be single rooms, entire structures, old cemeteries, or even decaying forest groves. Trespassing creatures find the gloom nibbles away at their mental defenses, and take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects, effects with the emotion descriptor, the effects of haunts, the progression of corruptions, madnesses, and sanity damage.",
			"",
			"***Plague of Flies (CR 2):*** Often harbingers of famine and decay, these swarms of flies spread disease and pestilence wherever their buzzing wings carry them. These insects typically form a cloud 20 feet across, made of tens of thousands of flies. This cloud moves at up to 10 feet per round, and obscures all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance), and creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Moderate or stronger winds can temporarily disperse the cloud, as per {spell/obscuring mist}, but the flies reform 1d4+1 rounds later to continue their pursuit of carrion. Spells such as {spell/fireball}, {spell/flame strike}, and {spell/wall of fire}, as well as similar area spells, destroy the cloud of flies if they deal at least 10 points of damage. Creatures that spend at least 1 round in the cloud must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or contract the {disease/shakes}. Some plagues of flies carry other virulent diseases instead, which might affect the CR of the hazard if the DC is significantly higher or lower.",
			"",
			"***Rain of Gore (CR 3):*** This unusual and unsettling phenomenon results in the corpses of small animals (ranging from Diminutive to Small) falling from the sky in a localized area. A rain of gore generally covers a 500-foot-radius area, and lasts for 2d4 &times; 10 minutes. During this time, each round that a character remains in the open, it takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. In the wake of a rain of gore, scores of animal corpses are left strewn about in the area. Sometimes, a rain of gore will deposit animal corpses that are infected with {disease/filth fever} or another disease, in which case each time characters take damage from the rain of gore, they risk infection. This version of the hazard has a CR of 4 or higher.",
			"",
			"***Sanguinary Cloud (CR 6):*** Often found floating over campsites of unfortunate travelers drained of all bodily fluids, these blood-red fog banks can be mistaken for colossal [vampiric mists](monster/vampiric_mist). A sanguinary cloud typically settles over a 60-foot-radius area, obscuring all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) to all creatures 5 feet away or farther. Creatures caught within a bank of this deadly fog must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save each round or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage as their bodily fluids are forcibly extracted from their pores and mucous membranes and drawn into the crimson mist. A severe or greater wind disperses a sanguinary cloud, leaving behind a thin sheen of bloody bile.",
			"",
			"***Sour Ground (CR varies):*** These corrupted holy sites usually feature long-toppled standing stones and spiraling rock paths carefully arranged by a forgotten culture to invoke powerful divine magic. On these grounds, divine casters restored life to those who died before their time and buried those whose time indeed was up. However, time, overuse, and trespassers caused the ground's life-giving properties to sour, corrupting the corpses of those whose loved ones are foolhardy enough to lay them to rest within the necropolis's boundaries. Any mostly intact corpse of a creature buried within these ancient cemeteries animates 24 hours later as a {template/juju zombie} and seeks its revenge on those who condemned its corpse to this vile existence. These terrible creatures still retain a semblance of their former personalities and are often barely distinguishable from the living with the exception of cold flesh, slightly sunken features, distracted behavior, and an increasingly foul smell. They lure in mourning loved ones with comforting embraces before engaging in a murderous rampage, perhaps burying the resulting corpses in the same sour ground to increase their numbers and extract more revenge on the living. The CR and the XP reward of sour ground are based on the number of juju zombies that arise.",
			"",
			"***Suicide Copse (CR 4):*** Certain forests are known for attracting unusual numbers of suicides. The exact cause can vary, and may be the result of mind-altering pollen, strange psychic phenomena, or the work of mournful or malevolent spirits. Whatever the cause, suicide copses don't so much attract suicidal creatures as inspire suicide in those nearby. Each hour a creature spends within the suicide copse, it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected by the spell {spell/terrible remorse} (CL 10). A creature that succeeds at this saving throw three consecutive times is immune to this effect for 24 hours. At the GM's discretion, some creatures affected by the suicide copse might be compelled to hang themselves, drown themselves, or kill themselves by other means, rather than being affected by {spell/terrible remorse}, but such compulsions still last only 1 minute. Though called a copse, this effect can potentially cover entire forests spanning hundreds of square miles.",
			"",
			"***Watchful Doll (CR 1):*** These porcelain dolls resemble young children, and stare forward with blank, glassy expressions on their stylized yet eerily lifelike faces. Whenever a creature moves within 30 feet of a watchful doll, the doll's head rotates to face the creature, and emits a childlike laugh that echoes as if across a great distance, and can be clearly heard up to 60 feet away. Creatures within 30 feet that hear the laughter must succeed at a Will save (DC 13) or be shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice that fail their saves are instead frightened. Once triggered, the doll doesn't laugh again for 1 minute, but its head continues to move so its gaze follows the creature that triggered it. The fear from the laughter is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"***Well of Evil (CR 5):*** These places are accursed morasses of depravity, nexuses of lingering hate and festering evil that bode ill for the pure-hearted who trespass upon them. A well of evil is typically a single room, cave, or structure, though it can expand to fill an area with a radius of up to 2d4 &times; 10 feet. Good-aligned creatures can feel the powerful evil presence tainting a well of evil, and such creatures that approach within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become sickened and refuse to enter the location for 1 hour. A successful Will save negates these unfortunate effects, but if the creature actually enters the location, it becomes sickened with no save. Within a well of evil, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and good-aligned creatures take a -2 penalty on saving throws against curses, corruptions, madnesses, spells with the evil descriptor, and the effects of haunts. Haunts that lurk within wells of evil also gain a +4 bonus on their Initiative checks and to Perception check DCs to notice them.",
			"",
			"***Witch Light (CR 1):*** Often confused with will-o'-wisps, these shimmering lights also tend to lead unwary passersby to their dooms. Witch lights appear as flickering lights resembling lantern or torch flames, but can be seen only with a successful DC 10 Perception check. A result of 30 or higher on the Perception check allows the viewer to identify the witch light as a mirage. The witch light seems to move with the viewer, retreating if the creature moves toward it and following if it moves away. Some witch lights have a mind of their own, or are controlled by malevolent entities, and lead viewers toward specific places - often pits or other hazards, but sometimes treasures or long-buried secrets. Creatures actively following a witch light take a -4 penalty on Perception checks and a -4 penalty on Reflex saves to resist the effects of traps and hazards."

			"Some powerful creatures are so corrupted that their malignancy creeps into the land around them, establishing dangerous domains of evil over which they rule. And though some vile lords find themselves trapped within these cursed realms, they also become capable of exerting tremendous influence over the atmosphere and composition of their domains, such that their lands grow to reflect their dark moods and deeds. These dark rulers are described in the {template/dread lord/ template}.",
			"",
			"Domains of evil are dark pockets of supernatural activity embedded in a plane (often the Material Plane) like boils on pockmarked flesh. Most domains are hostile and uninviting at best, full of twisted forests, rough and intractable terrain, and putrid rivers that reek of rot and pollution. Wildlife could be similarly tainted, in which case even the occasional hare or ground squirrel is bony, cancerous, and infested with vermin. Packs of mangy coyotes, pustule-plagued wolves, and murders of molting crows might constantly harass travelers, nipping at their heels, ripping the flanks of their mounts, or snatching at the fingers of careless campers.",
			"",
			"Supernatural creatures might also plague the unwary, as moaning zombies wander wind-blown mountain passes and spectral dead seek to drain the life from the living at every turn. Packs of ghouls roam the lowlands, devouring entire villages, and the gnawed skeletons they leave in their wake animate and attack travelers. Everywhere lurks the foreboding presence of some foul master, who has an uncanny knack for knowing the whereabouts of trespassers and is capable of bending the lands to his will to make them most unwelcome.",
			"",
			"Such domains are not always devoid of humanoid populations - they may harbor villages of fearful and superstitious locals that usually serve as chattel and livestock for the domain's lord. These populations tend to be incredibly insular and suspicious of outsiders and intrusions on their lifestyles, as trespassers into the realm - particularly adventurers - have ways of disrupting the locals' tentative impasse with their lord."

			"When created, a domain of evil warps reality around it into a foul reflection of its master, with a radius of 5 miles for every Hit Die of its new lord (see the {template/dread lord/ template}). This radius usually centers on an ancient ancestral manse or cursed cairn that housed the dread lord's family or was the scene of a tragedy that led to the domain's creation. Though domains of evil are still located on their original plane (usually the Material Plane), with all the terrain, weather, flora, fauna, structures, and features normal to the area where they were created, their special natures cause them to have {rule/planar traits} that alter their physical and magical properties, as well as some features exclusive to them. Domains of evil have the following features, as befits the horrible creatures that preside over these realms.",
			"",
			"***Alignment:*** If its master has 10 Hit Dice or fewer, a domain gains the mildly aligned planar alignment trait reflecting the alignment of its master. Domains with masters with more than 10 Hit Dice instead become strongly aligned.",
			"",
			"***Borders:*** Some domains are formed simply by the foul presence of an evil that has long inhabited the land, whether it's a nosferatu lord lurking in the shadows or a restless ghost bound to the soil of its unquiet grave. The borders of such a domain are open; creatures can freely enter and leave, and its lord can pass to and from its domain without penalty, though the influence he has over his lands doesn't extend past the domain's established borders. Other domains of evil serve as torturous prisons for their cursed lords (see {rule/Cursed Domains}), who find it impossible to leave the realms to which they are bound, oftentimes hindered by a pervasive bank of dread fog that prevents their egress. These mists resist intrusion into the domain, though the strange whims of dark powers might allow passage through the fog for those who might further trouble or torment the land's lord.",
			"",
			"***Disturbing to Animals:*** The overwhelming taint of unnatural presences disturbs animals that are not native to a domain of evil. Animals don't willingly approach the domain's border unless their masters succeed at DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy checks, and the masters must continue to attempt checks each hour within the domain to prevent their animals from trying to leave the area. The DCs of all other Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks to influence non-native animals increase by 5 while the animals remain within the domain's border.",
			"",
			"***Hazards:*** The domain morphs into a dark and twisted reflection of its lord, with dangerous landmarks and supernatural hazards (such as the ones on in the {rule/Hazards} section) mirroring the master's temperament and personality infesting the landscape. Forests might become darker and more foreboding, full of misleading paths or gnarled oaks that grasp and tear at trespassers. Seemingly sentient fogs drift across the crags and crevices of the land, animating undead in their wakes, while bat colonies infest the domain's caves and ruins. These hazards can shift and change over time as the land reacts to the moods and whims of the dread lord (a slow process that takes at least 24 hours, during which no hazard functions), but the total CR of all hazards found with a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed double the dread lord's Hit Dice, and no individual hazard can have a CR that exceeds the dread lord's Hit Dice. If the land is the domain of a cursed lord and bordered by dread fog, the fog's CR value doesn't count against this limit.",
			"",
			"***Magic:*** The domain can have the enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait, as befits the personality and temperament of its lord. If the domain has enhanced, impeded, or limited magic, one type of magic per 5 Hit Dice of its lord can be enhanced, impeded, or limited. The categories of magic that are affected are relatively narrow. For example, an entire school of magic would be too broad, but \"effects with the healing descriptor or that restore hit points\" or \"death spells and spells granted by the {domain/Death} and {domain/Repose} domains\" would be appropriate. A type of spell can't be both enhanced and impeded by the same domain.",
			"",
			"***Time:*** A domain's time passes at the normal rate by default. In some cases, the lord's powerful whims alter the passage of time, whether replicating the slow churning of years felt by a lich's long existence, or the quickening felt by a blood-sated vampire. This alteration can be temporary or permanent, and the domain can have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait."

There is no escape for a cursed lord, who is continuously subject to living and spectral reminders of the tragic misdeeds that trapped him (see the {template/cursed lord/ template}). These realms have all the qualities of domains of evil, with the following additional traits.",
			"",
			"***Dread Fog:*** This cloying mist often encapsulates the boundaries of cursed domains, raised by terrible powers to prevent entry into, or escape from, the cursed lands they protect. Like normal fog, these pervasive banks of thick mists obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet, granting concealment to all creatures at least 5 feet away (20% miss chance). Navigation and orientation within the mists is treacherous, and creatures usually find themselves easily separated from their companions unless extraordinary means are taken to prevent separation, which can include shackling or binding adjacent creatures to one another with rope. Those within the fog have little hope of navigating the mists and risk becoming hopelessly lost. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence check each hour after entering the mist. Creatures that fail continue to wander in the fog until they succeed. Creatures that succeed exit the fog 1d10 &times; 100 feet from the location where they first entered the miasma. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as {spell/teleport} and {spell/dimension door}, don't help a creature escape this fog, although a {spell/plane shift} spell allows the creature to exit at the location it originally entered the fog. Penetrating the fog to actually enter or exit the realm it protects is subject to the GM's discretion. Navigating through might require difficult Knowledge (planes) checks, random happenstance, complicated arcane rituals beseeching favor, or simply the desire of the mysterious entities responsible for the cursed realm's creation to see the torture of their prisoner ended or increased with the intrusion of the adventurers.",
			"",
			"The fog's hopelessness is pervasive, and creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour they are within the fog. The wraiths and geists of those who have perished in the mists might also materialize to drain the life from travelers.

Still, the process of creating a drider is no blessing, but rather a cruel punishment perpetrated by the depraved dark elves upon their own kind. If possible, the processes drow inflict on other creatures are even crueler. This also points to another rule of fleshwarping: creatures that are inherently evil tend to take forms that are useful and powerful, while good creatures tend to metamorphose into more twisted and helpless forms. Another quirk of true fleshwarping is that targets of mixed race, such has half-elves and half-orcs, usually transform into creatures that more strongly reflect their non-human parentage.

It is also the base saving throw needed to cure the madness (see {rule/Curing Madness} below) and the saving throw the effects of the madness require. If, during the course of treating a madness, the affliction's DC decreases, that new reduced saving throw also becomes the DC the afflicted character must succeed at to avoid any of the madness's effects. It's possible to suffer from multiple forms of the same madness.

All madnesses are mind-affecting effects.",

During the onset time, the character gradually gains the madness effect, rather then suddenly experiencing the full effect after a number of days.",

For complex effects or effects that rely on roleplaying, the description section of the madness contains a more detailed description of the effect. If you're using the sanity system, this effect manifests as long as the madness is not dormant.",

			"Each madness has a DC representing its strength. Among other things, that DC specifies the saving throw the afflicted character must succeed at to recover from the madness. Recovering from a madness without magical aid is a lengthy process requiring significant rest. After 7 consecutive days of uninterrupted rest, the afflicted character can attempt a Will save against the madness's current DC. If she succeeds, the DC is reduced by a number of points equal to 1/2 the character's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on her own strength of personality to reduce the effects of madness, a character can also seek out a single confidante, priest, or other advisor. The recovering character must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours each day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever is higher) with a DC of 15 for a lesser madness or a DC of 20 for a greater madness. On a success, the recovering character can reduce the madness's DC by 1/2 the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher, minimum 1) in addition to the decrease for resting. The character suffers the madness's effect until the DC is reduced to 0.",

Conversely, {spell/greater restoration}, {spell/heal}, and {spell/psychic surgery} have reduced effects against greater madnesses in this system compared to in the previous books. This allows madnesses to play a larger part at both higher and lower levels in horror games, or any other game featuring psychological threats. If you want to feature the madnesses as afflictions that are simple to remove for high-level spellcasters while outside the reach of anyone else - as per the more baseline Pathfinder RPG experience - assume lesser madnesses are not affected by {spell/lesser restoration}, and {spell/greater restoration}, {spell/heal}, and {spell/psychic surgery} remove all madnesses, whether lesser or greater."
