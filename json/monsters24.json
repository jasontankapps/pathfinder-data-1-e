Swamp barracuda can survive for a long time outside their preferred climates, but often grow lax and weak if their owners fail to feed them properly or don't take care of their holding tank. Magnimar's infamous Sczarni gang, the Gallowed, uses swamp barracuda as a coercion technique against wealthy patsies as well as borrowers who fail to make a payment on time (an act made difficult by the exorbitant interest rate the Gallowed put on any loans they give out). Called the Fish Tank by those who know of it, the saltwater aquarium that houses Jaster Frallino's precious barracuda is stored in a dilapidated blue caravan wagon owned by the Gallowed, and more than one failed business partner has lost an eye, toe, or hand to \"the Boss's Fish.\" It is also known that the Sczarni boss keeps a collection of rusty keys at the bottom of the Fish Tank, though the purpose of these mysterious items is a secret held by Frallino alone.",

Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away the natural animals dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the relentless danger.",

They tend to be pale and thin to the point of appearing delicate, though their skinny bodies are more resilient than they look. While many can pass unnoticed through crowds of humans, sylphs display their heritage in subtle ways, and those who study them carefully sometimes notice that breezes seem to follow a sylph wherever she goes, even inside rooms with no windows. When consumed by fits of anger or passion, these tendencies become more apparent, as winds surround the sylph and tousle her hair or knock small items from shelves. Many sylphs have complex markings on their pale flesh that resemble tiny swirling designs like blue and gray tattoos, and the most exotic of their kind have hair that twists and coils almost as if it were made of living mist.",
			"",
			"As people, sylphs tend to be shy and reclusive, blending into crowds or skillfully avoiding those they don't desire to meet. Yet while they often prefer to manipulate situations and avoid conflict themselves, most sylphs remain intensely curious about other people, and often go to great lengths to spy or eavesdrop on those who spark their interest (a hobby frequently referred to as \"listening to the wind\"). This combined love of subterfuge and ability to slip away from any compromising situation makes sylphs perfectly suited to lives as rogues, thieves, and spies, and beneath the average sylph's veneer of shy waifishness lies a mind that's capable and calculating, constantly sizing up the competition and analyzing the most effective exits from any given room.",

			"Sylphs are defined by class levels - they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Sylphs have the following racial traits.",

			"**+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Constitution:** Sylphs are quick and insightful, but slight and delicate.  ",
			"**Darkvision:** Sylphs can see in the dark up to 60 feet.  ",
			"**Sylph Magic:** Feather fall 1/day (caster level equals the sylph's Hit Dice).  ",
			"**Energy Resistance:** Sylphs have electricity resistance 5.  ",
			"**Air Affinity:** See above.  ",
			"**Languages:** Sylphs begin play speaking Common and Auran. Sylphs with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aquan, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Halfling, Ignan, and Terran."

			"A tsaalgrend is a predatory creature resembling a tangle of sturdy vines with jagged purple thorns. Its coloration is mottled with brown, green, and yellow mold patches that flake and fall as the creature writhes through the air. The tsaalgrend's vines barely conceal two translucent, gas-filled sacks that act as balloons, enabling it to float along above the ground. Two longer vines stretch from the creature's center, allowing the tsaalgrend to snare its prey. An opening filled with rows of spiky thorns, positioned on the creature's underside, serves as the creature's mouth. This orifice constantly emits a wet, rancid stench and a wheezing sigh as warm gas escapes from its floatation chambers.",
			"",
			"Tsaalgrends are complex, ambulatory fungi, but also symbiotically support a multitude of other molds, fungi, mosses, and epiphytes. The most powerful mold growing within tsaalgrends produces potent, hallucinogenic black spores. Tsaalgrends mainly use these fine spores for hunting, and they are capable of ejecting spores in a wide area to stun prey. Any creature that breathes in the spores is immediately subject to an overwhelming terror response as its mind floods with primal, animalistic fears. The victim's breathing becomes quick and shallow, its heart rate rises dramatically, and nearby sounds become dull over the rush of blood in its ears. The creature's mind begs to flee, but its muscles simply seize tight. Most victims find this experience maddening enough that their frustration and panic heighten the actual chemical effects of the tsaalgrends' spores.",
			"",
			"Daring alchemists occasionally hunt and trap tsaalgrends with the intention of harvesting the black spores from living specimens and using them to fabricate new and potent inhaled poisons. Securing a living tsaalgrend is important to the process, for the spores lose potency soon after they are released, making storage for later use impractical. Such alchemists often run afoul of fungus-focused druids, who commune with and protect these unusual plants.",
			"",
			"Tsaalgrends display a limited intelligence-easily on par with apes- and can overcome simple puzzles and challenges. They communicate basic concepts with each other through the deliberate transfer of spores. These bouts of communication involve bursts of various colors and scents, granting tsaalgrends with large and more varied symbiotic colonies something akin to leadership roles. Most often, tsaalgrends \"speak\" to each other to coordinate hunting efforts. The plants also respond to some spoken language, though they lack a well-developed sense of hearing and show difficulty differentiating any but the simplest words and phrases. Several distinct patches of stubby 1- or 2-inch growths track light and movement, essentially serving as eyes.",

			"Tulpas are constructed of ideas and imagination. Beings of pure thought (some theorize that they are made of the same mysterious substance as the Astral Plane), tulpas are made physical by a powerful mind that is either psychically attuned or has some amount of latent psychic power.",
			"",
			"The exact process that creates a tulpa is not well understood. Sometimes such beings come about after years of practice and meditation followed by an occult ritual. Other times they seem to appear spontaneously, often after their creators suffer traumatic experiences. More often than not, in these latter cases, the creators are children. Such a child witnesses something horrific or far too strange for her nascent imagination to comprehend, and ends up creating an imaginary friend to help her sort through the event and protect her from other potential dangers. While most of these imaginary friends are nothing more than figments of her mind, every so often they manifest as tulpas. Some such tulpas are noble creatures that protect the child who created them, but just as many are malicious entities that subtly torment the child or lead her astray.",
			"",
			"While a tulpa is a creature of thought created by the imagination of another being, it has a will and a mind of its own. This often leads to conflict between a tulpa and its creator. In order to protect itself from banishment or worse, a tulpa often attempts to compel others to think and concentrate on its existence. This allows the tulpa to create havens of other \"creators\" in case its original creator forgets about the tulpa or becomes incapacitated. Nonetheless, even a sadistic tulpa or a tulpa with an actively belligerent creator must protect its creator's life in order to preserve its own existence."

Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case.

To benefit from the being's attention, the leaders of the tribe must acquiesce to the bird's demands, which typically include accomplishing some difficult quest to which the bird's enigmatic prophecies allude. While sometimes these radiant messengers are phoenixes, occasionally they are a rarer sort of prophet: majestic birdlike creatures from the Positive Energy Plane known as turuls.",

Instead of dwelling in crystalline cities like the jyoti, turuls roost at the tops of tree-shaped gemstone formations that spring up from the landscape of their home plane. Turuls are haughty but talkative and sometimes welcome visitors. They perch silently upon their crystal trees, taking time to speak to any who approach them, so long as they find the conversation worthwhile. As soon as they lose interest, they politely dismiss themselves or their guests. Those who don't leave are typically met with scorn if not aggression. Turuls are not used to or fond of being ignored or insulted.",

Those who do become more like the jyoti over time, and treat outsiders with the same anger and vehemence as their wards. Such arrangements are typically short-lived, though. Turuls who live with jyoti only do so for a century at most, and when they leave, their personalities and relations with others revert to a more calm and contemplative manner. Such might hint at some arrangement wherein a turul agrees to become part of a jyoti community, living by their rules for a period in return for something the turul covets - such as mystical knowledge, information about egress to the Material Plane, or possibly one of the artifacts that the jyoti hoard.",
			"",
			"The most consistent relationship the turuls have is with phoenixes. Those fiery avians often treat turuls like royalty and willingly serve them, whether or not the turul has expressed any interest in gaining a flaming entourage. Though, for all their impatience with other creatures, turuls tolerate the presence of phoenixes better than they do others.",
			"",
			"Part of turuls' legendary moodiness stems from the same myths for which they're best known - those wherein they bring prophecies of light and peace. On some Material Plane worlds, such tales are so pervasive that mortal heroes go as far as venturing to the Positive Energy Plane to seek blessings and wisdom from turuls. The great avians have little patience for those who presume upon their occasional benevolence. Not only that, but a turul's prophecies are not merely boons to be meted out. Rather, their promises of peace and prosperity typically come about via changes they've affected using their own considerable power, or as inevitabilities they've had the foresight to predict. In the rarest of cases, some turuls claim to have communed with the power of the deepest Positive Energy Plane and that they serve as messengers of that mysterious cosmic will. Whether or not such is true few can know, but that possibility has certainly influenced the greatest variety of mortal myths regarding turuls.",
			"",
			"Gigantic in stature, turuls stand nearly 30 feet tall and have a wingspan of almost 50 feet. They weigh upwards of 15 tons. While they reside on the Positive Energy Plane, turuls are effectively immortal. They age only when traveling from their home plane."

If a tuyewera takes any action that would negate its invisibility (such as attacking), it remains visible until it takes a full-round action to reactivate its invisibility.",
			"",
			"**Lure (Su)** If a tuyewera possesses a stolen tongue (see steal tongue ability), it can lure creatures into a trance-like state and compel them to approach as a standard action. When a tuyewera uses its lure, it must target an intelligent creature within 120 feet to which it has line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight). The tuyewera must concentrate to maintain the lure's effects. It then calls out to the creature, beckoning it to approach. The target can resist this lure by making a successful DC 15 Will save, after which that target is immune to that tuyewera's lure ability until the tuyewera gains a different tongue. If the tuyewera uses the target's name during the lure, the target suffers a -2 penalty on the Will save. If the target fails, she becomes fascinated and attempts to approach the tuyewera by the shortest, safest route possible. Once the target is adjacent to the tuyewera, she remains motionless and offers no resistance to the undead's attacks (although once the tuyewera attacks, it ceases concentration and the victim is free to act, assuming she survives the monster's attack). This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Suffocation (Su)** A tuyewera does not breathe itself, but it can attempt to steal the breath of a helpless, fascinated, or stunned adjacent creature as a standard action. When the tuyewera attempts this, it moves its mouth next to the victim's mouth and inhales, drawing the victim's breath out of her body. The victim can attempt to resist this attack by making a DC 15 Fortitude save. If she fails, the victim is stunned for 1 round and begins to suffocate. The victim falls unconscious on the second round, drops to -1 hit points on the third, and dies of suffocation on the fourth. Each round, the victim may attempt a new DC 15 Fortitude save to end the suffocation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Steal Tongue (Su)** A tuyewera does not possess a tongue of its own when it is created - it must steal a tongue from a recently slain (no more than 1 day ago) creature before it can speak, attack with its tongue, or use its lure or constriction attacks. Stealing a tongue is a full-round action, after which the stolen tongue merges with the tuyewera's jaw. The tuyewera gains the ability to speak and understand all of the languages known by the dead body from which the tongue was harvested, and its voice sounds exactly like that of the dead creature while it still lived. The monster's new tongue is a dangerous weapon as well, and can extend to a length of nearly 5 feet to attack and constrict foes. A stolen tongue only lasts until the next sunrise, after which it rots away to corruption in a single round, forcing the tuyewera to seek out a replacement before it regains its speech and attacks.",

			"The tuyewera is a hideous creation designed to serve not only as a stealthy minion but also as a monstrous assassin. Invisible during the day, a tuyewera can be sent into an enemy's lair to perform any number of missions desired by its creator or master. A tuyewera that lacks a master is a free-willed undead - in wilderness regions, it wanders aimlessly, constantly searching for signs of civilization. If it finds such signs, it invariably seeks out a graveyard and lurks in hiding, waiting for a new body to be buried so that it can burrow into the grave and steal the corpse's tongue at the first opportunity. The tuyewera then stalks the region, looking for mourners of the dead person to lure into a secluded area and suffocate, before stealing their tongues to repeat the process.",

			"",
			"The statistics presented on the facing page are for a typical tuyewera created from the body of a Medium humanoid creature, but there are methods by which tuyeweras can be created from the bodies of smaller or larger humanoids as well. While in theory, one should be able to create a tuyewera from a non-humanoid creature, so far necromancers have been unable to achieve this feat. Something to do with the preparation method and the medicines used simply doesn't translate to non-humanoid bodies - although the unique undead created by such methods could have a variety of powers, they are not truly tuyeweras. Guidelines for statting up smaller and larger tuyeweras appear below.",
			"",
			"**Smaller Tuyeweras:** Tuyeweras created from the bodies of gnomes, halflings, or even children of larger humanoids can be statted up by applying the young creature simple template.",
			"",
			"**Larger Tuyeweras:** A tuyewera created from the body of a giant can be Large or larger. You can simply apply the giant creature simple template, but a better solution in this case is to rebuild the tuyewera with all of the appropriate changes to its stats-whenever a tuyewera's Hit Dice grant it an ability score increase, it increases its Charisma score. A Large tuyewera has 10 HD and is CR 6. A Huge one has 14 HD and is CR 8. A Gargantuan one has 18 HD and is CR 11. The largest, Colossal tuyeweras, have 22 HD and are CR 14.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"A tuyewera can be created via the create undead spell, so long as the caster undertakes a specialized ritual as part of the casting. The body to be transformed into a tuyewera must be that of a humanoid the caster has himself slain at some point in the last 3 days. The spellcaster must be at least 13th level to create a tuyewera. Before the spellcasting begins, the caster must prepare the body by removing the corpse's tongue and severing its legs at the knees. The actual casting of the spell requires the caster to anoint the tuyewera's severed limbs and tongue with special medicines. These discarded body parts must then be burnt to ashes so that when the tuyewera rises from the dead, it does not recognize its missing limbs and tongue (if it does, it immediately attacks its creator). When the spell is complete, the newly created tuyewera is loyal to its creator and follows his spoken commands as long as the caster wears or carries a small pouch containing a handful of the ashes from the tuyewera's burnt limbs and tongue on his person. If the caster ever loses this pouch, the tuyewera becomes uncontrolled. If a tuyewera ever sees the ashes, it immediately recognizes them and seeks out its creator unerringly (as if via locate creature, but with no range limitation) and attempts to kill him: preferably as the creator sleeps."

Although they possess a keen intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find twigjacks bothersome, and resent any suggestion that they are related. Equally, twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud of their fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time.

Typhilipedes possess night-black, segmented bodies with dozens of scraping, skittering legs. Two pairs of batlike wings sprout from between body segments closer to the creature's head, which bears two pairs of eyes and oversized mandibles glistening with sickly ichor.",
			"",
			"A typhilipede typically measures 2 to 3 feet in length and rises no more than 8 inches from the ground, though its 3-foot wingspan can lift it off the ground with only minor difficulty. A single typhilipede weighs about 10 pounds.",
			"",
			"Typhilipedes have a legendary reputation in Erebus, where it's said they hail from a place called the Wax Tower. Supposedly, this particular vault is a vast echo chamber, alive with the deafening drone of an impossibly large typhilipede swarm. At the vast space's center rises an organic-looking tower of incredible height. Millions of typhilipedes burrow into the tower's callouslike exterior, creating a network of tunnels and caverns where primordial, endlessly fecund typhilipede progenitors are said to dwell. At the tower's endlessly rising summit burns a tiny, unquenchable flame. Supposedly the entire tower was once just a single candle that an innocent mortal begged the gods to keep burning eternally. The gods granted the request, but as the candle burned, its wax dripped endlessly. In the aftermath of the resulting disaster, Asmodeus volunteered to deal with the candle. The taper that would become the Wax Tower was installed in Erebus, along with a few unfortunate gnats that had become trapped in the wax. Over ages of exposure to the darkness of Erebus and the corruption of Hell, those crawling things transformed into the first typhilipedes.",
			"",
			"Now, typhilipedes are native to Erebus, though small colonies occasionally slip into the tunnels of the Darklands. In both places, they are considered pests, akin to otherworldly forms of giant rats or monstrous spiders. Typhilipedes most often hunt the lightless depths of Erebus for unwary souls and creatures of flesh. While capable of hunting on their own, typhilipedes usually hunt in teeming masses, swarming over whatever prey they encounter and devouring it. Despite the zeal with which they tear other creatures apart, typhilipedes prefer to consume the raw energy of light. This makes their presence convenient to the other inhabitants in the cavernous vaults of Erebus, where vast treasures lie cloaked in darkness like nothing known on the Material Plane. As the denizens of Erebus rarely have any need for light - and suffer its presence with displeasure - typhilipedes can easily distinguish their prey, spotting even a candle's flicker from miles away and pursuing it relentlessly. One typhilipede spotting a source of light and winging toward it is often enough to set an entire swarm on the hunt.",
			"",
			"Especially in secluded corners of the Darklands, where droves of typhilipedes occasionally flourish, these creatures are often known as \"eye biters.\" While the name might reference their tendency to plunge their victims into darkness before eating them, the nickname just as likely derives from the effects of the venom they produce. Survivors of typhilipede poison report feeling as though their eyes were on fire. Many also claim their experience with color changed dramatically as a result, with warm shades seeming to catch fire, becoming almost painfully vivid and certainly uncomfortable to look at. While these optical effects don't inhibit the victim's visual acuity, many survivors claim to be wary of bright lights and colors for weeks after shaking off the venom's effects.",
			"",
			"While typhilipede venom is not usually deadly on its own, it is valued for its rarity. A single dose often sells for 1,500 gp or more in nefarious markets around the Inner Sea. Some Darklands alchemists believe that mixing typhilipede venom with the blood of good-aligned outsiders can make the poison much more debilitating - though the exact process by which this is possible remains elusive.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Beyond Erebus, typhilipedes are occasionally found in the Darklands realms of Orv and Sekamina, but they rarely venture closer to the surface than that. Given their ability to gain nourishment from light, many assume that typhilipedes flourish in areas of bright sunlight. In fact, overwhelming sources of bright light - especially sunlight - repel the creatures, forcing them into regions of absolute darkness.",
			"",
			"Typhilipedes don't form communities or social bonds as more intelligent beings do. Instead, they tend to clump together, forming colonies akin to those of cockroaches. When hunting, they behave in a manner similar to a swarm, utilizing knowledge of the terrain to intercept prey and separate individuals from larger groups. Once they have surrounded a target, they attack en masse. Upon bringing down their prey, typhilipedes eat as a group. Typhilipede young and pregnant individuals eat first, as the hunters instinctively prioritize the groups' long-term survival over that of any individual. Hunters eat next, with the sickly and wounded eating last. Typically, typhilipedes that are debilitated in battle try to sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. Those that face excessive wounds but still survive, though, often try to slink away into the darkness to quietly die. Few have the chance to indulge such a fate, though, as typhilipedes have an innate understanding of their own bodies and what they can survive. If no enemies are present and it becomes clear that one of their number bears a wound that will never heal, a typhilipede swarm quickly turns on the individual, enthusiastically cannibalizing it. Peculiarly, after consuming one of their own kind, typhilipedes typically stack the remains in a neat heap with the gnawed skull deliberately placed on top.",
			"",
			"A typhilipede can be summoned as a familiar by a 7th-level spellcaster with an alignment up to one step away from lawful evil who has the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat. Duergar spellcasters in particular favor typhilipede familiars, and many view possessing one - especially an overweight specimen - as a symbol of status."

Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy briefly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants.",
			"",

Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power.",
			"",
			"Those aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira.",
			"",
			"Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its influence spreads even further.",
			"",

			"",
			"The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles.",
			"",
			"One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death - the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers.",
			"",
			"While ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon.",
			"",

			"- A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo, merchants send word to ports along the Obari Ocean's shores, searching for a group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives.",
			"- Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and other non-evil aquatic creatures recently formed a congress to address the gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost within the Obari Ocean south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of Achom. The aquatic council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the item."

Most ugothokras carry the following three contagions in their systems, and they can decide which one to inflict on a target as part of the act of firing a flechette spray - it can even inflict different diseases with different sprays in the same round if it so chooses. Some ugothokras carry additional viral infections that are tailored by their Dominion creators for incredibly specialized tasks. A creature exposed to any of these viral infections can resist the infection with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, but on a failed save, the effect occurs immediately and the onset time is ignored.

These incubators are of widely varying size and capacity. Smaller versions, possessing no more than two birthing tubes, can produce an ugothokra every hour if provided the proper nutrients (typically curdled flesh harvested from victims of flesh ripen fever), fed to it through the living walls in which the incubator is nestled. Significantly larger incubators with dozens of birthing tubes have been reported, their size limited only by the resources needed to create more offspring.",

While ugothokras can't fly, their immunity to cold and the fact that they don't breathe make them ideal bioweapons for use against enemy vessels in space - often, a Dominion ship's exterior swarms with ugothokras, and as they near an enemy ship, dozens of the tenacious aberrations drop off to cling to the enemy's hull. The creatures skitter along surfaces, searching for points of entry so they can infect the vessel's crew and spread their sickness. Often, these entry points are created for them via battle damage from other Dominion weaponry. Many Dominion ships have had great success at using ugothokras to spread Aklo submission among enemy crews, allowing the Dominion to order their victims to power down and submit. Those that manage to resist still typically fall under the grinding legs and mouth parts of swarms of ugothokras.",

As a result, there is no typical description for a Harvestman-each is a patchwork conglomeration of different features, though most Umasi have multiple limbs of varying sizes. The need to use body parts of generally the same size and shape makes most Umasi human-sized; few are over 6 feet tall.

Though they lust for the chance to spread their worship elsewhere, exposure to the light and energy of other planes is extremely harmful to them, thus necessitating the use of host bodies. Umbral shepherds value their hosts as vehicles but ultimately see them as disposable, knowing that without powerful magic their vessels will gradually sicken and die. An umbral shepherd that believes its vessel is close to death almost always abandons it rather than risking death itself, and usually transfers to a new host.",

In most cases, crews of such ships are made up of corporeal undead, especially draugr and draugr captains, though lacedons and wights are also prevalent undead on the high seas. The driving force behind most ghost vessels is a bottomless hatred for all things living, and most seafaring undead seek souls upon which they can vent their undying malice. The stat blocks presented here represent a typical crew of a ghost ship, but countless other combinations exist.",

The most common effects of these haunts are fear-related, though some of these ocean-bound terror-traps inflict various curses upon victims, such as rotting diseases, premature aging, or permanent physical debilitations. Some haunts are known to place a powerful geas on those ships that run afoul of them, requiring that their crews complete some task before being freed of a dreadful blight. Destruction of these haunts is often extremely difficult, as the bodies of the restless spirits that perpetuate such curses usually lie at the bottom of the sea or have drifted ashore on remote islands. Some sea haunts are tied to a specific date denoting the anniversary of a tragedy near a particular point in the ocean, and thus may not reset for an entire year. Such commemorative haunts tend to be more feared and dangerous to mariners, especially since the bodies or treasures such haunts are anchored to are sometimes dragged by the tides far from where the original event that triggered the haunt occurred."

On rare occasions, lone unicorns without mates or whose partners have been slain have been known to adopt young women of exceptionally pure virtue as surrogates, allowing the women to ride on their backs and becoming their guardians and protectors for life. This bond generally ends amiably if the woman becomes more committed to someone else - such as a lover or child - giving rise to the myth that unicorns only befriend virgins.",

Crew members eat only by claiming the cargo and passengers aboard the enemy ships they raid; conveniently, to the urdefhans, everyone is an enemy.

This functions similarly to a greater possession spell, except that the creature uses the urhag's Strength, Dexterity, and hit points instead of its own, and the urhag's tail emerges from the host's mouth like a blistered tongue, allowing it to make sting attacks. If the host body is slain, the urhag emerges as a free action but is staggered for 1 round. Otherwise, this effect lasts for 3 days or until the urhag emerges as a standard action. When the effect ends or the urhag emerges, the corpse collapses into rotten scraps of infected flesh. Anyone who touches these scraps is exposed to red plague. An urhag can infest a recently dead body (one killed within an hour) with 3 full rounds of gnawing.",

Red plague is a disease effect.",

Once an urhag's victim dies, the urhag wears it like armor for a time while slowly consuming its flesh. Strangely, urhags avoid eating creatures incapable of dreaming, as they find their taste repellent. An urhag is about 4 feet long and weighs roughly 50 pounds."

Their grasping forearms each end in a sharp pincer capable of shearing flesh from bone, and shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies. The ursikka's most unusual trait, however, is a three-part maw that can open wide enough to swallow humans whole. Freezing saliva drips constantly from these gnashing mandibles, injuring and trapping prey. With only a bestial intellect, ursikka view all smaller creatures as food, and think nothing of invading and devouring entire humanoid communities."

			"**Kiss (Su)** A vargouille can kiss a helpless target by making a successful melee touch attack (this provokes attacks of opportunity). A kissed opponent must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or begin a terrible transformation that changes the creature into a vargouille within 24 hours (and often much sooner; roll 1d6 separately for each phase of the transformation). First, over a period of 1d6 hours, all the victim's hair falls out. Within another 1d6 hours thereafter, the ears grow into leathery wings, tentacles sprout on the chin and scalp, and the teeth become long, pointed fangs. During the next 1d6 hours, the victim takes Intelligence drain and Charisma drain equal to 1 point per hour (to a minimum of 3). The transformation is complete 1d6 hours thereafter, when the victim's head breaks free of the body (which promptly dies) and becomes a vargouille. This transformation's progress is paused by sunlight or any light spell of 3rd level or higher, but stopping the transformation requires remove disease or a similar effect. The transformation is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.",

			"",
			"**Shriek (Su)** Instead of biting, a vargouille can open its distended mouth to shriek. Those within 60 feet (except other vargouilles) who hear the shriek and can clearly see the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 2d4 rounds or until the monster attacks them, goes out of range, or leaves their sight. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same vargouille's shriek for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",

			"A vargouille is larger than a human head, typically between 12 and 20 inches high with a 15- to 35-inch wing span. Vargouilles are not natives of the Material Plane but can often be found there nevertheless, occupying graveyards, ancient battlefields, or anywhere one can find remnants of death and decay. These hideous monsters come from the fiendish outer planes, where they flop and flap through strange and haunted skies in constant search of fresh souls to torment. In these nightmare realms, vargouilles play a role similar to that of a raven or vulture, although they augment these roles with a malevolent delight in causing pain and anguish that no scavenger bird could ever hope to match.",
			"",
			"Vargouilles attack by swooping in on their opponents, shrieking them into paralysis, and then biting them with rows of razor-sharp teeth. When multiple vargouilles take up a common cause and fight as allies, they overwhelm their victim with bites and shrieks, tearing it to shreds.",
			"",
			"A vargouille's low power and hideous method of reproduction make for a dangerous combination. Vargouilles are relatively easy to summon to the Material Plane, and once here, they can swiftly reproduce, creating more and more of their hideous kind from those who fall victim to their kiss. Vargouilles created on the Material Plane in this manner are still extraplanar creatures, and as such can be banished with the right magic."

			"Brutish and rather stupid, veds are clannish and shun even lightly populated areas, preferring cold hills and mountains. Occasionally, a gang of veds (often an adult leading two or three adolescents) carries out raids on remote mining camps or other establishments in the hills, claiming the lives of a half dozen people or so and collecting whatever baubles, food, and useful raw materials they find. They rarely strike against larger settlements, and don't pursue sentient creatures that flee their attacks.",

			"",
			"Veds enjoy simple sports that emphasize strength and athleticism, particularly variations on tag or catch. The most popular game veds play, called simply \"topple,\" involves stacking a pile of stones or logs and taking turns attempting to blow it over. They make larger and larger stacks until one of the competitors fails to blow it down. Even in sport, veds are brutal, and tend to deliver a quick beating to the loser of any game. They are pragmatic, however, and avoid injuries that will slow the loser down.",
			"",
			"Veds are omnivores; they prefer raw meat, but aren't averse to consuming tree bark for nourishment. Though they have no compunctions about killing sentient creatures, they rarely eat them. They simply leave the bodies to rot or-for particularly sadistic or desperate veds-use the corpses as bait for catching wild game.",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the veds is their enormous lung capacity, which they are able to use aggressively. These giants can expel air from their lungs in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking prone any who stand before them. The veds then descend on their victims, pummeling their prey viciously with their simple but effective clubs."
