While the eye is open, she also gains a +8 bonus on Perception checks to notice invisible creatures and can use the aid another action to grant an adjacent wizard a +1 bonus to his caster level and a +2 circumstance bonus on {rule/concentration} checks for the next wizard spell he casts before the beginning of the Arclord's next turn. If the Arclord expends two uses of her hand of the apprentice ability, she can add the effect of arcane sight or see invisibility to the benefits of her third eye for 1 minute (or until the duration of the third eye ends, whichever is sooner). She can add both effects by spending four uses of hand of the apprentice.",

			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Claiming to be descended from the wizard Nex's household servants, the Arclords see it as their solemn duty to further the archmage's goals in his absence. Over time, the exact details of these goals have evolved as Arclords have uncovered and analyzed additional texts penned by Nex, though more often than not they jealously guard these documents, making it difficult for outsiders to determine whether members of the secretive society of mages are staying true to their cause or subtly manipulating their findings for their own inscrutable purposes.",
			"",
			"Among the most famous techniques of the Arclords is their ability to open a third eye upon the forehead. Intense willpower is required to keep this eye open. Few can maintain the eye for more than a few minutes, yet in that time even a basic practitioner can sense the presence and flow of magic as no other. Especially talented Arclords can analyze enchantments almost instantly and even see through the most convincing illusions while benefiting from this magical sight.",
			"",
			"Although divinations give the Arclords an edge, the tool that most makes them a force to be reckoned with is their magical constructs. Oenopion in particular specializes in the construction of golems, and the Arclords from this Nexian city are among the most capable eldritch smiths, even among their counterparts from other parts of Nex. An Arclord is rarely without at least one construct bodyguard or assistant, and even a lone Arclord often has the means to instantly summon one or more golems to her side at the slightest sign of a threat.",
			"",
			"The highest concentration of Arclords in the Inner Sea is in Nex, where the organization reigned supreme for several centuries during the Age of Enthronement. Their decision to resume hostilities with Geb eventually led to their exile to the island of Jalmeray, and though the Arclords ruled there for several more centuries, the rajahs of Vudra destroyed all but a handful of the stubborn mages with an army of genies, angry at the Arclords' trespassing. The only other land the Arclords made a concerted effort to insinuate themselves into, following their exodus from Jalmeray, was Absalom, where they established the famous Arcanamirium, a school of magic. The Arclords launched a failed campaign to conquer the island metropolis using the school as their base of power, and relics of their assault likely still lie buried among the siege fortresses outside of Absalom.",
			"",
			"Perhaps in response to their failures in executing large, sweeping changes, most Arclords now pursue a more subtle agenda of integrating arcane magic directly into the cities and cultures of the Inner Sea, thus building a growing dependence upon their services, research, and insights. As a result, they consider courtly skills of diplomacy, etiquette, and composure second in importance only to their magical studies; these earn them influence they could never maintain through direct force.",
			"",
			"Even so, the Arclords crave the influence and power to accomplish several key goals. First, they long to regain their control over the Nex, and thereby gain uncontested access to its resources instead of having to negotiate with the Council of Three and Nine. With such means at their disposal, they might finally eradicate the country of Geb and its namesake necromancer - a task they are certain Nex himself would appreciate. Finally, the Arclords publicly express an interest in finding the wizard Nex and restoring him to power. This claim is bandied about only to reinforce the Arclords' political mandate and power, however, as doing so would certainly rob the Arclords of their autonomy, among other unforeseeable consequences."

			"In the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, strength is the key to survival, and there's no greater symbol of that strength than a powerful Kellid warrior astride one of the massive beasts that roam those untamed lands. Though these warrior's massive mounts are not always mammoths, the rest of the Inner Sea region has long been captivated by this romantic (and terrifying) image, leading to the name of the [Mammoth Lords](rule/aff_beast_riders) and their followers.",
			"",
			"Mammoth riders are fierce hunters and defenders of the lands they call home. Whether part of a \"following\" - a loose affiliation of individual Kellid families and tribes united under a powerful leader - or loners traveling the wilds with only their gigantic steeds for company, mammoth riders are as much forces of nature as the winds that blast across the Ginji Mesa.",
			"",
			"While it might be hard for citizens of southern nations to imagine who in their right minds would challenge a man or woman atop thousands of pounds of fur and tusk, mammoth riders do in fact face numerous foes, ranging from other dangerous megafauna to the giant tribes of the Tusk and Kodar Mountains to demonic forces from the Worldwound to the east. Orcs from Belkzen to the south are also a problem, as the warring tribes also see the value in using megafauna as terrible weapons in battle, and they frequently lead raiding parties into mammoth warrior lands in order to capture the giant creatures. Along the southern borders of their land, most mammoth warriors have a particular hatred for Belkzen invaders, as the orcs' use of mammoths and other megafauna as engines of war tends to be crude, wasteful, and unnecessarily cruel to the animals, creating a dark parody of the mammoth riders themselves.",
			"",
			"Along these same lines, mammoths are more than just beasts of burden for their riders. The ability to acquire and train a mammoth is far from universal, and many riders come to value their mounts as friends or even totem animals. A mammoth is a symbol of its rider's strength of will and prowess in battle, and as such it's common for riders to decorate their mounts with dyes and warpaint that matches their own, or to pierce or wrap their tusks with rings of metal. Some tribes even engage in elaborate scrimshaw, carving the life stories of each creature's riders into its tusks.",
			"",
			"Mammoth riders can be powerful allies in the rugged lands just south of the Crown of the World. Their survival skills, strength in battle, and strong connection to nature spirits allow them to protect themselves and others against the dangers of the wild. But these same abilities can make them dangerous enemies, and they grow even more dangerous if other tribes add their strength to that of a powerful and respected leader. Further, most mammoth riders are suspicious of outsiders and deeply superstitious about magic, especially when the latter comes from arcane sources. Travelers making their way through the Realm of the Mammoth Lords are wise to enlist local guides to help them placate local rulers and negotiate taboos, lest they find themselves in the path of a stampeding beast or the set spear of a charging rider.",

His hatred includes monsters that use arcane magic, such as nagas and dragons, and especially those that use magic to bypass the natural laws of death by becoming undead. He is very knowledgeable about arcane magic, recognizing signs of magic and quickly identifying a caster's class, bloodline, or favored school. He knows that a split-second hesitation could cost him his life, so he never makes witty chatter during a fight, instead going about his business with a grim and brutal efficiency.",

He might ally with priests of his cult, especially if they can ward him against hostile magic (such as with death ward, spell immunity, and spell resistance). He has no particular hatred for nonmagical creatures, but never gives more than one warning to stay out of his way, and frequently waives that warning if it's clear someone intends to stop him.",

His unorthodox tactics were mocked at first, with some seeing him as cowardly for not standing and fighting with feet planted like a normal dwarven warrior, but as the corpses of the clan's enemies mounted into piles, then great mounds, the whispers and jokes died. Now he enjoys high status within his clan, and teaches his ways to a new generation of dwarves, occasionally making pilgrimages out onto the surface to take his tactics to other holds.",
