			"These deadly golems are crafted with a technique that incorporates inubrix, a rare skymetal, into their bodies. Due to the extraordinary material used in their construction, these golems are extremely rare throughout most of Golarion, found only in places with access to skymetals or in places where those who can afford such unique materials reside. Inubrix's unique characteristics allow it to pass through iron and steel without any impact, as if it existed slightly out of phase with such metals. This strange property has given it the nickname of \"ghost iron.\" Weaponsmiths were initially excited to learn that it could penetrate metal armor with ease. However, the soft metal is too malleable for effective crafting; weapons made from inubrix are weaker than their normal counterparts, making them less effective. Alloys of inubrix with other metals failed to maintain its unique property to phase through iron, causing many smiths to see it as a strange curiosity and nothing of practical value.",
			"",
			"Because of its ghostlike properties, the odd metal has also earned a reputation for being related to necromancy, gluttony, and temperance. Some spellcasters report spectacular effects when using inubrix in the creation of magic items associated with necromancy, as the metal tends to accept magical enhancements from that magic school more readily than from other schools of magic. This has led enterprising golem crafters to create the first inubrix golems. Rather than being imbued with an elemental spirit like many golems, inubrix golems gain their animating spark from negative energy, which seems to resonate particularly well with the inubrix used in their construction.",
			"",
			"Though creators can craft these golems into any configuration they desire, most form inubrix golems that have a skeletal aesthetic. This grotesque appearance only adds to the necromantic mystique of the golem, its visage promising the one thing these monstrosities can deliver: a brush with death. These 11-foot-tall creations weigh about 5,000 pounds, but their {spell/air walk} ability allows them to navigate difficult and unstable terrain with ease. They cannot speak, though at times their metal bodies emit a low bass rumble.",
			"",
			"Technic League engineers created the first inubrix golems in the golem forges of Numeria. Their captains hoped to use them as scouts and shock troops when exploring the vast and dangerous metal ruins that speckle the landscape. However, their inability to communicate makes inubrix golems poor scouts, and the properties bestowed from their inubrix components left them often unable to harm the robotic contraptions they were sent to destroy. Their use as bodyguards is limited, as they cannot stop or deflect iron weapons, but they make decent assassins and excellent traps when hidden behind a wall of iron. Enterprising captains used the creatures to attack and assassinate their rivals, but it wasn't long before Technic League officers started to line their strongholds with lead and other materials that the golems can't pass through.",

Affected creatures include (but are not limited to) metallic creatures, creatures wearing metal armor, and creatures wielding metal weapons. If the golem succeeds at its combat maneuver against a creature, the affected creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the golem, and can't move away from the golem during its next round. The magnetic field is stronger than gravity, and can pull creatures off the ground. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Unattended Large or smaller metal objects automatically travel toward magnetite golem at a rate of 10 feet per round. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects.",

			"#### Description",

			"Though softer than iron golems - upon whom their design is based - and problematic in most industrial settings, magnetite golems still prove to be useful, specialized constructs for both security and salvage. A magnetite golem's humanoid body is made of magnetite, a naturally magnetic mineral. A magnetite golem mindlessly obeys its creator's instructions, and, like most golems, shrugs off the most devastating magical assaults. To complicate matters, a magnetite golem emits a magnetic field, which forcefully pulls metallic objects closer - including creatures holding metal weapons or clad in metal armor. Once within range, metal-bearing opponents find it difficult to pull themselves away. Magnetite golems specialize in grappling and disarming creatures that rely on metal equipment.",
			"",
			"Magnetite golems are usually about 9 feet tall, and weigh approximately 1,500 pounds.",

			"",
			"While magnetite golems are invaluable in specific circumstances, they are equally inconvenient in other instances. Due to the golems' magnetic fields, small metal bits constantly fly toward them and cling to their bodies, perpetually covering them in metal detritus-chains, fittings, scrap metal, and the occasional tool or weapon. A golem's owner must regularly pry off such debris, lest the clinging metal clog the construct's joints. Additionally, the golem's magnetic field prohibits using any kind of mundane metal objects (like basic tools, locks, or nails) nearby. Due to this, wealthy individuals in the market for golems usually purchase iron, stone, or wood golems. However, in the rare cases in which a magnetite golem is the perfect tool for the job, it proves a devastatingly effective weapon.",

In Edasseril, the Thassilonian nation tied to the sin of envy, some powerful wizards commanded magnetite golems, and delighted in the constructs' ability to seize their foes' prized possessions.",
			"",
			"Because of the unique difficulties associated with the crafting of magnetite golems, the production of new specimens is a rare event. Only a few workshops - such as Magnimar's famous Golemworks or the forges of Quantium - have the resources necessary to create these golems.",
			"",
			"Most magnetite golems toil as guardians. A few individuals use magnetite golems for private security, including particularly wealthy alchemists and mages who wish to protect nonmetallic caches of alchemical reagents, artwork, spell components, or tomes. A few jealous warlords even protect their legendary armor or weapons by attaching them to the backs of magnetite golem guardians. For eccentrics who work exclusively with glass, paper, or wood, magnetite golems are ideal companions. Magnetite golems are sometimes tasked to guard lightly trafficked areas that hold objects of cultural, historical, or material value, such as spacious tombs or far-flung libraries.",
			"",
			"A few paranoid aristocrats and wealthy thieves' guilds station magnetite golems at their visitor's entrances, as the inexorable pull of the golems' auras reveal even the most thoroughly hidden weapons. Individuals with substantial wealth may also station magnetite golems in secret passageways leading to their hidden vaults.

Given the readily available crafting resources and plentiful artificers, the golems made effective and inexpensive additions to the Jistkans' menagerie of creations. As time went on, Jistkan golem crafters also found that these golems proved equally useful on the front lines of battle. However, as Jistkan enemies began utilizing creatures from beyond the Material Plane, sand golems were eventually phased out in favor of bigger, more dangerous beings with far greater abilities. As conflicts with their neighbors eventually broke and scattered the Jistka Imperium, the knowledge of how to create these golems was lost to the sands of time.",

Though the process was archaic, these crafters were able to once more produce new sand golems. When the time came to put their newly found treasure to the test, the artificers knew the perfect trial for their unearthed creations: defensive sentries in the scorching desert surrounding many of Osirion's cities. When enemies approached, the sand golems coalesced from the nearby sand and made quick work of trespassers and potential invaders, proving a brilliant success.",

Along with sentience, wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep, or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this, wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing any one person to get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift in demeanor.",

The golem's shadow aura can attempt to dispel any amount of spells in this way, and if it fails to do so during one round, it can attempt to do so again at the start of each following round.",

			"Among the most exotic of golems are the enigmatic shadow golems, animated constructs composed not of any mundane material but of pure shadowstuff harvested from the Shadow Plane. Tempered by magic, this strange substance holds a solid shape yet retains its eerie otherworldly features, allowing the shadow golem to walk on the air or to resist physical attacks that don't cut deeply - and even then, only the sharpest of adamantine edges can do significant harm to one of these creatures.",
			"",
			"Shadow golems are typically built in the form of hulking humanoids with skin and clothing as black as spilled ink. Despite their muscular forms, they can move with surprising speed, and weigh much less than one might expect a muscle-bound statue to weigh. While the creator of a shadow golem can fashion the construct into any shape, a strange element of the way the animating magic mixes with the raw shadowstuff results in an unusual side effect - the facial features of all shadow golems are indistinct, with the exception of two glowing eyes that are difficult to spot in the cloak of shadows that surrounds every shadow golem.",
			"",
			"The typical shadow golem stands 11 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Shadow golems are rare creations that border on the mythical or nonsensical in the minds of many self-styled sages of magic. To these people, the notion of crafting a creature of such resounding power as a golem from a substance as fleeting as a shadow appears the epitome of madness. However, more visionary scholars and researchers understand that anything is possible when a passionate creator is involved - particularly when such a person draws on preternatural resources such as those available in the Shadow Plane.",
			"",
			"Shadow golems are most common in the nation of Nidal, and the golem crafters who serve the Umbral Court guard the secrets of creating these constructs with jealousy and fervor. Nevertheless, those formulae have leaked across the Nidalese borders time and again, and while these golems remain rare, they can be encountered outside of that land's borders with increasing frequency. In particular, Nidal has awarded House Thrune of Cheliax this privileged information in return for unknown favors from the powerful empire.",

			"Because of the difficulty of their creation and the aura of mysticism and mystery that their creators prefer to preserve around them, shadow golems are generally used to guard secret treasuries, the inner sanctums of temples devoted to Zon-Kuthon, hidden libraries, and portals between this world and the Shadow Plane. Of course, as the knowledge of their construction spreads through Cheliax, these eerie creations are slowly becoming more common in areas of importance to House Thrune and their closest allies.",

As the ingredients are added the hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary arcane energies to create the hag eye ooze do not properly bind to the creature's nascent form. If successful, she then begins a 24-hour ritual, during which the cauldron holding the brewing ooze is bombarded with spells. This ritual and spellcasting culminates in the addition of a hag eye - preferably from the hag creator. If the ritual is successful, the hag eye ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The hag eye ooze is under the control of the creator, but in cases where a coven takes part in creating the ooze, control goes to the hag that supplied the hag eye."

Each hag eye emits a different spell effect: bestow curse (DC 17, -6 to Dexterity), confusion (DC 17, 9 rounds), hold person (DC 16, 9 rounds). All of these spell-like abilities function at CL 9th.

			"**Split (Ex)** Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a coven ooze. Instead, the creature splits into three identical oozes, each with one third of the original ooze's current hit points (round down). Upon splitting, each copy retains a single hag eye within its mass and can continue to use its hag eye ray ability, albeit with only one spell effect. A coven ooze with 10 hit points or fewer, or that doesn't have enough hag eyes to result in each new ooze getting its own eye, cannot be split and instead takes damage normally.",

			"Coven oozes result from a hag eye ooze's conglomeration of multiple hag eyes, often caused by the destruction of a hag coven with a hag eye ooze nearby. With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye.",

			"A coven ooze wanders its creator's territory, devouring any living organism it comes upon. With their animal intelligence, they use the terrain to their best advantage, often lying in waterways near frequented river crossings.",
			"",
			"Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye ooze - if a hag - must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have her connection to the hag eye ooze severed."

			"Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking - often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp.",
			"",
			"Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example - often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death.",
			"",
			"Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis - typically horrible triplets - are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles.",

			"**Grasping Chains (Ex)** An iron rhinoceros is covered in animated chains that grasp at its enemies. It doesn't gain the grappled condition when using its chains to grapple enemies, and can maintain a grapple using its chains as a free action, though doing so prevents it from attacking with that chain. An iron rhinoceros may have up to two creatures grappled in its chains at a time. Additionally, the chains seek to ensnare creatures the rhino tramples. The chains entangle any creature that fails its saving throw against the rhinoceros's trample attack, or that chooses to forgo its save in order to make an attack of opportunity against the rhinoceros. An entangled creature can escape from the chains as a standard action by succeeding on a DC 26 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. Each chain has AC 12, hardness 10, and 15 hit points. Creatures entangled in the chains can't move farther than 20 feet away from the rhinoceros. If the rhinoceros moves farther than 20 feet from an entangled target, the tethering chain breaks, but the target remains entangled.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Drag (Ex)** An iron rhinoceros can use the drag combat maneuver to savagely scrape its foes across the ground. As a full-round action, an iron rhinoceros can attempt a single drag combat maneuver against every creature currently tethered to its grasping chains. This deals 1d6 points of damage for every 5 feet dragged, and the chains tethered to any creature more than 20 feet away break. The dragging damage may increase depending on the terrain, at the GM's discretion. Creatures dragged any distance are knocked prone.",
			"",
			"**Scooping Charge (Ex)** An iron rhinoceros can unhinge its snout in order to scoop enemies into the furnace-like cavity within its belly. When making a powerful charge, the iron rhinoceros can forgo dealing damage in order to gain the grab and fast swallow abilities with its gore attack. The rhinoceros must make this choice at the beginning of its charge.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** An iron rhinoceros's belly functions as a furnace, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to swallowed creatures. Hatches on the rhinoceros's sides allow it to swallow creatures grappled in its chains. In order to take swallowed creatures prisoner without dealing fire damage, the rhinoceros can suppress (or activate) the flames within its furnace as a swift action. When the rhinoceros is suppressing the flames, the furnace instead fills with smoke, forcing swallowed creatures to succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save each round or be sickened for as long as they remain in the rhinoceros's belly. This save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures attempting to cut their way out of the iron rhinoceros's belly must overcome the durability of the thick furnace walls (hardness 10).",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The brutality of fire giants is matched only by their ingenuity at crafting devices of war. Of all their creations, however, few match the ruthless efficiency or raw power of the iron rhinoceros. Built to sate the fire giants' endless desire for slaves, iron rhinoceroses serve as both tireless mounts for giant warlords campaigning against lesser races and as temporary prisons for troublesome captives.",
			"",
			"An iron rhinoceros measures 18 feet long from snout to tail and stands 12 feet tall at the shoulder.",
			"",
			"It is a quirk of fate that fire giants, the most rigid and militaristic of the giant races, created a construct as willful and obstinate as the iron rhinoceros. Early prototypes for the creature borrowed techniques from golem manufacturing and relied on bound elementals to provide the construct's animating force. The results were initially promising, as these unintelligent creatures obeyed without hesitation and executed their orders with mechanical precision. However, they also inherited their golem forebears' tendency to go berserk in battle. Few generals were willing to ride a mount that might turn on its rider, and so these first creations were deemed unreliable and most were broken down for scrap.",
			"",
			"For the second generation of iron rhinoceroses, fire giant blacksmiths bound the spirits of animals rather than elementals into the construct's frame. The results were surprisingly lifelike. When not in use as mounts or engines of war, these new iron rhinoceroses rest and graze as normal rhinoceroses do, even without the need for food or sleep. They \"eat\" combustible materials, such as wood and coal, to fuel their internal furnaces, and seek warm places to lie down. They also share their living cousins' aggressive tendencies, and attack unfamiliar creatures on sight.",
			"",
			"An iron rhinoceros is only truly loyal to its maker, or to an individual whom its maker designates at the time of its creation. At best, it tolerates the presence of other creatures, and more often displays barely constrained hostility toward its master's servants. An iron rhinoceros prefers not to allow riders other than its master, and such riders take a -4 penalty on Ride checks to control it in battle.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Iron rhinoceroses are rarely found outside of fire giant camps. Although any sufficiently experienced and equipped spellcaster can create one, something in the mechanical beasts' construction predisposes them to favor giants over other creatures. While they might remain loyal to their creator, iron rhinoceroses display aggression toward any other non-giant creature they meet. These tendencies, combined with the creatures' immense size and strength, make them dangerous to keep in even lightly civilized areas.",
			"",
			"Among some fire giant communities, iron rhinoceroses are a mark of status and power. Many fire giants assume that a general who possesses and commands one has been successful enough at war to afford the exorbitant cost of the beast's creation. Because iron rhinoceroses cannot (or will not) bond with a new master after their creation, elders rarely pass them down along family lines or to successors. Up-and-coming fire giant generals are expected to produce their own iron rhinoceroses to prove their worth as military commanders. In truth, few iron rhinoceroses survive their masters, as both tend to fall in battle against more powerful enemies. On the rare occasion when an iron rhinoceros does outlast its owner, the construct is placed within its master's tomb to serve as a guardian for his body and grave goods. Desperate or foolish young commanders sometimes attempt to steal iron rhinoceroses from the tombs of their ancestors, hoping to gain the prestige that comes with ownership without first proving themselves in war. These young generals more often than not end up impaled, making their attempted theft readily apparent to whatever unfortunate giants must clean up the mess.",

			"**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoid creature that is slain by an irradiated dead's radiation becomes an irradiated dead itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical irradiated dead, taking a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and having 2 fewer hit points per Hit Die. Spawn are under the command of the irradiated dead that created them and remain enslaved until its destruction, at which point they lose their spawn penalties to d20 rolls and become fullfledged and free-willed irradiated dead.

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Little more than orange-tinted, blistered flesh drawn across skeletons, the irradiated dead were once humanoids-mainly Kellid warriors-who have been tainted by the radiation that's strewn across Numeria. Created as a result of experiments by members of the Technic League, a handful of irradiated dead escaped their restraints and set off across Numeria, creating more of their kind with each kill. With the strange chemicals and radiation coursing through their bodies and augmenting survival and hunting instincts, they scour the Numerian wastes in search of prey. Irradiated dead generally appear the same size as the humanoids they once were, but they weigh less due to their bodies have been ravaged by radiation.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The secretive cabal known as the Technic League has always looked for ways to bolster its military power beyond the use of the gearsmen. Over the past couple centuries, the League's members have made numerous foul discoveries by studying the strange relics, technologies, and chemicals collected from the ruins of Divinity.",
			"",
			"Originally conceived by a Technic League lieutenant as more reliable and easily replaceable minions than the gearsmen, the irradiated dead were the result of a series of experiments conducted in the shadow of the Silver Mount. The lieutenant was skilled in the use of necromancy magic, a study not normally mastered by Technic League members. She gathered a group of the strongest young warriors in Starfall - all of whom sought to make names for themselves in the service of the Black Sovereign - and subjected them to round after round of brutal endurance tests, injections of chemicals and drugs, savage bloodletting, and forced starvation until their bodies couldn't take any more.",
			"",
			"The lieutenant administered to the warriors a number of chemical compounds recovered from a medical bay within Silver Mount that were originally intended to aid the crew of the Divinity in surviving in strange and hostile environments. Lacking full understanding of what they were working with, the lieutenant and her apprentices mixed and distilled these strange chemicals into a viscous, orange fluid that augmented physical strength and coordination while also thickening the outer layers of skin to a rocklike hardness. She believed that replacing the subjects' blood with the orange liquid, along with controlled exposure to a smashed piece of wreckage leaking radiation, would yield the obedient soldiers she desired. When the first two test subjects completed the regimen, they awoke with a savage hunger for the flesh of their kind and rose up to fight her. The lieutenant escaped that first trial with only the loss of her right eye and her right hand just above the wrist. Her two apprentices were not so lucky. Subsequent refinements and tests yielded no better results. Though these latest test subjects retained their free will, their hunger for raw flesh was just as potent as the earlier attempts. And as they're generally more powerful than their Technic League creators, the irradiated dead saw no reason to serve their creators in any way.",
			"",
			"Not long after these experiments, several irradiated dead were turned loose or escaped. Rumors persist within the Technic League of study specimens that were kept in secret, and some foolish young sub-commanders are looking to restart the project.",
			"",
			"Burning inside with necrotic radiation, the irradiated dead display enhanced strength and coordination. Their skin and pupils are tinted pale orange like the fluids that replaced their blood. Their fingers transform into savage claws as sharp as ragged metal. Unexpectedly, the creatures show a remarkable resistance to the effects of positive energy that are deadly to most other forms of undead. They are also carriers of the radiation treatment that fueled their transition to undeath, able to pass the affliction to other living creatures.",
			"",
			"Irradiated dead are carnivorous, greatly preferring fresh meat, but they aren't above eating carrion. Cunning, patient and careful hunters, irradiated dead can prey on a nomad tribe over months, ambushing small bands of warriors and feeding upon them one by one.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most irradiated dead are natives of the broken Numerian wastes, and they continue haunting these regions in their new forms just as they inhabited the wastes in life. They generally search for new hunting grounds in solitude, but those that manage to create their own spawn travel in packs with those they have transformed. Whether roaming across the plains, hills, and valleys, or even wading through muck and waterways, they spend much of their time lurking in shadowy places on the outskirts of villages or tribal encampments. They do not generally keep personal possessions or treasure from their meals, but may use such things to lure and entrap subsequent search parties.",
			"",
			"Though they're intelligent, the irradiated dead rarely show any inclination toward forming social groups or hierarchies, preferring to kill and eat creatures that enter their territories, though they will deal with other intelligent creatures if they must. If they encounter more powerful beings in their hunting grounds, irradiated dead will work to trick or trap them. The irradiated dead simply move on to new territories if they are unable to eliminate the threat. An unconfirmed report by a Technic League spy in Sunder Horn, however, claimed that at least three fast-moving, orange-skinned creatures had been hunting on the outskirts of town for nearly a year. The creatures have seemingly disappeared without any further sightings in the last 18 months.",
			"",
			"Even the Technic League is aware of the dangers these creatures could pose to the populace. The methods used to create the irradiated dead are well-guarded secrets of the Technic League. These techniques are also impossible to implement outside of Numeria, because the necrotic radiation and alien chemicals instrumental to their creation can be found nowhere else on Golarion."
