			"Abadar's herald is the Lawgiver, a golem-like creature of gold and consecrated steel. Massive and powerful, the divine emissary appears as a giant in elaborate golden armor bearing a titanic warhammer. Standing still, the Lawgiver seems to be a fantastic statue crafted in honor of the god of law. When it's active, its steps shake the earth and the blows of its legendary hammer - the god-forged Gavel of Abadar - can shatter castle walls. Stoic, infinitely patient, and entirely dedicated to the Keeper of the First Vault, the Lawgiver is righteous, relentless in its cause, and capable of exacting incredible destruction. This sentinel of civilization appears where the forces of chaos threaten to undo the works of lawful communities and hinder the inexorable march of progress.",

			"",
			"Over the past century, followers of Abadar have reported seeing the Lawgiver wandering in remote places, from ancient caves to underwater trenches, seemingly searching for something. These travels have lead to widespread conjecture and debate among the faithful.",

			"",
			"- Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, fire, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- Lorthact's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- Lorthact can grant spells to his worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on his behalf. Lorthact grants access to the domains of {domain/Evil}, {domain/Law}, {domain/Magic}, and {domain/Trickery}. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.",
			"",
			"**Intelligence Drain (Su)** Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of {spell/foresight} (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Scholastic Masquerade (Su)** When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.",
			"",
			"**Spell Reservoir (Su)** Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a {magic-ring/ring of spell storing}. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Anomaly (Su)** Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future - such as {spell/augury}, {spell/divination}, {spell/foresight}, and {spell/moment of prescience} - cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses {spell/time stop}, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies deserted him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels.",
			"",
			"After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers, Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly comfortable under the gaze of so many potentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200 years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal favor in Hell.",
			"",
			"In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos. Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his identity or unravel his schemes."

			"Malsandra traveled farther from her mother's stream in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings than any of her sisters when looking for a body of water to call her own, just under a century ago. She followed the stream to the Rimeflow River and from there to the Steaming Sea, where the open water felt new and exciting to her. Once in the ocean, Malsandra swam south along the coastline for many months, never settling and continuing ever toward warmer waters. Nearly a year after setting out on her own, she finally found a marshy estuary where the godless land of Rahadoum meets the Sodden Lands, well within the immediate influence of the newly formed permanent hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego.",

			"There she inhabited a long-abandoned temple to a forgotten god - all holy symbols and iconography shorn from its walls after the Oath Wars drew to a close - submerged in the center of an ever-growing swamp. The Rahadoumi villagers of the nearby fishing settlement of Mekhum, still coping with drastic shifts in climate as a result of the Eye of Abendego's advent, believed her to be a drowned victim of the increasingly dangerous wetlands. Lacking clerics to exorcise the ghost from the abandoned temple, the people of Mekhum had little choice but to acquiesce to Malsandra's demands, and to this day, they pay her tribute each year on the anniversary of her arrival (a date they believe to have been when she died).",
			"",
			"Malsandra prefers to keep as pets a combination of wayward sailors who find their way into her marshy seaside realm and powerful swamp monsters, which have grown ever more prevalent since the Eye of Abendego has taken hold in the region. From time to time, locals even report seeing the temple ghost with a small black dragon, though these may be simple rumors."

In the past thousand years, the rune giants of Malziarax's people have managed to dominate many of the giants in this relatively new region: including the frost giants of the Tian side of the Crown of the World and several of the mysterious wood giants of the Forest of Spirits. In recent years, however, Malziarax found the icy and often barren realms of the Wall of Heaven not to her liking, and so she set out to reclaim the empires of her ancestors, leading a band of loyal followers back across the Crown of the World to northern Irrisen.",

In that life, Mangvhune was a highly-respected scholar of Kintargo's illustrious Alabaster Academy, an erudite surgeon and accomplished scholar of humanoid physiology. He was as close as you could get among the Academy's professors to a celebrity. His lectures on anatomy in particular were always standing-room only events that drew far beyond the walls of the Academy itself for audience members. Charming, handsome, and as the Kintargo gossips were so fond of pointing out, quite available, Mangvhune maintained the public facade of the perfect gentleman scholar.",

Despite a swift trial and even swifter execution by headsman's axe, the Alabaster Academy's reputation never fully recovered from the scandalous revelation. Mangvhune's murderous soul went swiftly to the Abyss after his death, where he transformed into a babau demon, mind and personality intact. Since then, Mangvhune's notoriety has only grown, and rumors that the Temple Hill Slasher now stalks the streets of dozens of cities throughout the Inner Sea region persist - particularly in Kintargo during the week surrounding the anniversary of his execution so many years ago.",
			"",
			"The Temple Hill Slasher prefers to face solitary foes, striking swiftly with a sneak attack if possible to set the victim to bleeding and then holding back, hiding in the cover of darkness and watching until the victim dies or recovers from the bleed damage, at which point he slips in again to start the process anew. The babau isn't afraid to teleport to a nearby hiding place if a foe seems to be particularly strong - he merely hides again and then bides his time for another strike when he can. Mangvhune prefers to use his death attack to paralyze foes rather than kill them outright, affording him a chance to torment the victim telepathically for several rounds before he delivers a coup de grace. The babau prefers to avoid fighting larger groups on his own, but when he must, he abandons his sneak attacks in favor of full-attack actions, focusing on healers first. He saves his angel of death ability for particularly hated foes. Mangvhune delights in gathering the dust remaining after such a kill, and keeps an ever-growing collection of painstakingly-labeled vials of these ashen mortal remains in his Abyssal lair.",
			"",
			"This den is called Razorspan, a bridge-like palace built from blades and knives that straddles a deep rift filled with bones near the realm of Shax itself, on a winding route that leads away from the realm of the demon lord of murder into the wilds of unclaimed Abyssal worlds. The ceilings, walls, and floors of Razorspan are riddled with cutting edges, blades that make exploration of the structure a constant battle against a thousand cuts. The blades themselves are incapable of penetrating Mangvhune's damage reduction (or that of most of his minions, for that matter), but are an impossible to ignore hazard for would-be explorers of the notorious structure.",
			"",
			"Mangvhune does not require any additional offering when conjured, but does require that any service he provides to a conjurer includes an equal amount of time allowed in the conjurer's region to stalk new victims of the babau assassin's choice. Wise conjurers take pains to protect themselves from Mangvhune's additional attentions once his services have been carried out. It's a DC 26 check to research the Temple Hill Slasher."

His father, Huratektor, was the ruling tyrant of their tribe, and had recently relocated the tribe to the Bandu Hills, where the mountainous landscape proved more easily defendable than their previous lair within the Kaava Lands. When Huratektor's most outspoken rival - a warrior of low status by the name of Nukamman - assassinated the tyrant, he sparked a civil conflict within the tribe that irreparably split its people into two groups, with Nukamman and his fellow dissenters fleeing further into the mountains, where he was crowned tyrant of his newly created splinter tribe. In the chaos of the conflict, Nukamman managed to abduct baby Mardatektor, renaming him Mardahamman and raising him as his own.",

When Mardahamman came of age and brandished a greatclub for the first time, his adoptive father brought the youth with him on the final raid against their rival tribe. When Mardahamman experienced the taste of battle for this first time, unknowingly laying waste to his own people, he knew something was amiss, a notion confirmed when he confronted Nukamman about it later.",
			"",
			"Shamed by his own actions and angry at the betrayal of the tyrant he had thought to be his father, Mardahamman fled from the hills and into the Kaava Lands, not knowing that his people originally hailed from there decades earlier. In that forest, he met a small conclave of cyclops warriors who had stayed behind when Huratektor took his tribe to the Bandu Hills. Feeling that these rebels would be the closest he'd ever have to a real family again, Mardahamman joined their conclave and trained to become an expert warrior, eventually coming to lead the cyclopes of the Kaava Lands as their tyrant, all in hopes of one day exacting revenge on his treacherous adoptive father, Nukamman."

Eygreas barely escaped the onslaught; the traumatic event spurred within her a burning hatred for the froglike denizens of the swamp, and so she honed her skill with her bow and devoted her life to hunting the tribe that had killed her kin. After stealthily slaughtering all of the boggards with her arrows and gaze - and thus removing her only driving motivation - she fell into a realm of madness and bitter isolation.",

Still, though she does not remember why, the sight of the toady people of the swamp enrages her to no end, and the only thing that will stop Eygreas from pursuing her current target is the opportunity to hunt a boggard instead."

Even if they withstand the island's maddening magic, adventurers in search of legendary lost riches may confront Moxix himself and be scourged of mind, body, and soul. Moxix's baleful presence and malevolent awareness leer from every crudely carved icon, relief, and idol bearing his likeness, bringing with them a tinge of insanity and a ravenous hunger for human flesh.

Among the dozens of fiendish icons was Moxix, who came into influence among the cyclopes as their practice of sacrifice and cannibalism increased. It was at this time Moxix became known as the Drinker of Human Hopes. The ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes fed him hundreds of captured humans, most of whom were of Azlanti descent. In one instance early in his time among the Ghol-Gan cyclopes, Moxix's followers captured an entire Azlanti embassy and fed them to the strange demon one by one while their companions watched in horror. Some say the sacrifices' spirits still inhabit the region, their wailing cries drifting through the hills and jungles of the haunted island.",

			"As his reign of blood began to spread from its base in southern Ghol-Gan, a raging contingent of rival cyclopes from elsewhere in the failing empire raided the demon-worshiping clan dedicated to Moxix, bringing both brute strength and the magic of powerful shamans and oracles to bear against it. The battle raged for 2 days, and in the end an oracle sacrificed her life in a final ploy to destroy Moxix. However, the oracle only succeeded in binding him to the high mountain peak that would one day become the island known as Yoha's Graveyard.",

There he delights in turning people to cannibalism, destruction, and insanity. Obscuring and disease-laden mists swirl around the island, keeping its lands hidden and protected from trespassers. Once per year, however, on the first full moon after the rainy season, the mists part for a single night. Some explorers have mounted expeditions to Moxix's island during these events, but as of yet, no one has returned the same person she used to be; all bear the mark of insanity Moxix stamps on their being."

Scroon preferred young victims, that their vanishing would cause the most distress possible-his favorites were young adults freshly in love, although he seemed to have had no preference between man or woman. He abducted his victims with astonishing skill, tormenting them for hours with his blades before leaving them broken and bleeding to death at the bottom of a specially prepared pit far outside of town. The mass murderer was finally captured by Cesandra Dayne, an obsessed priest of Sarenrae who had lost her fiancee and her father to Scroon. Only by forsaking the teachings of her church was she able to trap the murderer in the slums of Almas, and although the resulting fight saw the death of a dozen innocent bystanders, in the end Cesandra had her man alive.",
			"",
			"After Scroon was turned over to the law in his hometown of Oppara, the authorities thought to prosecute him for the deaths of no fewer than 46 known victims. When Scroon gleefully bragged of having murdered nearly a thousand men, women, and children, the authorities were eager to write off his ravings, yet after Scroon provided exacting details to the sites of 953 victims, and one after the other his directions led to actual graves, the killer's sentencing was hastened: death by hanging. Yet Scroon survived. One after the other, attempts to execute the Nightripper failed - headsmen died of fright as they lifted the axe, guillotines malfunctioned, magic failed. Each botched execution left Scroon more disfigured, but his legend grew. The 13th and final execution put the man down once and for all - or so it was hoped.",
			"",
			"Scroon's soul went to the Boneyard, where something amazing happened: he passed through to the Abyss with his mind and memories intact. So remarkable was his retention of his identity that it drew the attention of Lamashtu herself, who pulled the killer's soul from the shuddersome bosom of the Abyss and made him her personal assassin, raising him from a broken shell of a soul to a nascent demon lord with greater power than he'd ever hoped for in life. His form had changed, transforming into a shape more befitting one of his horrific nature, yet his mind remained sharp and clear. Nightripper harbors a strong desire for revenge, but for now he serves dutifully as Lamashtu's favored torturer and assassin and as the lord of the dungeons below her palace in the Abyssal realm of Kurnugia. But it is said that someday, when he has repaid his debt to the Mother of Demons for his ascension and rescue from the dregs of the Abyss, the Nightripper will return to his old haunts. Only this time, it will not be individuals he breaks and bleeds and buries in his pits - it will be entire cities.",

			"No character looms larger in the myths of the Mwangi tribes than Old-Mage Jatembe. Jatembe rose to prominence in the Age of Anguish, a time when mankind was just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by Earthfall and the destruction of Azlant. Jatembe was the first among humanity to rediscover the art of wizardry and written magic, and did much to redeem these arts in the eyes of a superstitious people. Jatmebe worked tirelessly to stem the tide of barbarism left in the wake of the Age of Darkness, and preserve the learning and culture of his people. He is remembered as a folk hero among the Mwangi, and as a beacon of hope in a darkest of times.",
			"",

Some scholars point out parallels between Jatembe's ageless nature and the immortal masters of the lost city of Ird, suggesting that fabled city as his birthplace, though the decadent and cruel lords of Ird have little else in common with him. Later accounts claim Jatembe and his disciples destroyed the city of Ird to punish it for its wickedness, casting doubt on this theory. Other myths connect Jatembe with the druids of the Mwangi Expanse, some even claiming he was an ex-druid himself. True or not, Jatembe did have an affinity for druidic magic, and the magical school he founded - the [Magaambya](rule/aff_i_school) - continues to teach druid spells to this day.",
			"",
			"The details of Jatembe's ascension are similarly occluded by millennia of myth and legend. One popular tale holds that Jatembe learned the deepest mysteries of magic from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing the serpent-god's lips shut. Others claim he gained mythic knowledge from sources among the planes, for many tales tell of his dealings with angels, demons, and other outsiders while in search of ways to protect his people. Still more stories say that Jatembe found some potent artifact amid the ruins of the Mwangi that awakened his mythic potential, and that he departed Golarion once the strength of this artifact had faded.",
			"",
			"Prior to his mysterious departure, Jatembe performed many astonishing deeds. The first of these was the gathering of his disciples, the Ten Magic Warriors. These men and women were known only by the golden animal masks they wore, having forsaken their identities in service to Jatembe and his quest. With their help, Jatembe explored the ancient ruins that dot the Mwangi Expanse, uncovering ancient magical secrets and treasures. He founded the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya arcane academy to preserve and share knowledge and wealth with future generations, and to protect the Expanse from further devastation such as that wrought by the Earthfall. In later days, Jatembe fought and defeated the twisted sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants, who claimed to possess a weapon that would allow him to eat the sun and cast the world into darkness.",
			"",
			"For reasons unknown, Jatembe departed Golarion; if anyone knows where he left to, they're silent on the matter. Some believe he left to fulfill obligations to the beings who granted him mythic power, and others think a magnificent spell took him. He left his Ten Magic Warriors behind to rule in his place, and forged the Ring of Nine Facets to aid them in his absence. He has created and used other artifacts in his travels, but gave them all away to allies, keeping only the beacon of true faith that one of his patrons gave him.",

Black clouds sprang from a clear sky around the mountain of a creature, and lightning and hail shot down on the amassed troops. Every impact of the thing's foot shook the ground, and the thunder of the Oliphaunt's march through the armies drowned out even the screams of the dying thousands. A massive valley marked the path where the Oliphaunt trod, with entire cities lying buried underneath the earth by the crushing footfalls.",
			"",
			"But even a runelord couldn't control such power forever, and the wards protecting the Oliphaunt continued to draw it back to its home realm of Jandelay. The legion following the runelord's ally, Runelord Xanderghul, suffered the parting punishment when the Oliphaunt vanished, torn back to Jandelay. A quarter of Xanderghul's legion froze still in their tracks, then were ripped apart by chaotic, bloody storms and repeated earthquakes left in the Oliphaunt's wake.",
			"",
			"In spite of the repercussions of calling the Oliphaunt of Jandelay, spellcasters of great influence and arrogance still attempt to recreate the singular feat of calling it to Golarion. Desperation drives most who try, most notably the Runelord Alaznist, who was prepared to call the beast down upon Karzoug as he prepared to finally march on her territory. Only Earthfall cut Alaznist's plans short.",
			"",
			"Since the fall of the runelords and Thassilon, lore about the Oliphaunt and Jandelay has become much harder to come by - but it's far from forgotten. Ancient liches still work away in secluded laboratories to recreate the complicated means that once before called forth the great Oliphaunt, meticulously reconstructing what few scraps of ancient records they can find. Speculators collect all sorts of relics purported to be chunks of tusk that sloughed off the beast, vials of water collected from lakes formed by the Oliphaunt's tears, and all manner of other curiosities. Few eyewitness accounts remain, since most who saw the Oliphaunt died.",
			"",
			"Few alive on Golarion even know about the Oliphaunt, but even fewer understand what Jandelay itself is. Some believe it's the name of the person who first scribed a tale of the Oliphaunt, others think it's an even greater progenitor beast that spawned the creature. Those who've deeply researched to topic found only a few hints. The most compelling of these are within the epic poem Jandelay, as inscribed at the base of the Spindlehorn. The poem tells of the Oliphaunt's rampage and the other legendary acts of the runelord who summoned it (though lacking specific details of how the runelord pulled off this feat). However, within the poem is a cipher that when translated reveals these words:",

Dedicated to the ideals of altruism, they raised her with lessons of the good in all creatures beneath Ioz'om's skies, and taught her all she'd need to know as a future leader and nurturer. Her innate gifts with wind and air emerged at a young age, but with them came the first hints of a darker fate. When the initial signs of her oracular curse made themselves apparent, many of her fellow tribespeople thought her to be plagued by some great evil. The merest hint of danger was enough to send the skittish child into a frenzy of words and phrases that she had no way of learning. With the pain of rejection first came bashfulness, which slowly evolved into utter hatred. Turning her back on her tribe, she abandoned her parents' cause to gather her own legion of followers among the evil cloud giants. She only returned once, nearly a century after leaving, to burn her home to the ground, torching the citadel and all the benevolent cloud giants within, including her parents.",

Along with her army of cloud giant and mihstu servants, she has traveled along the western side of the Shattered Range for years in search of the fabled floating cloud giant city that lies somewhere within the rocky crags. She has been obsessed with the idea of floating cloud giant castles since she was a child, and sees in these mythic sky towers the means to forever rid herself of her curse. Through her pawns and other agents, she pursues any rumor of a city's discovery, extracting information with torture when lavish gifts won't suffice."

Some tell a folk tale about a lazy, greedy youth who preferred begging off his neighbors rather than working for an honest living. One day, the youth reluctantly agreed to herd goats in exchange for food when no one would give him a meal for free. Rather than drive the goats to the pasture, the youth let them graze in a nearby graveyard. Outraged at this insolent act, the spirits of the buried ancestors cursed the youth. He took the form of a chupacabra, doomed to forever prey on animals for sustenance, shunned and feared by his former neighbors. The locals say that only death will free the boy's spirit, but Papa Chupar is far too quick and clever to be easily slain.",

Gray-green hide thicker than an ordinary chupacabra's seems to draw shadows around it, and two leathery, scaled wings stretch out from the beast's spine. Papa Chupar's eyes glow crimson, and his talons and spines are a deep burgundy. The hilly terrain affords cover that Papa Chupar takes full advantage of.",
			"",
			"Unlike most chupacabras, Papa Chupar is willing to attack adult humanoids and often targets lone travelers, or even travelers in pairs. The chupacabra is particularly clever and vicious, and studies prey for at least an hour before striking. If possible, Papa Chupar prefers to sneak into camps at night and drain blood from sleeping victims. Though a victim's panicked screams wake the whole camp, Papa Chupar easily takes to the sky, invigorated, and flies off. If a watch is set, Papa Chupar has learned to flush small animals from their nests to create a distraction, hoping to lure the guard away and leave sleeping travelers vulnerable to his attack.",

			"Pyralisia, often called \"the Rain of Embers,\" was considered one the strongest and most benevolent phoenixes of Avistan in the early years of the Age of Lost Omens. She rose to prominence during the First Mendevian Crusade by leading the charge against a marilith general and her legion of minions. During the Second Crusade, Pyralisia oversaw the erection of several of the wardstones that kept the Worldwound's demonic hordes contained near the crusader citadel of Drezen. But when an Abyssal rift opened near the wardstone line before the final menhirs were in place, the entire crusade stood on the brink of failure. Without hesitation, Pyralisia threw her body into the yawning chasm, blocking the demons' escape and using her body to absorb the torrents of tainted fire bursting forth.",
			"",
			"Pyralisia's heroic act was not enough, however, and the dark energy pouring from the rift slew her quickly. When she resurrected from her ashes, the Abyssal flames bonded with Pyralisia and corrupted her, instilling her body with dark, negative energy and trapping the Rain of Embers in a body utterly consumed by evil.",
			"",
			"Now, Pyralisia prowls the Worldwound, hunting crusaders and demons alike in her vengeful anger. Phoenixes contend that if she could be killed, Pyralisia's self-resurrection would cleanse her of this malignancy and restore her true goodness. But so far, few have faced Pyralisia and lived to tell the tale. Those phoenixes that have tried to defeat her found themselves outmatched by the new power of Pyralisia's black fire, their own flames as useless against her as against any other of their kind. The phoenix Garidor - Pyralisia's mate prior to her corruption - anxiously watches the roads leading into Mendev, seeking powerful crusaders or adventurers to aid him in destroying his beloved before her perversion becomes permanent.",

			"**Boiling Spray (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Chavazvug can expel blasts of boiling bile, blood, and other bodily fluids from his dozens of seeping, dangling intestinal extrusions. This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug. A creature struck takes 10d10 points of fire damage and 10d10 points of acid damage from this spray of toxic fluids (Reflex DC 34 half). Any creature that takes any damage at all from this boiling spray (regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save) must also succeed at DC 34 Fortitude save or become nauseated by the foul fluids for one round. This nausea effect is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Chavazvug's horrific appearance feels its temperature rise swiftly, as if suddenly beset by a powerful fever. A creature that succeeds at a DC 28 Will save suffers no other effect from the qlippoth lord's horrific appearance, but one that fails gains a fiery red or orange tinge to its flesh. An affected creature takes a permanent -4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains vulnerability to fire. All forms of fire resistance the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire resistance 30 effectively functions as fire resistance 15, for example). All forms of immunity to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance. If a creature has the fire subtype, it loses that subtype as long as it is affected by this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.",

During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of defending and protecting Chavazvug's body). This rejuvenation ability replaces the rejuvenation ability that most qlippoth lords have; Chavazvug is easier to track down and permanently slay, but his rejuvenation ability functions anywhere in the multiverse.",

A creature that is grappling or grappled by Chavazvug takes 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of the creature's turn.",

The creature takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug).

These worshipers believe such a fate is a reward for service, and never seek to trigger such combustion on their own. Worshipers of Chavazvug tend to be solitary lunatics, arsonists, and sadists who delight in burning helpless victims as much as they do in the choking scent of seared flesh or the hypnotic glow of a fiery conflagration consuming a building or woodland. Chavazvug's sacred sites are the burnt-out husks of buildings - particularly buildings where demonic worship once took place.",

If the creature successfully saves, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain and 20d6 points of negative energy damage.

In many cases, such leaders have been dominated or otherwise mentally controlled by Isph-Aun-Vuln so often that they have lost all remnants of their previous personalities. Isph-Aun-Vuln's worshipers venerate her amid standing stones perched on the edges of towering cliffs or rugged, wind-scoured mountain tops, and sacrifices to the demigoddess generally involve using magic to hurl a victim into the sky, where it is buffeted by winds before being allowed to fall to the earth below, broken and ruined.",

Freedom of movement prevents this entangle effect; otherwise, it persists until a character peels off and discards the acidic sludge; doing so requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Attempting to do so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**False Intellect (Su)** In any round that Thuskchoon causes any Intelligence damage to a creature via his swallow whole ability, the qlippoth lord can use that digested intellect to gain the benefits of his intellectual flash ability for 1 round per point of Intelligence damage dealt in that round. This duration stacks if Thuskchoon has swallowed multiple creatures, or if the Intelligence damage continues for more than 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has its mind flooded with horrific recollections that may or may not be real, repressed terrors knocked loose and brought to the conscious mind by the presence of the monstrosity that is Thuskchoon. Often these memories are a strange mix of racial memory and flashes from past lives. The victim also experiences genetic reversions. The victim is immediately affected by {spell/feeblemind} (as per the spell), and its body is deformed and hideously twisted. Select (or choose randomly) from the list of deformities gained from the {template/mutant/ template} to apply to the victim. Alternatively, simply reduce one of the victim's physical ability scores by 4 points (feel free to devise an appropriate cosmetic atrocity to add flavor to this reduction). The feeblemind effect can be cured normally by any effect that removes that condition (see the spell description for more details), but the mutation is permanent and can be removed only via a {spell/miracle} or {spell/wish} spell, or by death and subsequent {spell/resurrection}. Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 0.",
			"",
			"**Intellectual Flash (Ex)** When Thuskchoon enters combat, there's a cumulative 20% chance per round that he receives a flash of intellect. Check for this flash at the start of the qlippoth lord's turn in combat. If the chance succeeds, for that round Thuskchoon loses his nearly mindless weakness and can use his spell-like abilities freely and engage in combat tactics on par with those of a typical human. During that round, Thuskchoon can attempt Knowledge checks untrained with a +20 insight bonus (he retains his -4 penalty from his Intelligence score of 3, so this means his Knowledge checks are attempted with a +16 bonus for this round). The next round, the chance of an intellectual flash occurring is reduced to 0%, but then increases by 20% each subsequent round.",

			"**Nearly Mindless (Ex)** Thuskchoon's limited intellect and his overwhelming hunger combine to make the creature nearly mindless in his actions. Unless he uses his intellectual flash ability or gains the benefit of false intellect, he cannot activate any spell-like abilities and his tactical choices in combat are those of a violent animal. While in his nearly mindless state, Thuskchoon gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Trailing Tar (Ex)** Thuskchoon exudes a thick swath of sticky, tarlike sludge whenever he moves using his base speed. Any square he passes over using this base speed is transformed into difficult terrain for 1 hour. Freedom of movement allows free passage through this sticky terrain, and a dose of universal solvent can cleanse one 5-foot-square area of tar. Spell effects that cleanse an area of filth or detritus can also remove this difficult terrain, provided the spell effect in question is 6th level or higher.",

			"Not all of the qlippoth lords have alien intelligences that outstrip the minds of most mortals. In the case of Thuskchoon, the qlippoth lord's intellect is replaced almost entirely by a ravenous need to consume and feed. Now and then, the qlippoth lord gains flashes of insight and momentarily comprehends vast puzzles of reality, yet those brief insights fade quickly. These periods of insight are lengthened when Thuskchoon consumes prey, for as he digests flesh, he also digests thought, and can parasitize his victim's minds in order to act with purpose.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon's Abyssal sanctum is a vast warren of tunnels that wind through the depths of the Abyss and connect most, if not all, of the other qlippoth sanctums. Rarely does he spend time in this maze of caves, though, instead aimlessly wandering the depths of the Abyss in constant search of anything to sate his eternal hunger. Now and then, the qlippoth lord blunders through portals that bring his ravenings to other planes, whereupon it is but a matter of time before he is banished or slain and forced to start his wanderings over anew from his sanctum's heart.",

			"",
			"The worshipers of Thuskchoon refer to the qlippoth lord as the Everglutton to honor his nearly mindless and nigh-constant hunger. Cultists of this unusual qlippoth lord venerate him while not expecting much in the way of intentional reward, for a core part of the faith is the acknowledgement that Thuskchoon is not particularly driven by intellect. The secrets he reveals are potent and world-shaking, yet they are accidental revelations - the circumstantial repercussions of the meandering swaths of destruction the Everglutton leaves in his wake as he lumbers through creation. Temples of Thuskchoon are converted from large caverns or ruined buildings, but the cult is nomadic and never remains in one location for long. Visions of new regions to savage and destroy constantly plague the leaders of this qlippoth lord's cults, but now and then they may settle in a region for a few years. In these cases, they tend to carve hideous pictographs and foul Abyssal prayers into the stones that make up their temporary shrines. Just as the qlippoth lord himself can gain momentary flashes of insight from the minds of digested victims, so do his cultists constantly seek new drugs, poisons, and exotic consumables to feed upon in hopes of being granted strange visions or unexpected answers to questions they haven't dared ask.",

Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.",

Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The \"new flesh\" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects' men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the {monster/gongorinan/s}.",

			"Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought.",

Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.",

			"Rahstalshan was scarcely old enough to speak when her parents and clan were slain by a tribe of raiding Mammoth Lord Kellids. The raiders tried to take the young stone giant to raise as their own, but she narrowly escaped their clutches, fleeing deep into the Tusk Mountains, orphaned and alone. For the next 700 years, she wandered throughout the peaks of Avistan, staying briefly with each stone giant clan she met along the way. From the Tusks to the Mindspins she roamed, though she was inevitably drawn to leave each new tribe soon after she discovered them. During these journeys she claimed her giant name, Rahstalshan, \"the wanderer in stone.\"",
			"",
			"Despairing of ever finding a true home, Rahstalshan felt the pull of the towering Kodar Mountains. Choosing a peak at random, she climbed and climbed, heedless of the biting cold. Near the mountain's top she found an inviting cave overlooking the sprawling lands of the frozen north. Though she had no way of being sure, the ancient stone giant felt that these mountains were her true homeland. Settled in her cave, at peace, she waited for death to take her. Instead, for the first time in her long life, she heard the whispers in the stone, awakening within her the ancient earth magic of her people. She descended from the heights and soon came upon a fledgling tribe of stone giants, bereft of an elder and as lost as she had been. She has guided their path ever since."

The fortunate ones resist the fell influence of the Dark Tapestry and survive with their minds intact.",
			"",
			"Raskineya was not one of the fortunate ones. The taint of the void shattered her mind, driving her to mindless violence and destruction. In her madness she sought out the inner planets of Golarion's solar system, plunging into the gravity wells of the inhabited worlds to feed and raze before fleeing back to the stars and plotting her next attack.",
			"",
			"This urge to destroy is what brought her to the attention of the cult of Rovagug. Priests of the Rough Beast often enslave powerful creatures to serve as proxies for their shackled god and guardians for their hidden temples, and Raskineya's savagery and madness made her an excellent prospect. The priests called to the stars, whispering promises of blood to the dragon to lure her into their waiting clutches. In her unthinking madness, she was no match for the cunning priests, and soon she was subdued, shackled, and locked in a cavern hidden deep within the earth.",
			"",
			"Raskineya languished at first, longing to once again fly to the stars and seek exotic new prey. Yet the priests had not lied to her when they promised her blood. She was given sacrifices and allowed to hunt and feed within her underground prison. With each such sacrifice, she not only grew stronger and more focused, but also found began to understand the prayers given to her. This world was promised to Rovagug, and he would have it. All worlds were promised to him, and he would destroy them all. Even the gods themselves would fall to his power, and in his wake only nothingness would remain. Raskineya found in Rovagug something she had not realized she was searching for: someone to champion. If she could but release this Unmaker, she could at long last have vengeance upon this existence, and upon the nameless ones who drew her here. All that would be left in his wake would be nothingness, and to nothingness her heart longed to return.",
			"",
			"With her newfound sense of purpose, Raskineya turned upon her captors. Her mind intact for the first time in centuries, she quickly overpowered them. First, she swallowed the high priest alive, consuming his life and essence to fuel her ascension. Then she enslaved the priests, and commanded them to find her a way to unleash their god upon the world once more. From them she learned of a prophecy, set down by the oracles of the brimstone haruspex, that a dark comet would herald the return of Gormuz - the first and most powerful of Rovagug's spawn - who would in turn unleash the Rough Beast himself. Raskineya sees herself as this dark comet, and demands all those who address her to call her by that name (with a slow death awaiting to those who do not).",
			"",
			"In the years since her ascension, Raskineya first scoured the world searching for the Star Towers-artifacts created by the gods to strengthen Rovagug's prison. The dragon was certain that if she could locate the first of these towers and destroy it, the rest will fall like dominoes, weakening the foundations of Rovagug's prison enough to allow his escape. She moved from Star Tower to Star Tower, searching for clues as to the location of the original. She last conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, winning it from a paladin of Sarenrae named Dazma the Bright, who had learned of the dragon's design on the tower and marshaled an army to defend it. Raskineya vanquished Dazma and her army by dragging meteors from the sky to drop on the Sarenites. Those who survived the initial bombardment were savaged by akatas carried within the meteors, leaving the remainder easy pickings for the dragon.",
			"",
			"Though it seemed she was getting closer to her goal, Raskineya's devotion to Rovagug made her actions unpredictable. Just as she conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, she heard a pressing call she believed came from Rovagug himself. She flew to the Pit of Gormuz, where she made a den in the Crater of Carnal Joining in anticipation of the Rough Beast's arrival. There she waits, conducting horrific rituals to attract his attention. She brought with her the Sarenite survivors of the raid on the Star Tower, who she keeps alive as subjects for her rites. Once noble soldiers, they're now maimed and driven mad, kept in perpetual darkness within a small cave in Raskineya's lair. The warriors of the Maimed Legion, as she calls them, see light only when they're being tortured."

If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).",
			"",
			"**Summon Demons (Sp)** As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.",

			"Shamira, the Ardent Dream, is the nominal ruler of the isle of Alinythia, and by extension the city of Alushinyrra, but with the honor of ruling the largest of the Midnight Isles comes with an unwritten caveat-Nocticula's palace overlooks the city from its own isle. While this position is one that Shamira revels in, and one that has afforded her no small amount of influence (indeed, it's helped to propel her into the ranks of nascent demon lords), the Ardent Dream knows that her mistress watches over her always, and surely regards her not only as a valued lover, companion, and minion, but also as the closest thing Nocticula has to competition. Of course, Shamira does keep an eye out for any opportunity she has to erode some of Nocticula's power, for someday she hopes to wear Nocticula's crown.",
			"",
			"Shamira is unique in her appearance. Even before she became a nascent demon lord, her burning wings and flowing crimson hair marked her as a succubus of power. Close-lipped about her history, she appeared in Nocticula's palace one moonrise and seduced the Lady in Shadow, thus earning the position of Lady of Alinythia. (Nocticula banished Shamira's predecessor, an incubus named Ziforian, to the sewers below the city, where he may yet lurk.) None in the Abyss recall this majestic and unmistakable succubus in the city before her arrival in Nocticula's boudoir. Shamira does little to quell rumors that her previous home was a much loftier place than the Abyss, and her resemblance to the deity Sarenrae provides endless speculation."

			"Even before he was recruited by Deskari to raze the Green Faith from Sarkoris, the vrolikai Shaorhaz had a long tradition of antipathy toward the druidic faith. When Shaorhaz first came to the Material Plane to grow, he had the misfortune of appearing in the small village of Rookhill in southeastern Ustalav. At first, Shaorhaz met little opposition from the villagers, and he fed with impunity. But then a cabal of druids came to Rookhill's aid, and Shaorhaz found his hunting grounds increasingly well guarded and dangerous. Stubborn to a fault, the nabasu refused to move on to easier hunting grounds elsewhere, and time and time again, he clashed with the druids. With each attempt to kill them, though, the druids grew more and more adept at fighting the nabasu, and with each dawn, it seemed that the very wilderness in which he had enjoyed hiding for so many months was turning against him. When the nabasu was nearly slain by the druids' treant ally, he made a desperate attempt to assassinate their leader. This foolish assault earned the nabasu nothing more than the loss of his accumulated growth, as the druid sacrificed his life to return the spiritual energies the demon had fed upon to the land. Only then did Shaorhaz flee Ustalav, teleporting to another wilderness to start over. It took the demon 10 times as long as he'd hoped to finally achieve apotheosis and transform to a vrolikai, and in that time, his hatred of the druidic faith only grew.",
			"",
			"Today, Shaorhaz rules over the ruins of the Forest of Stones in what was once northern Sarkoris. This region, known today as the Stonewilds, was once sacred to the Green Faith, but now the only druids who remain are the warped and twisted undead abominations known as siabraes, for when it became clear that Shaorhaz had won the battle, the last few druids turned again to sacrifice to defeat the demon. Yet this time, the tactic did not work. This time, Shaorhaz was prepared, and the vile energies he commanded reflected back upon the druids, turning them into the very things they detested most. Since then, Shaorhaz has spent the majority of his time within his palace, Greengrave, searching for a way to feed not on more mortal souls but upon the very soul of Golarion itself.",
			"",
			"Shaorhaz prefers offerings of druids, especially those of the Green Faith. He often promises to let these offerings live if they can reveal to him something of the druidic faith that he has not already confirmed for himself - those druids foolish enough to take the demon at his word get the deaths they deserve. It's a DC 33 check to research the Glutton of the Green."

As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them.

Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes.

In addition to looking in on the nation that has arisen under his wings, he wanders the Outer Sphere, often acting as an ambassador between mortal priesthoods and the immortal servants of Erastil, Iomedae, and Shelyn.",
			"",
			"Like most agathions, Talmandor takes an interest in influencing mortals and bringing them to a place of enlightenment. He is convinced that the greatest enlightenment for mortals can be achieved through social interaction. He has observed that mortals respond best to a full, robust engagement with their fellow citizens, and that it's important to have a voice in the decisionmaking process of one's society. Talmandor sees hereditary aristocracy and primogeniture as shackles slowing society's ascent into a place of justice and peace where all citizens work together for the common good. Talmandor does not want the rights and importance of individuals to be sacrificed for the greater good, and advocates a balance between collective needs and communitarian works on the one hand and the individual's personal responsibilities and liberties on the other.",
			"",
			"According to popular legend, Talmandor developed his democratic theories and shared them with the mortal poet Darl Jubannich, who transcribed them in his now-famous treatise, On Government. However, while Talmandor favored overturning established structures of power where necessary, he never promoted anarchy and has long felt great sadness over how the core tenets of his political philosophy have been twisted beyond recognition in Galt. He strives to promote moderation and peaceful reconciliation within government, even in times of upheaval.",
			"",
			"In some parts of Andoran, the adulation Talmandor has earned goes beyond respect to outright worship. The agathion steadfastly refuses to seek godhood in his own right, as he believes he can be a better inspiration to the goals of democratic freedom as a powerful outsider who can aid the mortal citizens of Andoran in times of great need, rather than becoming a godlike creature they worship from afar. Talmandor typically assists only those he feels have earned the right to call upon any ally of Andoran, though he is pleased to give advice to anyone if asked in earnest. He often appears to speak when called upon by the People's Council, offering what guidance he can, but never insists that his suggestions be enacted. He has been known to appear at the meetings of smaller city and town councils as well, though as a guest he does not speak until the council asks him to. Only if Andoran faced some threat it found impossible to handle on its own without his aid would Talmandor take direct action to protect the nation, though his regular presence is certainly considered carefully by Andoran's enemies.",
			"",
			"Though Andoran celebrates a feast day in his honor on 4 Erastus, Talmandor insists the celebration is held to honor him in his capacity as one of many heroes of the nation, rather than as its divine protector. Despite his refusal of the mantle of divinity, a few in Andoran (including a small but growing number of oracles and paladins) revere him as a nascent demigod embodying the virtues of hope, liberty, and community, and his worship has begun to grow in small congregations across the country.",
			"",
			"Talmandor is closely associated with birds of prey and as a result is the patron of the Steel Falcons order of the [Eagle Knights](rule/aff_vangard) of Andoran, as well as a frequent advisor to leaders within the order. Talmandor inspires their work as ambassadors of liberty, and he sometimes even sends aid to those in the midst of dangerous political missions aimed at cultivating peace. Those who rise to greatness also receive Talmandor's direct blessing, which he sees as a rightful reward for good works and a tool that allows those blessed to achieve even greater things. If called to serve through powerful magic (such as gate), Talmandor generally answers but refuses to grant direct assistance except to those overwhelmingly outmatched by evil foes. Even then, he generally requires any aid he gives be paid for in massive donations to the poor and oppressed, though he also often offers a free alternative to his direct involvement, such as receiving his blessing (often crafted with miracle) or gaining some insight into the caller's foes."

They are beautiful beyond compare, and they use their allure and wiles to draw travelers to their swampy home. Invariably, such victims end up in the waiting jaws of the Mistress of the Fen.",
			"",
			"Those who live on the edges of the fen avoid the place despite the lure of easy fishing and lost funeral barges said to be crammed with treasure. They know of the Mistress, her followers, and her sacrifices. Many suspect it was the changelings who gave the orm her powers over rot and fecundity, but the witches deny this, claiming that the Mistress has always possessed such gifts. Their chants can be heard at all times across the murky waters of the swamp, and on moonless nights, one can catch a glimpse of the changelings as they take turns kissing the fetid jaws of their revered mother and drinking in her pestilence."

Still other inhabitants of the Darklands would like to see the Mourning One put to different uses - in Delvingulf, drow fleshwarpers view the monstrous sea serpent as a figure of great awe as well as potential. If it were to be captured, they could perhaps learn how to further utilize the strange substance known as black blood in subsequent experiments."

Though his origins are lost to time, it's thought that he grew up on the shores of Lake Encarthan, where he first studied the necromantic arts. As his power grew, so did his ambition, eventually leading him to the Cenotaph, the resting place of the slumbering runelord of gluttony. After unlocking the powers of Zutha, Tar-Baphon gained power beyond that of mortals. He realized then that true greatness required bringing the world itself under his control-alive or dead, all would serve him.",

Tar-Baphon's broken form lay among the rubble, and Aroden buried him there, thinking that was the end of the threat.",

For Tar-Baphon's last step in becoming a lich beyond compare, he needed to be killed by a god, and Aroden served this purpose. The process sparked by Aroden took time, however, and for 2,307 years Tar-Baphon's body laid dead in the ground before he returned to grim unlife. The Whispering Tyrant was born.",
			"",
			"He soon reestablished his power, animating thousands of dead. For centuries, the forces of the living were unable to resist the tide of the dead-with Aroden gone, nothing could stop the Whispering Tyrant. Only the Shining Crusade had a chance to end his threat. Bearing the Shield of Aroden, General Arnisant faced the lich, but when the Whispering Tyrant used a wish to summon the general's heart to his waiting claw, the symbol of Aroden flared to life, the shield shattered, and the lich's body was destroyed. Without a means to locate the Tyrant's phylactery, let alone destroy it, the crusaders instead sealed him away in his tower, where their descendants remain ever watchful for his return."

			"**Aura of Corruption (Su)** Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming fungoid in nature. Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Defoliation (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits** A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.",

All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil - in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests.",

			"Treerazer, the self-styled Lord of the Blasted Tarn, was once the favored minion and lieutenant (some even say child) of Cyth-V-sug, Demon Lord of Fungus and Parasites. After a failed attempt to wrest that crown away from Cyth-V-sug, Treerazer fled to the Material Plane. Cyth-V-sug was unable (or perhaps only unwilling) to pursue, but took steps to ensure that Treerazer would remain there by exiling him, transforming Treerazer into a native outsider and severing his bond to the Abyss - if the Lord of the Blasted Tarn is slain, his animus will not return to the Abyss and reform. Death, to Treerazer, is a permanent thing.",
			"",
			"Treerazer arrived on Golarion near the end of the Age of Darkness, and found the savaged planet much to his liking - so much so that the sting of exile was somewhat ameliorated. He spent many centuries wandering the remote corners of Golarion before finally coming upon the abandoned elven nation of Kyonin in 2497 ar. In the Sovyrian Stone, he found an artifact that he believed he could use to reinstate his Abyssal link and, perhaps, even uproot the entire nation and refocus the portal from Sovyrian to the Abyss, thereby reclaiming his position there and taking one more step toward revenge against Cyth-V-sug. Yet the elves sensed his tamperings and returned to confront the demon. A terrific battle resulted, and while the elves were able to drive Treerazer out of Iadara and into southern Kyonin, they were unable to slay him or force him out completely - they merely concentrated his power in a smaller region. Instead, the elves \"walled off\" this region, a perverted realm known today as the Tanglebriar. Treerazer lurks at the Tanglebriar's heart to this day, the greatest bogeyman in elven mythology and a very real and constant threat to the nation's security.",
			"",
			"Treerazer begins most combats by casting time stop and raising an antiplant shell to prevent plant creatures (including creatures under the effect of his aura of corruption) from approaching. If he has time, he also creates walls of thorns and summons demons (usually four nalfeshnees and 12 hezrous). In melee, Treerazer gleefully takes up Blackaxe and makes full attacks against the closest foe, or Greater Vital Strikes if he's forced to move or charge. During the first 3 rounds of combat, he targets obvious spell effects with quickened greater dispel magic. If Treerazer is reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he teleports back to his fortress, Witchbole, to recover and plan his revenge."

Triaza keeps the members of her cult pacified by allowing them various means of venting their depraved and violent desires, yet still worries about her tenure as ruler, given that her cult is now cut off from the rest of urdefhan society. A time may come when her underlings decide she is not fit to lead, and instead plot to push her to pair with a daemon to continue the propagation of the cult. She has no solid arguments against the importance of increasing their numbers, but is loath to accede to a plan that would take her away from the bountiful death-dealing opportunities offered by the surface world, which are the only activities in which she finds any pleasure or fulfillment."

Little information regarding Tychilarius from this bygone era survives to the current day, and what has resurfaced is contradictory and vague. What is known is that Tychilarius is a powerful leader in the Dominion of the Black, a starfaring association of creatures from the Dark Tapestry.",
			"",
			"While Tychilarius's relationship with the early Osirians seems to have been primarily antagonistic, there is evidence that a few cults formed around the being. Many scholarly texts claim that these early cultists gave Tychilarius the appellation \"The Drowned God.\" That title, however, is a misnomer, for while Tychilarius is aquatic and extremely powerful, it can't grant spells and is not a god. In truth, the appellation is a mistranslation made by a scholar-cultist who was less than savvy about the intricacies of the Dominion of the Black's use of language. Older texts suggest that the closest accurate approximation of this being's title is \"They Drown the Gods in Oblivion.\" Modernday scholars, theologians, and would-be worshipers simply use the name \"Tychilarius.\" The name by which the early Osirian cultists addressed the creature has been lost to history, and most extant records suggest that they referred to the focus of their worship primarily by epithets.",
			"",
			"Many academics suspect that Tychilarius originally hailed from the planet Aucturn, considering the being's connection to Osirion and the countdown clocks within that country mysteriously linked to Aucturn's movement.

It is said that Tychilarius was birthed from a black hole into which millions of foul creatures had been pulled. They were ripped apart into mere particles and reassembled into the terror incarnate that was somehow ejected from the oblivion within the black hole.",
			"",
			"Tychilarius is believed to be immortal, and has traveled throughout the cosmos. Well after its creation, it likely spent time on Aucturn before coming to Golarion. Currently - mercifully - it is locked away in some manner of prison. The nature of this confinement is uncertain, but what matters is that for the moment, Tychilarius cannot reach Golarion. Scholars posit that the creature was banished while it dwelled in Osirion, perhaps by ancient Osirian wizards or clerics, and that the door and key to this prison still rest somewhere in that ancient nation.",
			"",
			"Cultists such as the Night Heralds have performed hundreds of rituals over the years to call Tychilarius back to this world, but to date none have succeeded. Despite these failures, the Night Heralds remain unfazed and continue their dark work. In recent years, a cell of Night Herald cultists uncovered a supposed relic that would draw Tychilarius from its prison into the body and mind of another being. Though the ritual failed and most of the cultists were slain, rumors insist the attempt was almost a success. Admittedly, these tales mostly circulate among other cultists eager to succeed where their predecessors failed. True or not, these claims have spurred an increase in such activity by the Night Heralds. While none have yet managed to free Tychilarius, their attempts have summoned a host of lesser, but still dangerous, malevolent creatures.",
			"",
			"Many scholars study beings such as Tychilarius out of simple curiosity or - especially among theologians of goodly churches - with an eye toward protecting the world from the ravages of these creatures. Yet the most knowledge of Tychilarius rests in the hands of those who study the Dominion of the Black and among the members of the Night Heralds, who hope to attract the attention of the creatures in the Dark Tapestry and bring about the end of Golarion. In addition to delving into this forbidden knowledge themselves, such cultists do what they can to eliminate it from the libraries of those who might use it to keep Tychilarius sealed away, stealing and destroying documents and even murdering scholars. If they ever successfully open the door to Tychilarius's prison, Golarion will certainly fall under the glaring eye of the Dominion, and it would be only a matter of time before the Dominion of the Black's organic starships begin dropping to the planet's surface."
