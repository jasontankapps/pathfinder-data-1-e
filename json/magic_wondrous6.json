Once activated in this manner, the lintel stone remains affixed to the portal, in defiance of gravity, and cannot be removed for 1 minute. During this time, creatures stepping through the opening must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be shunted to the plane to which the metal rod is attuned. All travelers appear in the same location, stepping out of another portal somewhere on the destination plane (which might be a constructed doorway or a natural arch, as befits the destination plane). Unlike with plane shift, the creature activating a lintel stone has no control over the arrival point on the destination plane, although the portal is usually in a similar area (such as an urban one, if activated in a city). One minute after activation, the lintel stone disappears, reappearing among the possessions of the creature that activated it, regardless of the current location or plane of that creature. A lintel stone can be activated once per day.",

Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars.",

A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.",

			"Forged from adamantine and silver, this heavy lock's shank is large enough to wrap around a humanoid ankle, magically resizing itself to fit any wearer. When the lock is placed on a creature, it immediately suppresses all magical polymorph effects or supernatural shapechanging effects (such as a lycanthrope's change shape ability) affecting the wearer, returning her to her true form. The lock of formbinding does not negate these effects, and creatures return to their altered form if the lock is removed before the effect's duration expires. Creatures targeted by a polymorph effect while wearing a lock of formbinding are affected for only a single round before the lock returns them to their true form. A creature wearing a lock of formbinding can likewise change its own shape, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw at the end of each round or revert to its true form; the lock resizes to accommodate whatever new forms its wearer might temporarily assume.",
			"",
			"Attaching the lock of formbinding is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Unwilling creatures must be unconscious, pinned, or helpless before the lock can be attached. The lock has hardness 20 and 20 hit points, and without the key, it can be removed only with a successful DC 30 Strength check, a DC 37 Escape Artist check, or DC 30 Disable Device check.",

			"The wielder of the unicorn's blackened horn can be healed by positive energy as well as negative energy, regardless of her creature type, as long as she holds the horn. When holding the horn, a spellcaster can also use its corrupted innocence to shape both positive and negative energy. If the wielder prepares spells, a prepared cure spell (any spell with \"cure\" in its name) can be spontaneously converted as it is cast into any inflict spell (any spell with \"inflict\" in its name) of the same level or lower, and vice versa, even if the cure or inflict spell is not normally on her spell list. When others attempt to use Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) to identify a spell cast in this way, the spell appears to be the cure or inflict spell that is being converted (not the spell actually being cast) unless the identifier exceeds the Spellcraft or Knowledge (arcana) DC by 10. In this case, the identifier correctly identifies the spell. Analyze dweomer, greater arcane sight, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal the converted spell for what it is.",

			"Furthermore, if the spellcaster is able to spontaneously cast either cure or inflict spells (for an example, see the cleric's spontaneous casting ability), then she can spontaneously cast both cure and inflict spells while wielding the unicorn's blackened horn. If the wielder can channel energy using a class feature, twice per day she can channel the opposite type of energy that she normally channels.",

The negative level remains as long as the horn is held in hand and disappears when the horn is no longer held. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the horn is held.",
