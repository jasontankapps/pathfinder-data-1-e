			"{SOURCE Adventurer's Guide/5}",
			"",
			"Affiliation with a group means that a character has proven to be an ally with the group's interests at heart and is trusted to be a caretaker for that group's secrets.",
			"",
			"***Affiliation Slots:*** Each PC has a number of affiliation slots equal to the character's Charisma modifier + 1 (minimum 1 slot). Each time a PC takes the {feat/Additional Affiliations} feat, his total number of affiliation slots increases by 2. Finally, a GM can award bonus affiliation slots as rewards for gameplay, but typically these slots must be spent on specific groups. (For example, after the PCs successfully undertake a dangerous mission for the [Silver Ravens](rule/aff_rebels), the GM may reward the group with a bonus affiliation with the Silver Ravens.)",
			"",
			"***Starting Affiliation:*** A player can choose her PC's first affiliation when she creates the character, so long as she justifies her choice via the character's background. For example, perhaps a PC's parents belong to the [Pathfinder Society](rule/aff_scholars), and her parents' reputation in that organization could vouch for her own affiliation. A PC born into an [Al-Zabriti](rule/aff_deserts) tribe may retain her birthright and history by belonging to these horse-riding folk despite having since traveled far from Qadira. Or maybe a PC was rescued from slavery at a young age by members of the [Bellflower Network](rule/aff_antislavery), and has modeled his life upon heroes from that group. This starting affiliation must be approved by the GM, who may say that certain affiliations are off-limits or some organizations must be contacted in-play before joining.",
			"",
			"***Subsequent Affiliations:*** Once play begins, a PC must seek out and contact agents of an organization before attempting to join or gain affiliation with it. Upon making contact, she must convince that agent that she would make a good addition to the organization. Players should speak with their GM out of the game when they make the decision to pursue affiliation with a group, since the GM has final say as to which groups (and thus which options) are available. An affiliation should never be something players just decide they have on their own - it should be the result of gameplay and interaction with NPCs associated with the organization. Additional information on how to earn affiliation is presented in each group's section, along with a short example encounter GMs can use as inspiration for setting up the attempt to affiliate with the group.",
			"",
			"### Affiliations for Adventuring Parties",
			"",
			"At the GM's discretion, an entire adventuring party can have a group affiliation. In such a case, the assumption is that the campaign the GM has chosen to run involves the whole party being agents of a specific group. Once the GM assigns a group affiliation, all members of the party are treated as if they were affiliated with that group. This affiliation does not take up any individual PC's affiliation slots.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, a party can use rules for membership in groups, such as those presented in {rule/factions}, or joining a group could be a significant part of a published campaign. In such a case, a character automatically gains affiliation with a group once he successfully joins the group in question.",
			"",
			"### Afiliations for NPCs",
			"",
			"An NPC should typically have only one affiliation (if any), and the GM gets to decide what that affiliation is. Yet there is no maximum number of affiliations for NPCs - an NPC can have as many as are needed for the GM to tell the story she wishes to tell. It's generally unnecessary to list in an NPC's statistics what affiliations he has, since that should be clear from the NPC's background.",
			"",
			"### Rivals",
			"",
			"Note that certain groups have rivals listed in their group stat blocks, representing long-standing conflicts with other groups. The [Aspis Consortium](rule/aff_profiteers) and the Pathfinder Society are perennial enemies, and the [Hellknights](rule/aff_lawknights) and the Bellflower Network have long been at odds. There's no reason that characters of rival affiliations can't exist in the same adventuring party (although such a group will likely be more prone to party strife than others), but a single character cannot normally have an affiliation with two rival groups.",
			"",
			"### Abandoning Affiliations",
			"",
			"A character can abandon an affiliation at any time, but she cannot replace the abandoned affiliation with a new affiliation until she has gained at least 1 character level (unless the GM decrees otherwise). Once a character has abandoned her affiliation with a group, only exceptional circumstances can allow her to regain her affiliation with that group. Abandoning an affiliation may have in-game repercussions, as members of the group may not take kindly to learning that a character has deserted them.",
			"",
			"When a character abandons an affiliation, she cannot gain new options from that group until her affiliation with the group is restored. However, she does not lose access to options she already has, and can still gain access to affiliation options via alternative means. If a character has a prestige class or archetype associated with a group, she can continue to gain levels in that class or archetype, regardless of her current affiliation status with that group.",
			"",
			"As an alternative way to gain more affiliation slots rather than abandoning one, a character could take the {feat/Additional Affiliations} feat to expand her set of affiliations without having to sacrifice existing affiliations. And of course, if a character's Charisma score (and thus her Charisma modifier) permanently increases, she can gain access to new affiliation slots as a result.",
			"",
			"### Important Notes",
			"",
			"***1:*** The affiliations listed here were printed in {source/Adventurer's Guide} and have been converted into generic entities, removing proper names and Pathfinder-specific lore that likely isn't considered Open Game Content.",
			"",
			"***2:*** There was also a separate publication with rules for {rule/Factions} that can be used with/instead of these rules."

			"",
			"### Step 2: Evaluate Item",
			"",
			"The buyer chooses to attempt either an {skill/Appraise} check to estimate the item's value or a {skill/Sense Motive} check opposed by the seller's {skill/Bluff} check (with failure meaning the buyer believes the seller is being fair). If the seller's price is the same as the buyer's estimation of the item's value, no Sense Motive check is needed and the buyer believes the seller.",
			"",
			"A group of items can be sold as a unit. If the buyer is dealing with a mix of items she can appraise and others she can only guess about, she uses either Appraise or Sense Motive, depending on which she has more skill ranks in.",
			"",
			"The GM can allow a PC to substitute an appropriate Knowledge skill for Appraise or Sense Motive, such as {skill/Knowledge (arcana)} for selling a rare book about magic. He may also assign modifiers to skill checks to reflect expertise or ignorance about a specific type of item, good roleplaying, or insulting behavior toward an NPC buyer or seller.",
			"",
			"### Step 3: Determine Undercut",
			"",
			"The **Undercut Percentage** is a portion of the item's price or value used to determine the buyer's Initial and Final Offers.",
			"",
			"To determine the *Undercut Percentage,* have the buyer attempt a Bluff check opposed by the seller's Sense Motive check. The *Undercut Percentage* is 2%, plus 1% for every point by which the Bluff check exceeds the Sense Motive check (minimum 0%).",
			"",
			"### Step 4: Set Offers",
			"",
			"The **Initial Offer** is the buyer's first counteroffer to the seller's *Asking Price.*",
			"",
			"The **Final Offer** is the largest amount the buyer is willing to pay. Though the seller and buyer negotiate back and forth, the buyer won't exceed this offer. For example, if the seller's *Asking Price* is 1,000 gp, the buyer's *Initial Offer* may be 800 gp and the *Final Offer* 900 gp. These offers are determined by how much the buyer thinks the item is worth compared to the seller's *Asking Price.*",
			"",
			">**Fair (Appraise or Sense Motive):** If the seller's *Asking Price* is less than or equal to the amount that the buyer thinks the item is worth, subtract the *Undercut Percentage* from the seller's price to get the *Final Offer,* and subtract 2 &times; the *Undercut Percentage* to get the *Initial Offer.*",
			"",
			">**Unfair (Appraise):** If the result of the buyer's Appraise check leads her to believe the item is worth less than the seller's *Asking Price,* subtract the *Undercut Percentage* from the buyer's estimate of the item's value to get the *Final Offer,* and subtract 2 &times; the *Undercut Percentage* to get the *Initial Offer.*",
			"",
			">**Unfair (Sense Motive):** If the result of the buyer's Appraise check leads her to believe the seller's *Asking Price* is too high, subtract 2 &times; the *Undercut Percentage* from the seller's *Asking Price* to get the *Final Offer,* and subtract 4 &times; the *Undercut Percentage* to get the *Initial Offer.*",

Failure means the buyer holds at her *Initial Offer.* The seller can try again, but the Diplomacy check DC increases by 5 unless the seller lowers his price.",

Failure means the buyer counteroffers at a price between the *Initial Offer* and the *Final Offer.* The seller can try again, but the Diplomacy DC increases by 5 unless the seller lowers his price.",

Success means the buyer counteroffers at a price between the *Initial Offer* and the *Final Offer.* Failure means the buyer holds at her *Initial Offer.* Failure by 5 or more means the buyer is insulted and lowers her offer or refuses to deal with the seller.

The collector succeeds at her Appraise check and realizes the idol's actual value. The collector attempts a Bluff check against Orshok's Sense Motive check and succeeds by 1, so her *Undercut Percentage* is 3% (base 2% plus 1% for exceeding the check by 1). Because the collector thinks the idol is worth less than Orshok's price, her *Initial Offer* is 6% less than her estimate of the value (1,692 gp) and her *Final Offer* is 3% less than her estimate (1,746 gp). When she makes her *Initial Offer,* Orshok counters with a price of 2,000 gp. This is higher than the collector's *Final Offer,* so Orshok attempts a Diplomacy check whose DC equals 25 + the buyer's Charisma modifier to keep the buyer's interest. He succeeds at the check, so the buyer counteroffers 1,740 gp (between her *Initial* and *Final Offers*). Orshok doesn't think the collector will go much higher, and decides to find another buyer.",

The merchant attempts a Bluff check opposed by Orshok's Sense Motive check and succeeds by 4, which makes her *Undercut Percentage* 6% (base 2% plus 4% for exceeding the check by 4). The merchant's *Initial Offer* is 12% less than Orshok's price (1,936 gp), and her *Final Offer* is 6% less than Orshok's price (2,068 gp). Orshok counters with a price of 2,000 gp. This is less than the merchant's *Final Offer,* so Orshok attempts a Diplomacy check (DC 15 + the buyer's Charisma modifier).

A low-level contact can dig up a local rumor, tell you where to find a good meal, or impart basic knowledge. However, as you earn more of a contact's trust, he might perform greater tasks with greater personal risk, such as helping you track down an adversary, bailing you out of jail, or loaning you a magic item.",

They aren't limited to a specific social class or profession. A contact with few connections is capable of providing only minimal aid to you, but others might have more significant resources. A contact's ability to aid you might even shift over the course of your adventuring career. Changes to a contact's profession, rising or falling social status, and other personal events can alter his ability to provide aid.",

			"Sometimes a contact needs compensation for his trouble, or at least reimbursement for costs incurred while working on your behalf. Criminal contacts in particular almost always charge for their services or demand favors in return. A contact from a temple or guild might expect you to give a donation to the temple or pay guild fees. Other times, costs arise out of necessity. A contact who needs anonymity to accomplish a task might require additional funds for bribes or to purchase covert access to a secret location. Likewise, you shouldn't expect a spellcaster contact to pay for the expensive material components when casting a spell on your behalf.",

For example, your childhood friend might have close ties with a political organization, thieves' guild, or street gang, but may keep this information secret to protect himself and you. At some point, the friend reveals this connection and becomes a contact for you.

As these interactions accrue, the level of Trust increases (see {rule/Gaining, Cultivating, and Losing Contacts}). A contact can have different Trust scores for different PCs in the same adventuring party; a city guard could have a high Trust score for a paladin PC he's known for a while and a low Trust score for a wizard PC who is new to town.

A wary contact performs only basic tasks that assume little to no personal risk.",

He can be called upon to perform tasks of minimal risk, but refuses any task that might jeopardize his safety, public image, or finances. If questioned about you, the skeptical contact attempts to remain neutral when describing his relationship and won't immediately turn on you.",
			"",
			"***3. Reliable:*** A reliable contact still doesn't fully trust you, but is willing to make a greater effort to help. He might perform tasks that place him at slightly greater risk, such as hiding a fugitive on his property or loaning small sums of money or nonmagical items. A reliable contact is not willing to assume greater risk solely out of trust in you, and tries to protect his own reputation as a reliable contact.",
			"",
			"***4. Trustworthy:*** A trustworthy contact holds you in high regard. When you ask for assistance, he sincerely desires to aid you. He puts in extra time and effort to assure success, but still avoids undertaking tasks that would place him or his loved ones in significant danger. He will not lightly accept a task that would destroy his career, reputation, or finances.",
			"",
			"***5. Confidant:*** At this level, the contact trusts you with his life. He attempts to help you even if it stretches his personal means or involves great personal risk. A confidant never turns against you unless he's shown absolute proof that you betrayed him."

Moderate:*** Moderately risky tasks include lying to authorities on your behalf, making forgeries, helping you evade authorities (such as by providing horses or casting a {spell/teleport} spell), or loaning you money or equipment (worth up to 1/3 your estimated gear value according to [Table 12-4: Character Wealth By Level](rule/placing_treasure)).

A conversation with a local miller or lumberjack attracts far less attention than a conversation with the sister of a powerful guildmaster or multiple visits to the grand vizier's chambers. Likewise, asking a notorious assassin to see whether an ailing wizard friend is recovering may be construed as a threat, asking a crazed wizard contact for local rumors is more likely to reflect poorly on you than asking a popular bard, and keeping company with criminals, outcasts, or other shady characters might implicate some amount of guilt by association in the eyes of local authorities.",
			"",
			"Some of the following example contacts have a minimum Risk (MR) listed after them. When making the negotiation check, use the Risk score of the task or the contact's MR, whichever is higher. For example, asking a contact to acquire a black-market item is normally a minor task (Risk score 2), but asking an assassin contact (MR 3) to acquire the same item makes the task moderately risky (Risk score 3), simply because the assassin's nature and reputation make even common tasks more chancy.",
			"",
			"The DC of the skill check to complete the task uses the task's Risk, not the MR of the contact. For example, just because a master assassin is an inherently risky contact doesn't mean it's automatically harder for her to find a black-market item for you.",
			"",
			"A particular contact may have a higher minimum Risk than what is listed; these are just typical examples within a general category.",
			"",
			">***Academic:*** An academic can provide knowledge within her areas of expertise. She typically has access to various libraries or other centers of knowledge. An academic researches a subject by drawing on public records and texts and then attempts to answer questions by making appropriate Knowledge checks.",
			">",
			">***Artisan:*** A PC can count on an artisan to get an honest appraisal of an item, find goods for fair prices, locate or create a hard-to-find mundane item, find hearty livestock, or repair a broken item.",
			">",
			">***Assassin (MR 3):*** An assassin will sicken, poison, or even kill someone at your behest. Most assassins charge a fee based on the nature of the target, though there are religious assassins who perform these services for religious leaders at no cost. In most lands, the penalty for hiring an assassin is the same as the penalty for committing a murder.",
			">",
			">***Crime Boss (MR 3):*** This contact is the leader of some type of criminal syndicate, such as a thieves' guild, crime family, or necromantic cult. A successful crime boss usually has great wealth and knowledge of the region his organization works within. A crime boss rarely fails to complete a task given his resources, but usually demands some sort of payment for this service: typically requiring you to perform an illegal act that benefits the contact or his criminal organization.",
			">",
			">***Fence (MR 2):*** A fence specializes in buying and selling hard-to-find items, magical trinkets, and stolen or illegal black-market goods (such as drugs, poisons, and other types of contraband). Though fences often keep a low profile, many folks find their services useful enough that incidental contact with a local fence won't totally besmirch one's character.",
			">",
			">***Gossip:*** This contact could be a bartender, tavern owner, servant, prostitute, or stable hand who regularly encounters all sorts of individuals. Gregarious and chatty, the gossip leaks you information about various patrons or stories. Unlike a rumormonger, a gossip doesn't actively seek to distribute information for money, and his knowledge is based on what he hears directly from others. Though a gossip provides useful information, rarely is it anything unusual or covert. Things a gossip might know include the type of person a certain noble fancies, the day of the week merchant ships usually sail into port, or reports of a wild beast savaging the surrounding lands.",
			">",
			">***Heretic (MR 2):*** A heretic might be the laughingstock of a temple or a dangerous cultist. The heretic could know which clergy members are the most corrupt, and might have access to dark secrets, hidden caches of money or magic, evidence of lies and conspiracies, or forbidden texts.",
			">",
			">***Lunatic (MR 2):*** This contact might be a wandering doomsayer, a reclusive hermit, or an insane criminal locked into a dingy cell and desperate for human company. Lunatics often know dark and forgotten secrets, can recount seemingly insignificant events that are full of clues, or recall seeing things most would rather forget. Though a lunatic might adore you and make sincere efforts to aid you, madness taints her judgment and interpretation of both the facts and reality. Sometimes her ramblings can be helpful, though other times they can be useless or even detrimental.",
			">",
			">***Manipulator (MR 2):*** A manipulator usually runs a clandestine network of agents who whisper in the ears of powerful merchants, nobles, priests, and politicians to effect change on the behalf of the manipulator's clients. Depending on his personal motives, the nature of his network, and whether your plans affect his other clients, his services could be very expensive.",
			">",
			">***Merchant:*** A merchant owns or operates some sort of shop. As a contact, the merchant might impart tidbits of information about other customers and minimal town gossip. She might also give you a discount on goods or services, or extend you a line of credit.",
			">",
			">***Observer:*** This category includes vagrants, beggars, street-cart vendors, fortune-tellers, drunks, and others who spend their time wandering the city streets or country roads. So commonplace is the observer within his surroundings that most people ignore him as they pass by. The observer bears witness to all that goes on around him. He can tell you the time a specific event occurred and who was around when it happened. He knows the patterns of the city guard and which gates they watch most closely, and can keep a watch out for individuals who are hiding within a crowd or who are abroad at odd hours.",
			">",
			">***Outsider (MR 2):*** The outsider's roots lie beyond the immediate community, and as a result she suffers the distrust and prejudices of locals. She might be a foreigner, a member of a primitive tribe, or an indigenous person in a land conquered by imperialists. The outsider provides information about the outside world, especially the lands of her birth and places she's traveled. She knows sources for exotic weapons and other imports, such as spices and wines. Alternatively, the outsider might know and be able to teach you rare fighting techniques, secret formulas, or the esoteric spells of her people.",
			">",
			">***Pariah (MR 2):*** A pariah suffers the disdain of a certain group such as a city council, local religious leaders and their congregation, or even an entire community. Though not openly persecuted or hunted, the pariah has few rights and no privileges. What pariahs can offer varies from one to another. Use another contact type for the basis of that aid, but use the pariah's minimum Risk.",
			">",
			">***Petty Criminal (MR 2):*** A petty criminal dabbles in minor non-violent crimes, such as burglary, smuggling, and money laundering. He might also know about covert passages through a city and which officials accept bribes. He could be willing to introduce you to a professional criminal or crime boss.",
			">",
			">***Politician (MR 2):*** This person holds an influential position within the community's current political structure. She might be a royal advisor, a tribal council member, or the scion of another politician. The contact maintains direct access to the ears and concerns of those with political power and can attempt to influence their decisions. This type of contact is highly sought after, so her actions are closely watched to prevent outsiders (like you) from bribing or otherwise manipulating her. Though she has great potential to initiate social and political changes, she remains under close scrutiny at all times. A politician who has fallen out of favor could become a gossip, outsider, manipulator, or even a pariah or traitor.",
			">",
			">***Professional Criminal (MR 3):*** This contact belongs to a known criminal organization, thieves' guild, or street gang. Unlike a petty criminal, he might resort to more violent crimes such as arson, kidnapping, assault, and extortion. A professional criminal might know or work for a crime boss.",
			">",
			">***Rumormonger:*** A rumormonger keeps her ear to the ground for tidbits about the social and political goings-on as well as word of interesting current events or discoveries. She makes a living buying and selling semi-sensitive and personal information, and might also provide little-known details about current events. A rumormonger usually provides more usefulness and amusement to her community than threat, and is careful enough to keep secrets that might get her killed. She occasionally repeats information that's more dangerous than she realizes, however, putting herself or others in jeopardy.",
			">",
			">***Saboteur (MR 3):*** A saboteur is an expert at destroying objects and property, whether through arson, scuttling ships, weakening bridges, or setting deadly traps. A career saboteur typically works for a thieves' guild or a resistance movement against local authorities.",
			">",
			">***Snitch (MR 2):*** Unlike a rumormonger, a professional snitch deals only in information that he knows to be true. He relies upon an extensive range of sources and checks the accuracy of their reports. A snitch also earns many enemies; thus he makes every effort to keep a low profile. He can be hard to contact, and his services are generally costly. He can produce personal information about nobles, clergy members, politicians, criminals, and other important people.",
			">",
			">***Thug (MR 2):*** A thug uses force or threats of violence to influence others. She may be an enforcer who collects on debts for his employers or a vigilante who treats villains to her own sense of justice. Often the only difference between a thug and a city guard is that the thug performs his jobs outside of the constraints of the law. A thug isn't necessarily villainous, but others might consider her actions criminal. In addition to performing unsavory tasks, a thug can tell you details about her employer or those she torments.",
			">",
			">***Traitor (MR 3):*** A traitor has been accused or convicted of turning against the government and actively aiding its enemies. This contact isn't necessarily evil; he just actively rejects the ideology or actions of the current rulers - a paladin who rejects the edicts of an unscrupulous monarch and a witch who hexes nobles are both traitors according to their local leaders. A traitor is often knowledgeable about the government and could have even once been a politician in good standing.",
			">",
			">***Watch Guard:*** This contact provides information about local criminals and suspects, as well as reasonable insight into the workings of the city guard and current political goings-on and trends. She can keep an eye on things, provide an escort, allow you to speak with a prisoner, or arrange a meeting with a superior officer."

			"Prepare for your PCs to step into a larger world. In the classic roleplaying tradition, the PCs are independent heroes, and though they may undertake missions for powerful patrons, their association is usually temporary, with no long-term benefits. This book is about something different.",
			"",
			"The concept of factions is familiar from books and movies: mysterious organizations with hidden agendas, some secretive and others very public with their activities. Their members are contacts, associates, and informants for the heroes of the story, able to provide information, resources, or even backup or rescue in a pinch. The heroes might meet them by chance, seek them out for help, or be sought by them as their own reputations increase.",
			"",
			"This book, though, is not simply a guidebook about factions, as most of these groups are already detailed in other books. Instead, it's a guide to how you and your players can create characters that are integrated with those groups and with the campaign you want to run. Each group entry talks about the mission and outlook of the group, why PCs might want to be a part of it, and what the advantages are (both social and mechanical) of membership in a group.",
			"",
			"The Faction Guide is part of a style of play that presumes characters are actively plugged in to the power brokers and organizations of the world. Moreover, their connections with these organizations are rich and deep, affording characters both benefits of membership as well as the opportunity to advance. A party of adventurers may include members of several different factions, all of them working toward a common overall goal but each individual member having received special instructions from his faction regarding information or actions of particular importance to him and his faction.",
			"",
			"Working factions into your home campaign requires some extra effort on your (the GM's) part, either tailoring published adventures or adding details to adventures of your own design to incorporate the idea of characters as members of secret (or not-so-secret) societies, fellowships, and orders with goals and visions beyond the next payday. You may have some decisions to make concerning which factions you want to use; you want players to find factions that interest and excite them, but some factions may not fit for the campaign because of alignment, location, mission, or focus. The reward for this extra effort is a richer campaign, one where PCs really feel themselves a part of a living, breathing campaign world.",

			"PCs improve their standing within their faction by succeeding in missions relating to or coming from a faction. In a given adventure, or even in between adventures, you should think about the factions the characters in the party have chosen to represent. Their factions might ask them to assassinate a crime lord, protect an innocent merchant caught in a crossfire, save a kidnapped child, hand off an important letter, foil an assassination, recover a specific stolen relic, or locate a letter of marque. Whatever the mission, a positive outcome earns the character a **Prestige Award (PA).**",
			"",

In this section, you'll find an expanded system of rules that describes the kinds of rewards and privileges a character can access as her **Total Prestige Award (TPA)** increases and how she can use her Prestige Award for a variety of benefits that reflect her faction's willingness to assist her in times of need.",
			"",
			"### Faction Secrecy",
			"",
			"Governments and religious, political, mercantile, or cultural organizations may vary a great deal when it comes to dealing with factions and their activities. Some factions are blatantly public in their actions and their efforts to recruit others to their cause. Others are subtler in their plots and operate in the shadows; even where their presence is known, local leaders often turn a blind eye to their existence and activities as long as they don't make trouble. The more secretive factions often look down on those who act openly, but every faction must weigh the value of a public presence and reputation versus the ability to operate without interference. Factions have alliances and rivalries to be sure, but they usually avoid open conflict with their rivals in the interest of keeping the favor of local governments that allow them to operate freely in their territory.",
			"",
			"### Choosing a Faction",
			"",
			"Every faction has a unique history, culture, style, and specialty. Each has its own modus operandi in the ongoing struggle for power and influence on Golarion, and each offers its members different boons. Choosing a faction can be as important as choosing a character class or race: it defines a character in the campaign and ties him to his faction's destiny. Before you allow your players to choose their factions, peruse each faction carefully and see which ones fit well with the theme of your campaign. If you don't wish to allow evil characters, for instance, you might think twice about allowing characters to become part of evil-aligned factions, and if your campaign is set in a forested alpine wilderness, it might be reasonable to disallow factions from a desert land as they have little interest or influence there. It's not about restricting your players; it's about creating a rational and logical campaign setting where options fit together and where players won't be frustrated by making a choice that won't have much to do with the campaign. That said, if a player has a great character concept that he's excited about for a faction that you don't think would work, give the player a chance to pitch the idea. Explain the reasons why his faction choice might be hard to play in the campaign, but if he really wants to try it, let him give it a go.",
			"",
			"Bear in mind that a PC need not be from a particular country to become a member of a faction, even if that faction itself is closely associated with that country. Likewise, characters of any class can join a faction. PCs are not necessarily bound to work with a single faction. Although it is simplest to stay with one faction for a character's career, there is no reason a PC can't gain prestige within more than one group (though trying to work with two rival groups is unlikely to turn out well). Lastly, characters should not be required to join a faction. Those uninterested in the idea can ignore it, but those who find it appealing have an additional option for customizing their characters and how they fit into the world."

			"A character's ***Prestige Award (PA)*** is an abstract way to track his growing renown and reputation within a faction.",
			"",
			"### Total and Current Prestige Award",
			"",
			"Just as a character has a maximum hit point value when fully healed and a current hit point value when injured, that character has a ***Total Prestige Award (TPA)*** and a ***Current Prestige Award (CPA).*** TPA represents the character's overall reputation within a faction. CPA represents how much influence the character currently has within that faction in terms of favors owed to him and his ability to influence others and make use of the faction's resources.",
			"",
			"Characters may spend CPA to acquire goods or services (see Spending Prestige Award), which means that a character's CPA is usually less than his TPA, just as an adventuring character's current hit points are usually less than his total hit points. CPA can never be higher than TPA.",
			"",
			"### Earning Prestige",
			"",
			"Characters earn prestige for performing missions for a faction or otherwise advancing the faction's goals. For example, a character allied with the Eagle Knights gains prestige with that faction for breaking up a slaving ring, while a Razmiri cultist gains prestige for converting unbelievers to the faith and sending tithes back to Razmiran. At your discretion, a character may earn prestige for an adventure even if it's not part of an \"official\" mission for a faction; a 7th-level paladin who's freed many slaves probably has earned prestige with the Eagle Knights even if she's never taken orders from a member of that faction.",
			"",
			"When a character's Prestige Award increases, her TPA and CPA increase by the same value. For example, Jothalia has 5 TPA and 2 CPA with the Eagle Knight faction; if she completes a mission for them and her PA increases by 2, she now has 7 TPA and 4 CPA.",
			"",
			"Not every adventure or encounter needs to relate to a faction mission, nor does every faction have an interest in every possible adventure, but as a general rule you should strive to provide equal opportunity for PCs of all factions to earn prestige. If you cannot find a place within a given adventure for the interests of a particular PC's faction, make a point of integrating opportunities later on for that PC to achieve some faction goals.",
			"",
			"The ability to earn prestige should be routine, but it need not be automatic. If a PC fails at her appointed tasks or passes up opportunities to further her factions' goals, she does not earn prestige simply because her player showed up to play. By choosing to play using a faction, a player is agreeing to \"play along\" with faction goals in order to obtain faction rewards. If the PC does not fulfill her obligations as a member of the faction, she should not expect to rise in the faction's esteem.",
			"",
			"The rate at which characters' prestige increases varies depending on the whether you use Fast, Medium, or Slow advancement (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 30), but on average, characters should be able to increase their PA by 3 to 5 points per experience level, whether acquired by completing several small missions or tasks or one more difficult or significant task. Over the course of a long campaign like a Pathfinder Adventure Path, characters might expect to increase their PA by 40 or more points, especially if the campaign is tightly linked to the factions players choose.",
			"",
			"If you want to expand how you use prestige in a game, you could also use the characters' PA to replace or supplement standard treasure awards. In a campaign where looting the dead or robbing tombs is frowned upon, you could use PA to help fill the gap in character resources that would normally be satisfied by pillage and plunder.",
			"",
			"### Losing Prestige",
			"",
			"Prestige should be seen as an enticement rather than an instrument to punish PCs, but a character can lose prestige for betraying faction secrets to outsiders, causing the death of a faction member, stealing from or lying to their faction brethren, befriending or allying with members of opposed factions, and so on. A typical penalty would be the loss of 1-3 CPA. In extreme situations, however, a character might incur such a negative reputation within his faction that his CPA and TPA decrease by 5 or even 10 points for a major transgression, possibly resulting in loss of rank and privileges within the faction. This does not force characters to forfeit boons already acquired, but it may prevent them from obtaining any new boons or benefits for which they no longer qualify at their lowered TPA, and they must work to get back in the good graces of their peers.",
			"",
			"### Benefits of Prestige",
			"",
			"A character's Total Prestige Award represents her trustworthiness and status within their faction. The simplest representation of this prestige is that for every 10 points of her Total Prestige Award, she gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks with members of that faction. In addition, she may learn certain feats or spells or be able to purchase unique magical items or other goods that are restricted to those whose TPA reaches a certain benchmark. Her faction contacts can allow her to buy or sell goods whose value exceeds the normal gp limit of the local area or that might be of questionable legality. Finally, depending on the organization, a character's TPA might afford her certain titles and incidental privileges.",
			"",
			"### Dealing with Allied Factions",
			"",
			"Many factions have close associations and alliances with other groups, and earning prestige in her faction can allow a character to enjoy some of the benefits of membership and prestige within allied factions as well. Each faction entry describes whether that faction is allied with any others. When dealing with members of an allied faction, a character may treat her TPA as if it were half its actual amount, including the related bonus on Diplomacy checks with, and buying and selling goods through, the allied faction; she can also spend CPA to obtain boons from an allied faction, though the costs are increased by 1.",
			"",
			"### Dealing with Opposed Factions",
			"",
			"Just as factions have allies, so too do they have enemies. The very same prestige that can make a PC famous within her faction and among allies can make her infamous in the eyes of opposing factions, and avoiding attracting unwanted attention from her faction's enemies or those friendly to them is one reason that some characters keep their faction allegiances secret. If a character's faction allegiance is known, the initial attitude of an NPC of the opposing faction is treated as one step worse than normal (for example, Indifferent becomes Unfriendly, Unfriendly becomes Hostile), and for every 10 points of the character's TPA, she takes a -1 penalty on Diplomacy checks to influence that NPC. If the NPC's faction opposes more than one of the PC's factions, only the faction with which the PC has the highest TPA counts.",
			"",
			"### Spending Prestige",
			"",
			"A character's CPA total reflects the goodwill, political capital, and personal favors she has built up through service to the organization. While a character's TPA can provide certain titles and privileges, most tangible benefits of faction membership are acquired when a character spends his CPA on temporary boons, favors, aid, spellcasting, or other service. Regardless of whatever honorific titles a character has earned through his Total Prestige Award, the cost for obtaining boons remains the same.",
			"",
			"Once a character's CPA is spent, it is spent permanently; it is not recovered automatically like lost hit points or ability score damage. The character can, of course, earn more PA, which adds to both her TPA and her CPA, but spent points are gone.",
			"",
			"Characters may not spend CPA during combat, and for the sake of simplicity you may limit characters to spending CPA once per gaming session (this keeps players from saving up their PA in large amounts and spending it all at once, making an adventure too easy). It is possible for a player to spend his character's PA even if the PC is dead; in essence, this represents the PC having made prior arrangements with his faction to perform certain actions on his behalf, such as recovering his dead body and returning it to a specific location or having it raised.",
			"",
			"You can add to the services presented in this book or create your own factions. The monetary equivalent of 1 point of PA is approximately 375 gp, though characters should normally only be able to spend PA on services, not physical goods.",
			"",
			"PCs may not pool their earned prestige to obtain items or services, or for any other purpose, even if they are members of the same faction. As a general rule, PA is designed to be spent by characters on themselves; PA costs increase by 1 when the benefit is to other characters instead of to the member of the faction. However, PCs in a home game are ultimately free to spend their PA as they see fit.",
			"",
			"A character's ability to spend PA is dependent on his being in contact with other members of his faction, and unless noted otherwise, most factions tend to have agents, contacts, or headquarters in settlements that are at least the size of a large city. To reflect the difficulty of contacting a faction agent in a smaller settlement, PA costs increase by 5 in communities smaller than 5,000 people. This change, of course, can vary by organization; for the Green Faith, for example, the opposite is true - PA costs increase by 5 in communities larger than 5,000"

Of course, a bard who has used all his bardic performance rounds for the day can sing for his own benefit as long as he has at least 1 rank in Perform (sing)."

Some of these writings contain versions of the spells that are 1-3 levels lower than the normal version of the spell (such as a level 3 version of contact other plane) or arcane versions of divine spells (or vice versa).

Other conjured creatures are more tractable and are willing to bargain for their services.",

A few dozen more belong to the Imperial Guard itself and are awarded at the discretion of the leader. Those lucky enough to own one consider it a high honor, and all who recognize the ring greatly respect the wearer. The rightful wearer of a baculum ring gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saves against fear effects; this is a nonmagical effect. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence someone who recognizes the nature of the ring.

For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 hero points, the GM decides that the arrow pierced the character's holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. Cheating death is the only way for a character to spend more than 1 hero point in a turn. The character can spend hero points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC."

			"Although all of the options presented here should be carefully considered before they are added to your game, hero points deserve closer inspection. Although hero points do not drastically increase the power of the PCs, they do grant the PCs the ability to greatly increase their chances of success during critical moments. While the game itself is set up to give the player characters an edge, hero points take that a bit further, possibly more so than you might be comfortable with.",
			"",
			"The value to hero points is that they add dramatic tension to the climax of your game. Most uses of hero points do not guarantee success, making the moment they are used even more important to the players. Hero points are a very limited resource and their use should be described with additional detail and dramatic style. Used in this way, they can help create very memorable sessions for both you and your players.",
			"",
			"Although NPCs do not generally receive hero points, there are ways that they can use these mechanics. A number of spells and magic items, as well as the Hero's Fortune feat, grant hero points to a character. Such hero points should be used sparingly, and should be reserved for major villains or truly important characters. If you use them too much, the players will begin to resent the system, making it more of a problem than an opportunity to enhance the game."

			"Beyond life and death, beyond good and evil, there is honor. It is the abode of the eternal, which none can take but which can be destroyed through a single rash act. It is a measure of one's place within a society, a status known to all and sought by many. Whether in a samurai culture, the frozen viking wastes of the northlands, or the dizzying court intrigues of a byzantine kingdom, honor provides an anchor and stable foundations for your life's work. If you lack honor, others view you as faithless, untrustworthy, disloyal, and unfair. Honor influences reputation, status, and legend, but transcends them all.",
			"",
			"Who has honor varies from culture to culture. In some, anyone from the lowliest peasant to the emperor can pursue honor, and a life lived in accordance with honor is the highest achievement. In another land, honor is a game only for nobility, a scoring method in their battles over status. Honor may be purely a warrior's code or a more primitive, largely unspoken understanding between combatants.",
			"",
			"In some lands, the use of poison is an instant blight on one's honor. In others, its subtle and effective use might be a mark of the truly civilized person who wants to avert war and avoid innocent bloodshed. The general who fights until his last soldier falls is counted as honorable in some realms; in others, it is the general who surrenders, recognizing that sacrificing her soldiers' lives would be a waste. A criminal's code of honor is different from a priest's, and a school of wizards may have different rules for honor than a cabal of sorcerers.",
			"",
			"No matter what form it takes, honor is recognition of a code larger than the individual, a willingness to subsume one's desires in the service of that code. Honor requires self-sacrifice. It is often neither the most reasonable course of action nor the most practical. It comes with a cost, but is its own reward. Your honor must be protected and upheld at all times; allowing another to besmirch it is almost as great an affront as you performing a dishonorable act. A dishonorable person may try to use your honorable code against you, but honor does not equate to stupidity.",

A score of 100 represents a person of legendary stature whose reputation is without blemish. Honor is not a measurement of alignment, fame, or goodwill so much as a gauge of loyalty, trustworthiness, and fairness; one could be a kindhearted-but-flighty shogun with 0 honor points, or a cruel-but-stalwart monk with 100 honor points.",

Most NPCs' honor scores rarely change, though the GM might choose to bestow fortune or disgrace on a particular NPC as a story or adventure hook for the PCs.",
