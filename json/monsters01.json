Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists.",

Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting influence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic.",

Moving with uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields seeking objects of war that once held special significance to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to the faint psychic imprints of the slain combatants from which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories make it their mission to reunite the items with their past owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds. This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant psychic echoes cause an abandoned armory to believe everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding a new suitable owner for that individual's equipment. This behavior has led abandoned armories to become something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.",

			"Abandoned armories are rare, as their creation requires an unlikely confluence of environmental conditions and historical circumstances, along with a fair bit of luck. Across Golarion, only a handful of battlefields and other sites of mass death and suffering contain sufficient psychic echoes of terror and pain, as well as buried or hidden implements of war - magic weapons, armor, and other trinkets - to give rise to an abandoned armory. In addition to the psychic imprints that serve as the foundation for the constructs, the genesis of abandoned armories hinges on the application of additional, formidable arcane or divine power, often as an unintended consequence of unrelated events. A leaking seal on a long-forgotten eldritch prison, a thinning of the veil between planes, or a potent ritual to summon a demon may provide the energy needed for an abandoned armory to lurch into animation. When the psychic imprints and magical energy mix at a perfect balance, it can form a small abandoned armory. Once animated, the abandoned armory is quick to grow into the massive terror that is the bane of all battlefields.",
			"",
			"The magic binding that binds armories together does eventually fade away, causing the constructs' various collected items to become open for the taking. These mounds of equipment, typically overgrown with vegetation and hidden by the passage of years, contain treasure troves of items that are prized by fortune hunters. The process for an abandoned armory's collapse usually happens in one of two ways. The more common method is through the destruction of the construct. This usually damages many of the constituent items and makes the process of salvaging this equipment tedious at best. On the other hand, abandoned armories naturally collapse and dissipate when the magic that fuels them is exhausted. This usually happens to \"longer-lived\" abandoned armories that consume the innate magical energies after countless battles. The energy required to activate an abandoned armory's various abilities slowly saps these magical energies until the abandoned armory lacks enough energy to maintain its form.",

Alternatively, the abandoned armories might simply clash mindlessly against one another until their constituent metal melted to slag and their magic power was spent.",
			"",
			"Certain creatures have taken an interest in abandoned armories, almost to the extent of representing a symbiotic relationship. Scavenging tribes of goblins who forage at the edges of legendary battlefields have developed a near-religious awe of the constructs, and they regard the appearance of an abandoned armory both as a good omen and a prime opportunity to comb the destruction left by its passage for interesting new tools and trinkets. To attract an abandoned armory, the goblins erect crude fetishes at the edges of their territory, making offerings of assorted \"magic\" items in the hope of drawing the attention of the construct. The rare occasions when an abandoned armory does indeed appear are just as likely to result in the hopeful goblins being destroyed by a tide of unstoppable metal and magic as they are to fulfill the goblins' greed for treasure."

Though the test subjects died during their transformation, the strange energies involved animated them as undead horrors bound to serve their aboleth creator. These abominations share a hive mind, chattering telepathically with each other to determine a common purpose. All of them can be called into action instantly if their aboleth master issues a telepathic command, the dominating words reverberating from one connected mind to another. Abhominals hunger for the life energy of living beings, but their masters can keep their hunger in check in order to make them hunt new subjects to use in further experiments (who might end up sharing the fate of their captors).",
			"",
			"The midsection of an abhominal rises to a height of about 2-1/2 feet, though its barbed tentacles go much higher than that. They weigh over 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"An alghollthu that experiments with modifying sentient creatures routinely introduces a part of its awareness into the process so it can exert control over the resulting abominations. The specific transformation that resulted in the first abhominals was particularly grueling and led to many of the subjects dying. However, some subjects survived the initial process, which landed them in a holding cell for further observation. The transformation of the subjects continued within their bodies, and to date the flawed experiment has always culminated in the subjects' death. In their final moments, they are pale and feverish, and their abdomens become bloated. Their nascent telepathy whispers dissonant echoes of the abhominal hive mind reaching out to them. Upon the moment of death, their bodies convulse, limbs snapping at weird angles, and black bile spills from their open mouths. Finally, a mass of tentacles bursts out of the subject's abdomen, and the newborn abhominal screams out a telepathic call to others of its kind.",
			"",
			"On the outside, abhominals are reminiscent of the living beings they once were. In addition to their tentacles and twisted postures, their insides have been transformed into something completely alien. When an abhominal is cut, its wounds ooze a brackish black liquid instead of blood. This liquid permeates their entire bodies, coloring their glistening eyes completely black. The creatures have a hardened carapace beneath their skin, allowing them to shrug off deadly blows with ease. Their hands and feet are covered in fine branching bristles that burrow into surfaces, allowing them to scramble effortlessly along even the smoothest walls and ceilings. Their tentacles are covered in microscopic barbs that inflict profuse bleeding. In addition, abhominals are able to leech vitality out of their victims with their tentacles as they tighten around the unfortunate souls.",
			"",
			"Abhominals use their telepathic connection to coordinate their movements when hunting their prey. Abhominals make good sentries - if one of them notices an intruder, then all of its kind within reach are telepathically notified of it as well. When the need arises, their alghollthu master can take a more direct role, commanding its abhominals to utilize more advanced tactics to combat intruders or abduct new captives.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"When the number of abhominals reaches a large enough number, their nesting habits tend to fall into a particular pattern. Abhominals nest high above ground, writhing together in a clump that spreads from the ceiling downward, their tentacles entwining like a web between them. They prefer areas such as caverns or chambers with passages and openings leading to areas below, in which they tend to form a central hive that eventually expands to smaller nests located within telepathic range around it. Once the central hive is established, abhominals use hidden routes to traverse between the hive and its peripheral nests, and smaller groups of the creatures rotate between staying in a nest and prowling the areas around it. Similarly, a rotation of abhominals periodically shifts between the central hive and its outlier nests.",
			"",
			"Abhominals are quite dependent on the telepathic connection that binds them together, which results in them going berserk if they are separated from the hive mind. This behavior became evident as soon as the first abhominal came into existence: it raved like a rabid beast, lashing out at anything that came near unless its alghollthu creator exerted psychic influence over it. When the alghollthu's experiments resulted in more abhominals, the abominations started to exhibit more intricate behavior and purpose, and their master found it could direct the newly formed hive mind to serve its own needs. Ultimately, the creatures' usefulness outweighed the annoying reminder of an experiment that continued to fail.",
			"",
			"If the abhominals' numbers grow too large, the thoughts of those swarming in the central hive begin to harmonize, exhibiting higher levels of cognizance that could pose a threat to the alghollthu's control over its creations. It's possible that if the abhominals were left unsupervised, an oversized hive could find a way to turn captives into abhominals on their own, though this is not something their aboleth creators would ever willingly allow. It's important for an aboleth master to regularly reaffirm its dominance over the abhominals under its command to keep the psychic leash that controls them intact.",
			"",
			"When under the rule of an aboleth master, abhominals follow that master's directions regarding other creatures. If left without guidance, abhominals are more likely to give in to their hunger and attack all living creatures they encounter; other undead are typically left alone unless they pose a threat to the abhominals. It's possible that certain types of undead could form a mutually beneficial arrangement with a hive of abhominals, consuming the flesh of any humanoid corpses that the abhominals leave during their hunts."

An abysogh usually keeps a few of its victims for future use, either as ammunition or snacks. For this reason, the thunderous beat of an approaching abysogh's footsteps is often accompanied by the lamentations of the giant's battered victims as they're carried along in its sack."

			"Though not devils themselves, achaierais live and hunt on the scorched and blasted plains of Hell, where they make excellent use of their long, stilt-like legs in running down any lost souls or lesser devils who stumble into their feeding grounds. Once it has closed with its target, an achaierai attacks with its two front legs, punching or slashing, as well as biting with its powerful beak. Far smarter than their animalistic form might suggest, achaierais prefer to hunt in shrieking packs and use their prey's confusion and their own reach to their advantage, circling their quarry and darting in to attack as soon as the victim becomes distracted, then retreating again before the prey has a chance to retaliate. They have been known to wander through battlefields in the lower planes, picking over dying and regenerating creatures and souls, which has earned them the nickname \"Hell's vultures.\" As achaierais are immune to the toxic clouds of others of their kind, they often work in conjunction to use these clouds to herd or scatter enemies, form long lines of black clouds to protect their retreat, or merely panic opponents in large melees. Achaierais are fond of disemboweling their targets and feasting on the hot entrails while their mortally wounded prey screams itself to death. Of course, as outsiders, achaierais have no need to eat, and their elaborate hunting routines are simply the bird-beasts' sick form of entertainment."

Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass.

However, their digestive process is very slow, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they split into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just split begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle.

			"",
			"The colors of the tropical deep - simmering reds, yellows, and oranges - decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seafloors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat.",
			"",
			"Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques - whether magically or through a fluke of nature - but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities.",
			"",
			"In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and - when other prey is scarce - sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle.",
			"",
			"Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate - when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims.",
			"",
			"Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh - or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death."

			"Agnoias are not yet deemed outcasts by the ranks of aeonkind, but they teeter on the edge of exile from the ranks of the caretakers of reality. Like all aeons, agnoias work to maintain a precarious cosmic balance - in their case, this balance is between the dissemination of knowledge and the preservation of ignorance. Although these aeons once worked to keep this balance in careful check by distributing truths across planetary and planar gulfs and obliterating dangerous truths from mortal minds, agnoias collectively decided several years ago that the sum total of knowledge in the multiverse had reached dangerous heights. Creation had become too well informed to sustain redoubts of ignorance for long, and the balance agnoias worked to maintain was in danger. As a group, the agnoias agreed that they would wholly forsake their duties regarding the spread of learning and instead focus on fostering ignorance, returning the multiverse to a safely unenlightened level. Agnoias connected to universities and libraries turned on their associates, setting controlled fires and transporting scholars to isolated wildernesses. This rapid change in direction, nearly unprecedented by aeon standards, caused most other aeons to mark agnoias as reckless and dangerous.",
			"",
			"Agnoias see this change as absolutely vital to the performance of their overall function as arbiters of knowledge and ignorance. In fact, some agnoias express frustration that the drive to obliterate universal knowledge wasn't initiated much sooner, when knowledge was more centralized in nascent civilizations and therefore easier to manage. No agnoia would dare to blame the Monad directly for this error in intellectual administration, as they see it, but most agnoias express some satisfaction for finally being able to act as they deem fit rather than remaining shackled to a higher power.",
			"",
			"Agnoias have a particular dislike for mortal explorers and planar travelers. As mortals learn to travel quickly across their worlds and between the planes, they spread their knowledge like a plague, disrupting nascent civilizations and exposing long-sequestered secrets. Such travelers are agnoias' most frequent targets, as these aeons consider them vectors for spreading the disease of enlightenment. Agnoias work to close planar gates and sabotage transport vessels, first seeking to control the transmission of knowledge and then working to eradicate it. Although they have little concern for mortal lives that might be lost in a sinking ship or a burning library, they aren't cruel and usually time their actions to minimize the loss of innocent - and particularly ignorant - life. Agnoias often work alone, but this is primarily because they view their tasks as urgent and their numbers are very few. When given the opportunity to work together, agnoias operate in eerie concert, each seeming to predict the actions of the others with automatic prescience.",
			"",
			"Agnoias don't apply their recent knowledgeobliterating directive to their own kind. Many agnoias in fact hoard knowledge, and they are surprisingly well informed on a broad variety of topics. Most have labored for years in academies or universities, absorbing minutiae on particular specialties and adding this information to their vast mental storehouses. Getting an agnoia to part with its knowledge is all but impossible, however, as each knows that any information might start yet another cascade of erudition it must later extinguish.",
			"",
			"In combat, agnoias prefer to reduce their enemies' intellects as quickly as possible. Their preferred tactic is to afflict their most intelligent opponents with feeblemind, which agnoias augment by removing targets' memories not only from the targets' own minds, but also from the consciousness of reality. Victims of this attack have their intellects reduced, and their effect upon the cosmic network of knowledge is dulled - people once familiar with a victim find their recollections clouding over, and any intellectual influence a victim may have had (such as authored works, public lectures, or tales of daring exploits) is removed. This effect even extends to printed works; a shelf of books authored by a victim transforms into paper covered with incomprehensible marks, unable to convey meaning or knowledge. Although this power is permanent, it is reversible, unfortunately for the agnoias. If a victim's intellect is restored, so too are her works and the memories of her.",
			"",
			"Agnoias are keen observers; their eyes drift around their bodies and switch from one side to another with a mere blink. They are particularly difficult to surprise, and their keen vision allows them to detect even magical auras with ease. Agnoias are also apt judges of character and have several lifetimes of experience interacting with mortals. As a result, they can predict actions and motivations with shrewd consideration that is as much a factor of their experience as it is their magical ability to detect creatures' thoughts.",
			"",
			"Agnoias appear as columns of fog and shadow. Within their roiling forms, the shadows never obscure the fog and the fog never conceals the dark shadow. Although an agnoia can walk on the three clawed feet protruding from the bottom of its column, it can just as easily fly with a thought. An agnoia's three claws are spread radially around its torso. Despite their vaporous appearance, agnoias aren't insubstantial, but they can compress their forms to fit into small spaces.",

			"Lipikas - also known as the Lords of Karma - are among the highest order of aeons. Unlike other aeons, their duality springs not from opposition but from understanding that all actions and reactions are the crests and troughs of the same cosmic wave. While it may seem to a casual observer that the Lords of Karma simply wander the universe looking for random events of importance, from the momentous to the mundane, what they are actually observing is the rhythm of causality, the way that one action becomes another and affects everything in the grand scheme of reality. Whatever they find, they inscribe in the cosmic memory of all aeons, and occult scholars believe that this cosmic memory finds its way to the Akashic Record, deep within the heart of the Astral Plane.",

Lipikas consider themselves the judges of willful karma, sometimes manipulating the cycle of mortal lives and reincarnations. This often leads to friction with psychopomps, other agents of Purgatory, and those who would steal, use, or destroy souls - such as daemons and night hags. The reason for the aeons' interest is difficult to ascertain. There seems to be no overriding philosophy concerning the nature or purpose of the souls lipikas manipulate. This has led many occult scholars to theorize that the lipikas' connection to the Akashic Record is more direct, going so far as to suggest that these aeons are its agents.",

Sometimes the aeons act as guides to such creatures, while at other times they set these subjects upon a new course entirely undirected. Unlike others of their kind, a lipika uses some bits and pieces of language to convey its messages - though often in a pidgin of all known languages that have existed or will exist - and takes considerable time and care when communicating with its subject, at least compared with other aeons. Lipikas give their subjects guidance on how to adjust their actions within their current forms to achieve some karmic imperative or progression of personal enlightenment. Often such advice seems to contradict any sense of intuition, reason, or cultural concepts of morality. A lipika is just as likely to chastise a righteous person for her charity and goodness as it is to scold an evil creature for its misdeeds. To the lipika, the balance of alignments and morality is inconsequential beside the realities of action and the bonds of cause and effect.",

			"When not focused on performing a specific task, lipikas deliver messages, omens, and portents to both those who seek their wisdom and those who do not. These messages are often signs of enormous events of great significance that might not occur within the recipients' lifetimes, but the lipikas maintain that the subjects' actions are nonetheless influential. At other times, lipikas appear merely to guide reincarnated souls or spirits destined to be reincarnated. A lipika that is focused on a specific task - whether observing a significant historical event or delivering a message to another being - typically ignores other creatures unless they attempt to delay it from performing its assigned task, at which point it may become violent in its reactions. While it seems they would rather manipulate events subtly, lipikas are capable of great force when faced with those who would thwart their plans.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions these aeons appear and create conflicts, claiming that great damage to the multiverse is being done by actions taken by a civilization - actions that are often so minute their consequences might seem arbitrary to the subjects of the aeon's attention. Worse still, the appearance of a lipika can herald the coming of even greater displays of aeon power. Sages of occult lore theorize that the information lipikas inscribe into the Akashic Record directly informs the agenda of the concept or entity known as the Monad, and that this information is disseminated to pleromas - more powerful aeons who are direct representatives of the Monad. If this theory is correct, the information scribed by lipikas is of grave consequence to entire civilizations, as pleroma aeons are tasked with acts of creation and destruction that can sometimes impact entire worlds. Those who subscribe to more traditional theories of the multiverse see the connection between lipikas and pleromas in more direct terms. If a lipika cannot accomplish its goals, it calls in a pleroma to enact the strange and inexplicable will of the aeons, often to devastating ends. However, the goals of lipikas are typically so abstract that their intervention often seems random, and few mortals have figured out how to placate them.",

Once a paracletus locates such a creature, the paracletus remains nearby, studying the target's relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, the paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how outside influences affect the subject.

For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be many more things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself.

This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed.",

They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conflicts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should any be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed.",

			"Possessing perhaps one of the strangest appearances of all agathions, bishops look as much like fish as they do humans. On their native plane of Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies are needed, such as on watery planes or worlds that are wholly aquatic. The few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized duality on land and at sea - goodly sailors, ocean-hopping priests, or kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these fascinating creatures.",
			"",
			"Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from their chins, and their eyes - which come in all the colors of the tumultuous waves - look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops' bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes - a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will.",
			"",
			"Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become acquainted with bishops' complex ways.",

			"Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions.",
			"",
			"The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told.",
			"",
			"Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion - and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge - consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business - or whose evil they witness and wish to stop."

Chelonidals don't normally reproduce sexually, being directly formed from the petitioners of Nirvana. However, given their tendency to protect locations for long periods, those on the Material Plane occasionally fall in love with mortals. If such a relationship results in children, the chelonidal parent remains until its offspring come of age, departing only if a great need arises; the lords of Nirvana understand that the duty to protect must be counterbalanced with duty to family.

			"",
			"On Nirvana, most chelonidals serve more potent agathions without complaint. The empyreal lords Dalenydra and Ylimancha, in particular, often associate with chelonidals. Every so often a chelonidal feels the urge to wander; while it never leaves a post without securing a replacement, once one is found, the agathion wanders for a time before settling down again. Some find their way to the Material Plane during this period. Without a specific task, a chelonidal on the Material Plane often finds a secluded but vulnerable location, such as a remote fishing village or shrine, and defends it until protectors can be found or trained.",
			"",
			"While chelonidals defend those who cannot defend themselves, they are at their strongest when they stand alongside those with the strength and will to fight. A single chelonidal can bolster a mortal legion, keeping the troops fighting until reinforcements arrive. In greater numbers, chelonidals form a phalanx, trusting in allies to clean up any foe that makes it past their guard. On those rare occasions when the agathions must march to war, chelonidals form the core of their armies. Led by {monster/cervinal} knights and supported by soaring {monster/avoral/s}, a chelonidal legion is a force potent enough to make any fiendish combatants think twice."

A muldnal that successfully saves against revulsion can't be affected by the same source of blood for 24 hours.",

They stand roughly 3 feet in height, and their wide, dirt-encrusted, clawed hands and equally filthy smocks of undyed linen belie their true extraplanar nature. Dense fur of black, brown, and gray coats their muscular bodies, while a pink nose and whiskers twitch as they sense their surrounding environment, their small black eyes lost in the fur and dirt on their bodies.",
			"",
			"While the ferocious leonal agathions guard the portals to Nirvana, the overlooked muldnals tend to the innumerable underground passages of that plane. When found on the Material Plane, a muldnal tends to sites of magical power associated with agriculture and nature. Many people have been fooled by their friendly and furred countenances; when provoked, a muldnal uses both a paralytic bite and command over the earth to drive off its enemies.",
			"",
			"Formed from the souls of farmers and miners, muldnals continue the agrarian traditions they had in their mortal lives. These souls discovered peace in the ebb and flow of the passage of the seasons, the pace and planning of crops, or discovering the natural wealth beneath the earth, and their skills and talents found their home among the eternal tranquility of Nirvana.",
			"",
			"As with other agathions, muldnals appear fully formed in Nirvana, their purpose clear in their minds as they begin their work to correct unduly chaotic or orderly influences in the deep caverns of the plane. With no need to eat or sleep, muldnals tirelessly rearrange passageways to be safer or enhance their natural beauty, improve the fertility of the soil in grasslands, and decompose fallen leaves in Nirvana's primal forests to promote the plane's health.",
			"",
			"Pacifists at heart, muldnals prefer to avoid fighting, as the sight and smell of spilled blood repels them. That does not mean they are incapable of defending themselves, though, and they wield clubs, cudgels, quarterstaves, and saps with aplomb. A single muldnal's efforts may be only an annoyance as it harasses intruders, but an entire labor of muldnals can collapse tunnels or pen in foes while they summon the aid of more powerful allies (often silvanshees or vulpinals). Should a muldnal fall to violence, it collapses into a pile of dirt and crawling insects or worms-returning to the dust that formed its existence and purpose.",

Compared to other agathions, muldnals are loners, preferring the company of fey or kami when journeying on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Muldnals do not feel beholden to any one particular deity or empyreal lord, and unlike other agathions, they don't actually have a representative empyreal lord. Theories abound as to why this might be, but the reclusive nature of the muldnals, as well as their avoidance of bloody conflict, may be reasons why none of them have attained the power of an empyreal lord. They can be found serving followers of Erastil in rural fields, assisting dwarven miners on behalf of Torag, seeking hidden wonders for Benorus, tending gardens and orchards sacred to Halcamora, or aiding monadic devas on the Plane of Earth.",
			"",
			"Muldnals can spend their entire existence never seeing another of their kind, but when they do meet, it is a cause for celebration, and perhaps for an extraordinary engineering project. Numerous legendary underground grottos, such as the Cave of a Thousand Stars in Vudra and the Emerald Veldt in Molthune, are the works of muldnal moots. In these locations, the barrier between the Material Plane and Nirvana is much thinner - these are places where enlightenment and perfection can be touched, and therefore, they are sought after by monks and scholars alike.",
			"",
			"Muldnals embrace a mentor-apprentice relationship in their society. Experienced muldnals are expected to teach younger muldnals everything they know, and pass it along verbally as they travel and work together. A muldnal traveling by itself leaves knowledge in the stone, constructing cairns of different types of rock, perfectly round corridors, or other earthen works of wonder.",
			"",
			"Recently, more muldnals claim to hear Nirvana's earth \"call\" to them, beckoning them down to a place they do not know. A massive earthen hill, called the Mouldywarp, mars one of the verdant grasslands of Nirvana, and it could be that the muldnals are claiming a spot of their own in the idyllic perfection of that plane.",

Rarely do they evolve without fully transforming into more powerful variants of agathions, but those who live eons in the dark caverns of Nirvana may grow in both size and prowess, and present an even larger threat to forces that would threaten the subterranean regions of the plane. These elder muldnals often lead small enclaves of other muldnals and take on saintlike qualities in many of their followers' eyes.",

The mustelidal applies his full Strength modifier on all damage rolls with his unarmed strike. A mustelidal's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A mustelidal's unarmed strikes are treated as magic, cold iron, silver, and adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.",

At the end of the 10 minutes, the mustelidal awakens completely cured of any poisons that were affecting him.

The mustelidal can leave this state as a free action only after reducing an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer or when there are no enemies in the mustelidal's line of sight.",

They often wear open yet loose-fitting clothing that shows off their toned physiques and allows them more freedom of movement in battle.

The more times such a mortal has been resurrected in order to prolong its fight, the greater the chance that her soul is transformed into a mustelidal after finally receiving Pharasma's judgment. Just after they are \"born,\" mustelidals are eager to return to the Material Plane and engage in battle with the forces of evil.",

			"When in a conflict, mustelidals rely on their natural defenses a bit too much, often getting in over their heads and attacking large throngs of enemies or foes who eclipse them in size. In such situations, mustelidals tap into a well of courage that usually allows them to survive against all odds. These agathions use their ability to summon Large earth elementals only to distract their foes at the start of combat or in dire circumstances when the mustelidals need a way to cover their escape.",
			"",
			"At the end of a protracted conflict, mustelidals burrow into the nearby dirt or use their meld into stone spell-like ability to allow their regeneration to restore them to full health. They also take advantage of their poison purge ability at this time if any toxins are coursing through their blood. If the mustelidals weren't victorious in the previous fight, they use their skills to track down the surviving foes to attempt to finish the job.",

			"Because of mustelidals' unwillingness to back down from a fight, other types of agathions often use them as personal bodyguards, especially when traveling to other planes. Those with crucial missions frequently bring along a small retinue of mustelidals, though they must convince the badger-headed outsiders that they will be face a fair challenge; mustelidals are uninterested in wasting their talents against foes they can defeat without any effort. Occasionally, mustelidals are tasked with protecting a good-aligned outsider or a particularly important mortal. Mustelidals consider such a duty sacrosanct, and never abandon their charges when things get dangerous, not even to chase down an enemy to finish it off - while mustelidals enjoy fighting, they are clever enough to recognize that an apparent retreat may simply be an ambush in disguise.",
			"",
			"When not protecting charges, mustelidals prefer to remain in burrowed dens, letting the cool, musty smell of soil fill their nostrils. They enjoy claustrophobic spaces and darkness, and often react violently to intruders who threaten their solitude with either their presence or light. In other contexts, however, mustelidals are quite friendly, if a bit intense. They tend to speak in brief sentences and their laughs, which rarely occur, are short, staccato bursts. The condition of a mustelidal's fur often indicates how long it has been idle; one with dirt clumped and matted in its coat hasn't been in a fight in weeks or months. A mustelidal who has spent some time outside of Nirvana is much more freshly groomed.",
			"",
			"Of all the races on the Material Plane, mustelidals have a certain fondness for gnomes. This may be because the two races share the ability to speak with animals, giving them both an appreciation of the natural world - or perhaps because mustelidals appreciate the way gnomes fight so hard to stave off the Bleaching, despite its seeming inevitability. Whatever the reason, a mustelidal sometimes forms a strong attachment with a particular gnome, rescuing him from fatal situations but otherwise content simply to observe his antics. Many campfire tales have been told about gnomes who have garnered these literal guardian angels.",

			"### Calling a Mustelidal",
			"",
			"Mustelidals are among the more powerful outsiders that can be called with greater planar ally. Although they do not need to eat, they enjoy the taste of honey, and each 8-ounce jar included in the material components of the spell counts as 200 gp worth of offerings. A mustelidal will eagerly accept the task of watching over a worthy person, halving the payment requested, though such tasks require a specific time frame and cannot be open-ended. Mustelidal protectors are often willing to lay down their lives to ensure the people in their care survive whatever dangers prompted them to employ the agathions' services in the first place. Particularly zealous mustelidals have been known to check in on their former charges from time to time, even years after the terms of their original agreement ended, offering their services again. While they require a new agreement to serve the mortal again, they can be very persuasive, and former charges who find themselves in perpetual danger may employ the same mustelidal a dozen or more times over the course of their lives, so long as the threats that the agathions are defending against present suitable challenges."

They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the freedom of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn't something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically part of it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that \"you are not in the city, you are a part of the city\" - and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.",

			"Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly growing and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly growing and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.",

			"Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person's normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature's ultimate good - or at least the ultimate good of that creature's community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals' appearances just to play goodnatured pranks on them - though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking \"themselves\" for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature's face twist in confusion.",
			"",

Though they may wear fancy clothes, procyals make a point not to try to flaunt their wealth, and earnestly attempt to ensure that others are able to satisfy their own needs.

Instead of imposing laws, they establish order through hundreds of maxims that discuss every aspect of daily life, from what clothing to wear to how to speak with strangers. Procyals don't follow every axiom at all times; instead, they use these proverbs as behavioral guides, and they expect visitors to do likewise. They record these maxims in large, bound tomes kept in the hearts of their cities, available for all to read.",
			"",
			"Procyals are gregarious creatures who are always eager to meet new people while on their travels, whether they are in Nirvana or on the Material Plane. They prefer to travel frequently from one community to another, experiencing each one fully and guiding it as needed before once again setting out toward the next settlements along their paths. Once they have experienced a community, they never forget about it or its needs, and they often return when they know their services will likely be needed. However, procyals rarely spend significant time in one place.",
			"",
			"The exception is when procyals cross paths with obvious evil, whereupon they stop, often for years at a time, to establish and carry out complex and long-term plans to undermine it. They don't see evil as a force to be met head on and fought, but instead as something that needs to be weakened over time, so that good can naturally rise up in its place.",
			"",
			"This is especially true when it comes to governing bodies, as procyals see some administrations as fundamentally better than others: democratic groups and wise councils are among their favorite forms of government, while dictatorships, monarchies, and military states must ultimately be replaced. In cases of particularly tyrannical rulers, they even go so far as to actively encourage or provide assistance to bands of revolutionaries or heroes who might usher in a fundamentally better government. Procyals are hesitant to meet even a weaker foe in direct combat if they can avoid it. Instead, they prefer to trick enemies into attacking another stronger opponent, especially if that will weaken both antagonists at the same time. When they must fight, they fight dirty, and they take any advantage they can. Procyals typically focus on damaging their opponents' faces as they fight; if they are forced into unarmed combat, they gouge eyes and tear off ears whenever they can.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, procyals are rarely wholly trusted. Since procyals love to chasten the powerful and to play pranks on the high and mighty, few talented creatures are willing to enter into long-term alliances with them. Individuals in the lower classes are frequent exceptions. They tend to welcome procyals with open arms. For here among the poor and downtrodden, where society exists in its most imperfect state, nearly every action that a procyal takes has a positive and lasting effect."

			"A carnage-hungry denizen of swamps, the ahuizotl is a ferocious-looking predator, even before one takes into consideration its most distinctive feature - a long tail that ends in a clawed but all-too-humanoid hand. Whether from the entrance of its aquatic home (typically a sunken mass of trees or a flooded cavern) or the thick reeds and flora that grow at the water's edge, an ahuizotl remains watchful for any intruder that might trespass into its territory. Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its uncanny ability to mimic the sound of a humanoid in distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a river's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack.",
			"",
			"Despite its preference for cruelty, an ahuizotl might come to mutually advantageous arrangements with other pernicious denizens of the swamps. Will-o'-wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o'-wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl's lair and then lingering to feed upon the victims' fear as the ahuizotl drags them into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl's clutches - typically lizardfolk, boggards, or swamp-dwelling humans - have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such arrangements always lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the aquatic predator's proxy coaxes new victims into the swamp for its fearsome partner to dine upon.",

An active akaruzug (or another creature working with an inactive akaruzug) can spend 1 minute to bind a helpless or willing creature to the construct. Once the victim is restrained, the akaruzug can attempt to draw the creature's soul into it once per round as a free action; the victim can resist with a successful DC 24 Will save. On a failure, the victim dies and the akaruzug becomes active. If the body crucified upon an active akaruzug is removed, the soul within the construct is freed and the akaruzug deactivates after 1d4 rounds. An akaruzug's victim cannot be resurrected while its soul is trapped within the construct, but destroying an akaruzug releases a trapped soul. While an akaruzug is active, attacks and effects directed specifically at the victim crucified to the akaruzug treat the attack or effect as if it targeted the akaruzug instead. However, a creature can attempt to remove a crucified body from the construct, but doing so first requires the creature to successfully pin the akaruzug. Once this occurs, the creature can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrench the body free. On a success, the corpse is removed and the akaruzug deactivates in 1d4 rounds. A deactivated akaruzug can take no action other than to attempt to draw in the soul of a creature crucified on its body to reactivate itself. It does not have an Intelligence score while deactivated, nor does it gain the benefit of any of its feats or skill ranks.

The statue is then bathed in hellfire, a process that reduces the body inside into a substance similar to packed ash. These remains and the magic woven over the construct prevent the escape of the lingering soul within. At this point, the akaruzug's \"soul engine\" is complete, but the construct still requires further spirit energy to become fully active.

			"**Numbing Slime (Ex)** Any creature that deals damage to an alpluachra with a natural attack or an unarmed strike, comes into contact with an alpluachra, or is host to an alpluachra must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take a -4 penalty on all tactile Perception checks, as well as other skill checks requiring tactile senses (such as Disable Device and Sleight of Hand) for 24 hours. A host creature that fails this saving throw takes the penalty to detect the alpluachra implanted inside it. If the host creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be affected by the same alpluachra's numbing slime for another 24 hours.",

			"These strange and insatiable fey prowl bubbling brooks, sauntering streams, and slow-moving rivers in a constant pursuit of food, but the extremely lazy creatures often tire of hunting. Alpluachras find it much easier to slip down a sleeping creature's throat, fall asleep, and dream of fantastic feasts and warm bubbling pools while its host does the eating for it. Because of this, alpluachras always keep an eye on riverbanks, looking for creatures napping near waterways. Once they find potential hosts, alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets.",

			"Once inside, an alpluachra rests along the walls of the esophagus and devours all the food that comes down the host's throat. The host often starves to death in the process, as the parasite becomes more ravenous over time.",
			"",
			"Despite their propensity to slowly kill their hosts, alpluachras are slothful rather than cruel. They have no concept of the harm they are doing, lazily enjoying the benefits while the host is still alive."
