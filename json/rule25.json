Ki collects in seven mystical vortices within the body called chakras.

Some mystics claim its colorful name derives from the fact that its mastery was first pioneered by the ancient serpentfolk who ruled the world millennia ago, but another explanation is that kundalini energy flows through the seven chakras in a coiling, ophidian manner. The kundalini flow awakens each chakra in turn. As it progresses from the root chakra at the base of the spine to the crown chakra at the top of the head, the serpent-fire opens new vistas of personal power to the initiate, granting her unique supernatural abilities."

The initiate must also possess the {feat/Psychic Sensitivity} feat or have levels in one of the occult classes.",
			"",
			"Awakening chakras or maintaining awakened chakras is a swift action that costs 1 ki point. On the first round, this opens the root chakra. Each round after the first, it opens the next chakra in the sequence, up to the crown chakra on the seventh round. Once the initiate has begun awakening his chakras, each round he must continue opening chakras or maintain his awakened chakras, or all of his chakras close and he must begin again from the root chakra. If he pauses in the progression, he can resume it at any time, provided he has spent 1 ki point per round in the meanwhile to maintain his open chakras. Each round, when expending the ki for that round, the initiate can select the benefit from one chakra awakened up to that point. For example, if after 4 rounds the initiate has awakened three chakras, he can gain the ability of any of those three. To open a chakra, the initiate's character level (or total HD) must equal at least double the chakra's rank. For example, an initiate must be 14th level to open his crown chakra.",

			"Manipulation of the serpent-fire involves considerable risk. Every round in which a character has one or more awakened chakras, he must succeed at Fortitude and Will saving throws, adding his Charisma modifier to each save, to resist the inherent dangers of the kundalini flow as it suffuses his body with spiritual fire. The save DCs are equal to 10 + the sum of the ranks of the awakened chakras. For example, awakening the root, sacral, and navel chakras would result in a DC of 16. Opening all seven chakras at once results in DC 38 saves. The save DC totals are listed after each chakra's rank and title. If the initiate fails the Fortitude save, he takes 1d6 points of damage per awakened chakra. If the initiate fails the Will save, he is overcome with visions related to the emotions and concepts associated with the awakened chakras, causing him to be dazed for 1 round and causing all of his chakras to close.",

			"",
			"@HL[2. Sacral Chakra (DC 13):] The sacral chakra is closely associated with the generative power of the reproductive cycle, as well as pleasure, addiction, creativity, emotional needs, and relationships. When the sacral chakra is awakened, the adept recalls moments of sensual or creative ecstasy, when consciousness slips from the physical body into astral realms of weightless bliss. When opened, the sacral chakra gleams with sun-like radiance.",
			"",
			"By awakening his sacral chakra, the initiate gains a fly speed equal to his base movement for 1 round with average maneuverability. The movement must begin and end on a solid surface. The initiate must be at least 4th level before he can open this chakra.",
			"",
			"@HL[3. Navel Chakra (DC 16):] The navel chakra is sometimes called the power chakra, for it is associated with fire, combustion, digestion, anger, joy, fear, anxiety, and laughter. Here the serpent-fire swirls and swells with heat and vital energy, the source of the so-called \"fire in the belly\" of common parlance.",
			"",
			"Upon awakening his navel chakra, the initiate can channel the serpent-fire as a breath attack that deals 2d8 points of damage in a 30-foot cone. This radiant gout of orange-red liquid flame somewhat resembles fire, but bypasses all forms of energy resistance, protection, and immunity. The amount of damage increases by 1d8 for each open chakra beyond the 3rd, to a maximum of 6d8 if all of the chakras are awakened. The initiate must be at least 6th level before he can open this chakra.",

			"",
			"Once the heart chakra has been awakened, the initiate can channel his serpent-fire into a torrent of healing energy. He can use this ability on himself or touch any adjacent living creature with this fire to heal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + double the number of chakras he has awakened. In addition, he can remove one of the following conditions from the creature healed: confused, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned. This fire has no effect on constructs, undead, or other creatures that are not alive. The initiate must be at least 8th level before he can open this chakra.",
			"",
			"@HL[5. Throat Chakra (DC 25):] Speech and hearing are nothing more than vibrations, and the throat chakra thrums with the occult vibrations that govern existence. Here the urges and emotions of the lower chakras give way to more refined, cerebral vistas, making the throat chakra the bridge between feeling and thinking.",
			"",
			"By awakening the throat chakra, the initiate can tap into the primordial mystical language underlying all things - the raw tongue of the multiverse that gives motion to atoms, keeps planets rotating in infinite space, and orders the coruscations of the stars. When using this chakra, the initiate slips into a kind of trance. He can take actions as normal, but he constantly mutters incoherent, often disturbing utterances of a vastly primal nature. Each round, he can select one enemy within 30 feet. That foe must succeed at a Will save to resist becoming staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the initiate's total Hit Dice + his Charisma modifier. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The initiate must be at least 10th level before he can open this chakra.",
			"",
			"@HL[6. Brow Chakra (DC 31):] Also called the intuitive chakra, this force center governs occult vision, both literal and metaphorical. Once the brow chakra has been opened, the initiate gains the benefits of {spell/true seeing} for 1 round. Engaging this force center literally opens a shining third eye of psychic energy upon the initiate's forehead. The mystical eye is easily perceived by anyone looking at the initiate, and persists so long as he maintains the brow chakra. The initiate must be at least 12th level before he can open this chakra.",
			"",
			"@HL[7. Crown Chakra (DC 38):] Channeling serpent-fire through all seven chakras at the same time aligns the initiate's life energy to its utmost potential, bathing his aura in glimmering golden hues that illuminate his head like a gleaming halo. For the briefest of moments, he transcends mortality to become a being of temporary divinity. This alignment with the cosmic harmony of the multiverse grants him enormous sway over probability.",
			"",
			"Once the crown chakra is opened, the initiate becomes fully in tune with the powers of the multiverse, allowing him to gain the benefit of any two distinct chakras each round. He gains this benefit even if he doesn't select the crown chakra. If he selects the crown chakra, every time he would roll a d20 during that turn (such as when attempting an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), he can roll twice and take the higher result. The initiate must be at least 14th level before he can open this chakra."

The target's dominated mind merely carries out a mandate given by the caster with the means, knowledge, and experience it has available.",
			"",
			"@HL[Spell Possession:] Prior to *Occult Adventures*, the primary source for possession mechanics in the Pathfinder RPG was the {spell/magic jar} spell. {spell/Magic jar} allows the caster to detach her soul from her body and place it in the body of another creature, displacing the host's soul and leaving the caster's own body essentially \"empty.\" Like {spell/possession}, these effects belong to the necromancy school of magic, as befits magic that manipulates life force and souls.

The {spell/marionette possession} spell operates under an identical principle, but does not displace the host's soul because the target cedes control to the caster willingly.",

Additionally, the caster does not perish instantly if her body is outside the spell's range when she is ejected; the range on the {spell/possession} spell pertains only to the distance the caster can be from her intended target at the time of casting. Once ejected, the caster's soul snaps back to her body from any distance, so long as it remains on the same plane.",

			"",
			"Possession versus Charm and Compulsion: Possession overrides charms and compulsions that are in control of another creature. Neither type of effect prevents the other from functioning, but possession bypasses the mind and takes direct physical control of the body - which may result in a possessor enslaving an intelligence that is essentially helpless already because of a compulsion. Compulsion and charm effects move with the mind or soul of the creature originally targeted. For example, if you cast {spell/mind swap} on a dominated creature, the domination effect remains active but transfers with the originally dominated mind to its new host body, and a dominated creature capable of possession could possess another creature while still remaining dominated.",
			"",
			"If the host's mind or soul is not displaced from the body, a dominating creature can still telepathically interact with its now-possessed target, even though the target is helpless within its own hijacked body. The dominating creature can even command the target to explain what the host body is doing, if the host has access to its senses.",
			"",
			"Conversely, a caster can target a possessing creature with a compulsion or charm effect. If the possessing creature is the only mind or soul in the host body, the compulsion or charm effect works on the possessing creature normally. If the possessing creature is later evicted from the body, the compulsion or charm effect remains active on the possessing creature when it returns to its original body. For instance, if a mesmerist is using {spell/mind swap} on a bard, and a {monster/succubus} uses her {spell/dominate monster} spell-like ability when she meets the possessed bard, the mesmerist must attempt a saving throw against the spell. If he fails, the mesmerist becomes dominated by the succubus, and when his possession ends and he returns to his body, he remains at the mercy of his new mistress.",
			"",
			"When both the host creature and a possessing creature occupy a body at the same time, a charm or compulsion effect can target either one. However, the caster must be aware of the possessing creature's presence in the host body in order to target it. Otherwise, the effect targets the host by default, generally with limited effect.",
			"",
			"Possession versus Divination Effects: Possession does nothing to obfuscate or block most divination spells. For example, if an evil mesmerist is possessing a paladin, {spell/detect evil} will sense the presence of an evil creature when the paladin's body enters the area of effect. The Hidden Presence feat can assist a possessing creature in foiling divinations. If a creature's body and soul are in two different locations, as in the case of a caster of {spell/magic jar}, divination spells that depend on location, such as {spell/locate creature} or {spell/scrying}, fail to produce results. The exception is {spell/discern location}; this powerful spell provides both locations unless the body and soul are protected by {spell/mind blank} or a deity.",
			"",
			"Possession versus Possession: If you attempt to possess a creature that is already possessed, the possessing creature must succeed at the {spell/possession} spell's save or be ejected, allowing you to enter the host. If the possessing creature voluntarily fails its save, first that creature is automatically ejected and then the host attempts the Will save instead.

Fiends with the power to loose themselves from their forms to prey upon the minds and souls of the living practice a terrible blasphemy known as possession.",
			"",
			"Fiendish possession allows horrors from realms beyond to encroach upon specific locations, objects, and creatures, tainting their victims with fundamental evil and reshaping natural life to their terrible whims. The motivation for such possessions differs among the fiendish races, though even upon shedding their forms, evil outsiders operate and seek to defile mortality just as bodied members of their kind. While a devil might utilize the powers of possession to corrupt and manipulate, daemons typically seek to sow death and destroy lives, with demons spreading dramatic terror and ruin. Yet while such fiends might be directly combated and slain in their bodily forms, possession grants such evils the shield of innocence and the mask of virtue as their corruption spreads not from a nightmarish abomination, but from a familiar face.",
			"",
			"This article describes the methods and powers of possession in a variety of forms, as well as powers utilized by the living to combat such affronts. Possession is a supernatural ability.",
			"",
			"While this article uses the word \"fiend\" extensively, it should be noted that fiends are not the only creatures that might attempt to forcibly manipulate mortals to their whims. Other extraplanar creatures - good or evil - various forms of undead, unknowable entities from the depths of space, and other even less fathomable beings all might seek to take control of frail mortal bodies or other base physical shells. As such, GMs might easily alter or add to these rules to use them for any manner of possession-like effect they require."

			"Rare among common fiends, those capable of possession stand out in power above others of their kind. Mastering the ability to discorporate their forms and influence creatures and materials around them, such body thieves are masters of terror and manipulation. Typically only the most extraordinary and perverse fiends can make use of the powers of possession, learning such secrets from blasphemous masters or dark secrets of the multiverse. To represent this, fiends who increase in power beyond the common representatives of their kind gain access to the {feat/Possess Creature}, {feat/Possess Location}, and {feat/Possess Object} feats and the host of terrible abilities they might provide. Using these powers, even a relatively weak fiend can come to possess an area or object, while more powerful horrors might overwhelm a mortal body. Despite the similarity to mind-affecting effects, fiendish possession has more to do with the spiritual hijacking of a body or the physical corruption of objects, and thus, creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are not immune to possession (although several possession actions themselves are mind-affecting). Creatures where the body and spirit are indivisible, as is the case with most outsiders and incorporeal undead, are immune to possession effects."

These spells drive the fiend from its host, but do not return the creature to its home plane, typically causing the monstrosity to manifest in its true form nearby. Many fiends, however, find this kind of exposure counterproductive to their ultimate goals and flee to seek another suitable host, while others might become enraged and attack the meddling exorcist.",
			"",
			"A far riskier method of ending a possession involves an invitation by the exorcist to the possessing fiend to leave its current host to take up residence in the exorcist's body (or in the body of a nearby volunteer). An exorcist can force a possessing fiend to leave its current host and attempt the new possession by making a successful Intimidate check to demoralize the fiend. Typically, the exorcist taking such a bold risk hopes to make his own saving throw to resist the possession or protects himself with magic before making this risky attempt. If the fiend fails to possess the exorcist, it can immediately try to repossess its original host, who can attempt to resist this possession by making a Will save. If the fiend fails to return to its host, it manifests in its physical form in a space adjacent to the host, and is typically infuriated."

These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence.

			"Casting an occult ritual requires at least 10 minutes per ritual level and sometimes as long as 1 hour per ritual level. One of the casters - either the primary caster or a secondary caster who the primary caster specifies - attempts one of the skill checks required by the ritual every 10 minutes of the casting, unless the ritual takes 1 hour per caster level, in which case the caster attempts the check every hour of the ritual. These checks cannot benefit from the aid another action, and the caster attempting the check can't take 10 or take 20, even if she has an ability that would normally allow her to do so when threatened or distracted. Furthermore, because of the specific procedures of ritual casting, mundane equipment that grants bonuses on skill checks can't usually increase the caster's bonus on the checks required by the ritual, unless the GM allows it. Bonuses on the skill checks required for the ritual that are granted by feats, spells (with enough duration to last throughout the casting), traits, and magic items usually apply, at the GM's discretion. The primary caster decides the order in which the various skill checks are attempted, but the GM rolls for the checks and tracks the progress of the ritual casting in secret.

While secondary casters can help by attempting the skill checks the primary caster assigns them, their chief purpose is to aid in the ritual's casting.

Rituals are often an interesting way to introduce unusually powerful magical effects into your game in a limited or controlled way. They can also introduce these effects in a manner that is more specific than similar higher-level spell effects. The ritual's purpose should influence subsequent design decisions.",

If you're unsure which school is most appropriate, compare the effects with existing spells. If a ritual could have one or more possible schools, determine which is the most relevant school and use that one.",
			"",
			"@HL[Step 3-Determine Ritual Level:] This step involves setting the level of the occult ritual. Occult rituals are always equivalent to at least 4th-level spells. Often the best way to determine a ritual level is to compare it to other spells in the game, or to use the guidelines for [designing new spells](rule/research_and_designing_spells). The ritual level determines how many total successes are required to cast the ritual, the DCs for the skill checks needed to complete the ritual, the save DC for the ritual's effect (if applicable), and indirectly determines the ritual's range and duration.",

			"@HL[Rahadoum:] One might expect Rahadoum to sneer at all divination, seeing in astrology and astrologers a dangerous similarity to priests and religion, and in some cases this is true. Yet the ability to potentially divine the future using scientific practices - and without indenturing oneself to any divine being - has significant appeal, and Rahadoum houses a healthy astrological community.",

			"@HL[Saoc Brethren:] The Saoc Brethren was a cadre of astrologers who ruled the fallen nation of Lirgen. Having mastered the art of celestial divination, the Brethren used prophecy extensively in making state decisions. However, their foresight proved imperfect, as they failed to predict the formation of the Eye of Abendego and its subsequent destruction of their homeland."

			"The modern {eq-misc/harrow deck} is the culmination of millennia of storytelling, travel, arcane research, and shared tragedy. Though many wanderers and gamblers claim to read the cards, a rare minority of true harrowers can tap into the weave of destiny through the deck to channel and enhance their own magic.",
			"",
			"At a mundane level, the harrow is used to play games, divine the future, and separate fools from their coin. Each card is a beautiful work of art, handcrafted and passed down through generations of mystics. To a trained harrower, each card is steeped in symbolism and meaning. In the distant past, every harrower crafted her own unique deck, but over time the standard deck of 54 cards evolved and is now accepted by all but the most exotic mystic or foolhardy dabbler.",
			"",
			"The 54 cards of the harrow are divided into six suits and nine alignments, with each suit featuring a single card per alignment. The alignments hint at a card's meaning: positive or negative and past, present, or future. The suits - hammers, keys, shields, books, stars, and crowns - roughly correspond to the concepts central to a caravan's life: The suit of hammers concerns matters of warfare, hunting, and reputation. The suit of keys evokes both larceny and things closely guarded, like children or dreams. The suit of shields reflects home, community, health, and things kept at hand. Books encompass learning, history, and managing resources or wealth. The suit of stars concerns esoteric and intangible matters such as tradition, the gods, and folklore. Lastly, the suit of crowns delves into those things that rule every mortal: romance, family, and one's place in the world, along with mundane rulership.",
			"",
			"A harrow reading is a somber affair. Because a harrowing is subjective and personal, most practitioners learn to read their subjects as much as the cards to inform their prophecy. The subject (or subjects) states a single question clearly, and the harrower withdraws the nine cards of the suit associated with that concern and shuffles them. Each participant draws one of these cards to learn his role in events to come (the \"role card\"). The entire harrow deck is then reshuffled. Nine cards are drawn and typically laid out in a three-by-three array. Cards in the left column represent the past, while cards in the right reveal the future. Each card's alignment interacts with its placement in the array, and its meaning might be more or less important, or even inverted, based on its position. Finally, any role cards that reappear in the array mean that the indicated participant has a vital role to play, and provides some clue to his purpose."

			"The {eq-misc/harrow deck} is most famously associated with the Varisian wandering clans of northwestern Avistan. The Azlanti colonists who founded Thassilon brought playing cards to the region, which their Varisian subjects altered by adorning them with iconography from their own folklore. In the Age of Legends, hundreds of unique cards existed, but with Earthfall, most of the Varisians' lore was lost. The Imlios family dedicated itself to gathering whatever hereditary knowledge they could, but over the centuries, the family dwindled to a single woman: Sonnorae. Sonnorae used Thassilonian magic and her family's harrow deck to create a pocket dimension forged from dreams, where her library of Varisian lore would be safe. Most Varisians now use Sonnorae's Deck of Harrowed Tales as the archetype for their own harrow decks, hoping to sympathetically tap into the {rule/Harrowed Realm/'s} power and vast store of knowledge.",
			"",
			"Far to the south, wealthy traders brought the harrow to Absalom. Initially, the cards were little more than an amusement, but after the death of Aroden, many in Absalom began to take them seriously. Most notably, Arodenites lay out a circular array known as the All-Seeing Eye instead of the standard three-by-three grid, and assign the alignment of each card a numerical value to incorporate some elements of Osirian numerology."

A PC may have multiple Plot Twist Cards in hand at a time, to a maximum of his level.

The target referred to in this entry is chosen by the PC who is using the card.

Along with harrowing, numerology is one of only a few forms of divination that rely exclusively on abstract systems, making it more widely applicable than many other divinatory practices.",

However, numerology's focus on mathematics links it more closely to alchemy, architecture, and engineering, making it more accessible to craftspeople and scholars than the study of spellcasting, which is often exclusive to magical universities and religious organizations. There are two basic forms of numerology: arithmancy and sacred geometry.",

For arithmancers, the unseen equations embedded within language evoke hidden meanings that other arcanists often miss. By essentially turning every word and sentence into a mathematical equation, practitioners can boil down names to single numbers that indicate the hidden natures of the spells, creatures, or locations named. Arithmancers often use this skill in a manner similar to astrologers' use of horoscopes, to determine someone's natural profession, her lucky numbers, or auspicious times of year. Arithmancy is most widely associated with the Tian and Draconic languages, though numerological studies of Common are popular in many magical academies.",

Many of the shapes revered by sacred geometers are the result of observation of the natural world: hexagons grant abundance because of their inherent efficiency and use in honeycombs, spheres and arches are associated with strength because they can withstand more pressure than any other shape, and logarithmic spirals (such as those found in nautilus shells) are symbols of eternity because it maintains the same shape at every point. Sacred geometry is used extensively in architecture, construction, and spellcraft; sacred geometers seek out and manipulate potent shapes and ratios in order to design magically conductive temples, pinpoint locations of power, and augment spellcasting."

Others must seek out haunts in the places where they reside in order to establish a direct rapport.

Once mediums have overcome the effects of such haunts, they can proceed with communication.",

Likewise, destroyed spectral dead such as ghosts and poltergeists can assume this same state during rejuvenating periods, and can attempt to convey their needs to the living. While still potentially malevolent, these entities can often communicate via simple codes (such as one rap for \"yes\" and two for \"no\") or by the medium calling out words, numbers, and letters for rapped selection by the spirits. Such messages can be formed at the rate of 1d10 words for each minute in which a character succeeds at a {skill/Linguistics} check, with a DC equal to 15 + the original haunt's CR. Mediums channeling demanding dead, on the other hand, typically whisper messages, or write at the haunt's suggestion - both at the same rate when unaided by tools of their trade. In either case, spirits are often unreliable, always cryptic, and never able to convey knowledge beyond what they knew in life.",

Some mediums carry flat, lettered boards known as \"talking boards,\" cone-shaped spirit trumpets, or writing planchettes - small boards that can be written on with chalk or charcoal pencils. While these are mundane versions of magical {magic-wondrous/trumpet[s] of spirit speaking} and {magic-wondrous/spirit planchette/s>_brass} with no inherent power of their own, in the hands of those with properly established rapports, these tools increase the efficiency of messages received to 3d6 words per minute of communication, and grant the user a +4 bonus on Linguistics checks to decipher the cryptic messages of haunts.",

The Shoanti, for example, engaged in totemistic rituals meant to anchor these spiritual protections to them. Far to the east, Tians who prize family and genealogy practice a similar form of ancestor worship wherein descendants venerate departed souls and attune themselves to the quiet guidance of protective spirits while taking measures to guard themselves from the vengeance of wrathful entities.",

For example, while the PCs are on the trail of a murderous demon cult, misinformation might lead them to a secret society involved in unusual initiation rites. While the lead may be a dead end in terms of their original investigation, perhaps the PCs discover the group's seemingly innocuous initiations actually involve dangerous necromancy.",
			"",
			"@HL[Building PC Involvement:] Sometimes the best way to involve the PCs in a campaign is to ask them what they want. At the beginning of your occult campaign, ask each player to come up with a personal mystery for his or her character, such as having witnessed an unusual phenomenon or having experienced an inexplicable event as a teenager. A PC may have brief flashbacks to her childhood of visits by men in blood-red robes and disturbing animal masks, for example. The character's search to discover the meaning of this memory may lead her down dark paths, particularly when she spots a street preacher wearing the tattered remains of one of the robes in a nearby city, and discovers from him that as a child, the PC was a candidate for an apocalyptic cult. Other hooks might include the unknown fate of a friend or relative, or the significance of a city monument's unconventional design. It may center on a certain location, like a place seen in recurring dreams or the ghost-haunted gardens of some overgrown manor. It could have to do with a mysterious object, such as a locket that throbs painfully in the hands of a psychometrist or an ancient tome containing twisting, backwards writing in which a new word is scribbled each day.",
			"",
			"Some hooks may play major roles in the campaign, while others turn out to be minor anecdotes. Regardless, an adventure hook based on a character's curiosity, need, or longing is an invaluable tool for building player investment in the story."

This causes ley lines to seed magical effects, subconscious thoughts, and other supernatural phenomena along their paths, and sometimes creates unusual supernatural effects.",

			"Psychic impressions carried down ley lines can impact the cultural and psychological growth of peoples living along the path of a ley line. Such alignments can cause two civilizations separated by thousands of miles - or even separated by planar boundaries - to evolve along similar developmental paths. Towns built on opposite ends of a ley line may have identical (or sometimes mirrored) street plans and similar histories. Artists living near a ley line may unconsciously convey their ideas to other artists on other planes, creating instances of parallel design. When a ley line penetrates planes, it can carry influences from one plane into another, making ley lines partially responsible for the appearance of tieflings and aasimars in bloodlines that had no prior history of contact with outsiders. This effect is also responsible for some of the propagation of sorcerous power, psychic powers, and other unusual magical phenomena such as haunts and {rule/loci spirits}.",
			"",
			"Like the arteries of a circulatory system, ley lines come in many different sizes. The larger a ley line, the more capacity it has to carry magical energy. The size of a given ley line can change over time, however, and may vary at different points along its length. The size of a ley line generally impacts the strength and kinds of power that can be drawn from it by spellcasters. Ley lines have an effective caster level ranging from 1 to 20 that represents the overall strength of the ley line and determines the power of effects associated with it."

			"A ley line's natural state is as an imperceptible current of energy. Finding a ley line requires the use of a skill or spell that can detect the magical energy a ley line radiates. {spell/Detect magic} can locate the presence of an accessible portion of a ley line within its area of effect and uses the ley line's effective caster level to determine its aura's strength as if the ley line were a magic item. {spell/True seeing} reveals all accessible ley lines within its area of effect; they appear as ghostly bundles of tightly packed streams of energy. The color of a ley line is representative of its overall power level. Ley lines with a caster level of 1 are a dark violet color, while ley lines with a caster level of 20 are deep red. Ley lines with caster levels between 1 and 20 range across the color spectrum as appropriate (starting with violet and continuing to blue, green, yellow, orange, and finally red). Divination magic such as {spell/contact other plane}, {spell/divination}, and {spell/commune} can help narrow down the location of a ley line. Additionally, {spell/legend lore} can help reveal information about a known ley line. Occult skill unlocks such as {skill/dowsing} can also help detect the presence of ley lines over long distances, which can be quite useful in locating an accessible portion of a ley line.",
			"",
			"Because of ley lines' ability to pick up ambient energy, some local effects can cause portions of a ley line to become visible. For example, in areas of wild magic, an extant ley line may manifest as a shimmering river of rainbow-hued light constantly shifting through the color spectrum, while locations with a powerful presence of negative energy might cause a ley line to appear as a tendril of darkness that bleeds an ephemeral black smoke tinged with red light.",
			"",
			"Ley lines do not generally move from location to location. While the exact paths they take may drift over the course of millennia or eons, these changes are largely unnoticed by all but the longest-lived races. As such, the discovery of a ley line can impact a region for millennia and draw attention from those seeking to exploit the ley line's power. Civilizations that discover ley lines sometimes mark the locations in which their power is most easily accessible by erecting monuments such as menhir circles or obelisks. These sites are typically used to perform rituals or other functions that tap into the latent power of a ley line to enhance spellcasting. A powerful wizard might build his tower atop a particularly strong ley line, a druidic sect might construct a menhir circle nearest to where a ley line touches the ground, or an ancient dragon might build its mountaintop lair as close to a ley line in the sky as possible. Accurate maps and charts depicting the paths and intersections of ley lines are reliable for centuries or more and can reveal nodes of power across worlds and planes."

These sites can be of any size, ranging from a tiny cave under a great mountain to an entire mountain range.",

			"Most of the effects generated by a ley line's accessible portions are passive and easy to miss. Planar energy, psychic impressions, and other collected powers bleed out into the land and influence the development of local life. A creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities can attempt to tap into an accessible segment of a ley line within 100 feet. Doing so takes 1 hour per 2 caster levels of the ley line and requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + the ley line's caster level. Success indicates the creature is attuned to the ley line and gains a +1 bonus to its effective caster level for all spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 caster levels of the ley line, to a maximum of +5. Depending on the nature of the ley line convergence, this bonus may apply only to certain spells and spell-like abilities. For instance, a ley line convergence atop a great volcano might apply its bonus only to spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor. Hags or other creatures with the coven ability benefit from the bonus of ley line attunement so long as at least one member of the coven is attuned to the ley line and all coven members are within 10 feet of an attuned creature. Some ley lines also grant creatures attuned to them special abilities such as bonus spells, spell-like abilities, or other supernatural effects. Once a creature is attuned to a ley line, the bond is permanent unless dispelled. {spell/Dispel magic} and similar effects can break a creature's attunement to a ley line; the caster attempting to break the attunement must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the ley line. When an attuned creature is more than 100 feet from the ley line, it gains no benefit from the attunement, but the benefits return when it is once again in proximity.",

			"Ley lines can become damaged over the course of time, whether by extreme magical forces or other monumental events. Damage in this manner can cause a supernatural bruise that bleeds out into the location surrounding a ley line. Harming or destroying ley lines is difficult, given their monumental size and power. Even the weakest of ley lines are impervious to most physical and magical attacks, though great forces can exert influence over them. {spell/Mage's disjunction} can potentially destroy a ley line, though this task requires the caster to succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 20 + the ley line's caster level. Doing so immediately deals 2d6 points of damage per caster level of the ley line (no saving throw) to the caster. Additionally, all creatures attuned to the ley line and able to benefit from attunement take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level of the ley line when it is destroyed. There is a 1% chance per caster level of the ley line that its destruction creates a permanent {spell/antimagic field} with a radius of 100 feet per caster level of the destroyed ley line. Furthermore, the caster of {spell/mage's disjunction} who creates an {spell/antimagic field} in this way must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or permanently lose all spellcasting abilities. These abilities cannot be recovered by mortal magic, not even via {spell/miracle} or {spell/wish}."

			"Mindscapes are temporary constructs of the mind that come into being on the Astral Plane and fade away again, in much the same way a sleeping person's imagined landscape forms and dissolves while he is dreaming. The primary difference between a mindscape and a dream is one of intent; a creature often deliberately and precisely constructs a mindscape, while a dreamer typically does not. A mindscape can come into existence as a result of creatures engaging in a [psychic duel](rule/psychic_duels), as well as through certain spells, magic items, rituals, and other occult phenomena. In theory, a mindscape can take on any form or appearance - and can possess any conceivable trait - in much the same way the various planes do. In practice, mindscapes often either appear mostly normal, or feature only one or two traits that stray from reality, and creatures' psychic avatars manifesting within the mindscape might not be able to tell they're no longer in the real world.",
			"",
			"Two types of mindscape exist: binary mindscapes and immersive mindscapes. Binary mindscapes occur during psychic duels, when a creature with psychic powers draws another into a mental battle. Only two participants can occupy a binary mindscape. This cerebral combat arena does not totally engulf the participants' senses; a creature engaged in a psychic duel within a binary mindscape can still perceive the real world, but is largely consumed in her psychic battle. In this case, the mindscape is a powerful image in the mind's eye, perceived on an abstract level and capable of affecting the subject in the real world, detaching her from events in the real world but leaving her still capable of perceiving them.",
			"",
			"Immersive mindscapes are far more tangible and realistic. In an immersive mindscape, a creature's every sense perceives its imaginary surroundings completely, in effect replacing the body's actual sensory perceptions.",
			"",
			"While a creature's consciousness is within a mindscape, that creature's body in the real world can take no actions and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, but it isn't considered helpless, as the unconscious parts of the creature's mind still provide resistance to the creature's destruction. While in an immersive mindscape, the mind gets no information about what the body sees, hears, smells, or touches. Thus, if the body takes damage from an attack in the real world, the mind remains unaware of it. A binary mindscape, however, allows a creature to monitor its own condition in the real world.",

			"Creatures drawn into mindscapes don't have to appear as themselves, and can instead assume alternate forms called mental masks. They can do so only if they know they're in a mindscape or believe they're in a dream (the creator of a mindscape almost always does). A mental mask allows a creature to hide its true identity, masking its true features from its enemies. Non-psychic creatures can't assume a mental mask; they must appear in immersive mindscapes in their true forms."

Arcane tradition conceptualizes this multiverse of planes as a series of nesting spheres, with each layer and the spaces between representing different vistas of reality. At the center of it all, suspended within the silvery seas of the Astral Plane, lies the Inner Sphere of the Elemental and Material Planes. The Elemental Planes are the raw building blocks of the multiverse, while the planes aligned with positive and negative energy govern the forces of life and death, creation and destruction. The invisible mists and eddies of the Ethereal Plane connect and interpenetrate the worlds of the Inner Sphere, just as the Astral Plane connects these worlds in turn to the infinite realms of the Outer Sphere, the domains of gods and the final destination for the souls of the multiverse.",

			"The esoteric tradition, sometimes referred to as the \"ancient wisdom,\" acknowledges the many planes, demiplanes, and corners of the Inner and Outer Spheres, but tends to focus more on the Inner Sphere than the realms of the deities. Scholars of occultism believe that their investigations reveal a hidden truth behind the multiverse, and that mastering the implications of this secret can give an adept power over not just her mortal life, but also her life after death. She can then enter a cycle of reincarnation that allows, over successive cycles of existence and reflection, the complete mastery of body, mind, and soul, opening up new vistas of consciousness and immortality.",

Her final personal journey into a more evolved existence is loftier than the base elements, and more self-determined than the proscribed fate of the pious petitioner.",
			"",
			"The orthodox view of the planes sees two opposing forces underlying existence in the multiverse: positive and negative energy. Each of these primal forces commands a vast plane of its own at the core of the Inner Sphere. The Positive Energy Plane is the source of life, and the Negative Energy Plane is the source of death; each exists as antithesis to the other. The great secret of occultism holds that rather than positive and negative energy being conflicting forces, they are in fact two halves of a single whole. Their polarity is not a sign of opposition, but rather two integral aspects of a single dualistic cycle. The positive aspect of this duality is the Cosmic Fire, the breath of life that grants vital force to living creatures. The Negative Energy Plane is the intake of that same breath, a return to dust, the recycling of component parts to pave the way for that which comes next.",

Among the oldest creatures in the Great Beyond are the enigmatic outsiders known as aeons, who are said to be the caretakers of reality and the original architects and crafters of the multiverse itself. Befitting the esoteric view of the planes, these primordial beings always manifest a powerful dichotomy sustained in equilibrium: Birth and death. Fate and freedom. Creation and destruction.",
			"",
			"The aeons believe they are bound in a supreme oneness with the multiverse known as the \"monad,\" or the \"condition of all,\" the transcendental undersoul of all living creatures. They equate this oneness with both the life-giving Cosmic Fire of the Positive Energy Plane and the destructive void of the Negative Energy Plane. Furthermore, they do not limit this cosmic oneness to themselves, but rather include all of the multiverse's creatures within their concept of the monad. A human and a {monster/pleroma/ aeon} are both emanations of the cosmic flame - the aeon is simply much closer to the source and believes itself to be in communication with it, whereas the monadic soul of a human is esoterically distant from the Fire, being focused primarily on the mortal affairs of the base Material Plane.",

Now imagine multitudes of tiny holes in the screen, each allowing some of the light to shine through. From the exoteric viewpoint of the uninitiated, each pinpoint of light appears distinct and unique. The esoteric perspective looks behind the screen and understands that all of the individual lights are but rays from a single source. A creature's soul is like one glimmering light in that screen's field of stars, and when mortal scholars speak of \"a monad,\" they're usually referring to this individual-seeming expression of the universal undersoul, at once a unique entity and part of the common soul of the multiverse. The greater an adept understands her place in this scheme, the more power she holds over her eternal destiny.",

Ironically for a plane associated with life, the Positive Energy Plane can be extremely deadly to mortal visitors, as its ambient energies are so powerful that a mortal shell cannot absorb them without bursting. At certain vertices, the refraction of the Cosmic Fire's rays create islands of solidity where the plane's energies are not so extreme, and some manner of life as mortals understand it becomes possible. Here, upon vast shimmering fields, phoenix-feathered creatures known as the {monster/jyoti} tend to orchards of glowing, anemone-like trees as tall as mountains, sprouting immature souls like glossy, liquid fruit. The xenophobic jyoti dwell in complex cities of crystal specially designed to reflect the weird luminescence of the Cosmic Fire. Jyoti seldom venture from these structures, focusing all of their energies on their sacred charge of tending and defending the nascent souls of the multiverse. At the center of each jyoti city is an imposing gate to a star in the cosmos of the Material Plane. New souls pass through these gates and ride waves of light to find incarnation in mortal vessels.",

Negative energy is itself a dark opposite of life-giving positive energy, yet while it is most often a source or tool of destruction, it is also the animating force of the undead. The ancient wisdom of occultism seizes on this seemingly paradoxical association with creation and posits that entropy clears the slate for what's next as the multiverse inexorably marches along an unimaginably vast evolutionary cycle of its own. Perfection is not a fixed state. It is always growing and changing. To say that there is one \"natural\" state - for instance, utter oblivion - that constitutes perfection is as impossible as imposing a limit on the infinite. Occultists believe that this destruction allows for and drives change.",

Records of astral voyages to the Material Plane side of these portals relate tales of the accretion disks of black holes swarming with incorporeal undead trapped within the event horizon.",

Somehow, their manifestation seems to drain a measure of the plane's entropic energies, ironically making the regions around these haunting snowflake structures the most stable and survivable regions in the otherwise hostile plane. While negative energy is less of a concern, the sceaduinar themselves represent a significant threat to visitors.",

The Ethereal Plane coexists with these planes, interpenetrating them and generally mimicking their contours and vistas, albeit with greatly reduced visibility thanks to drifting fog and the slow rise and fall of fading sheets of light like the somber interior of a thunderstorm. From within the Ethereal Plane, these neighboring worlds appear hazy and indistinct, as if viewed through frosted glass. Inhabitants of neighboring planes can't perceive the Ethereal Plane at all, though certain mortals blessed or cursed with psychic sensitivity sometimes catch glimpses of its vistas. Since the Ethereal Plane is generally invisible from the other planes of the Inner Sphere, creatures under the effects of spells like {spell/ethereal jaunt} and {spell/etherealness} cannot be seen by creatures who are not themselves ethereal. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa.",

The natural denizens of the plane make this a frightful prospect, however, and ensure that most forays into the Ethereal Plane are brief endeavors. Among the deadliest of local hazards are the blood-red {monster/xill} - warlike, plane-shifting outsiders who incubate their eggs in living mortals. Worse still, hideous, cackling {monster/night hag/s} use the Ethereal Plane as a byway to the Dimension of Dreams, where they slip into nightmares to abduct mortal souls.",

Some souls, freed from their physical bodies by death, remain tethered to the Ethereal Plane by profound emotional distress and cannot proceed along multiversal currents to join the River of Souls flowing inexorably toward the Boneyard until they sever the powerful emotional ties that bind them. Indeed, the longer these souls remain stalled on their afterlife journey, the closer they slide toward the Negative Energy Plane, and the more of their memories and personalities become subsumed by raw emotional distress and psychic damage. These souls eventually manifest as incorporeal undead, frequently in the form of {monster/wraith/s} and {monster/spectre/s}. {class/Spiritualist/s} call out to the spirits of the Ethereal Plane and open their physical minds as refuges for them to inhabit. With practice and the help of a trained spiritualist, a spirit can even take its own physical form on the neighboring planes by cloaking itself in a sheath of ectoplasm, the ghostly substance that acts as a veil between worlds. These spirit guides are known as {sidekick/phantom/s}, and while they are loyal to the spiritualist to whom they are bound, the emotional connection to the Ethereal Plane remains strong, manifesting in jealousy and fiery outbursts from even the kindest of souls. The ectoplasmic nature of the Ethereal Plane is extraordinarily susceptible to the thoughts and emotions of the plane's inhabitants. The ethereal version of a physical location is informed not just by its actual dimensions and appearance, but also by the memories and impressions of the spirits that haunt it. For example, on the Ethereal Plane, an old mansion might look as it did in the era of its ghostly inhabitants. If those spirits find final rest, their memories cannot sustain the structure, and it falls into an ethereal ruin. Some incorporeal spirits become so entwined with the emotional nature of the plane that they can manifest these ectoplasmic vistas in an overlapping location on a neighboring plane, temporarily cloaking it in a disturbing reflection of some past incarnation.",
			"",
			"In a similar way that locations in the outside world possess overlapping etheric reflections, mortal creatures also have ethereal doppelgangers in the form of etheric doubles that exactly overlie their physical forms. The etheric double is a vessel for the cosmic breath of life that gives a creature animate force, most commonly known as ki. This energy collects in seven blazing vortices of colorful energy known as chakras, which bind the etheric double and the physical body together and distribute vital life energy to both. This energy extends 2 to 3 feet beyond the outlines of the creature's physical form to create its aura, a nimbus of colorful occult energies that reveals much about a creature's disposition and emotional state.",
			"",
			"A creature's etheric double, aura, and chakras are not visible except to those with the knowledge or magic to see them. From the Material Plane, this involves esoteric use of the {skill/Perception} skill by a creature with the {feat/Psychic Sensitivity} feat or any of a number of spells. From within the Ethereal Plane, all it takes to observe the interplay of these forces is simple concentration: if you know what to look for, it becomes plainly visible. Interpreting this information, of course, is another matter. An etheric double is outlined in violet-gray or blue-gray luminescence. Unlike an astral body generated by {spell/astral projection} or a lucid body of the Dimension of Dreams, an etheric double is not normally capable of acting as a separate vehicle of consciousness.",
			"",
			"Finally, the sweeping expanse of the Ethereal Plane is home to countless pocket realities known as demiplanes. Many of these unique realms are the private domains of powerful arcane spellcasters, the playgrounds of minor gods, the experiments of the inscrutable elohim, or the prisons of creatures that pose such danger to the cosmos that they must never be released.",

A dreamer can alter her surroundings, and one with the Lucid Dreamer feat gains a greater measure of control. Spells cast and items used in a dream are not depleted in the real world. Wounds and conditions don't have any effect on the creature's waking body and mind. Fantastic adventures don't yield real treasure or experience to the waking being, though knowledge gained in the Dimension of Dreams occasionally aids in solving real challenges faced in the waking world. Even the worst nightmares hold little true danger for the dreamer. Should the lucid body die, the dreamer simply awakens, perhaps a bit shaken but otherwise little worse for the experience.

When a physical creature enters a dreamscape, he doesn't have to make the check to determine his initial state, but also can't attempt impossible feats (see below). Spells cast, magic items used, and other limited abilities expended are lost just as if the creature were adventuring on some other plane. Creatures in their material forms can use items generated within a dreamscape, but these items wink out of existence when the primary dreamer awakens, or when a creature in material form leaves the dreamscape. Wounds and experiences are real, and remain after the creature leaves the dreamscape. A creature in its physical form that dies within a dream demiplane actually dies. Material creatures still within a dreamscape when the primary dreamer awakens are pushed into an abutting dreamscape or regions of the Ethereal Plane that border the Dimension of Dreams.",

As a standard action, a number of times during the dream equal to the creature's Charisma bonus (minimum 1) the dreamer can attempt one impossible action, such as casting a spell, gaining an effect of a spell as if it were cast, or conjuring a magic item. This requires a successful Charisma check (DC 10 + the level of the spell being cast or spell effect replicated or half of the caster level of the item conjured; nonmagical items are caster level 0). Other fantastic feats are also possible with GM approval and a Charisma check with a DC determined by the GM. If the check fails, the dreamer cannot perform the feat. Creatures that enter the dream with their physical bodies do not need to make the initial check and do not gain the ability to create items and spell effects or perform other fantastic feats, but must otherwise deal with the strange realities of the dreamscape.",

			"The Astral Plane is the great silvery sky that connects all planes to one another, the realm of pure thought and expanded consciousness. Occasional islands of solid matter float in astral space, but most of the plane is an enormous, seemingly eternal void of silver radiance. As a gateway between the Inner and Outer Spheres, the Astral Plane teems with travelers, from entities venturing between planes to explorers searching for one of the numerous demiplanes secreted here or looking for the one of the countless marooned spirits that dwell within the expanse. Its nature as a crossroads makes the Astral Plane very dangerous. Although it's possible to visit the plane bodily via {spell/plane shift} or by using an item such as a {magic-wondrous/robe of stars}, most travelers prefer to play it safe by manifesting their souls in an astral body created by spells such as {spell/astral projection}.",

			"A creature's astral body looks like a translucent version of its physical form, usually limned with a soft nimbus of blue or violet light. A slim tether of resilient incorporeal energy known as a silver cord connects a creature's astral body to its unconscious physical body. If the astral body dies, the silver cord retracts into the physical body, returning the soul to its familiar seat (albeit at the cost of two permanent negative levels due to the resultant trauma). A silver cord resists most attempts to damage it, but if it somehow manages to break, the creature immediately dies, and the astral form housing its soul is cast adrift on the astral currents, pulled inexorably toward the enormous spire of the Boneyard, which extends up into the Astral Plane from the surface of the Outer Sphere. As a realm of thought, the Astral Plane is home to entities that represent concepts, myths, and legends spawned from mortal thoughtforms. Mediums open their consciousness to these denizens of the Astral Plane, inviting them to reside in a physical form and spread their influence on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Travel through the Astral Plane is a strange affair, as the plane's subjective directional gravity means that each traveler chooses the direction of gravity's pull. Creatures can move normally in any direction by imagining \"down\" near their feet and \"falling\" in that direction. In this way a creature \"falls\" 150 feet the first round and 300 feet on each successive round. Movement is straight-line only. A character can attempt a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity or stop as a free action; this check can be attempted once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check on successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he succeeds. When moving in this manner, the traveler does not have the sensation of physical movement. Rather, the landscape of the Astral Plane (such as it is) seems to come toward, through, and past him. Scintillations of light are thrown off by the astral body as it moves along at great speed.",

Soul-collecting or soul-devouring predators such as {monster/night hag/s} and {monster/astradaemon/s} prey on the dead of the Astral Plane, usually limiting themselves to picking off isolated incorporeal undead but all too often raiding parties of disembodied souls as they make their way toward eternity. {faith/Pharasma}, the goddess of the dead, hates this perversion of the natural order of the multiverse, and the entities known as {family/psychopomp/s} often act as guides to deliver souls safely to their final destinations.",

The Akashic Record is a visual library of perfect psychic records of every moment in the history of the multiverse. Those who find their way here can observe scenes from any moment from the recent to distant past, going all the way back to the beginning of the multiverse. When a dead creature's untethered astral body sees its life flash before its eyes as it awaits judgment in the Boneyard, its consciousness ventures to the Akashic Record. When a psychometrist divines a touched object's past, he really gains impressions from scenes stored in the Akashic Record.",

Two creatures observing the same event in real time might come away with very different subjective understandings of what just occurred, but such confusion is impossible in the Akashic Record, which occultists speak of as the memory of nature. It is also known as the Book of the Lipika by the mysterious cloaked {family/aeon/s} who act as the Lords of Karma and who record every event in a mortal's life to measure its rightful place in the afterlife.",

			"Traveling to the Akashic Record, which abuts the mysterious Dimension of Time, is incredibly difficult. Spells that allow for planar travel, such as {spell/plane shift}, cannot take a seeker to the Akashic Record. While occult lore suggests several methods to \"enter\" the Akashic Record and influence the visions seen there (for example, to rescue a character from some past scene and escape with her to the Astral Plane), those doing so risk becoming lost in the currents of the Dimension of Time, marooned in the real past of the observed event, very likely never to return.

At the pinnacle of this spire is the Boneyard, a necropolis of graveyards, mausoleums, and solemn courts dedicated to {faith/Pharasma}, goddess of death. This gloomy realm, also known as Purgatory, is home to countless souls awaiting final judgment.

Only when it has worked through the psychological troubles of its past can it proceed further along the River of Souls. As a soul reflects upon and settles its past affairs, it lets go of its ties to these events and begins to forget them, cleansing its soul for the glorious (or terrible) transformations to come. This is why petitioners in the Outer Sphere seldom remember much of their mortal existence, and why most mortals cannot remember anything of their past incarnations on the Material Plane.",

The lessons of the {family/manasaputra/s} who guide the occult development of mortals suggest that the greatest esoteric fate is not to simply glance at the lake, but to step fully into its waters and allow them to subsume you. A soul immersed fully in the waters of the Lake of Mortal Reflections sheds the karma and experiences of its past life and, once again, the cleansed monadic soul descends into a new physical body in a cycle of reincarnation. With each subsequent reincarnation, the monad gains a greater appreciation for the experiences of a multitude of different incarnations, underlying the concept of the universal undersoul represented by the Cosmic Fire. With this understanding comes greater control over the soul's final incarnation as an outsider. According to esoteric lore, the most learned adepts are able to choose their own fates, becoming powerful outsiders, peerless mortal \"ascended masters,\" or even living gods.",

You should make sure to alert your players at the start of any campaign that will take place on the other planes of the Great Beyond.

			"One use lies in the nature of the fundamental building block of the Outer Planes - quintessence. As detailed in The River of Souls, when a mortal dies, the soul eventually merges with the material of another plane (usually after spending time as a petitioner or outsider), expanding the plane's size and counterbalancing its erosion by the Maelstrom. Thus, the very existence of the Outer Planes depends on the constant influx of souls. When a deity's religion is widespread on the Material Plane, her realm reaps direct benefits in the form of more petitioners, which can, in time, increase the overall size of the planar realm.",
			"",
			"But there's an even more important role that mortals play: they provide faith. When a mortal has faith in a divinity, that power increasingly ties that mortal's fate and soul to that divinity. The divinity does not directly gain power from this interaction - a deity with only one or even no worshipers can be as powerful as a deity with trillions of worshipers. A religion that is powerful and widespread, however, can expand a divinity's influence in ways that the divinity cannot, due to the fact that the divine do not directly interfere in the affairs of mortals. A deity who has legions of worshipers will see her religion spread, and that spread of faith will directly translate into an increase of souls into her realm. Deities with few or no worshipers will, over time, see their realms eaten away by the Maelstrom, their armies dwindle, and their standing among the divine fade. Faith can meet a divinity's emotional needs as well, be it the need for a self-centered deity to feel his ego bolstered, an extroverted deity to feel accepted and popular, a power-hungry deity to feel feared, or a benevolent deity to bask in the love of her children and family.",

			"Some deities have no interest in faith. These divinities may seek widespread destruction (such as {faith/Rovagug}, whose realm is also his prison, and who would be released into the Multiverse upon its destruction) or exist as a manifestation of the fact that all things must end (such as {faith/Groetus}, whose \"realm\" consists of his own body high above the Boneyard). And then there are the Outer Gods&mdash;divinities whose very existence predates the concept of existence as mortals understand it. Divinities like {faith/Azathoth}, {faith/Shub-Niggurath}, and {faith/Yog-Sothoth} are incalculably ancient, and they exist outside of the boundaries and restrictions of faith, souls, and the concept of quintessence entirely. Mortals still worship them, yet the Outer Gods have little interest in such worship, and in many cases these alien divinities may not even comprehend the concept of faith at all. Among the Outer Gods, only [Nyarlathotep's](faith/nyarlathotep_black_pharaoh) pursuit of faith provides a singular, ominous, and unnerving exception to this rule."

			"",
			"Conflict-based conquests are only rarely carried out by lawful or good divinities. The planes are vast, and for every realm currently ruled by a divinity, there are thousands, if not millions, more locations spread throughout the plane ripe for the picking. Thus, the most common method by which a divinity claims a realm on the planes is by challenging the plane itself. The divinity selects the realm it wishes to be its own, then exerts its will upon that realm and reshapes it to suit its needs. The more closely aligned a divinity is with the plane and the type of region it has chosen, the more quickly that territory transforms into a realm suited for rule.",

Just as a divinity leaves its worshipers free to express their faith and set their own fates as they wish, it also does not oversee and police every facet of life in its realm. This means that non-worshipers, or even enemies of a faith, can travel through a deity's planar realm without fear of immediate reprisal. A paladin among a group of adventurers on a mission into {faith/Lamashtu/'s} realm in the Abyss will likely feel unwelcome and meet strong resistance from that region's denizens, but would not need to fear direct punishment from Lamashtu herself. Likewise, a devil-worshiping priest who infiltrates an enclave of azatas in {faith/Cayden Cailean/'s} realm in Elysium to chase down an escaped petitioner from the pits of Hell would not be immediately crushed by the offended god. Only in the most significant of incursions or when a divinity is directly called out or confronted will a deity or demigod take note - and even then, the most common response would be to send a powerful minion to handle the situation."
