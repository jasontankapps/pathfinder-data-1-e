Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spellcasters are more difficult to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as surely as across land."

			"A darkmantle's tentacle-span measures just under 5 feet - when attached to a cave roof and disguised as a stalactite, its length varies from 2 to 3 feet. A typical darkmantle weighs 40 pounds. The creatures' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings.",
			"",
			"The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its \"prey\" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.",
			"",
			"Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle.",
			"",
			"A darkmantle's life cycle is swift - young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a significant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds."

			"Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human - and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.",

			"Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the \"musicians at the dawn of Creation.\" Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them - the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadfly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and influence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily - though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.",
			"",
			"### Dawn Piper Choirs",
			"",
			"A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.",

Said to be the risen corpses of dogs or hyenas animated by monster-worshiping cultists, they are actually living creatures infested with symbiotic worms. Capable of tracking their prey for miles across barren terrain, death dogs surround stronger creatures, attacking and retreating, allowing their infected bites to wear down an opponent until it is too weak to fight. A pack's territory may overlap with others of its kind without competition, though in lean times packs may skirmish over live prey or carrion.",

A death dog's corpse is contagious for several days after its demise and may infect creatures that touch or eat it. Remove disease can kill a death dog's worms and remove its disease ability, but if allowed to associate with others of its kind, its quickly becomes reinfected.",

These \"death worgs\" have worms infecting their brains, driving them mad with rage.",
			"",
			"Death worgs bully their packs into submission, raid caravans and humanoid settlements, and kill more than they can eat. Most death worgs live only a year or two into adulthood, slain in needless fights for dominance or dropping dead as their worm-ravaged brains stop working."

This egg requires even more warmth than the others in its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become death worm leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to fear them as well as to hold them in awe. Death worm leviathans possess powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for them to consume prey both large and small, and a single leviathan might consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated."

			"Named for its resemblance to a 10-armed octopus, the strange decapus is one of many bizarre creatures that hail from the deepest caverns of the world. When they are encountered aboveground, their affinity for forests (they particularly enjoy clambering around in tangled canopies) suggests that their original source might be some strange, deep underground cavern wherein magical jungles grow.",
			"",
			"The decapus is a fairly intelligent creature - an ambush predator that makes excellent use of its ability to weave magical visual illusions and to imitate the voices of other creatures it has heard speaking. Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short (up to three words long) sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know.",
			"",
			"The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forest canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed.",
			"",
			"The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available - the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old - although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans.",

Spellcasters among their tribes often use illusions to hide deep merfolk dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead interlopers into distant and dangerous areas of the deep ocean. If such misdirection and illusion fail, deep merfolk don't hesitate to launch proactive attacks against intruders - at a fair distance away from their homes if possible.",
			"",
			"While their appearance has led to legends of ties to dark powers and sinister agendas, most deep merfolk are simple folk with little interest in the world above the waves.

Wild hair whips around a doru's six twisting horns, while a flat nose, a fanged mouth, and red glowing eyes complete the terrifying image of this bodiless monstrosity. Dorus almost always fly, preferring to stay at heights that keep them at the eye level of those with whom they would have dealings. When not flying, dorus roll across the ground in a disturbing manner, horns bouncing and teeth clattering as the creatures cackle and cartwheel, terrifying children and shocking the faint of heart.",
			"",
			"The least of the divs, dorus serve as messengers and servants of other divs and sometimes mortal spellcasters. While not strong combatants, dorus prefer to sow ruin in more subtle ways. They enjoy tainting mortals with exaggerated news and outright lies, trying to turn impressionable beings to waste and wickedness. Even if a doru fails to fully corrupt an intelligent being itself, it attempts to weaken the target's will, making the victim more pliable to future corruption and ruin.",
			"",
			"All divs have some manner of esoteric flaw in their personalities-dorus are obsessed with secrets. These covetous fiends hoard secrets and legends like a miser hoards gold. This thirst for information causes the curious dorus to enter into ridiculous bargains to obtain hidden knowledge from those they believe hold tales of special interest or value, especially when such information has the potential to aid in the corruption of future souls. Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double (and sometimes triple) agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most. Only the most precious and profane secrets have the potential to keep a doru faithful to a mortal master for more than a century.",
			"",
			"Serving greater divs or mortal spellcasters, divs deliver messages, most directly plucked from secret sources. Dorus' spell-like abilities make them excellent spies, granting them the ability to infiltrate, eavesdrop while invisible, and charm their way out of perilous situations. Those serving mortals pride themselves on manipulating their masters into furthering the divs' own ends. Many evil spellcasters seeking profane power and ancient evil secrets seek to take dorus as familiars. A neutral evil spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat can select a doru as a familiar.",

They represent the uncleanness of the body and corrupting forces that can prevent a creature's proper passage into the afterlife. Some scholars claim that in ancient times these creatures' interference caused numerous cultures to alter their practices regarding burial.",
			"",
			"When a druj nasu was found near a body that was to be buried, the body would be considered unclean. An unclean body couldn't be buried and the sacred flames of a funeral pyre would only spread the taint to the winds, so some ancient people would then carry the corpse up the side of a cliff or mountain and have the birds and other animals clean the flesh from the bones before the deceased could be interred with the necessary rites to ensure a proper passage into the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"Unlike other corpse thieves, druj nasus don't take the bodies of the deceased in order to feast upon the rotting flesh. The divs do this to spite the survivors and bring greater grief and sorrow to the family and loved ones of the dead. After pilfering the bodies, the divs watch from afar as the grieving family sinks deeper into sadness. They then animate the stolen remains and, since they have no innate ability to influence these creations, use their command undead spell-like ability to send the shambling corpse back to prey upon its former loved ones. In this way, druj nasus disrupt polite society and commit one of the ultimate cultural taboos.",
			"",
			"Because druj nasus, like all divs, are a scourge on humanity's accomplishments, these foul fiends are a constant target of good faiths. They are particularly hated by followers of Pharasma because of their treatment of corpses and proclivity for animating the remains they steal. Druj nasus generally ignore Pharasmins, however, and instead focus on their own mockery of the living. Because of an unknown, ancient conflict in Kelesh, druj nasus have a strong hatred for Sarenrae and her worshipers, going so far as to single them out in combat and steal away the bodies of the clergy and faithful. Sarenrae's devoted find combating these divs frustrating due to their immunity to fire.",
			"",

The divs flee from them in flight or ignore all other creatures and threats in order to kill them. Strangely, this reaction doesn't apply to supernatural dog-like creatures like hell hounds or cerberi, but they are particularly hateful toward or frightened of hound archons. Morticians and priests who are aware of the predations of these divs often keep dogs around to help ward off the fiends. Though druj nasus have no weakness against the sun, these divs tend to do their hunting at night when there are fewer watchful eyes.",
			"",
			"In combat, druj nasus use their droning ability to weaken and incapacitate their enemies, and then summon swarms of biting insects to wash over them, often doing so under the protection of invisibility. Once their foes are subjected to the distracting nature of the swarms, the div closes into melee range, taking full advantage of its swarmwalking ability. Against enemies that outnumber them or are more powerful, the divs make great use of flyby attacks, often paired with invisibility, to keep out of reach.",

			"Druj nasus make their home in Abaddon, but, like most divs, they visit the Material Plane whenever they have the chance so that they can wreck the accomplishments and creations of humankind. These divs are most plentiful in Katapesh, Kelesh, Qadira, and Thuvia, but they can be found anywhere in the world. Druj nasus favor desert climates, but they don't spend much time in the open deserts, choosing instead to stick to places where people throng and plenty of dead bodies can be found and corrupted. These divs tend to stick to the outskirts of larger settlements, typically where the burial sites are located.",
			"",
			"In regions where a druj nasu takes up residence, undead are a particular problem. These uncontrolled undead roam the countryside causing strife and danger to the area's inhabitants. These cruels divs also haunt nearby communities. They hide using their invisibility spell-like ability and spoil people's stores of food and communal water wells using their putrefy food and drink spell-like ability. For communities with large stores of food and drink, divs continuously return until the settlements are on the verge of starvation. Druj nasus also use this ability to taint holy water fonts found in temples and shrines. These divs delight in sending plagues of insects to swarm through fields and towns to harass those living nearby.",
			"",
			"Typically, druj nasus are loners, but they sometimes work in small groups to achieve a task before disbanding and going their respective ways. They are not particularly opposed to working with other divs, but when they do so they get along the best with pairakas, with whom they share a desire to spread disease and personal strife.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, ghuls frequently inhabit the same kinds of spaces that druj nasus haunt. This leads the two creatures to compete over the theft of corpses; more often than not, such conflicts are won by the divs. Since divs can tolerate the burning rays of the sun better than ghuls, these divs gain a greater advantage in successfully stealing corpses."
