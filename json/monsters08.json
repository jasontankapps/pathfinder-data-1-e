Intelligent and canny, dark young know that spellcasters are more difficult to affect with insanity, and save that spell-like ability for use against rogues, fighters, and similar foes. Flight offers no guarantee of safety from the dark young, for they can pursue their foes through the air as surely as across land."

The creatures' heads and bodies are usually the color of basalt or dark granite, but their webbed tentacles can change color to match their surroundings.",
			"",
			"The darkmantle isn't a particularly good climber, but it can cling to a cave roof like a bat, hanging by the hooks at the ends of its tentacles so that its dangling body looks nearly indistinguishable from a stalactite. In this hidden position, the darkmantle waits for prey to pass beneath, at which point it drops and swoops down to attack its victim, slamming its body against the foe and attempting to wrap its webbed tentacles around the target. If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its \"prey\" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.",
			"",
			"Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle.",
			"",
			"A darkmantle's life cycle is swift - young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a significant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds."

			"Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human - and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the \"musicians at the dawn of Creation.\" Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them - the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadfly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and influence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily - though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.",
			"",
			"### Dawn Piper Choirs",
			"",
			"A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.",
			"",
			"At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag's coven possesses. They may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the First World."

When a warm-blooded creature happens by, a deadfall dweller straightens its legs to pursue, and bellows out a spray of acidic mucus that paralyzes the victim in its tracks. The beast then advances to attack with its poisonous bite and sharp, scraping appendages.",

			"Deadfall dwellers reproduce by immobilizing prey with repeated applications of acidic spray, then implanting a clutch of eggs within the paralyzed host.

This combination makes stories of these creatures hard to confirm, and in most urban centers, common wisdom is that the tales of death worms are fabrications - attempts to impress city folk or hallucinations born of too much drink.",
			"",
			"A death worm is 15 feet long and weighs 1,200 pounds - although rumors of much larger death worms persist."

			"Sometimes a pregnant death worm lays an especially promising egg among her brood, about twice as large as the others and with a nigh-impenetrable, brownspeckled shell. This egg requires even more warmth than the others in its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become death worm leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to fear them as well as to hold them in awe. Death worm leviathans possess powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for them to consume prey both large and small, and a single leviathan might consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated."

In trap form, the ooze uses its attack bonus, but otherwise functions as the emulated trap and uses that trap's statistics and damage. If a creature searching for traps exceeds the DC to find the ooze's trap form, a successful follow-up DC 19 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check allows the creature that discovered the trap to discern its true nature.

While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass.",
			"",
			"Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other oozes - they prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks any creative ability - it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered.",
			"",
			"These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians.",
			"",
			"Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain poison. Some even claim there are oozes so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts."

Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short (up to three words long) sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know.",
			"",
			"The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forest canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed.",
			"",
			"The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available - the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old - although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans.",

			"Deep merfolk build villages along the sides of the deepest ocean trenches, where they hunt sea creatures and gather crustaceans from the ocean floor. They are capable hunters, and small hunting groups of deep merfolk have been known to take down sharks or other large creatures stalking the depths. When hunting, deep merfolk prefer to ambush their prey, often luring targets in with bioluminescence. They rely on their camouflage to hide within the crevices and cold sand until their traps can be sprung.",
			"",
			"Like their cousins, deep merfolk are highly protective of their tribes and homes and go to great lengths to keep strangers away. Spellcasters among their tribes often use illusions to hide deep merfolk dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead interlopers into distant and dangerous areas of the deep ocean. If such misdirection and illusion fail, deep merfolk don't hesitate to launch proactive attacks against intruders - at a fair distance away from their homes if possible.",
			"",
			"While their appearance has led to legends of ties to dark powers and sinister agendas, most deep merfolk are simple folk with little interest in the world above the waves. A few secretive tribes worship the demon lord Dagon, but they view him as a dark protector they must appease, not a deity to emulate or for whom they feel any affection."

At other times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious - the deep sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls.",

Such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface - both their naturally elusive natures and the remote reality of their habitats mean that ensuring the veracity of these claims requires truly extraordinary efforts.",

Disenchanters are social creatures, and often seek the companionship of other intelligent beings, making excellent mounts and trackers for treasure hunters. A typical disenchanter is 8 feet long and weighs 1,600 pounds."

Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield - or are belched up from an akvan's gullet - as blasphemous undead servants.

Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double (and sometimes triple) agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most.

			"**Swarmwalking (Su)** A druj nasu is immune to damage or distraction effects caused by swarms.",
			"",
			"**Untouched By Flame (Su)** Any undead animated by a druj nasu or any swarm summoned by this div gains the druj nasu's immunity to fire.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Foul corruptors of the dead, druj nasus are divs that haunt funeral pyres, mausoleums, and burial sites to steal corpses. They represent the uncleanness of the body and corrupting forces that can prevent a creature's proper passage into the afterlife. Some scholars claim that in ancient times these creatures' interference caused numerous cultures to alter their practices regarding burial.",
			"",
			"When a druj nasu was found near a body that was to be buried, the body would be considered unclean. An unclean body couldn't be buried and the sacred flames of a funeral pyre would only spread the taint to the winds, so some ancient people would then carry the corpse up the side of a cliff or mountain and have the birds and other animals clean the flesh from the bones before the deceased could be interred with the necessary rites to ensure a proper passage into the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"Unlike other corpse thieves, druj nasus don't take the bodies of the deceased in order to feast upon the rotting flesh. The divs do this to spite the survivors and bring greater grief and sorrow to the family and loved ones of the dead. After pilfering the bodies, the divs watch from afar as the grieving family sinks deeper into sadness. They then animate the stolen remains and, since they have no innate ability to influence these creations, use their command undead spell-like ability to send the shambling corpse back to prey upon its former loved ones. In this way, druj nasus disrupt polite society and commit one of the ultimate cultural taboos.",
			"",
			"Because druj nasus, like all divs, are a scourge on humanity's accomplishments, these foul fiends are a constant target of good faiths. They are particularly hated by followers of Pharasma because of their treatment of corpses and proclivity for animating the remains they steal. Druj nasus generally ignore Pharasmins, however, and instead focus on their own mockery of the living. Because of an unknown, ancient conflict in Kelesh, druj nasus have a strong hatred for Sarenrae and her worshipers, going so far as to single them out in combat and steal away the bodies of the clergy and faithful. Sarenrae's devoted find combating these divs frustrating due to their immunity to fire.",
			"",
			"A druj nasu stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs a slight 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"All divs have some manner of esoteric weakness, and druj nasus have a strange negative reaction to common dogs. The divs flee from them in flight or ignore all other creatures and threats in order to kill them. Strangely, this reaction doesn't apply to supernatural doglike creatures like hell hounds or cerberi, but they are particularly hateful toward or frightened of hound archons. Morticians and priests who are aware of the predations of these divs often keep dogs around to help ward off the fiends. Though druj nasus have no weakness against the sun, these divs tend to do their hunting at night when there are fewer watchful eyes.",
			"",
			"In combat, druj nasus use their droning ability to weaken and incapacitate their enemies, and then summon swarms of biting insects to wash over them, often doing so under the protection of invisibility. Once their foes are subjected to the distracting nature of the swarms, the div closes into melee range, taking full advantage of its swarmwalking ability. Against enemies that outnumber them or are more powerful, the divs make great use of flyby attacks, often paired with invisibility, to keep out of reach.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Div}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Druj nasus make their home in Abaddon, but, like most divs, they visit the Material Plane whenever they have the chance so that they can wreck the accomplishments and creations of humankind. These divs are most plentiful in Katapesh, Kelesh, Qadira, and Thuvia, but they can be found anywhere in the world. Druj nasus favor desert climates, but they don't spend much time in the open deserts, choosing instead to stick to places where people throng and plenty of dead bodies can be found and corrupted. These divs tend to stick to the outskirts of larger settlements, typically where the burial sites are located.",
			"",
			"In regions where a druj nasu takes up residence, undead are a particular problem. These uncontrolled undead roam the countryside causing strife and danger to the area's inhabitants. These cruels divs also haunt nearby communities. They hide using their invisibility spell-like ability and spoil people's stores of food and communal water wells using their putrefy food and drink spell-like ability. For communities with large stores of food and drink, divs continuously return until the settlements are on the verge of starvation. Druj nasus also use this ability to taint holy water fonts found in temples and shrines. These divs delight in sending plagues of insects to swarm through fields and towns to harass those living nearby.",
			"",
			"Typically, druj nasus are loners, but they sometimes work in small groups to achieve a task before disbanding and going their respective ways. They are not particularly opposed to working with other divs, but when they do so they get along the best with pairakas, with whom they share a desire to spread disease and personal strife.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, ghuls frequently inhabit the same kinds of spaces that druj nasus haunt. This leads the two creatures to compete over the theft of corpses; more often than not, such conflicts are won by the divs. Since divs can tolerate the burning rays of the sun better than ghuls, these divs gain a greater advantage in successfully stealing corpses."

Although a doppeldrek is normally mindless, its skill at mimicry is sufficient to reproduce intelligence. While it maintains the shape of a creature with 1 or 2 Intelligence, it gains an Intelligence score of that value. If it mimics a creature with a higher intelligence, the doppeldrek still only gains an Intelligence score of 2. When a doppeldrek gains an Intelligence score, it gains skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice, which it always places in the Disguise skill. This ability otherwise functions as normal for change shape. If the doppeldrek takes the shape of an aberration, animal, dragon, magical beast, or vermin, it gains any of the creature's abilities listed in beast shape IV. If it takes the shape of a fey, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid, it instead gains any of the creature's abilities listed in monstrous physique IV.

However, doppeldreks habitually mimic other creatures that they detect with their blindsense, taking on not only their shapes but also some of their innate abilities, and even some of their intelligence. A doppeldrek using its change shape ability believes itself to be whatever type of creature it is currently mimicking, and its behavior matches the behavior typical of that type of creature, as far as its intelligence allows. When a doppeldrek attempts to copy a creature with substantially greater intelligence, such as the average humanoid, it attempts to follow the creature around, constantly copying its behavior and making vocalizations that are too imprecise to be recognizable as speech. An isolated doppeldrek eventually reverts to its natural form.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, through exposure to potent magic or other means, a doppeldrek gains a persistent intelligence and personality, becoming an awakened doppeldrek. An awakened doppeldrek possesses an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, and can use its change shape ability to mimic an Intelligence score up to double its own. An awakened doppeldrek must still put a number of skill ranks equal to its Hit Dice in Disguise, but can allocate its other skill ranks as it sees fit each time it assumes a new form."

While not standard, it is those doppelgangers use their gifts for cruel and sadistic purposes that are most notorious, and these shapeshifters are the primary cause of the race's sinister reputation. Certainly, a creature capable of changing its shape has a handy way to avoid capture for its crimes, and some particularly malicious doppelgangers enjoy disrupting relationships by posing as unfaithful lovers.",
			"",

These doppelgangers' change shape ability functions like the spell polymorph rather than alter self."

			"A duppy is the spirit of a cruel and brutal sailor who died by violence on land, away from his ship and crew, and thus was unable to receive a proper burial at sea. While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malevolence. The appearance of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling.",
			"",
			"Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates when exacting their vengeance, inflicting great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate these spectral beings.",
			"",
			"Though a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it can't be captured by mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a magical trap are wise to keep the horror confined until the daytime, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. Some tales claim that duppies arise near the treasures they buried while they were still alive, and ambitious sailors who buy into these stories might attempt to capture a duppy. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides."

A duskwalker's nonmagical weapons deal half damage to incorporeal creatures, as if they were magic weapons, and her magic weapons can deal critical hits and precision damage, even if they do not have the ghost touch property. Once per day as a standard action, a duskwalker can focus her natural revulsion toward undead.

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Duskwalkers are tall, bipedal, gray-skinned beings with a connection to Pharasma's Boneyard. They manifest directly on the Material Plane, incarnating from souls that have earned the honor of a second life. The souls that become duskwalkers have often distinguished themselves in the eyes of psychopomps as guardians of the cycle of birth and death. Other than their gray skin, their physical features bear some resemblance to those they held in their previous lives. As such, a typical duskwalker looks mostly human, other than her unusual coloration. However, duskwalkers whose ancestors belonged to other races can manifest with characteristic features such as pointed ears, hairy feet, or even feathers, horns, scales, or tails - though they rarely manifest smaller or larger than Medium.",
			"",
			"The first duskwalkers appeared as the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps: an olethros mother and a yamaraj. The olethros mother made the case to allow certain souls whose actions helped preserve and protect the cycle of souls, but whose lives had been cut short of what fate had decreed for them to reincarnate once before passing to their final judgment. After a long debate, the yamaraj agreed but imposed a strict limit on the number of duskwalkers that can exist at one time. Whenever this limit has been reached, dead duskwalkers cannot be restored to life. Most duskwalkers accept this limitation and appreciate that the end of their lives opens the door for new lives to begin. Some request that those mourning their deaths also celebrate the birth of a new duskwalker in the near future. The length of time it takes for a new duskwalker to be born when one dies varies, but is rarely more than a year.",
			"",
			"When a duskwalker is born, she appears spontaneously in a sanctified place with a connection to death, most often a graveyard or a temple. Duskwalkers do not experience infancy, instead beginning their lives with the appearance and facilities of a roughly 8-year-old human child. These mysterious children always appear cloaked in simple white robes, with a small satchel of food and water by their sides. Duskwalker children mature at a variable rate depending upon the support they receive. A child adopted into a nurturing family or taken into care at a temple matures at a rate similar to that of a human child and develops a healthy balance between her appreciation for life and her interest in death. While duskwalker children almost always appear near settlements, the unusual circumstances of their creation sometimes lead them to be ostracized to the point where they are forced to fend for themselves. Duskwalker children who endure such circumstances reach physical and intellectual maturity rapidly, but they struggle socially and emotionally.",
			"",
			"Duskwalker naming conventions are varied. Many duskwalkers prefer to select their own names shortly after they manifest. Duskwalkers who have a good relationship with their surrounding community choose names that follow that community's traditions. Isolated duskwalkers make up their own conventions, naming themselves after their accomplishments or values or even just selecting a string of syllables that sounds nice to them.",
			"",
			"The role of duskwalkers has changed somewhat since the beginning of the Age of Lost Omens, when prophecy failed. Prior to that time, only souls that were destined to perform roles that would serve the Boneyard's interests would be reincarnated as duskwalkers. With prophecy in disarray, however, duskwalkers began to shape their own fates. Some duskwalkers receive occasional visitations or messages from psychopomps, intended to steer them toward certain tasks, but they are under no obligation to follow this guidance. Still, because of their origins, most duskwalkers have an innate respect for the cycles of birth and death. They tend to gravitate toward positions and occupations that allow them to protect this cycle, such as hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.",
			"",
			"Because duskwalkers are so rare, the few duskwalker communities that exist are small and form mostly among individuals united by a common goal, such as adventuring bands of undead-hunters. Many duskwalkers go their entire lives without meeting another member of their race. Instead, they usually live among whichever races are most common near the graveyards in which they manifested. Duskwalkers meet with mixed reactions from human communities. Some people look askance at their ashen appearance and the manner of their creation. Others find the way in which duskwalkers relate to death unsettling. Duskwalkers struggle to understand the fear and hesitance with which most other races speak of death, and even cheerful duskwalkers tend toward dark and morbid senses of humor. However, other communities value or even revere duskwalkers for their wisdom, skill at medicine, and proficiency at fighting undead. Duskwalkers get along particularly well with members of other races that share a planar heritage, such as aasimars, aphorites, ganzis, and tieflings, but they share a mutual distrust with dhampirs.",
			"",
			"Despite the prejudices they sometimes face, duskwalkers are typically companionable, open-minded, and accepting of people. They seek friendships and romantic relationships with others of many different races. Many duskwalkers seek to build a family with children at some point in their lives. They grow their families by adopting children from their communities, with a particular preference toward children that other prospective parents may look over. Most have no interest in sexual relationships, though, and no duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological children.",
			"",
			"Duskwalkers are typically neutral in their alignment, like psychopomps themselves. Those who are not neutrally aligned tend toward good alignments over evil ones. Pharasma is the most popular deity among duskwalkers, but Sarenrae and the empyreal lord Ashava also command sizable followings. Members of a growing contingent of evil duskwalkers have been rejecting their inborn nature entirely, throwing in their lot with the sahkils, who delight in such perversion. These duskwalkers can lose the abilities that help them combat undead and gain powers better suited to inflicting fear, but such choices also have a chance of altering their ward against corruption in a particularly unsettling way. Such duskwalkers inevitably find that not only can they become undead, but that their deaths all but guarantee some form of unnatural unlife after death, often coming back as a ghost without such an entity's classic inability to travel far from the place of its death."

			"**Sinkhole (Ex)** A dust digger can burrow into sand, loose soil, or dirt to lie in ambush just under the surface. When it feels (via tremorsense) prey walk into a square it threatens, it can deflate its body as an immediate action, causing the sand and other loose soil above to shift and slide. All creatures who were standing in the dust digger's reach must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled as long as they remain in the dust digger's reach. All creatures who were standing at least partially in the dust digger's actual space must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled and fall prone - if such a creature makes this save, it immediately moves to the closest adjacent unoccupied square. If this results in more than a 5-foot move, the creature moves that distance and then falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.",

			"Dust diggers most resemble mammoth starfish, with thick sandy-colored exoskeletons covered with rough, burr-like spines. Its five arms are long and thin, and covered with hundreds of barbed, tubular cilia that the creature uses to move as well at grab and grapple prey. At the fleshy center of the creature's body gapes a circular maw lined with large sharp teeth.",
			"",
			"As ambush predators, dust diggers spend the majority of their lives buried beneath the sand, waiting patiently for prey to stumble over their ambush site.",
			"",
			"Dust diggers are asexual. They reproduce by budding, splitting off young three to four times over the course of their 10-year lives-smaller versions of themselves that must immediately move away from the parent to avoid being snatched up and eaten. Dust digger young are just over 4 feet across, and can move relatively quickly through sand (their burrow speed is 40 feet). Usually, a young dust digger travels at least a mile from its parent before it settles down to create its first ambush - the amount of life in the region it has chosen as its new lair often determines whether the new dust digger thrives or starves to death, for once it digs its first ambush, it rarely moves more than a few hundred feet away over the course of its life."
