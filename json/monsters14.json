Most huldras wear their hair long to mask the hole in their backs, and they prefer long gowns to hide their tails when interacting with humanoids. Though huldras are not ashamed of their status as fey, they react rather negatively when someone points out their tails.

			"In the nightmare dimensions of unreality beyond space and time, the power of alien Gods is sufficient to give life to intention. Hunduns are the incarnation of the desire to reduce the multiverse to a space filled with nothing but randomly fluctuating energy fields and gravitic curvatures. Hunduns are primordial alien monks who embody aspects of the gaping, formless void that preceded the creation of the multiverse. They are out of step with reality, which accommodates their individual existences as intractable errors that must be continually accounted for yet that can never fully be corrected. These bizarre aberrations of life are sustained by negative energy - life's antithetical force - yet they are not undead, nor do they differentiate between the living and the unliving in the pursuit of their purpose. Few beings can exist on the Negative Energy Plane for long, making the hunduns, who often make their homes there, something of an anomaly. Some scholars speculate that early hunduns came to the Negative Energy Plane as explorers, and remained there, addicted to the mixture of pain and euphoric release caused by the effects of negative energy on their skin.",

			"Hunduns are tireless antagonists of archons, asuras, axiomites, devils, inevitables, kytons, and other exemplars of law. They oppose any effort to impose or maintain discipline, structure, or regulation. They loathe and undermine the prospect of peace or tranquility, and relish confusion, disorder, and destruction. Though these attitudes would seem to make them ideological allies of the proteans, hunduns hold those creatures in contempt, caring nothing for that race's strange religion, nor the spontaneous, ephemeral acts of creation in which proteans delight. Hunduns believe that the freedom and truth of pure entropy are preferable to the artificial illusions of structure, and they seek to spread this brand of enlightenment to others as part of their goal to free all creation from order's fetters.",
			"",
			"Hunduns appear as gigantic humanoids with faces hidden by voluminous, hooded robes made out of their own wrinkled skin. In truth, their faces are not hidden, for they are faceless; the interiors of their hoods are just filled with more folds of skin. They carry staff-like objects known as strange attractors, which appear as different things to different observers but always as something that causes some form of revulsion or nausea: a shaft of knotted intestines and vital organs, studded with colored, weeping eyes; a polished metallic rod on which distorted reflections of the observer indulge in extreme self-harm; a column of darkness in which worlds spiral toward a black heart that snuffs out the life on them. These implements are not artificial objects, but part of a hundun's body. As well as being weapons and snares, they are methods of reproduction. Two hunduns can bring their strange attractors together, causing them to merge into an egg-shaped object under the control of one of the parents; the other parent must create a new strange attractor. This ovoid is still a strange attractor in all respects save for its shape, but if it is moved, the development of the embryonic hundun within must begin anew. The gestation of the new hundun takes many years. When the egg hatches, the strange attractor is destroyed and a fully formed hundun emerges. Reproduction between hunduns doesn't involve any sort of love or even affection. Rather, the two hunduns feel a premonition that another hundun will be needed to fight order in the future, then meet and breed wordlessly.",
			"",
			"Hunduns can be found floating in the Negative Energy Plane or within stable voids in the planes of chaos, meditating on ways to corrupt universal truths and undermine the laws of nature on a cosmic scale-anything they can exploit to trigger the collapse and implosion of entire dimensions or planes of existence. Though they spend the majority of their time in solitary contemplation or action, hunduns sometimes gather to oppose forms of creation or manifestations of law that require greater numbers to counteract. The creatures come together spontaneously, drawn by an innate sensitivity to the structuring forces that operate on reality.",

Many hunting horrors take to the creation of magic items, but they are unconcerned with scaling their magical devices for other users, which reduces their utility for smaller creatures. A hunting horror that focuses on item creation generally replaces its Combat Casting feat with {feat/Craft Wondrous Item}.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"As with many of the monsters that have come to be associated with the Cthulhu Mythos, like the byakhee, the dark young of Shub-Niggurath, and the gnoph-keh, the hunting horror's original incarnation in fiction was as a vague fragment and a few evocative words. Sandy Petersen ran with these scraps when creating the bestiary section for the Call of Cthulhu RPG, and fully fleshed out the hunting horror into an iconic monster in its own right."

Despite their large size, hyaleth can swim and hide in surprisingly shallow waters, allowing them to remain undetected while approaching their prey. Once it closes in on a target, a hyaleth uses its stinger to deliver a paralyzing neurotoxin before engulfing its victim within its elastic body.

Some hyaleths are tasked with caring for the eggs, while others defend the colony or gather food and knowledge for their queen.",

Hyaleths simply digest any unintelligent or dim-witted creatures they engulf, but they place intelligent creatures into a deep sleep, reading the victim's thoughts as it falls into slumber. A hyaleth derives great pleasure from drawing out this knowledge, and it subtly changes color while doing so, its transparent body rippling through several hues in delight. When a hyaleth identifies and engulfs a creature with exceptional intelligence, it returns to the deep to deliver the victim to a gigantic hyaleth queen.",

A hyaleth queen can engulf Large or smaller creatures and can automatically engulf sleeping or helpless creatures expelled by an adjacent hyaleth. A hyaleth queen can selectively apply either option of its adaptive digestion ability to each creature it has engulfed, judging whether each can add to its eclectic store of knowledge or is suitable only as nourishment."

These beings dwelt in Ib for ages, worshiping their deity Bokrug and performing their own curious rites and rituals until they were slaughtered by humans who were disturbed by the creatures' strange appearances and frightening deity. One thousand years later, the ghosts of this slaughtered race rose from the waters of that lake and descended upon the human city of Sarnath, bringing with them a terrible doom that brought death to all and wiped the mighty metropolis from existence, leaving only a swampy shoreline in its wake with the rising of the next sun.",

But being born from nightmares, ikeloses see such direct tactics as inelegant, and take pride in creative plans that slowly drive their victims mad. As a few surviving victims remember from the monster's taunts, ikeloses claim that fear tastes better when it has time to ripen. When an ikelos is threatened, it doesn't hesitate to unleash its aura of lethargy and viciously claw apart whoever stands in its way.",
			"",
			"Ikeloses usually prey on insomniacs, those most prone to weariness and paranoia. In a pinch, they drift around invisibly during the day, searching for anxious individuals to target. They prefer to torment prey with alien whispers and intrusive thoughts - which become increasingly diffficult to dismiss as days pass into weeks - before revealing their true forms. Many ikeloses dislike that diviners can grant themselves and others the ability to see them, and target these spellcasters out of spite. Magic that pierces invisibility reveals ikeloses but, as with fatigue, makes the viewer more susceptible to ikeloses's malignancies.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ikeloses exist wherever sentient creatures dream, especially poor urban areas where hopes die and anxieties run high. Though they don't need to sleep, ikeloses become torpid during the day, anticipating their nocturnal games.",
			"",
			"An ikelos's alien mind is ever turned toward finding suitable prey and devising new and unexpected ways to horrify. Typically loners, ikeloses sometimes form packs-not for companionship, but to aid in their hunting. Like a wolf pack, ikeloses surround their prey, increasing the chance that the victim will be paralyzed or unable to flee. Interactions between such ikeloses are usually contests of dominance. While food and mating are of no concern to these creatures, the dominant ikelos makes most of the decisions for the group; ikeloses crave autonomy as much as any living thing hungers or lusts. Acts of deviousness and depravity are the usual measure of standing. Knowing it can't heal in a normal fashion, an ikelos almost always avoids committing violence against others of its kind, unless it can do so without anticipation of reprisal.",
			"",
			"Ikeloses don't interact with living creatures except to harvest their fear. Even were they not often invisible and intangible to most beings, they have little desire to socialize with creatures they consider food. However, as parasites, they can be found living invisibly amid all manner of creatures. An ikelos might seek to defend its \"cattle\" from other predators - whether monsters preying on its human stock or adventurers slaying its hobgoblin victims - or else seek to harvest a new source of fear. Creatures who are immune to fear cannot sustain an ikelos's unnatural existence, and thus hold little interest for these stalkers.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, ikeloses encounter creatures similar to themselves, such as house-haunting undead or soulharvesting night hags, and choose to form temporary alliances. Such a creature might complement the ikelos's abilities, and an ikelos has no use for its victim's bodies or souls. However, such alliances can prove tenuous and dangerous for both sides. Perhaps the creature most similar to an ikelos is an animate dream. While animate dreams are non-specific fragments of a single dream, ikeloses are specific figures that build up strength across multiple dreams. Ikeloses and animate dreams each believe themselves to be superior manifestations, and when an ikelos and an animate dream set their sights on the same prey, the conflict typically ends in violent confrontation."

It is believed that an evil shaman summoned the first impundulu and that using an ancient, taboo ritual, the two formed a blood pact. The shaman offered the impundulu the ability to wear his mortal flesh in exchange for mastery over the demon's significant occult powers. As soon as the impundulu seized control of the shaman's body, it broke the pact; however, the ancient ritual bound the fiend to the mortal form, and even after the shaman perished, it could not shed its flesh. Thus despite its own immortality, the impundulu became forever tied to the realm of mortals.

			"**Puppetmaster (Su)** As a full-round action, an incutilis can drive its lesser tendrils into any helpless Small or Medium creature occupying the same square and pump the victim full of poison and chemicals. The victim is killed instantly, and becomes a zombie-like creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie isn't treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that affect only undead (including damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie - typically by the head - occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie. Area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.",

Though most incutilises live their entire lives within the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between water and land, taking terrible control over land-dwelling flesh with an alien disregard for sentient life. Because of their aquatic physiologies, their ability to cross this border and travel on land is limited. These aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore.",

Their favorite foods seem to be larger sea creatures - sharks, whales, and sentient ocean dwellers - and they make no distinction between the living and the dead. Incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators. When one is on land and its zombie puppet is destroyed, it attempts to flee to the nearest body of water.",

Once the target succumbs to the incutilis lord's will (see the calcifying sting ability, below), the target's whole body is infused with new secretions that allow the incutilis lord to dictate the target's actions and restore any Dexterity lost to the calcifying sting, as the secretions assist the minion's movement rather than hindering it. The incutilis lord can control a number of minions equal to its Charisma modifier as a free action. If the incutilis lord attempts to control a new minion in excess of this limit, it must first release one of its current calcified minions; see the calcifying sting ability, below. The minions have no will of their own but retain a small portion of their identity, giving the incutilis lord access to their feats, physical skills, extraordinary abilities, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A calcified creature moves under the direct control of its incutilis lord until the stinger is removed from its body. While under the incutilis lord's control, a calcified minion takes its own normal actions each round, as directed by its controller. A minion can survive this process for a number of days equal to its Constitution score. After this time, the calcified minion dies, though its body retains a semblance of life. The dead minion is treated as a living creature and can be controlled in the same fashion as before until the calcifying stinger is removed or the incutilis lord that controls the creature dies.",

A creature stung by an incutilis lord must attempt a DC 19 Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of every turn until the stinger is removed. Each time it fails this save, the creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity drain. If this causes the creature to reach 0 or fewer hit points or a Dexterity score of 0, it loses all will of its own and immediately comes under the control of the incutilis lord (see the calcified minion ability, above). As a swift action, the incutilis lord can psychically command one of its stingers to remove itself from a stung creature, releasing its control over that creature. Another creature can forcefully remove a stinger from a willing or unconscious target by a succeeding at a DC 19 Heal check. Regardless of whether this Heal check succeeds or fails, attempting to remove the stinger deals 1d8 points of damage to the target. If the stinger is removed or the incutilis lord dies, the fluid seeps out of the controlled creature's wounds and the creature is released from the incutilis lord's control - though the creature may be dead by that time. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Unlike the mindless zombies that serve a more common incutilis, an incutilis lord's servitors retain muscle memory and a grasp of their magical abilities. An incutilis lord can survive for decades by feeding on the body and psyche of a single Medium-sized victim, but rarely settles for having only one minion to manipulate or feed upon.",

			"In times of need, the taiga giants of Varisia turn to the spirits of their ancestors for aid, relying on signs and omens from the spirit world to guide them out of danger. Yet sometimes the power and insight of these ancestral spirits is not enough. When invaders overhunt the land, when disease and pestilence run rampant, or when war and slavery threaten to decimate whole tribes, some giants seek a different sort of aid - one that comes at a far higher price. High above the snow line, trapped within ancient glacial floes, the indarugants wait to be unleashed so they might once again bring disaster and ruin to the enemies of their tribes.",
			"",
			"Most indarugants resemble the desiccated corpses of taiga giants, though other types of giants may become indarugants as well. After taiga giants, stone giants are the most likely to follow through with this ritual, though by doing so they risk being shunned by neighboring tribes.",
			"",
			"Indarugants stand 20 feet tall, but weigh only 3,000 pounds due to the lack of water in their shriveled, skeletal bodies. The ritual that creates an indarugant involves marking and maiming the body of the candidate, and many still bear these fading tattoos and ancient scars.",
			"",
			"Indarugants are remarkable among corporeal undead in that they can't be created from a deceased creature's corpse - a creature must be alive and willing to be transformed into an indarugant. This process usually begins with a pilgrimage of a group of taiga giants into the icy mountains. The tribe's shaman or chieftain accompanies the candidate in order to perform the profane rituals necessary for the transformation. Once above the snow line, the candidate is subjected to a week-long ritual designed to sever its connection to the spirits of its ancestors, the intent being that the future indarugant can do whatever must be done to protect the tribe without fear of offending the spirits or bringing dishonor to the tribe. At the ritual's conclusion, the candidate is killed with a single blow to the head, then buried in the ice and snow along with the weapons and tools it will use once it rises as an indarugant. How long it takes the indarugant to rise varies - some rise as early as the following evening, while others remain in the ice for months or even years.",
			"",
			"Not all giants who agree to undergo the transformation successfully complete their promise. Many lose their gall at the ritual's outset and attempt to escape back down the mountain to safety. Those who flee are hunted ruthlessly by their fellow pilgrims and the rest of the tribe, who fear offending the spirits. If possible, such escapees are captured alive and brought back to the frozen heights to undergo the ritual at spear point. This forced ritual does not produce an indarugant, but serves as a deterrent to those who would think to renege on their commitments in the future.",
			"",
			"Some tribal leaders claim that those who successfully escape their promise to serve as an indarugant are cursed. They say that these traitors to their people transform into even more grotesque and sinister creatures, though no evidence of such monsters exists - these claims are widely thought to be a scare tactic to elicit compliance.",
			"",
			"Those that successfully undergo the transformation come back changed. They are no longer constrained by moral concerns such as honor, fear, or mercy. Indarugants are capable of committing any act, no matter how taboo, so long as it furthers the interests of the tribe and its people. They treat their foes with such brutality that even the most wicked of giants cringe at the sight.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Indarugants reside high in the mountains of Varisia, in places where the snow never melts. They hide themselves away in glacial caves, deep foreboding crevasses, and other secluded chasms where only those initiated into the secrets of their creation will know to find them. In times of need, a giant shaman or oracle will journey to the hidden places, braving the dangers of the cold and high elevation in order to beseech the indarugants for aid. Usually this aid comes in the form of exacting violence against the tribe's enemies, as indarugants are powerful warriors and cunning strategists. Rarely, an especially evil or desperate tribe may entreat an indarugant to serve as its chief or shaman, though usually only for a limited period of time, and only when the tribe is leaderless and under dire threat.",
			"",
			"Whatever form the indarugant's aid takes, it comes at a steep price. A giant who would petition an indarugant for aid must first swear a profane pact with the creature to someday undergo the transformation and become an indarugant itself. Once the indarugant has accomplished its agreed-upon task, it will lead the petitioner back up the mountain to its desolate home, and perform the necessary rituals to add the petitioner to the ranks of the undead. This serves both as a deterrent to keep the giants from calling on the indarugants too readily, and as a way to ensure the indarugant population grows along with the tribe. In this way, the tribes of giants will always have guardians waiting for them in the high ice, ready to defend them against any threat.",
			"",
			"Scholars of giant lore claim that all the races of giants once buried their dead in this manner, or at least created indarugants through similar rituals, if they did not live in icy climates. In Varisia, this changed during the Age of Legend, when the runelords of Azlant enslaved the giants and bent them to their sinister will. Those giants who fought back against the runelords called upon the might of their undying ancestors, sending legions of indarugants down into the plains to defend the giant tribes. Though the undead guardians fought fiercely, they were unable to stand against the might of Thassilon, and all were eventually destroyed. Since that time, only the taiga giants, who largely escaped slavery, continue the practice of creating indarugants. This may not be true for much longer, however, as reports of stone and frost giants burying their dead in the high ice now grow ever more common."

At its core, a hykariut views mortals as conflicted creatures with unpredictable moods that require regulation. Hence, the inevitables usually approach small-scale revolts with the firm but gentle hand of a scolding adult. Ongoing revolution, particularly that led by one or more demagogues, earns less mercy. A hykariut has no compunctions against publicly pulverizing a mutinous leader as an object lesson in civic obedience for wide-eyed onlookers.",

In a typical case, the impariut offers the ruler its ongoing assistance as an advisor to help steer the leader back to a proper path. However, if at any point the inevitable ascertains that the ruler is beyond redemption, it is empowered to execute the head of state and shepherd the best suitable replacement.

In rare cases in which corruption is widespread, an impariut might gather a local council of lesser leaders to establish a new government in as peaceful a way as possible. The only taboo for impariuts is that each avoids directly intervening in any nations it ruled during its mortal life.

Other inevitables or lawful outsiders usually neutralize these malfunctioning impariuts swiftly. To minimize these transgressions, senior inevitables encourage impariuts to return to the Eternal City between assignments. There these inevitables can bask in the perfect orderliness, grounding themselves and mentally preparing to guide another generation of imperfect nobles. Impariuts between assignments share information freely, evaluating and circulating the most effective leadership techniques, disciplinary tactics, and methods of avoiding any unintended consequences of their intervention.",

			"Many know how the axiomites, entities of pure law who dwell in the Eternal City of Axis, forged the first and greatest of the inevitables-living constructs to wage war against the proteans and the unbridled chaos of the Maelstrom. Yet, even as the laws governing the multiverse have been altered over time, so too has the role of the inevitables changed. Beyond defending Axis's borders, inevitables were tasked with seeking out threats to the order of all things. To fulfill these missions, the axiomites created many more types of inevitables. Among the lesser known are the kastamuts, charged with protecting the traditions of cultures spread across the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"Like kolyaruts, kastamuts are humanoid in shape. However, kastamuts are shorter and stockier, giving the appearance of a dwarf - or an artistic impression of a dwarf - crafted in flowing curves and planes from dark bronze or gold-tinged steel. Unlike kolyaruts, kastamuts make no effort to disguise their identities when dealing with mortals. Depending on how long a kastamut has been in service, dents or cracks may mar its metallic shell, evidence of past battles against rebels and renegades.",

			"",
			"Kastamuts represent the powerfully conservative forces of tradition and custom at the core of most well-defined civilizations. They oppose sudden, radical changes in the course of a culture's traditions, and work to prevent the destruction of established belief systems, rites, and social customs. While some kastamuts carry out this task by protecting a society's heritage sites, most work directly against agents of change-internal or external-that threaten a civilization.",
			"",
			"Kastamuts do not waste time or energy on small infractions against tradition. A petulant child resisting his parent's teachings draws no attention from Axis. Even fundamental shifts in the beliefs shared by a large group of people are allowed, so long as they progress along the lines of a normal cultural development. What kastamuts do work against are immediate, substantial changes, such as when a new ruler outlaws a nation's long-standing religion and seeks to wipe out all practice of the old faith in favor of a new one, especially if the new religion has no precedent. Turning slowly from old ways to new ones can be part of the natural order, but violently rebelling against traditional practices in favor of untested systems gives rise to chaos, which the powers of Axis cannot abide.",
			"",
			"Some scholars speculate that a kastamut's appearance reflects the level of importance tradition has within dwarven society.

Each is subject solely to those commands given by the Transcendental Council of the Defined Infinite, also known as the Godmind of Axis, or its direct representatives.",
			"",
			"Dwarves are the most likely to have dealings with kastamuts, as they take their traditions much more seriously than most other races. Dwarves' long lifespans mean that any changes in custom that do take place usually happen very slowly, but they are more prone to violent upheavals than elves, increasing the chances that a kastamut will get involved in order to prevent things from changing too much at once.",
			"",
			"Kastamuts find human civilization vexing. Humans' comparatively short lifespans and their tendency toward individualism create countless variations of culture and tradition and introduce the high probability of sudden and radical change. Only human civilizations that manage to survive 20 or more generations seem to acquire the metaphysical depth necessary to gain the Godmind's attention.",
			"",
			"Since their missions on the Material Plane focus on preserving cultural traditions, kastamuts spend most of their time around centers of civilization. Aside from dwarven population centers like Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Kalsgard, kastamuts have been known to be active in Taldor, Osirion, Vudra, and even Geb and Tian Xia.",
			"",
			"This does not mean, however, that kastamuts are never encountered in the wilderness. In fact, many of the cultures in the greatest danger of being subverted or destroyed are found in the wilds. A few of these inevitables are believed to operate in the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, working against those Chelish colonists seeking to quell resistance by the region's indigenous population. [Pathfinder Society](rule/aff_scholars) reports also indicate that at least one kastamut haunts the western border of Irrisen, working against white witches and their minions who attempt to eliminate the many Ulfen tribes that dwell there. At the same time, kastamuts have also appeared in Irrisen and Nidal to oppose rebels seeking to undermine the cultural status quo."

Where a human would have legs, it instead possesses a complex orb of spinning rings similar in shape to an orrery - it is this whirling machine that grants the lhaksharut the ability to fly. Though a lhaksharut has huge, metal wings, they serve as little more than stabilizers when it's in flight. Four of the construct's arms end in functional hands that it normally uses to carry a mix of weapons. The lhaksharut's lower two arms hold large, flaming metal spheres in their hands - it uses these spheres to generate elemental bolts of energy that it can hurl great distances to damage foes.",
			"",
			"Lhaksharuts are tasked with maintaining the separation between different planes of reality, especially the elemental planes. They do not concern themselves with petty trespasses by visitors from one plane to another, nor even the occasional creation of a pocket plane or hijacking of a chunk of one reality to serve as a base within another. What does trouble a lhaksharut is anything that represents a permanent link between planes, or an effort by the denizens of one plane to invade and conquer another. They often find themselves in conflict with the machinations of powerful outsiders who seek to create beachheads on other planes to serve as launching pads for massive incursions.",
			"",
			"When possible, a lhaksharut enforces the separation of planes through the simple expedient of smashing any device that creates a dangerous breach, or killing any creature that seems determined to mix or blend realities. The inevitable does not care why such infractions occur, and is often deaf to any excuse suggesting even a temporary linking of planes is a good idea. However, while singled-mined, a lhaksharut is not mindless or incapable of reason. They are emotionless, but can be negotiated with if a problem cannot be solved by smashing and killing violators.",
			"",
			"Rarely, a lhaksharut can even be convinced that maintaining a planar link is important enough to let the gate stand, if only temporarily. In such cases, the lhaksharut always volunteers to guard the portal until the time comes to shut it down. These arrangements must include a detailed explanation on how a desired course of action will directly lead to meeting the lhaksharut's goal. Only when facing the most overwhelmingly powerful foe does a lhaksharut agree to assist in a task not related to its primary function, and then only to win allies to help it achieve success in an area where the lhaksharut has already met with failure. Even if convinced to undertake such an alliance, a lhaksharut is likely to insist its mission be accomplished first. A creature of pure order, a lhaksharut is incapable of defaulting on a promise made in good faith, but it is aware that not all creatures are so bound. If for some reason the needs of its allies must be put first, a lhaksharut insists on guarantees that its allies will meet their commitments to it once they have what they want.",
			"",
			"In combat, a lhaksharut uses its speed and mobility to get close to targets. A lhaksharut sees groups as imperfect machines, and knows that the best way to overcome them is to disrupt their smooth functioning. While creatures able to directly harm the inevitable are dealt with if necessary, it much prefers to first eliminate healers, scouts, and shield-bearers before tackling powerful fighters or spellcasters. A lhaksharut cannot be taunted or baited into changing its course of action - it is completely emotionless and only cares about the efficiency of its battle plan. It also fights without care for its own survival, trusting that either its regeneration will restore it to life, or a new inevitable will be created to replace it.",
			"",
			"When unaware of a threat to the sanctity of the division of the planes, and not threatened, a lhaksharut can be a surprisingly good conversationalist. They are as likely to be found floating through a void as maintaining any kind of stronghold. Lhaksharuts are aware that the domains they wish to patrol are too vast to be directly viewed with any efficiency. Some lhaksharuts thus forge networks of informants who can patrol the many planes, and send word to the inevitable to alert it of any apparent breaches. The constructs have no other need for the treasure that they gather from transgressors, and sometimes even pay for tips that might lead to a planar infraction. Anyone who might prove to be a valuable informant is treated with respect, and may even be able to gain insights into the planes from the lhaksharut's vast knowledge on the subject, as long as questions never wander into the dangerous territory of combining two planes.",

They are often knowledgeable about the Great Old Ones and the Dominion of the Black, as their missions take them into conflict with these entities on a regular basis.

Three identical faces surround a yarahkut's head, staring impassively in separate directions with glowing golden eyes. Of its two sets of arms, one set bears claws for combat, while the remaining set is more humanoid and is used to manipulate objects - including those items it confiscates. A yarahkut stands 11 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.",

			"These inevitables scour the planes for those in possession of items beyond their ability to control - or more accurately, beyond what the yarahkuts believe they can control - and ensure that such items do not remain in unsafe hands for long. Each yarahkut has jurisdiction over a specific territory and monitors its region for such trespasses, tracking any new piece of technology or major magical item that enters its assigned area. If an item is determined to be a threat, the yarahkut pursues its retrieval or destruction without reservation.",
			"",
			"A yarahkut's distinctive wings are for more than just flight; the inevitable has remarkable control over these mechanical appendages. The wings are just as sharp and dangerous as its razorlike claws, and double as weapons in combat. The grace with which yarahkuts use their wings awes members of many primitive cultures, who often mistake these inevitables for celestials. Only those familiar with the nature of yarahkuts understand that their wings are weapons first, and a mode of transportation second.",

While all inevitables know that if they're destroyed, replacements will simply emerge from the forges of Axis to continue their work, yarahkuts understand that their destruction would extend the time that significantly advanced items are allowed to contaminate their assigned territories.

Just by scrutinizing an item, a yarahkut is capable of disassembling it in a manner of moments, to the dismay of those who wield dangerous items against the inevitable. Yarahkuts also exude an aura that tampers with nearby mechanical items. This aura causes mechanical weapons such as crossbows and firearms to become misaligned and misfire, and can affect even advanced technology such as laser weapons.",
			"",
			"Once a yarahkut has tracked its quarry, it uses its innate arcane sight to identify any threats that require disposal and unceremoniously relieves the target of these items. Once the transgressor has had its dangerous possessions removed, the yarahkut uses its mind-affecting abilities to strip relevant memories from the target. If the target has expert knowledge of technology or has been exposed to dangerous items for long periods of time - such as a gun maker in a primitive land or an engineer who built a weapon that could instantly destroy millions - the inevitable resorts to a thorough memory wipe or simple execution.",

Whenever possible, yarahkuts attempt to stay removed from the mundane affairs of the material world, running their networks through intermediaries and sending agents to investigate dangerous items before committing to a mission themselves. Those in service to a yarahkut rarely realize the true nature of their benefactor, whose identity is disguised by the inevitable's heightened ability to understand and adapt to other cultures. After reviewing the intelligence gathered by their agents, yarahkuts begin planning their retrieval missions. They are meticulous creatures, and attempt to plan for as many contingencies as possible to ensure success.",
			"",
			"As they lack innate means of traveling the planes, yarahkuts may seek aid in arriving at the location of this wayward technology - including help from mortal spellcasters who summon them. Some conjurers seeking to bind a yarahkut tempt it with information about dangerous or prohibited technology being used in the inevitable's jurisdiction. Most conjurers fail to realize, though, that the yarahkut often already knows of the dangerous technology, word of which likely trickled through its established network of informants long ago; the yarahkut had counted on being summoned so it could pursue the item itself.",
			"",
			"In rare circumstances, yarahkuts form alliances with others of their kind. These alliances most often occur in response to the distribution of a large cache of volatile items across overlapping yarahkut jurisdictions, or the unearthing of dangerous artifacts with immediate repercussions for a large region.",
			"",
			"Sometimes yarahkuts seek out other types of inevitables when the need arises. For example, a situation in which a powerful undead creature has discovered a lost army of robots may prompt an alliance of convenience with a marut. If a bargain was broken regarding powerful technology, a yarahkut might instead align with a kolyarut, while a death-marked exile from Numeria bringing stolen items to other nations might necessitate working with a zelekhut in order to track the renegade down."

Needless to say, few inverted giants tried their masters' patience again, and the unimaginable pain they suffered throughout the rest of their days served as a maddening punishment that would remind them of their insolence until their merciful deaths.",

Those who find themselves exploring Thassilonian dungeons and ruins sometimes stumble upon such horrors, inadvertently releasing the monsters and restoring them to raging life and madness, the pain of their mutilated bodies having long since driven them to insanity and burning hatred.",

Their moist, splotched bodies are marked with runes, and their muscles and bones are often visible through their translucent flesh.",

Due to their constant battles over ethos, these two aspects were considered to be entirely different species, until a Fate was observed bursting open and releasing a Fortune from within its body. Further study confirmed that Fortunes can likewise become more rigid in outlook and transform into Fates.

Fate iriis believe that both the past and future are set in stone, and consider anything that attempts to change either to be world-threatening meddling; they help prophecies and destinies come to pass and harry those who would alter history. Fortune iriis delight in destroying predetermined events as well as subtly modifying those that have past, splicing portions of alternate histories into the timeline to replace events that have been rendered impossible by temporal tampering. All iriis work to preserve the timestream, however; though Fates and Fortunes disagree on how elastic time is, they both agree that it should flow smoothly from prior actions into future consequences. As such, they always band together to defend the timeline from events and powers that could devour the past, erase the future, or destroy the integrity of time itself, shattering existence into an endless series of temporal paradoxes.",
