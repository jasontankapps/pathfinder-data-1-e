			"This gremlin's head and pointed ears are overlarge compared to the rest of its anatomy. Thin, often matted hair tops a drexin's scalp.

			"",
			"Many gremlins believe that drexins were once nuglubs or jinkins who strayed too far underground. It's thought that after wandering into the twisted lands of Orv, these poor creatures stumbled upon a cabal of neothelids and were taken prisoner. Years in the massive worms' captivity both warped the gremlins' appearances and enhanced their minds. These lost gremlins became the drexins. The altered creatures emerged from the depths with new psychic abilities and an understanding of the neothelids' aberrant tongue. Perhaps the drexins escaped through sheer luck; perhaps their ascension to the upper levels of the Darklands is part of the machinations of the alien monstrosities in the deep heart of the world. Of course, the entire story is mere conjecture, and drexins quite possibly developed their psychic talents independent of neothelid influence.",
			"",
			"As their enlarged craniums suggest, drexin gremlins are particularly intelligent and have psychic talents that they gleefully employ to befuddle and maim the minds of others. While other gremlins revel in breaking objects, drexins enjoy tinkering with and disrupting thoughts, breaking the wills and minds of their targets rather than dismantling them physically.",
			"",
			"Drexins delight in sneaking up on spellcasters or artisans and using abilities such as babble, id insinuation I, and mental block to disrupt the process of spellcasting or magic item creation. If the victim senses the drexin's presence, the drexin typically casts mind thrust I or telekinetically flings an available object at the creature before fleeing. Drexins are physically weak and abhor physical combat unless they have a powerful ally to hide behind. This cowardice usually confines drexins to the sidelines of a fight.",
			"",
			"Like all gremlins, drexins are skilled trapsmiths. A drexin can imbue its traps with its own psychic spells. These masterpieces far surpass the mechanical devices made by other types of gremlins. Drexins are fond of creating and setting snares outside places of study, magic shops, and mages' homes. If a target springs the trap, the drexin emerges to torment its victim while she lies incapacitated, just outside the reach of aid. Drexins especially like to target other psychic creatures in this way, particularly those that are too powerful to confront directly. While drexins crave additional psychic power, most are incapable of more than a few spells. These wretched creatures therefore envy those who master the occult.",
			"",
			"From time to time, a drexin appears to a spellcaster or psychic and offers its services, usually proposing to increase the security of that person's home or workshop by building a number of traps in exchange for certain knowledge. Anyone foolish enough to accept the drexin's terms enjoys the benefits of a loyal trap crafter for a time. All too soon, however, the drexin gains the knowledge it seeks or grows bored with the arrangement. The unfortunate master returns to his home or study only to fall into the traps that once kept his secrets safe. The drexin then either kills or disables its former employer before stealing anything valuable and retreating to the sewers.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Among gremlinkind, drexins are feared for their mastery of mental magic. Different varieties of gremlins grudgingly cooperate with drexins to terrorize other creatures, but regard the psychic gremlins with intense distrust. Jinkins, pugwampis, and vexgits are even known to put aside their aversion to cold iron and construct \"mind shields\"- simple helms or plates of cold iron that are fastened around the head with straps to prevent drexins' psychic intrusions. These items do nothing to stop drexins' intrusions, but popular gremlin opinion keeps them in use. The fact that drexins speak Aklo as well as Undercommon further contributes to their otherness in gremlin society.",
			"",
			"In the Darklands, some lesser creatures believe drexins are capable of mental possession. The average drexin cannot truly dominate the mind or spirit, but individuals encourage this rumor, desiring the fearsome reputation it brings. Some drexins, however, grow more powerful than their kindred and gain class levels in kineticist or psychic. These drexins are particularly influential in gremlin society, and often command their own mobs of drexins or even other gremlins, who serve them out of fear and necessity rather than respect. Advanced drexins occasionally infiltrate humanoid society, enticing curious minds to explore mysteries best left undisturbed. Behind many academics who delve too deeply into maddening ancient secrets and spellcasters who open cursed magical tomes is an ambitious drexin joyfully luring others into psychic peril.",
			"",
			"Drexins prefer to dwell in the subterranean world, usually making their homes in caves and underground ruins. These gremlins commonly reside in the Darklands, and can be found among the slaves of the drow and serpentfolk of Sekamina. Drexins also form their own loosely organized societies in Nar-Voth, alongside jinkins, nuglubs, and vexgits. Still, the buzzing energy of thousands of minds in close proximity draws drexins to surface cities, where they often infest abandoned buildings and sewers.",
			"",
			"Though drexins usually betray their allies, occasionally creatures forge successful partnerships with these fey. Frauds claiming a connection to the spirit world or the minds of others sometimes use a hidden drexin's abilities to con patrons out of their hard-earned coin. A drexin might enter such a deal spurred by the promise of shared knowledge or gifts of materials to augment trap crafting. Ultimately, to avoid falling victim to a drexin's backstabbing, a drexin's partner must be just as conniving and cruel as the gremlin itself. Such a worthy creature might inspire a feeling akin to friendship in the drexin. If the partner ever doublecrosses the drexin, however, the arrangement ends. Drexins do not hold grudges; rather, they cultivate and nurture them over time, never forgetting the face or name of a betrayer. A drexin is a patient creature and may wait years to exact its revenge.",
			"",
			"Drexins are proud gremlins and do not typically worship deities or acknowledge any force greater than themselves. Contrary to their nature, however, some drexins pay homage to a being reverently named \"The Taker.\" This entity urges drexins to increase their own mental abilities by stealing the power of others, usually through a gruesome ritual in which the gremlin ingests portions of the brain of a murdered spellcaster or psychic. Drexins who follow The Taker typically dispatch their victims via traps, poison, or strangulation while those unfortunate souls sleep. While The Taker is not a deity and cannot grant spells to clerics, drexin oracles and shamans serve as the being's prophets and emissaries among drexin populations. Whether The Taker is an aspect of another deity, a powerful but mortal being with nefarious plans, or the creation of the gremlins' wild imaginations remains unknown."

This ability lets the wamp move relatively unhindered among unintelligent undead, but intelligent undead who understand the threat a wamp presents are unlikely to be fooled by this deception for long. This ability does not allow the wamp to be healed by negative energy; it is harmed by such attacks (and healed by positive energy) as per normal for a living creature. It does grant the wamp a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks and effects generated by undead creatures, regardless of whether its trickery has worked on that particular undead creature.",

			"Wamps dwell in the dead cities of the Dreamlands, particularly within necropolises or undead-haunted graveyards, where they can hunt their favored prey-unliving creatures with decaying flesh-with ease. A wamp is a vaguely arachnid creature, albeit one with nine legs that end in webbed feet colored a brilliant red, as if the creature had just finished wading through a pool of fresh gore. The wamp's face combines the least attractive features of a pig and a bat, but without the eyes. Covered with bristly pale fur save for their crimson feet, wamps often invite comparison to blood-smeared bones due to their coloration. Wamps often chuckle and chortle as they draw near their prey, eschewing ambush tactics in favor of a more disturbing opening volley of mockery designed to let their victims know that they have been marked for death - yet wamps are not foolish. Against canny foes, wamps can be as silent as the grave before springing to the attack.",
			"",
			"A wamp's body is 4 feet in diameter, but its 3-foot-long limbs give it a gangly leg span of 8 feet. It weighs 300 pounds and typically carries with it the faint and unsettling stench of rotting flesh.",
			"",
			"The wamp requires corruption of the flesh, both to survive and to procreate. It cannot digest fresh meat and prefers to feed on carrion it discovers or the flesh of corporeal undead creatures. Most wamps are not averse to slaying living victims they encounter, but they won't feed on the bodies for several days. Instead, they drag the corpses back to their dens to ripen before slurping the spongy, rotting flesh from the bones.",
			"",
			"When a wamp feeds on a dead body of at least Small size in this manner, it deposits hundreds of tiny eggs within the flesh, laying them in the decay through the very act of feeding. If a wamp leaves a body mostly unconsumed, these eggs quicken in the festering mess left behind and eventually start to absorb one other. When only one egg remains - having grown into a large mass of pale protoplasmic jelly - it hatches and a newborn wamp emerges. A newly hatched wamp is the size of a watermelon, but it grows quickly and achieves full size in a matter of hours. Once fully grown, a wamp can live for hundreds of years, although most succumb far sooner to violence, for their habits and methods often inspire disgust and retaliation among those they encounter. Fortunately for the enemies of wamps, these creatures are always ravenous and rarely leave behind enough meat on the bones of those they feed upon to spawn offspring.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Despite its alien form, hideous diet, and grim reproductive cycle, the average wamp should not be underestimated, for it is smarter and more curious than the average human. These creatures dwell in dead cities not only because these sites are often infested with delicious undead to feed on and spawn from, but also because such locales often feature a host of old carvings, forgotten libraries, and other cultural relics that can intrigue the mind. The fact that wamps, despite their lack of sight, manage to absorb the ancient lore of their favorite haunts and, over time, become expert historians of the ruins in which they dwell has long baffled scholars, for how could a creature who cannot see read old books or peruse ancient carvings? In truth, the wamp can see the natural decay inherent in all solidity, be it the rot of dead flesh, the erosion that affects carved stone walls, or the different rates of mildewing of paper and ink on printed pages over the passage of eons.",
			"",
			"It can be a dangerous but productive pursuit to consult wamps on the lore they have gathered, for they are often eager to divulge the secrets they've learned to visitors, if only as a way to brag about what they've discovered. Curious scholars are advised to keep such sessions with a wamp short, for many find themselves becoming a wamp's eventual meal not long after serving as its audience. Keeping a wamp interested in the conversation may require numerous successful DC 15 Knowledge checks, or perhaps Bluff checks if the converser is seeking only to distract.",
			"",
			"It seems that the nature of the particular ruins within which a wamp dwells might affect how the creature grows in power, as the types of lore left behind on carved stone walls or hidden in forgotten libraries can serve as primary sources of inspiration. Most wamps gain levels as sorcerers, psychics, or even rogues, bards, or clerics (they favor the worship of the Great Old One Tsathoggua), with those who gain the ability to cast arcane spells always seeking the Eschew Materials feat to combat the fact that wamps find it difficult to manipulate material components with their webbed feet. Other wamps simply grow more powerful by increasing in size and Hit Dice-rumors of wamps of up to colossal size persist in some regions.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"In his novella \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,\" H. P. Lovecraft mentions wamps briefly, describing them as \"web-footed creatures that are spawned in dead cities\" that the ghouls prefer to avoid, while leaving the rest up to the reader's imagination. In Chaosium's Dreamlands expansion to the Call of Cthulhu RPG, they drew upon the writings of Clark Ashton Smith for further inspiration in shaping that game's version of the wamp (in Smith's short story, \"The Abominations of Yondo,\" a strange nine-legged creature makes an appearance but is not called out directly as a wamp). It is upon the Chaosium version that this incarnation of the dreaded wamp is based."

Adults are around 10 feet tall and weigh about 1,100 pounds. Hill giants can live to be 200 years old, but almost never do.",
			"",
			"Hill giants prefer to fight from high, rocky outcroppings, where they can pelt opponents with rocks and boulders while limiting the risk to themselves. Hill giants love to make overrun attacks against smaller creatures when they first join battle. Thereafter, they stand fast and swing away with their massive clubs.",

			"Hill giants are the most nomadic of all the humanoid giant species, preferring to travel from one settlement to the next in order to raid and pillage. While they prefer temperate climates, they'll travel far from their preferred environment so long as the raiding is plentiful and successful. They are, as a whole, incredibly selfish creatures and rarely engage in battles they don't automatically know they'll win. Hill giants are known for shoving one another at terrifying foes and won't hesitate to sacrifice a clanmate to save their own skins. Roving bands of hill giants are common in temperate hills, and their constant aggression makes them one of the more feared dangers in this climate.",
			"",
			"Solitary, non-evil hill giants are very rare but can sometimes be found in other humanoid societies, though they are almost never accepted in central cities or population centers. They do best as laborers and soldiers in outlying frontier towns, and often serve as rudimentary diplomats to negotiate with marauding hill giant bands. Unfortunately, hill giants who shed their racial lifestyle for civilization are mocked and often killed on sight by their nomadic brethren. Still, these \"civilized\" hill giants can find their place within society and many have managed to live peaceful, uneventful lives."

Good river giants typically switch between bouts of great, jovial laughter or physical comedy (such as nearly tipping a raft with passengers), followed by quiet introspection while listening to the sounds of a slow river.

Such violet coloration is considered to be good luck among storm giants, and those possessing it tend to become leaders among their kind. Adults are typically 21 feet tall and weigh 12,000 pounds. Storm giants can live to be 600 years old. When at rest, they prefer to wear short, loose tunics belted at the waist, sandals or bare feet, and headbands. They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, with anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. Yet when they outfit themselves for battle, they don shimmering breastplates and wield enormous greatswords and bows.",
			"",
			"Storm giants tend to be reclusive, prefering to dwell along remote coastlines or on tropical islands. Yet like their namesakes, they are prone to violent mood swings. Storm giants are quick to anger in the face of evil and can be brutal, dangerous foes when insulted. In battle, they prefer to send a hail of arrows to rain down on their foes, only drawing their greatswords after opponents get inside their bow range.",
			"",
			"Storm giants live in well-constructed towers, castles, or walled settlements, and prefer to live off the land. They maintain enormous, well-tended gardens and manage hundreds of acres of farmland per group. They often hire other humanoids, such as elves or humans, to help them run their massive farms. A storm giant enclave often takes responsibility for the safety of an entire island or stretch of coastline."

Tomb giants are an entire race of humanoids who have given themselves over to necromancy, and in so doing have gained sinister powers. These giants are born as the living agents of undeath, and they show great skill in creating all manner of undead creatures - even from their own kind. Tomb giants fully expect to be transformed after they die, though most don't have to worry about the cost of sacrificing their experiences and memories, for they know their brothers and sisters can raise intelligent undead much greater than shambling zombies or clattering skeletons.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants possess an alabaster complexion. They are devoid of all body hair and have smooth, rounded features and marbleized skin. Tomb giants often tattoo their pale skin with arcane symbols in stark black ink. The sclerae of their eyes are jet black, and ghostly white pupils glow in the centers. They move with an eerie, silent grace for humanoids of their size, and rarely talk unless it is necessary. Tomb giants favor simple clothing, typically wearing togas at home and hooded cloaks when they emerge from their shadowy lairs. The average tomb giant stands 11 to 13 feet tall and weighs approximately 1,300 pounds. Tomb giants can live for up to 400 years.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants were created as an offshoot of taiga giants, forged by a Runelord of Gluttony during Thassilon's rule. When this ancient necromancer discovered the taiga giants' ability to sense and direct the life energy that pulses through every living creature, he hid a number of them away a secret complex deep beneath Golarion's surface. Using a now-lost ritual, the runelord altered the essence of these specimens to create the first tomb giants. He wanted to use the new species of giants as a deadly army of necromancers against the other runelords, but the conniving Runelord of Gluttony died before he could enact his plan, and his project was lost to the mists of time. The tomb giants lingered in their isolation for generations before they began to spread throughout the Darklands.",
			"",
			"These days, tomb giants are born rather than created, though it would be a misnomer to call their procreation natural. The giants' adaptation to their unwholesome powers has come at a cost, for tomb giants have trouble conceiving except during a small window of time (not much longer than an hour) after they have drained a portion of the life energy from another living creature. It is therefore common for tomb giants to take prisoners and keep them on hand for when they wish to conceive children.",
			"",
			"Although tomb giants possess inherent powers of necromancy, they are not undead. They aren't particularly troubled by sunlight (aside from their tendency to sunburn), but they have an instinctual dislike of bright light and open spaces. They are omnivorous and have no qualms about consuming sentient humanoids. By the time tomb giants are 10 years old, they are as large as an adult human and are capable of hunting and fighting. They reach maturity by age 50 or 60, when they gain full use of their magical abilities. When tomb giants die, their families or friends often transform them into sentient undead creatures or use the deceased giants' parts in the creation of other undead abominations. Tomb giants view their mortal life spans much as humans view puberty: as merely one stage in the development of the individual. An undead tomb giant is likely to be valued as a family elder.",
			"",
			"For tomb giants, sentient undeath represents the perpetual continuation of self-identity, and is the highest hope for those still alive. Thus, some of the most feared tomb giant punishments consist of execution followed by the offender's transformation into a mindless undead. Such unfortunates are often turned into an eternal servant, and are sometimes passed down from generation to generation within families.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tomb giants prefer enclosed spaces and underground lairs. While tombs and crypts can serve as lairs, tomb giants are more commonly found in renovated cave systems near the surface and in scattered pockets in the Darklands.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants have no compunction about living among undead, but are circumspect about their own safety and well aware that some undead have no loyalty to the living. It's common to create undead horrors from the corpses of lesser creatures to use as servants or guards-smaller undead are often used as components for necrocrafts.",
			"",
			"Tomb giants are a secretive race, and go to extraordinary lengths to pursue and capture anyone they catch spying on them. Surrounding themselves with undead creatures (most of which are under their control) has provided the giants the secrecy they crave, as the dead don't utter secrets. Some folktales speak of silent, pale folk of impossible height who come out of the night in pursuit of a victim who has \"seen something no one should see.\" These stories have a grain of truth to them, and invariably end with the foolhardy individual vanished from his home, never to be seen again. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped with their lives bear scars of their interactions with the sinister giants, and survivors tell tales of pale giants who made light conversation with their victims while preparing to cook them. Darker tales hint at the tomb giants' perverse mating rituals, wherein chained victims are drained of their life force and left hanging on the walls, bearing witness to the giants' frenzied couplings before the pale creatures eat their weakened captives alive. Wherever these alabaster fiends tread, horror and madness is sure to follow."

			"Vault giants are 42 feet tall and weigh 25,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"In the mysterious Age of Serpents, the vault giants' civilization spread across the shores of Golarion. Each vault giant clan raised mighty, translucent crystalline spires along the sea cliffs bordering its territory. Like the ancient xulgaths, vault giants were hard-pressed by usurper civilizations, most predominantly Thassilon and its rune giant servants. The divided nature of vault giant clan structure made them ill-prepared to resist a united empire. Thus, to this day, rune giants are hated foes in vault giant legends, and the reptilian giants attack rune giants on sight (though rune giants are rarely found in the deepest layers of the Darklands).",
			"",
			"When the vault giant clans were brought to the brink of extinction by Thassilon, their leaders struck a bargain with unnamed dark powers promising salvation. The clans surrendered their spires to the waves and journeyed deep into the sea. There, a passage led them to the shores of the Sightless Sea of Orv, where the vault giants made their new homes. They have adapted well to subterranean life and hunt the great beasts that roam the depths of the Sightless Sea for sustenance. Modern vault giants do not differ physically from their surface-dwelling ancestors, except that their once-vibrant aquamarine scales have paled over time. To compensate, vault giants paint themselves with glowing designs that show clan affiliation and personal status.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Vault giant clans build strongholds on the shores of the Sightless Sea. While most reside on the outer shores, some powerful clans claim steep, rocky islands. From the outside, vault giant clanholds resemble natural stone, with cunningly concealed openings for lookouts. The main entrance of a vault giant clanhold is always underwater, although the interior has portions both above and below sea level. On the inside, the structure is carefully designed to accommodate the entire clan, with defensive structures near the entrance to resist attack from rival clans or other creatures. Vault giants use the same glowing paint with which they adorn their bodies to decorate and mark the rooms inside a clanhold, including the communal heated baths where the giants sleep.",
			"",
			"Vault giant society is strict and ritualistic. A giant's role within the clan is established by his actions, and each giant knows the rituals and tasks that will cause his status within the clan to rise or fall. Each clan is led by a circle of powerful female psychics. The circle communes with the dark entities they serve and consults with the governing circles from other clans to decide the direction for vault giant raids and expeditions. A female vault giant who hears the psychic call to join a circle dives deep into the Sightless Sea. She returns changed many years later, with psychic abilities surpassing those of her ordinary kin - if she returns at all. Members of the circle do not age like others of their kind, but are eventually drawn back into the depths of the sea, never to be seen again.",
			"",
			"Beyond the ruling circle, vault giant clans assign roles to their members according to individual talents, regardless of gender. Vault giant culture places the unity of the clan above familial ties. The clans decree who mates with whom and when, and females lay their eggs in a clan's communal hatchery. Vault giant eggs mature slowly, taking a year to hatch; offspring that hatch too quickly usually have deformities and are destroyed. The whole clan is responsible for guiding healthy children to adulthood - which they reach at the age of 30 - and for teaching them combat and psychic magic along the way. Vault giants can live for several hundred years.",
			"",
			"Vault giants place the survival of their clan above all else, and self-image is closely tied to status in the clan. The worst punishment a vault giant can receive is exile. An exile's markings of status are erased, and the individual is sent alone away from the Sightless Sea. Vault giants deprived of their clan become psychotic and usually seek out a group of smaller creatures to bully into submission - often, a tribe of degenerate troglodytes. This leadership is a pale shadow of the sense of belonging the giant felt within the clan, and these giants often vent their frustrations in mighty rages.",
			"",
			"In their interactions with other intelligent denizens of the Sightless Sea, such as aboleths, munavris, and urdefhans, vault giants seem to operate according to an inscrutable agenda. They might raid one settlement, lavish gifts upon another, or raze yet another to the ground and take all of its inhabitants as prisoners. Intelligent captives receive equally erratic treatment: they might be eaten in a communal feast or set free in a distant corner of Orv. Vault giants are cautious when they meet unfamiliar intelligent creatures for the first time, preferring to take them captive until they receive instructions from their leaders. Vault giants know only that they loyally follow the orders of their psychic circle; few realize that these powerful psychics take their commands in turn from unknown masters far below the Sightless Sea."

Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called \"wings\" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons-gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night.",

Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form \"wings\", as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle.",

			"**Ganzi Oddity (Sp, Su, Ex)** As creatures infused with the entropic forces of the Maelstrom, all ganzis have a distinct and unusual oddity that manifests as a physical or magical ability that sets the ganzi apart. Typically, a ganzi's oddity is chosen from the most common manifestations of entropy listed below, but other, more unique oddities can certainly exist. The numbers listed for each option can be used to randomly determine what form of ganzi oddity a particular Ganzi might have, at the GM's option, but the quibble ability is the most common.",
			"",
			"- 1-2: *Chaos Champion (Su)* Ganzis with a lineage linked to the einherji often become crusaders for the forces of entropy and excel in combat against lawful beings. The ganzi can smite law once per day as a swift action, targeting a lawful foe. She adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Hit Dice. Once activated, smite law persists until the target is dead or the ganzi rests, whichever comes first.",
			"- 3-4: *Entropic Flesh (Ex)* Ganzis with lineages that link strongly to chaos beasts retain some of their ancestors' immunity to transformation. In addition to gaining a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, when such ganzis are affected by a hostile transmutation effect (such as polymorphing or petrification), they can attempt a new saving throw at the start of their next turn to end the effect. They gain a +4 bonus on this second saving throw, but if they fail, the transmutation effect persists as long as it normally would.",
			"- 5-6: *Prehensile Tail (Ex)* Ganzis with lineages that are particularly influenced by the presence of proteans often have colorful feathers, scales, or skin, and a long serpentine tail. This tail can be used to carry items. While ganzis with this oddity cannot wield weapons with their tails, they can use their tails to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.",
			"- 7-14: *Quibble (Su)* For most ganzis, the influence of chaos is relatively subtle and manifests as an ability to infect others with entropy and unexpected luck (be it good luck or bad). Once per day as an immediate action, a ganzi can twist probability and alter the luck of a single creature within 20 feet, forcing it to reroll a single d20 roll it has just made. The target must take the second result, even if it is worse. A ganzi can use this ability after the target has rolled but must use it before the GM declares whether the roll was a success or failure. Unwilling creatures can resist a ganzi's quibble with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's level + the ganzi's Charisma modifier). This is a curse effect.",
			"- 15-18: *Spell-Like Ability (Sp)* Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from regions other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such ganzis gain one of the following spell-like abilities, usable once per day at a caster level equal to the ganzi's HD: alter self, blur, detect thoughts, hideous laughter, minor image, shatter, or spider climb.",
			"- 19-20: *Weaponplay (Ex)* Ganzis with lineages that link to the valkyries manifest their heritage in their skill in combat. Such ganzis are always proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and they can qualify for feats normally available only to fighters (such as {feat/Weapon Specialization}) even if they don't have any fighter class levels.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Ganzis are the end result of planar chaos touching living creatures. Where the planes brush against the Material Plane or where chaotic inhabitants (be they chaos beasts, proteans, valkyries, or others) affect or influence mortal life, ganzis are born in their wake like ripples in a pond.",
			"",
			"While ganzis are superficially human in appearance, they often have features that set them apart from the rest of humanity. These features can vary widely; one ganzi might have a discolored hand that flickers with entropic (but harmless) energy, while another might have brightly colored scales covering her shoulders and back, and yet another might have horns and glowing green eyes. Likewise, ganzi height and weight can vary dramatically, even by human standards, but the average ganzi stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many ganzis are mistaken for aasimars or tieflings at birth, but in truth ganzi births very rarely result from mortals mingling with outsiders. The vast majority are born after one or both parents were exposed to a force of chaotic or entropic energy. As such, the circumstances of a ganzi's childhood can vary dramatically and depend on the parents' tolerance for the unexpected. A ganzi's tendency towards chaos exacerbates this, with many ganzis developing gregarious, iconoclastic, or thrill-seeking reputations among their peers. A sizable minority of ganzis appear completely human early in life, their anarchic heritage manifesting shortly after puberty in a chaotic - and traumatic - spasm of rapid evolution. While ganzis are most commonly of human stock, it is not unknown for ganzis to be born among other races. These ganzis bear superficial signs of their non-human heritage, but their statistics and abilities are identical to those born to humans.",
			"",
			"Like other native outsiders of humanoid heritage, ganzis are found most often scattered amidst the societies of their parent races. The rare ganzis who choose not to wander may live their entire lives without meeting another of their kind. Due to their scattered pattern of birth and their tendency towards wandering lifestyles, ganzis rarely congregate in significant numbers and almost never form cultures of their own. On occasion, a Material Plane society in a region with links to other planes will produce enough ganzis over time for them to form their own subculture, but such societies are rare indeed.",
			"",
			"Given their relationship to the Cerulean Void and its natives, it is not uncommon for ganzis with awareness of their heritage and the resources for planar travel to journey to the Maelstrom. Some ganzis make this pilgrimage to seek out proteans, valkyries, or other natives of the Maelstrom in hopes of understanding their own place in the cosmos, while others are drawn to the idea of communing with the vast and potent force of primordial chaos itself.",
			"",
			"As befits their chaotic origin, the personality and outlook of individual ganzis can vary significantly. Often chaotic-aligned, with no particular tendency towards good or evil, many find themselves drawn to the life of the wandering adventurer. Ganzis are commonly possessed of deep curiosity and powerful creative talent, leading many to become artists or bards, while others enjoy the alchemist's dichotomous mastery of creation and destruction. Sorcerous talents and oracular mysteries of all varieties are unsurprisingly common among ganzis."

			"**Bloodless Touch (Ex)** When a hooded harbinger makes a melee touch attack, its target must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the save is successful, the victim takes 2d6+8 points of damage and is wracked by pain for 1 round, gaining the staggered condition. It is thereafter immune to that hooded harbinger's bloodless touch for 1 day. On a failed save, the portion of the victim's body that is touched begins to swell and turn purplishblack as the blood flow to it is restricted. This effect deals 4d6+12 points of damage per round and the victim gains the staggered and sickened conditions from the intense pain. After 1d4 rounds, the victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to try and end the effect. The effect can be ended sooner by a heal spell or a successful DC 23 Heal check. The Heal check requires a precise incision to the affected flesh, and consequently deals 2d6 points of bleed damage to the victim as the pressure of the entrapped blood flow is released. Once a victim has been affected by a bloodless touch, it can't be affected by another until the effects of the first one have ended. If the effects are ended by a successful save, then that individual is immune to further bloodless touch attacks by that hooded harbinger for 1 day. The bloodless touch attack of a hooded harbinger affects only living creatures with recognizable physiology and a blood supply. Undead, oozes, most constructs, and creatures that are not subject to precision damage are immune to bloodless touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Manifest Yellow Sign (Sp)** Once per day, a hooded harbinger can trace a mystical pattern in the air, causing a glowing, immaterial image of the Yellow Sign to appear before it. This image remains in place for 1d4 minutes. Any creatures within 100 feet who is able to see the sign (it glows as per light) must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused for as long as the sign persists. The sign can be erased with dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel magic, or erase with a successful DC 26 caster level check. Anyone under the effects of the Yellow Sign will not act against the hooded harbinger in any way, though that does not mean that they will follow its commands. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.",
			"",
			"**Profane Reek (Su)** The musty, carrion stench wafting from the foul folds of a hooded harbinger's rags extends in a 5-foot radius, creating an aura of obscene influence around the creature. This terrible smell gives a hooded harbinger a profane bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. In addition, any breathing creature that enters this cloud must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be affected as though under the mental effects of a mind fog spell for as long as it remains within the profane reek's area of effect and for 2d4 rounds after it leaves. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the mind fog effect of that hooded harbinger's profane reek for 1 day. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Prophetic Utterance (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate action, a hooded harbinger can mutter a prophetic utterance against any single creature within 100 feet that has just dealt damage to it. This mutter is unintelligible to anyone but the target, which hears the utterance as a telepathic message pronouncing its doom. The target is immediately affected by a doom spell (no save) for the next hour or until the utterance is successfully dispelled (requiring a successful DC 26 caster level check).",
			"",
			"**Terrible Visage (Su)** A hooded harbinger never reveals its face. Only if slain or rendered helpless can anyone attempt to remove the hood and reveal the harbinger's true visage. However, as layers of the stinking, rotten wrappings around its face are peeled back or cut away, new layers are found beneath. These many filth-crusted layers can be removed only with 1d4+2 rounds of effort. If they are successfully removed, only those adjacent to the creature can see the revealed countenance and anyone able to do so must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by an insanity spell. Those who succeed at their saves are unaffected, as their minds mercifully erase the image from their memories. Those cured of the insanity receive the same relief. Immediately after the hooded harbinger's face is revealed, its body explodes in a massive flash of light and concussive force that completely obliterates all evidence of it. Anyone within 10 feet of the corpse when it explodes takes 6d10 points of force damage (Reflex DC 23 half) and must attempt two DC 23 Fortitude saves, one against blindness and one against deafness (both as per blindness/deafness). The save DC to resist the insanity effect is Charisma-based, and the save DCs to resist the explosion's effects are Constitution-based.",

			"It is said that the Crawling Chaos is the messenger of the Great Old Ones, but whether this is by their command or his own whim is debatable. Regardless of why, the Great Old One known as Hastur sometimes instead relies on his hooded harbingers to relay messages to his far-flung cults and even to the High Priest Not To Be Described of mystery-shrouded Leng. These dread figures swathed in filthy yellow rags bear the whispered tidings of their Unnamed Lord. There are those who even speculate that the veiled priest of Leng is actually the greatest of the hooded harbingers, who gained some measure of autonomy - but the truth of this remains unknown. Thought to have originated in distant Carcosa by unthinkable means, hooded harbingers are exceedingly rare, and seldom is more than one encountered at a time.",
			"",
			"Though tasked with the menial role of messengers, hooded harbingers take their charge very seriously. Infused with the hateful potency of their master, they are able to call upon many terrible powers in defense of their duties. When forced into combat, they prefer to trip opponents with the trailing ends of their ragged arm coverings and administer their bloodless touch to as many victims as possible. They always attempt to use plane shift to flee if in danger of imminent defeat.",
			"",
			"Serving as messengers for Hastur, hooded harbingers receive the communications they deliver directly from the Great Old One via mental transmission. Upon receiving the message, the hooded harbinger twitches and shakes as if it were having a seizure. During this time they are particularly dangerous, because if they are attacked or distracted in any way, they fly into a furious rage and the offender risks attracting the attention of the King in Yellow.",
			"",
			"No one has seen a hooded harbinger's face and lived to describe it. If its hood is pulled back, the creature's head is seen to be completely swathed in the same filthy rags that cover its body. If it is helpless, the rags can be unraveled, but each layer only gives way to dozens of layers of the tattered yellow cloth. Eventually, a face is revealed, but it appears to be the face of the unraveler. If she is lucky, her memories are immediately wiped clean. If she is less fortunate or less able to forget, she is driven insane.",

A ship's captain who plans to sail through an isonade's waters often takes on extra crew, knowing that at least a few crew members might simply disappear over the side before they reach port. Though few alive have ever seen the monster's full body, a great many sailors have caught a glimpse of its hooked carapace as it drags a skewered sailor down to the inky depths.",
			"",
			"Mercifully, isonades spend much of their existence in hibernation. When an isonade is preparing to hibernate, the population in its area of the ocean drops drastically while the beast consumes huge quantities of food. Though an isonade will eat just about anything that bleeds, it favors massive beasts to minimize time spent hunting - such as giant squid or whales - though it will resort to eating hundreds of fish once larger prey grow scarce. It's also intelligent enough to know that a seafaring vessel contains a large quantity of warm and screaming snacks all isolated in one convenient place. An isonade can hibernate for hundreds of years, waking only when its vast store of food has been exhausted or when startled by a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or volcanic eruption.",
			"",
			"Because of this long hibernation, rumors of isonades are often exaggerated and relegated to myth, making their exact territories hard to predict when they awaken once again. The isonade's eating cycle provides indicators of its return. An abundance of fish in a region can signal a hungry isonade's territory, as sudden explosions in the fish population sometimes occur when these beasts begin devouring the region's larger predators. An isonade shakes off its torpor by eating the large, slow animals in the depths, but inevitably circles upward as its appetite grows.",
			"",
			"An isonade can live for over 10,000 years, and can grow to over 70 feet in length. An adult isonade weighs approximately 300,000 pounds."

An ixion worm in its wheel form possesses the euphoric gaze, hypnotic wheel, and powerful charge special abilities. When in serpentine form, the ixion worm gains a 10-foot bonus to its speed, a climb speed of 10 feet, a +2 dodge bonus to its Armor Class, and the constrict special attack.

This additional use is available for 1 hour and is consumed only after the ixion worm's normal daily uses of its spell-like abilities have been expended.",
			"",
			"**Euphoric Gaze (Su)** Three times a day as a move action, when in its wheel form, an ixion worm can unfocus its eye and spin it in a mesmerizing whirl to gain a gaze attack that affects all creatures within 30 feet as per euphoric tranquility (CL 14th, Will DC 22 partial). The effect is persistent but immediately ends if the ixion worm threatens or is threatened by a creature, uses any other special abilities, or moves in any way but a straight line.

			"**Hypnotic Wheel (Su)** A rolling ixion worm's face is hypnotically grotesque. An ixion worm in wheel form can take a full-round action to move up to twice its speed. If it moves at least 20 feet as part of such an action, it can target a creature within 30 feet that is visible from any square in its path with a 14th-level mesmerist's hypnotic stare that has the allure, susceptibility, and timidity bold stare improvements.

Each is forged of flesh stretched over massive bones, and each bears the identical face of a hypnotically entrancing male cyclops. Its bones can slither as a crooked serpent or join at the ends to form a wheel, with its face freely sliding around the structure to spin on one side of the hub as it rolls itself around. The rotation amplifies the ixion worm's hypnotic abilities, which it uses to motivate Phlegethon's petitioners into working harder in the layer's mines and forges.",
			"",
			"The ixion worm's mouth dribbles with a prismatic oily residue that corrodes and absorbs the souls of whatever creatures with which it mingles. The worm's size and mass - 5 feet wide, 9 feet in radius in wheel form, nearly 30 feet long unrolled, and 600 pounds in weight - also make the creature a terrifying physical force as it careens down the narrow paths of Phlegethon's crags. The ixion worm's entrancing gaze and mental powers, however, are what make it an effective and intimidating enforcer; few of Phlegethon's lesser inhabitants consider challenging what they quickly believe is their only friend in Hell.",
			"",
			"When petitioners slack in their work, an ixion worm snakes into place, forms a wheel, and lulls them into a trance by rolling in hypnotic patterns until the rocky layer of Hell seems to become a twisted fantasy: a rolling field of rotting food to the gluttonous, for instance, or an endless sea of writhing, formless flesh to the lustful. The few who dare to disobey are either smashed under the wheel's rim or suckled in its warped mouth, where its soul-draining spit strips away what little individuality and vitality a creature retains.",
			"",
			"Belial smiles upon ixion worms that excel at their tasks and promotes them to serve as pulley wheels in his forges' machinery. The most prized are sent to Dispater to become gears in Dis's gates and wheels in the groaning carts that carry piles of petitioners through the layers of Hell. These elevated ixion worms endlessly plead for devils and broken souls alike to show gratitude to their diabolic benefactors, lest they too become little more than implements of Hell.",
			"",
			"In ancient tales passed down by the duergar of Nar-Voth, a handful of elevated ixion worms escaped Hell and taught the duergar the secrets of Phlegethon's forges in a daring doublecrossing of the lord of betrayal himself. The duergar venerate the ixion worms in these stories with the hope that they'll one day return to the Darklands bearing new infernal secrets of binding souls to stone and metal.",

			"Crafted from the souls of those who betray their relatives, ixion worms are all built from a singular namesake template - the ancient cyclops mesmerist Ixion, who psychically cowed a tribe of cyclopes under his rule during the nascent days of the kingdom of Ghol-Gan.",
			"",
			"In his covetous lust for his mother-in-law, the self-styled King Ixion lured his own father to death in a spiked pit trap. His flagrant betrayal garnered the attention of Belial, archdevil of Phlegethon and master of betrayers, and the archdevil dispatched an agent to Ixion's wife and mother-in-law to expose the king's plot and tempt them into killing him for vengeance. Belial's ploy worked; the women stabbed Ixion into submission, strapped his body to an oxcart's wheel, and then plowed him through his kingdom's mud until he died.",
			"",
			"When the cyclops's soul reached Belial's pleasure palace of Idolisque, the archdevil presented Ixion with a choice: to serve in the forges or join his twisted harem. Ixion spitefully responded by expressing his distaste for Belial's palace and declaring the archdevil's finest souls far too ugly. In a fit of mirthful wrath, the archdevil ripped the former king's soul apart and had him reforged into a worm of bones. Devils stretched Ixion's comely face across its length, then rolled his new form into the shape of a wheel.",
			"",
			"The ever-defiant mesmerist king nonetheless tried to hypnotize Belial into admitting his poor taste, and the archdevil rewarded his persistence by tossing him from Idolisque and into the jagged rocks below. To further mock Ixion, who still searches Phlegethon in anonymous bitterness for the souls of his wife and mother-in-law, Belial commanded his forges to craft the souls of every familial betrayer sent to Phlegethon into the cyclops king's likeness."
