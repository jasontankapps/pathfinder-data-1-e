These moments cement the players' commitment to the game by connecting them emotionally to what has just happened, while at the same time hooking them with the promise of future gains. Players revel in the success they've just scored, while also looking forward to the future triumphs their characters will be able to rack up after leveling up, using new gear, or making use of a long-forgotten scrap of lore.",
			"",
			"Expect responses to rewards to vary from group to group and between individual players. Some players enjoy constant rewards and actively alter their play styles to maximize the benefits they receive. Others regard them as a bookkeeping necessity they'd rather keep in the background. Observe your players' responses to see where they fit on this continuum. As you make decisions affecting reward distribution, seek out the sweet spot of compromise that makes the experience as compulsively entertaining as possible for the majority of your players.",
			"",
			"Generalizations don't always hold but can be useful as a starting point in determining what your players will enjoy. Younger or less experienced players often tend to prefer frequent rewards, with no benefit too small to lovingly describe. Even the most jaded players can remember their first few sessions, when a measly clutch of copper coins wrenched from a stinking kobold warren seemed like the most awesome haul ever. Older players, especially ones who are squeezed for time and can only meet for short sessions, may prefer to move the rewards process to the background. In this mode, shopping, swapping, and leveling up usually occurs outside of precious session time.",
			"",
			"Whatever their amount of experience, some players remain more oriented toward rewards than others. Players heavily invested in their characters' abilities and in slaying monsters tend to want their rewards as soon as they can get them. Becoming more powerful is their biggest thrill. A steady stream of small power boosts suits them just fine. They don't want to go into the next fight until they know they've squeezed every last iota of potential ability from their past accomplishments.",

They're more interested in seeing what's on the other side of that hill, or talking to the crazy hermit, than stopping every scene to add up their XP totals or divide treasure.

Downtime awards make leveling up seem like something that happens in the world. The characters only become visibly better at their tasks after taking some time to rest, reflect, contemplate, and train. One danger with downtime awards is that they can tempt players to take otherwise poorly motivated rest stops just to gain their XP awards and level up. Depending on the pacing of a given session, a break for downtime might completely deflate the game's momentum and make it hard to recapture your players' attention. On the other hand, it might give you a much-needed break to work out an upcoming encounter, dream up fresh story events, or simply let your brain idle for a few minutes.",

Use this interest to build in plot elements. They might happily spend more time spying on rivals, muscling out competitors, and fending off bandits than they do fighting orcs and demons.

Tolkien written before roleplaying tie - in novels began to influence the field, powerful magic tends to be scarce.

Where magical gear is concerned, the hero might have one or two very special items, rather than an entire kit-bag loaded with devices for every occasion.",

They're manufactured by retired magicians, traded by merchants, and found lying around in dungeons. This conceit trades epic atmosphere for gaming convenience. The rules as written assume that characters get magic items in line with their levels, and that when an adventurer desires a piece of magical gear, he need only pony up the cash and it's his.",

Shops of this grade frequently appear in undesirable or remote neighborhoods.

Most low-end shops follow an inflexible \"buyer beware\" policy, offering no guarantee that items are free from defects, curses, hauntings, or ownership disputes. For security, these shops rely on traps, curses, and crude but effective fortifications. Low-end shop owners tend to be reclusive, eccentric, or truculent.",

Shops of this type frequently nestle on cozy side streets not far from a city's commercial district. Many double as informal social clubs for the mystically inclined. Mid-range shops offer a fuller array of merchandise: in addition to a wide range of well-labeled components and large collections of scholarly tomes, they sell both minor and medium items. Items are guaranteed free from curse or defect, though the customer's only remedy is a full refund. Skilled mercenaries, some of whom are spellcasters, provide security. Magical traps supplement the fortifications.",

These top-range shops often specialize exclusively in major items, and reliably vouch for the quality of their wares, including freedom from curses or other ill effects. Security such shops is top of the line, with powerful spells and traps, and highly skilled and well-paid guards, some of whom may not be entirely mortal. They might be trained monsters, ingenious automatons, or summoned outsiders. The identities of a high-end shop's true owners are often shrouded in rumor and mystery. They might be phantasmal surrogates, disguised dragons, or even powerful entities from the Great Beyond."

Any item can be used as the focus of a story. Using a term made famous by Alfred Hitchcock, screenwriters refer to an object that serves as the motivating factor to drive a storyline as a macguffin.[^M] Famous macguffin include the Maltese Falcon, from the book and movie of the same name, and Pulp Fiction's glowing suitcase. Mythological macguffin include the Golden Fleece and Holy Grail.",

Once the group finds the macguffin, it might fade into the background as just another item of treasure, or gradually lead to a more sweeping narrative. Alternatively, you can introduce your big storyline sneakily, by having the item appear as just another piece of dungeon loot.

Alternatively, use items that multiple PCs can make use of. Depending on the makeup of your group, a relic could grant one power to a fighter and another to a cleric.",

			"Be prepared to be flexible when introducing special treasure details. You may find yourself about to bring in a vividly detailed treasure when the players are preoccupied with other concerns, like chasing down an escaped enemy, saving a dying comrade, or charging onward to the next plot development. If something else has already captured their interest, turn the treasure into a nondescript pile of coins and save the vivid details for an otherwise uneventful moment.",

This might be as simple a matter as specifying that a cache of coins was minted in Celwynvian, when one of the PCs is exploring her elven heritage. When customizing basic treasure, ask yourself the following questions.",

			"### Can the item reflect the adventure's theme?",
			"",
			"In an adventure where the heroes are questioning their identities, they could discover a precious mirror. During a quest for political power, they might find a crown or scepter.",
			"",
			"### Would the item foster an interesting debate or conflict within the party?",
			"",
			"If one PC hates demons and wishes to destroy anything associated with them, and the other is interested in studying dark arts in order to defeat them, give them a golden demon statuette to argue over. Aim for conflicts that define the characters, rather than ones that set them at each other's throats.",
			"",
			"### Is there a detail that will become important later?",
			"",
			"Foreshadow a future adventure into the ruins of a forgotten civilization by letting the adventurers discover a tapestry depicting the rise and fall of that society. This allows you to spread out the history lesson over several game sessions.",
			"",
			"### Can an item of treasure be used to subtly introduce an NPC?",
			"",
			"Often you want the party to meet a supporting player in a casual context before they discover his or her true importance in the story. The NPC might later be revealed to be an evil conspirator, a prince unaware of his birthright, or a predatory monster in disguise. If so, introduce an item of treasure that character will want to buy, examine, or attempt to steal. For example, make your conspirator a rug merchant, and the item of treasure a rare and valuable carpet.",
			"",
			"### Would an item lead the characters to interact non-violently with an enemy who wouldn't ordinarily talk to them?",
			"",
			"A precious memento or object of art might attract the attention of a cruel and powerful entity who wants it enough to negotiate a fair transaction under neutral circumstances. This allows the PCs to converse with the dragon, bandit king, or demon lord they'll wind up fighting later, when they have enough experience to tackle the foe.",
			"",
			"### When none of these questions help you to customize a treasure item, find a random interesting detail.",
			"",
			"Turn to a random page of the Pathfinder Campaign Setting, or another setting sourcebook you happen to be drawing on, and look for a detail that inspires a unique item of non-magical treasure. If you're not using a setting book, any edition of *Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable*[^B] makes a fine source of random mythological and fantastic inspiration.",
			"",
			"For example, let's say that your random page takes you to the section of the Campaign Setting detailing the Red Mantis Assassins. Using this as inspiration, you decide that the treasure includes a fabulously expensive brooch given to top members of the organization after performing an exemplary kill. In order to trade this in for cash, the party will either have to find a merchant who doesn't fear the wrath of the [Red Mantis](rule/aff_assassins), or seek out a high-ranking member of the group. One of the PCs might do something rash, like use the brooch to pass herself off as a member of the Red Mantis.",

			"The subject of designing spells is touched on only briefly in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. While some guidance on cost and time is provided, a GM needs to consider balance and design factors before allowing a PC to introduce a new spell into the game. As a first step, request a detailed write-up of the spell using the Pathfinder RPG rules. Based on this write-up, you can determine whether or not the spell is balanced for its level and appropriate for the game.",
			"",
			"***Spell Categories:*** When considering a new spell, first determine the category into which it fits. Spells can be divided into the broad categories of offensive magic (spells that deal direct damage, enhance combat abilities, or summon allies to fight), defensive magic (spells that protect the caster or her allies, control or impede enemies, or heal damage), and utility magic (spells of general use outside of combat, such as travel magic and most divinations). Some spells fit into multiple categories, such as {spell/teleport}, with both defensive and utility applications.",
			"",
			"***Level-Appropriate:*** Compare the new spell to other spells in the same category and at or near the desired spell level. Pay close attention to \"must have\" choices like {spell/fireball}, {spell/dimension door}, and {spell/wall of force}. If the spell is more powerful or more useful than other spells of the desired level, increase the level. If it seems weak, consider lowering the level. If there is already a similar spell in the game, pay particularly close attention to the new spell's relative power.",
			"",
			"***Saving Throw or Attack Roll:*** Most spells that are usable against others should require either a saving throw or an attack roll (generally touch or ranged touch). Spells that are quite powerful for their level, like {spell/disintegrate} or {spell/phantasmal killer}, may require both, or allow two saving throws. Watch out for spells that effectively take the target out of the fight and are negated by a saving throw. Consider adding a minor effect even on a successful save, and toning down the result of a failed save. Spells that automatically affect the target should be higher level or limited in their consequences.",
			"",
			"***Components:*** Unless there's a particularly good reason, almost all spells should require both verbal and somatic components, and most divine spells should require a divine focus. Spells with no verbal component are particularly rare. If the spell-as-designed lacks them, consider adding material component or focus requirements as a means of adding flavor. Expensive components and foci are a good way to adjust the effective power of a spell without changing the level."

			"Good spells expand upon the existing themes of magic, but in a novel manner. The game doesn't really need more ways to throw damage around, but a spell that hurls adjacent enemies away from the caster is both interesting and useful.

			"The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game handles most spell components in a fairly abstract fashion: the components are purchased as part of a spell component pouch, which is assumed to contain the required quantity of any components for any spell of which the caster has knowledge. For many GMs, this suits their needs, and other than having the player mark off some gold when his PC uses a more expensive component like diamond dust, that is the extent of attention spell components receive. The virtue of this system is speed and simplicity. A GM desiring more verisimilitude can instead require the PCs track down or prepare individual components, and even allow PCs to obtain enhanced components that improve their spells.",
			"",
			"Even when tracking individual components, many reagents are so common they can be assumed to be easily found. Save the legwork for commissioning tiny silver whistles (for {spell/mage's faithful hound}), finding dragon scales (for [form of the dragon](spell/form_of_the_dragon_1)), and things of that nature. Yet even then, don't go overboard - while finding rare components can be a fun opportunity for side-quests, your players go grocery shopping often enough in real life, and obsessing over whether their leaves are fresh or their eggshell components got cracked in the last fall is a good way to bore your players and ensure nobody wants to play a caster in your game."

			"Two principles of magic to remember when considering spell components are that of *contagion* (a part retains a connection to the whole) and *sympathy* (like produces like). A component can be linked to its source, manipulating or drawing power from that source, or it can produce effects based upon its nature.",
			"",
			"Historically, components such as blood carried both the life and strength of a creature, and the potential to bind two lives together; coffin nails could be pounded or bound into a weapon, making it strike true; hair and nails rendered the original owner vulnerable to hostile magic even at great distances; and animal horns and tusks provide protection to their wearer, not to mention the healing properties of a unicorn's horn.",
			"",
			"Most spell components in the Pathfinder RPG are based on sympathy, either duplicating the desired outcome of the spell (gauze and a wisp of smoke for {spell/gaseous form}) or having properties related to the spell (an owl's feather for {spell/owl's wisdom}). The latter sort of component may utilize contagion as well, as the single feather retains the nature of the whole.",
			"",
			"When adding material components or a focus to a new spell, consider what forces the spell is shaping, and select components that reflect those forces. Good components don't necessarily need to be literally appropriate - the handful of earth required for {spell/detect undead} is an example of a more symbolic fit. Humorous spell components are tempting (and well represented in the game), but should be used sparingly."

			"An enhanced component is a specialized reagent used to improve a spell. The exact effects of such a component are up to the GM, but may include a small increase to save DC, caster level, damage, range, or duration. Particularly rare enhanced components may even provide the benefits of metamagic feats. In addition, enhanced components used in long-duration spells often make them significantly harder to dispel.",
			"",
			"The power of a component is strongly influenced by the means by which it was obtained. For most magic, the most powerful components are those freely given, rather than taken by force, thievery, or magical compulsion. A vial of dragon's tears wept during a masterful performance may well hold more magic than a vial of blood taken from that same dragon's ravaged corpse. The same is not true for darker magics. For such spells, components obtained in profane and blasphemous rituals are the most powerful by far.",
			"",
			"Symbolism is key in obtaining enhanced components. A wizard seeking the last light of an eclipse to enhance a {spell/sunburst} might catch the sun's rays in a mirror, while a druid might gather the nectar of morning glories that bloomed in the day's light and shut in the darkness of the eclipse for the same spell. Neither is literally the last light of the sun, but the principle of contagion suffices to enhance the spell.",
			"",
			"Before introducing enhanced components into your game, consider the implications of allowing casters to increase their abilities without investing in metamagic feats or permanent magic items. To preserve their rare and exotic feel, enhanced components should not be easily obtainable or fixed in price. Finding a source for an enhanced component is an adventure in itself, and the quantities available should be limited to just a few castings. Two examples are as follows:",
			"",
			"***Dragon's Tears:*** These yellowish drops extend the duration of any spell that influences emotion, such as {spell/heroism} or {spell/rage}. If the tears are both genuine and freely given, the duration is increased by 50%. If obtained by trickery or magic, the increase is only 20%.",
			"",
			"***Vampire Dust:*** The carefully sifted dust of a destroyed vampire enhances spells fueled by negative energy. A single vampire yields only 1d4+1 uses of dust. Spells infused with vampire dust receive a +1 bonus to caster level. If the caster personally slew the vampire, the dust increases save DCs by +1 as well."

			"*The monstrous four-armed demon spoke in a surprisingly pleasant tenor voice. \"And what, pray tell, is it you so desire\"?

However, by expanding the boundaries of *wish* and *miracle*, you open up roleplaying and story opportunities that can keep your high-level game fresh and exciting for many adventures to come.",
			"",
			"***Types of Wishes:*** One of the first boundaries to set is whether or not all wishes are created equal, and have similar constraints. Treating all *wishes* the same has the virtues of consistency and simplicity, and helps keep your game under control. Having a hierarchy of *wishes* gives fodder for the story in your game, letting PCs alter their local reality with their wishes, but leaving the option of seeking out higher powers to grant the wishes spoken of in legends. A suggested hierarchy is *wishes* from spells or magic items, followed by *miracle*, *wishes* granted by artifacts and relics, *wishes* granted by powerful outsiders like the efreet and djinn, and finally those *wishes* bestowed directly by gods and other entities beyond mortal ken.",
			"",
			"***Making Good Wishes:*** The best *wishes* are short, unambiguous, related to matters immediately at hand, and usually aimed at a simple (if powerful) task. A *wish* for a sundered {magic-wondrous/mirror of mental prowess} to be made whole or a *wish* to reveal the identity of the thief of the crown jewels is unlikely to go awry.",
			"",
			"***Making Bad Wishes:*** *Wishes* born of greed or vengeance have a way of turning sour. Attempts to guard against mishap with a list of conditions and qualifiers are rarely successful, most often resulting in partial fulfillment of the *wish*. *Wishes* that stretch the limits of the power granting them are always ill advised. If the *wish* is from a spell or magic item, failure or backlash is likely, while if the *wish* is from an outside source, the granter of the *wish* may be angered by mortal temerity and twist the *wish* or otherwise seek retribution against the wisher.",
			"",
			"***Twisting Wishes:*** Folklore is filled with tales of *wishes* gone awry, bringing heartbreak, misery, and perhaps eventually wisdom to the hapless wisher. The *wishes* most likely to be perverted away from the wisher's intent are *wishes* granted by hostile outsiders, *wishes* from cursed objects, and bad *wishes* as described above. Evil outsiders in particular are loath to grant *wishes* that don't serve evil ends, and take every opportunity to twist them toward harm and suffering. A *wish* for eternal life may leave the wisher imprisoned in a decrepit yet still undying body. A *wish* for a powerful magic item can be granted by stealing the item from a powerful and vengeful lord. *Wishes* are best turned awry by adhering closely to the letter of the *wish*, but violating the spirit.",
			"",
			"***Deferred Results:*** Rather than denying a particularly powerful *wish*, such as for the throne of a kingdom, the *wish* can be granted over an extended period. The *wish* subtly reshapes reality, guiding the wisher through seeming coincidence, good fortune, and the timely appearance of helpful NPCs. Success is not assured unless the PC takes advantage of her opportunities."

It is also a great way to leave a mark on the campaign - after all, even the oldest magic items were once new to the world.",

			"Pricing a magic item is more art than science. Guidance on item pricing is given in {rule/Magic Item Gold Piece Values}, but a trip through the magic item section shows the formulas are often not applied exactly. An example is the {magic-ring/ring of invisibility}, with a calculated price of 10,800 gp, but a book value of 20,000 gp. This is because the at-will nature of the ring offsets the biggest drawback of {spell/invisibility}, namely that it ends after attacking. When pricing new magic items, watch out for any item that counteracts a basic weakness of an ability, class, or spell.",
			"",
			"The best test for item pricing is to compare it to \"must have\" items in the game, like weapons, armor, and stat-boosting gear. Also compare it to other items that share the same slot, and items with similar powers. As a rule of thumb, if you'd take the item in a heartbeat over a more expensive standard item, it is probably too cheap. And if you'd never consider taking a 10,000 gp ring over a {magic-wondrous/belt of physical might +2} or even a +2 battleaxe, it might just be overpriced. However, it is safer to price items too high rather than too low. After all, the PC gets a new, custom magic item out of the arrangement, and that's worth paying a bit extra."

			"If there's no effect in {rule/Magic Item Gold Piece Values} that matches the new item's powers, try looking through existing magic items for something that's close. For example, Seltyiel wants to add the bladethirst ability to his longsword, a power he's come up with that lets him draw the weapon as a free action. This is essentially the {feat/Quick Draw} feat, but tied to a single weapon. Even though it's a weapon enhancement, Seltyiel wants it as a flat cost, like adding fire resistance to a suit of armor. Looking over the ability, the GM decides that this fits well, since it doesn't really scale up with a more powerful weapon. {magic-wondrous/Gloves of arrow snaring} are a 4,000 gp item that grants a feat, so the GM uses this as the base price. Multiple different abilities on a magic item would normally increase this cost by 50%, but since the {feat/Quick Draw} feat would allow drawing items other than just a single weapon, the GM splits the difference and makes it a 5,000 gp weapon enhancement."
