			"A half-orc summoner who devotes himself to one of the bloody orc gods may believe his eidolon is an avatar of that god rather than a mere supernatural creature. A blood god disciple generally fights by the avatar's side and offers it blood sacrifices in exchange for martial prowess. A blood god disciple has the following class features.",
			"",
			"**Blood Feast (Su):** At 1st level, a blood god disciple can feed a recently fallen foe to his eidolon, allowing the outsider to channel some of its power into the summoner. The eidolon must spend a standard action to eat some of the opponent, which must be a living, corporeal creature killed or knocked unconscious by the eidolon or summoner in the past minute. This eating deals damage to the target as if the eidolon had attacked it with one natural attack (typically a bite). The fallen creature must have at least half as many Hit Dice as the summoner. Once the feeding is complete, the summoner may manifest one 1-point evolution. This lasts for 1 minute. The evolution's effects use the summoner's Hit Dice and ability scores rather than the eidolon's. The blood god disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He may only apply one use of this ability at a time (using it a second time replaces any evolution manifested with this ability), and can only manifest evolutions his eidolon has.",
			"",
			"At 5th level, when the blood god disciple uses blood feast, he may manifest one 2-point evolution instead of a 1-point evolution. At 9th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 3 evolution points or fewer. At 13th level, he may manifest up to two evolutions worth a total of 4 evolution points or fewer. At 17th level, he may manifest up to three evolutions worth a total of 5 evolution points or fewer.",
			"",
			"This ability replaces the summon monster I, III, V, VII, and IX spell-like abilities.",
			"",
			"**Bloody Gift (Su):** At 3rd level, when a blood god disciple uses blood feast to manifest an evolution, he may touch one ally and grant it that evolution as well. Each affected ally counts as one use per day of the blood feast ability. At 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th level, the blood god disciple can affect an additional creature with this ability (each one counting as a use per day of blood feast). If the blood god disciple can manifest multiple evolutions per use of blood feast, his selected allies manifest these multiple evolutions as well. This ability replaces the summon monster II spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Avatar Gambit (Ex):** At 7th level, when a blood god disciple dismisses his eidolon, he rages like a barbarian for a number of rounds equal to half his summoner level (he may end this rage early just like a barbarian, but if he does so, any remaining rounds of rage from this ability are lost). This replaces the summon monster IV spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Rage Power (Ex):** At 11th level and 15th level, a blood god disciple selects a barbarian rage power, which he may use when raging (whether from the avatar gambit ability or actual barbarian rage). This replaces the summon monster VI and VIII spell-like abilities."

This blood can be extracted from a willing or helpless creature as a full-round action that deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The offering grants the outsider a +2 enhancement bonus to the ability score of the blood summoner's choice and grants the blood summoner a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks and Charisma checks to bargain with it. The bonuses last for 10 minutes. The offering cannot be made to the same fiend twice in the same day. This ability replaces shield ally.",
			"",
			"**Blood Travel (Su):** At 8th level, a blood summoner can use his maker's call ability to allow his eidolon to travel through the blood of other creatures instead of bringing it to his side. The eidolon can either emerge from the blood of a living creature within range that has fewer than its maximum hit points remaining, or burst from the corpse of a Small or larger creature within range that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. If the eidolon emerges from an injured creature, that creature takes 4d6 points of damage, which is halved if the creature succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier). The eidolon appears in its choice of the nearest unoccupied square to the creature or corpse it emerged from, and is staggered for 1 round. This ability replaces transposition.",
			"",
			"**Fiendish Calling (Su):** At 10th level, the blood summoner's summon monster ability can additionally be used as lesser planar binding as a standard action, but only to call evil outsiders. At 13th level, he can instead use it as planar binding. At 16th level, he can instead use it as greater planar binding. This ability replaces greater shield ally.",
			"",
			"**Blood Possession (Su):** At 16th level as a full-round action, a blood summoner's eidolon can enter and control the body of any corporeal creature that has blood. This ability functions as marionette possession, except that the eidolon's body also enters the target and the target can be unwilling. A successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the blood summoner's level + his Charisma modifier) negates this effect. This ability can be used once per day at 16th level, twice per day at 18th level, and three times per day at 20th level. The eidolon can end this possession at any time as a standard action. If the host body is slain while the eidolon is possessing it, the eidolon is immediately ejected, takes 4d6 points of damage, and is stunned for 1 round. This ability replaces merge forms."

			"",
			"**Eidolon Brood:** At 2nd level, instead of a single eidolon, a broodmaster summons two Small eidolons to his side, each less powerful than the single eidolon of a standard summoner. Each eidolon has it own base form and associated base statistics and free evolutions. Regardless of the number of eidolons in the brood, each eidolon has the same base attack bonus and base saving throw bonuses, but the rest of the eidolons' base statistics must be divided between the eidolons, including Hit Dice (minimum 1), skill points, number of feats, armor bonus, Str/Dex bonus, evolution pool (but see below), and maximum number of natural attacks. Individual eidolons in the brood must purchase evolutions separately. Once a broodmaster decides on the forms and abilities of his eidolons, they cannot be changed until the summoner gains a level.",
			"",
			"**Example:** A 2nd-level broodmaster can summon two eidolons. Each eidolon has 1 Hit Dice, BAB +2, +3 on its two good saves and +0 on its bad save. The broodmaster decides to give the first eidolon 4 skill points, one feat, a +1 armor bonus, a +1 bonus to Strength, 2 points from the evolution pool, and a maximum of two attacks. The remaining 4 skill points, +1 armor bonus, +1 bonus to Dexterity, and 2 points from the evolution pool go to the second eidolon, but it gains no feats and can have only one natural attack.",
			"",
			"The broodmaster must dismiss all of his eidolons at one time. Likewise, all of the eidolons in a brood are banished if the broodmaster is unconscious, asleep, or killed. However, each eidolon in the brood is sent back to its home plane individually when its hit points are reduced to a negative number equal to or greater than its Constitution score. This ability replaces the summoner's normal eidolon ability.",

			"**Transposition (Su):** The broodmaster swaps his location with that of one eidolon in the brood with each use of this ability.",
			"",
			"**Larger Brood:** At 8th level, the broodmaster can spend 4 evolution points from the evolution pool for the large evolution; unlike with other evolutions, he spends these 4 points before he assigns evolution points to his individual eidolons (for an 8th-level broodmaster with 11 evolution points, this leaves 7 evolution points to distribute among the eidolons). This allows him to summon two Medium eidolons, four Small eidolons, or one Medium eidolon and two Small eidolons.",
			"",
			"At 13th level, if the broodmaster has purchased the large evolution for his brood, he can spend an additional 6 evolution points from the evolution pool for the huge evolution, distributing the remaining points among his eidolons.

			"",

At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing him to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of summon nature's ally IX at 17th level). Furthermore, at 19th level, the wild caller cannot use gate as a spell-like ability, but can use either summon elder worm or summon froghemoth instead. This ability otherwise functions like the standard summoner's summon monster I ability and replaces that ability."
