			"",
			"### Mixed Essence",
			"",
			"The Material Plane is the classic example of a mixed essence plane - here, reality is composed of a mixture of all forms of essence. In certain places, one form of essence might be more dominant than others, but overall they appear in this plane in relatively equal measures.",
			"",
			"On the Outer Planes, a different form of mixed essence composes reality: quintessence. This material forms the basis for all matter and life on the Outer Planes, and it is tied to the nature of the soul itself. Note that when quintessence duplicates another essence (such as earth or fire), effects that interact with that essence function as expected.",
			"",
			"### Air-Dominant",
			"",
			"Consisting mostly of open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating stone or other solid matter. They usually have a breathable atmosphere, though such a plane may include regions of acidic or toxic gas.",
			"",
			"### Earth-Dominant",
			"",
			"Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Visitors who need to breathe run the risk of suffocation if they don't reach a cavern or other pocket of breathable air within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (at a rate of 5 feet per full-round action spent digging).",
			"",
			"### Fire-Dominant",
			"",
			"Planes with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity to fire are soon immolated.",
			"",
			"Unprotected flammable materials catch fire almost immediately, and individuals wearing unprotected flammable clothing catch on fire. In addition, all individuals take 3d10 points of fire damage each round while on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes, while those that are made of water take 6d10 points of fire damage from the plane each round, rather than 3d10.",
			"",
			"### Water-Dominant",
			"",
			"Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can't breathe in water or reach a pocket of air likely drown. Creatures of the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes, and those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each round while on a water-dominant plane.",
			"",
			"### Negative-Dominant",
			"",
			"Planes with this trait drain the life out of travelers who tread upon them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes, drained of color, devoid of plant and animal life, and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those who died within them. {spell/Death ward} provides protection from a negative-dominant plane as long as the effect lasts, regardless of the strength of that plane's negative dominant trait.",
			"",
			"On minor negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of negative energy damage per round. When this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points or below, the creature crumbles into ash. Undead on a minor negative-dominant plane instead gain {umr/fast healing} 2 (this does not stack with existing fast healing an undead already has).",
			"",
			"Major negative-dominant planes are even more dangerous to the living. Each round, a living creature on such a plane must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or incur a negative level. A creature whose {rule/negative levels} equal its current levels or Hit Dice is slain and becomes a {monster/wraith}. Undead on a negative-dominant plane gain fast healing 5 (this does not stack with any existing fast healing an undead already has).",
			"",
			"### Positive-Dominant",
			"",
			"Planes with this trait are characterized by an abundance of life. Like for negative-dominant planes, the strength of the positive-dominant trait can be either minor or major.",
			"",
			"A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result of the positive energy infusing the plane. All living individuals in a positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2. Undead instead take 1d6 points of positive energy damage per round, and at 0 hit points they crumble to ash.",
			"",
			"A creature on a major positive-dominant plane must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be {misc/blinded} for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants living creatures fast healing 5. In addition, living creatures at full hit points gain 5 additional {rule/temporary hit points} per round that last until 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive-dominant plane. However, a creature that gains temporary hit points in this way must attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save each round that its temporary hit points exceed its normal maximum hit point total. Failure results in the creature exploding in a riot of energy, which kills it. Undead on a major positive-dominant plane take 3d6 points of positive energy damage per round and are {misc/staggered} during each round they take this damage."

Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly neutral-aligned planes impose a -2 penalty on the Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks of any creature that isn't neutral. The penalty is applied separately for neutrality with respect to law and chaos and for neutrality with respect to good and evil; therefore chaotic neutral, lawful neutral, neutral evil, and neutral good creatures take a -2 penalty, and chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good creatures take a -4 penalty."

Any spell or spell-like ability used on a wild magic plane has a chance to go awry.

			"| 48-51 | The spell functions, but shimmering colors swirl around the caster for 1d4 rounds. Treat this as a {spell/glitterdust} effect with a save DC of 10 + the level of the spell that generated this result. |",
			"| 52-59 | Nothing happens. The spell does not function. Any material components are used up, the spell or spell slot is used up, an item the spell is cast from loses charges, and the effect counts against an item's or spell-like ability's use limit. |",

Ethereal creatures can perceive objects, terrain, and creatures on the Material Plane as wispy, ghostlike images, but are themselves invisible to all on the Material Plane save for the supernaturally gifted. The ability to move through solid objects on the Material Plane gives an ethereal traveler incredible mobility, provided said traveler has a method of movement on this plane (see below). While traveling on the Ethereal Plane, a creature is insubstantial, invisible, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane.",

Not all souls succeed at this journey, however; the Ethereal Plane is receptive to potent emotion, and souls that died without finding peace may linger in the mists for a time. Souls that become lost or are unable to move on due to extreme emotional trauma at the time of death may return to the Material Plane as {template/ghost/s}, {monster/spectre/s}, {monster/wraith/s}, or other bodiless undead, while others are called back to existence by {class/spiritualist/s} to become {sidekick/phantom/s}. Folklore sometimes claims that incorporeal undead and outsiders somehow straddle the Ethereal Plane and Material Plane, existing on both simultaneously, but ghosts and other incorporeal creatures in fact have no intrinsic ties to the Ethereal Plane and can exist anywhere in the multiverse.",

There are no celestial bodies of note in this plane's \"skies,\" nor any innate analogue to \"north\" as far as navigation is concerned; while it's possible to use navigational cues from the faintly visible Material Plane, these cues can be confusing, distorted, or simply hard to see through the Ghost World's mists.",

A creature with a swim or burrow speed can use that speed to determine its halved movement rate instead. Creatures capable of flight or whose movement is based on non-terrestrial means such as ectoplasmic gliding can move at their full speed. Movement in this fashion is a purely mental action, and a creature that is {rule/paralyzed} can still move normally in this manner.

Beyond 900 feet, vision is obscured completely, although certain immense objects may be visible as lighter or darker shapes in the mist at great distance.

			"The Material Plane was not the first of its kind. In the earliest days of existence, before the creation of mortals and their realm, divinities created a rough draft - a prototype where they could test out different laws of physics and magic. Working through powerful proxies known as the elohim, the gods and goddesses populated this infinitely mutable landscape with countless forms of life. Every creature that could come to be was shaped and refined, every natural process examined. In the end, the goddesses and gods hit upon a configuration they enjoyed - yet they didn't simply declare their rough draft finished. Instead, they started over from scratch, abandoning their old ideas and painting the final version of the Material Plane over the top of their rough sketches. Thus, the First World was abandoned by its makers and the elohim proxies were freed to continue their own designs in the Astral Plane.",

Bolstered by its proximity to the Positive Energy Plane and the souls of the few mortal worshipers of the First World's demigods, the Eldest, the realm has become unnaturally verdant, bursting with growth. However, the First World is not simply a pastoral wonderland. It is a realm of infinite possibility and unbridled evolution, with natural laws changing from place to place to reflect the variety of half-finished versions tested out by their makers - the landscape constantly reinventing itself to suit the whims of powerful individuals or its own inscrutable desires. Its residents are equally mysterious, at once familiar and alien, with most living in harmony with a landscape of savage, primeval beauty.

These newcomer souls do not spend time as petitioners; instead, they immediately incarnate as fey creatures, and sometimes retain memories (but not class features) of their previous lives. What sort of fey the soul incarnates as seems random, determined as much by the desire of the soul's Eldest patron as by the capricious nature of the plane itself.",

			"Magic on the First World is mutable, confusing, and self-contradictory. Throughout most of the plane, the effects of spellcasting are unstable and can result in unexpectedly powerful or weak effects, but in certain regions of the realm wild magic holds sway - treat these regions as if the plane had the wild magic trait.",
			"",
			"For the rest of the First World, when a non-native spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + the spell's level; druids, hunters, rangers, and worshipers of the Eldest gain a +5 bonus on this check) for her spell to function normally. Failure means that the spellcaster rolls on Table 3-3: First World Magic to determine how the First World's energies enhance or decrease the effects of the spell as it is cast. Any spellcaster can voluntarily fail this caster level check to automatically roll on the table to determine the spell's effect. If the randomly generated enhancement or impediment cannot be applied to the spell being cast (for example, a result of increased damage when casting {spell/haste}, or a result of an adjusted duration for an instantaneous or permanent spell), then the spell is cast normally.",

			"The ability to bend the fabric of the First World to one's whim is an outgrowth of the plane's fundamental mutability and inconsistency, and thus the practice is difficult to codify into a single system of rules. Even on the First World, shaping is an ability learned through trial and error rather than taught - an expression of personality and sheer will - and no two entities go about the process in exactly the same way. The following notes give some general guidelines on how to incorporate shaping into your game.",
			"",
			"Shaping is not a simple matter, and an attempt to alter the morphic nature of the First World requires 1 minute of concentration by a character who is not {misc/fatigued} or {misc/exhausted}. This action provokes attacks of opportunity. At the end of this minute, the character must succeed at a Charisma check (DC = 20 + 4 per previous shaping attempt made in the last 24 hours). On a failed check, the character's ability to shape the First World is exhausted for 24 hours. If the character fails the check by 10 or more, she also becomes fatigued. Druids, hunters, rangers, fey, worshipers of one of the Eldest, and natives of the First World all gain a +4 bonus on Charisma checks to shape.",
			"",
			"On a successful Charisma check, the character can alter the First World by using a spell-like ability determined by the shaper's Hit Dice, as shown on Table 3-4. The shaper must begin using the spell-like ability on the round immediately after spending the minute of concentration required to shape in the first place, or the opportunity to shape is wasted. The spell-like ability resolves at a caster level equal to the character's Hit Dice or character level, whichever is higher. At the GM's option, similar spells of equal spell level can be allowed.",

			"A disorienting expanse cloaked in never-ending night, the Shadow Plane is a dark, twisted mirror of the Material Plane. It exists as an insulating layer between the Material Plane and the Negative Energy Plane, and it overlaps the Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, though its actual reaches are warped and distorted. Darkness covers the plane, yet shadows cannot exist without light. There is no day-night cycle in this world; the ambient light remains constantly at dim illumination, indoors or out, but the source of this illumination is never apparent. Shadows shift and move on their own as if the source of this mysterious light were constantly and randomly changing. While the perpetual gloom mutes most traces of color from the plane, it doesn't draw away heat, and thus the Shadow Plane remains relatively comfortable to most creatures.",
			"",
			"As a distorted reflection of the Material Plane, the Shadow Plane features many locations similar to those found on Golarion and elsewhere, but these counterparts are altered, sinister, and strange by comparison.

Despite the gloomy nature of the Shadow Plane, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected.",

In addition, certain spells, such as *shadow conjuration* and *shadow evocation,* modify the base material of the Shadow Plane. The utility and power of these spells here become enhanced (see above) as they are able to tap into the morphic nature of the realm.",

In primordial times, this plane was a single solid shell that barred all but the most acclimated or cunning species from entering. Since the Material Plane came into being, though, the essences of the other Elemental Planes - especially the adjacent shells of fire and water - have subtly influenced the Plane of Earth.

In practice, the warring between the shaitans and the efreet is limited to a specific conflict between the Opaline Vault and the City of Brass, and in general, shaitans harbor no enmity for their fiery counterparts, and the two types of genies sometimes even work together when their interests align.",

These elementals created such vast underground Vaults deep below the surface of many Material Plane worlds; on the world of Golarion, these Vaults lie in the realm of Orv, thousands of feet below the surface. Today, most of the xiomorns' enormous cities on the Plane of Earth lie abandoned, their inhabitants having moved on to expand their work throughout the Material Plane. Between the lands of the elemental lord and the shaitan empire's outer reaches, city-states, provinces, and nations rise and fall within the Plane of Earth's warrens.

			"Like the brilliant, fiery colors that dance within an all-consuming blaze, the Plane of Fire is both astonishingly beautiful and eminently hostile to most forms of life. Visitors able to safely traverse the Inferno are few and far between, as the plane quickly engulfs those without proper protection. Those who can endure its smoldering terrain - and the domains of its mercurial and often terribly cruel inhabitants - earn serious bragging rights back on their home planes, not to mention the wealth of treasure and adventure they might find here. For some elite explorers, the Plane of Fire's scintillating beauty is reward enough for visiting, though the dangers here are as unrivaled as they are alluring.",
			"",
			"Immense swaths of the Plane of Fire consist of rolling seas of fire, rivers of lava, volcanic mountains, and burning plains, and with skies filled with flame, smoke, and rains of cinders, the landscapes here are strange indeed. In some areas, searing, sulfurous fumes supplant all breathable air, but even those places with a breathable atmosphere are often so hot that organic materials instantly sear to a crisp. In other cases, massive columns of fire engulf whole regions and contain their own unique ecosystems. Much of the plane's solid and semisolid surfaces are seas of liquid fire, molten metal, flowing lava, or other hazardous materials. Rains of melted metal, incendiary mists, and volcanic eruptions occur throughout the plane, often randomly and without warning.",
			"",
			"### Exploration",
			"",
			"In a few choice places on the Plane of Fire, fire resistance or complete immunity to fire is unnecessary, as settlements such as Zjarra and the cruel efreet's City of Brass are carefully tailored to accommodate a variety of visitors. However, outside of these places, traveling on the Plane of Fire can quickly become deadly; even for those with immunity to fire, travel is perilous. Flying is the most direct way to travel on the Plane of Fire, though it is far from easy. Efreeti caravans use airships with fire-resistant exteriors and powerful magical ribs that keep them from collapsing upon themselves. Traveling with an efreeti caravan is expensive and usually dangerous, but it is often the best option for visitors.",
			"",
			"No day-night cycle exists on the Plane of Fire, and the skies above (or below, depending on your orientation at the time) are filled with ash, cinders, fire, and smoke. Travelers navigate via magic or the sighting of visual (or other) landmarks, but no direct analog to north exists on this plane."

			"With the Plane of Air serving as a vast sky and the Plane of Earth forming its floor, the Plane of Water is a breathtaking, endless ocean of salt and fresh water alike. Generally growing more saline with increased proximity to the Plane of Earth, the Boundless Sea nonetheless contains within its primeval tides vast pockets of pristine fresh water, salt-choked dead seas, freshwater rivers flowing in tandem with ocean currents, and even enormous bubbles of floating air, all of which contain their own unique and vibrant ecosystems.",
			"",
			"Sprinkled throughout the plane are even stranger features, such as enchanted springs that bubble into underwater pools, warping whatever wildlife lives within them, and pockets of acid and poison that form roiling lagoons and refuse to dilute into the surrounding ocean. Enormous, whirling torrents of blood and chum, too large to have formed through organic means, sustain environments incomprehensibly alien to all but the most savvy natives of this plane. Although the Boundless Sea's temperature is largely tepid, strong currents of ice-cold and boiling-hot water thread throughout it, imperiling those unfamiliar with the terrain.",
			"",
			"Most of the plane is liquid, but foreign elements can be found here as well, having fallen into the plane over the eons. For instance, hunks of rock from the Plane of Earth form vast floating reefs alongside fragments of lost cities and forgotten worlds. Enormous chunks of ice have also meandered into the Boundless Sea from the Plane of Air; on many such solid escarpments natives have constructed bustling cities, often alongside small populations of {family/ice elemental/s}. Jagged spires of solidified magma reach straight into the Endless Sky, while a handful of sunken spheres from the Plane of Fire light some portions of the seas, burning like underwater stars. The Boundless Sea's other light sources include gently filtered light from the Plane of Air and, near where it meets the Plane of Earth, massive, roving schools of luminescent fish.",
			"",
			"Water pressure remains even throughout the plane, allowing disparate life forms to travel throughout without much difficulty, and kingdoms and creatures alike can and often do grow to unfathomable sizes. Near the border with the Plane of Air, enormous storms occasionally descend into the turbulent waves, forming mountain-sized whirlpools and waterspouts. At the border with the Plane of Earth, the waters are clogged with iron and silt, and thermal vents shoot out jets of nutrients and superheated blasts of brine.",
			"",
			"### Exploration",
			"",
			"The simplest and most common way to traverse the Plane of Water is to swim, but this method is often not viable for non-aquatic planar visitors. Even those creatures to whom swimming comes naturally usually find that the plane's sheer vastness makes it nearly impossible to navigate with self-propelled locomotion alone. Instead, those on longer journeys use the plane itself, as the Boundless Sea is full of currents of all sizes, intensities, temperatures, and directions. Some currents are useless for travel, as they double back upon themselves or are controlled by notorious mephits and water elementals, but others are well-traveled routes of rushing water. For-hire ferries, both natural and manufactured, float through the Boundless Sea, many with magically sustained air bubbles that provide a habitable atmosphere for non-aquatic passengers.",
			"",
			"No standard day-night cycle exists on the Plane of Water. Some regions of the plane exist in continual darkness, while others are lit by way of sunken stars, luminescent fish, or simply a flickering, diffuse light from an indeterminate source. Travelers navigate via magic or the sighting of visual (or other) landmarks, but no direct analog to north exists on this plane."

			"The Outer Sphere revolves around the Inner Sphere, gliding upon a matrix of metaphysical material known as the Astral Plane, much as tectonic plates coast upon a planet's liquid mantle. This plane may seem to be an empty expanse of faint, shimmering, silvery clouds, yet astral space is a diffuse realm of colliding philosophies, eternally echoing thoughts, quintessential detritus, and undreamt ideas. Dispersed, these particles are barely perceptible. However, the Plane of Fire at the Astral Plane's heart churns this silvery sea with its physical and metaphysical heat, sending roiling currents coiling outward to eventually brush against the Outer Planes in a form of cosmic convection. As these currents collide, so too do concepts, legends, and raw quintessence, drawing in more and more material to form new islands of solidity or even entire demiplanes. Those new locales birthed near an Outer Plane often absorb that realm's ideals, whereas those spawned far from other planes can manifest the unspoken principles of nearby creatures.",
			"",
			"Cosmic convection by the Plane of Fire is not the only force to stir the Astral Plane. The River of Souls courses through this sea in a spiraling whorl imperceptible to most, yet the movement of souls is as powerful as any oceanic current for those with the tools to harness it. Likewise, the Antipodal Flow cascades back to the Inner Sphere in an opposing spiral, carrying the pulverized quintessence of the Outer Planes back to the Positive Energy Plane to fuel the cycle of souls. Both metaphysical waterways attract the attention of opportunists, be they {family/daemon/s} and {monster/night hag/s} hoping to snatch stray souls or enterprising wizards and cosmic filter feeders harvesting the Antipode's limitless potential - ultimately consuming mere drops from a deluge.

			"Axis is a bastion of immutable law set against the ever-crashing tide of pure chaos that is the Maelstrom. From the outside, Axis appears as a pristine city surrounded by a wall of gold amid a demolished wasteland littered with ancient, skeletal corpses of titans left over from a war during the Age of Creation. Known as the Eternal City, the Perfect City, or even Utopia, Axis is actually millions of separate cities folded and layered atop, within, and around one another in an elegantly arrayed masterpiece of architecture and city planning. Many of the city-districts within Axis are either a deity's domain or the remnants of a domain of a deceased deity. Magical portals at major crossroads connect the countless cities, aiding in navigation and travel. At Axis's back, looming impossibly tall, rises Pharasma's Spire - the foundation of the Boneyard.",
			"",
			"Before the rise of mortal life, the realm of Axis was a blank slate - an empty wasteland surrounding the base of Pharasma's Spire. As cities and laws were introduced by mortal acts, portions of the Maelstrom crystallized and broke away from that churning sea of infinite possibilities. These crystalline shards fell into the rough-hewn wasteland around Pharasma's Spire and became the Threefold Pillars of the Axiomite Godmind, allowing order and rigidity to manifest physically. It is from this seed, this Godmind, that the first axiomites emerged, and from them, in time, came their {race/aphorite} mortal proxies.",
			"",
			"Since its foundation, Axis has endured countless assaults on its walls from its enemies, but three legendary wars bear special mention. The first of these wars was against a legion of powerful proteans whose devastating assault resulted in the creation of the first inevitables as guardians and protectors of law. The second was a colossal conflict between the gods and titans, the scars of which can still be seen and explored in the wasteland that surrounds the city. The third and final war was against the Rough Beast {faith/Rovagug}, before he was sealed away by a collection of powerful deities, when he descended upon Axis in what may be the most devastating disaster the city has endured.",
			"",
			"### Exploration",
			"",
			"Adventures in Axis typically take the form of city-based intrigues. The day-night cycle in the plane is set and maintained by the will of the plane's most powerful and influential deity. Currently this is Abadar, and his will has synchronized Axis's day-night cycle with Golarion's, up to and including the turn of seasons. Likewise, Axis's inhabitants use north, south, east, and west as navigational aids. The First Vault always serves as the north pole, and the plane's border with the Maelstrom on the far side of the Wasteland is usually used as the south pole."

			"The Boneyard sits atop an impossibly tall and constantly growing spire of quintessence that extends from the edge of Axis and stretches up into the depths of the Astral Plane. Home to the goddess Pharasma and her court, the Boneyard serves as a beacon and destination for the River of Souls, from which the souls of the recently deceased arrive at the plane's edge and join enormous lines that wind through the realm, awaiting their final judgment to determine their place within the Great Beyond. For all its size and prominence, Pharasma's Court makes up only a small portion of the Spirelands; the majority of the plane consists of vast territories reminiscent of environments on the Material Plane. Determined travelers who overcome the Boneyard's systems for preventing accidental egress can also traverse the length of the Spire itself, a massive rock face riddled with yawning archways that lead into spiraling tunnels and staircases. Explorers have found truly bizarre relics in these shattered passageways, leading some to believe the Spire is what remains of a previous reality that has since ended. The origins of the Spire are shrouded in mystery - some legends speak of Pharasma creating the Boneyard and its Spire herself, while others claim that the Spire's existence predates the goddess. Pharasma does not answer questions regarding the Spire, but if anyone knows the truth, it is her.",
			"",

			"No day-night cycle exists in the Boneyard; the plane exists in a perpetual gloom at the far edge of twilight, as if the sun had been set for only half an hour. The gibbous light of the skull-moon Groetus illuminates the plane well, casting the realm into muted colors. This strange half-light functions as dim illumination, but it doesn't impede either areas of darkness or light created via magic or mundane sources. Pharasma's Palace - specifically, the goddess's throne within the towering structure - serves as the plane's pole, and {magic-wondrous/astralabe/s} or similar devices use it to set \"north.\" Inhabitants of the Boneyard use the word \"death\" in place of north, \"birth\" in place of south, \"before\" in place of east, and \"after\" in place of west - a tradition that can be quite confusing to newcomers to the plane.",

Doomsayers and pessimists suggest that this process isn't entirely efficient, and that each time a bit of potentiality is lost so that, in time, the ravenous grinding will consume all of reality.",

Likewise, on and below the surface of the Maelstrom's churning liquid Cerulean Void, gravity functions normally, with \"down\" being further from the surface into the sea of quintessence. The gravitational pull of the Cerulean Void generally extends to a distance of 200 feet above the surface (as such, it is rare for floating islands of solid matter to exist within 200 feet of the void), while the gravitational pull of a floating island extends to a range equal to its radius or 200 feet, whichever is a smaller distance.",
			"",
			"Beyond the Cerulean Void and the plane's solid islands, the churning chaos of its air functions with subjective gravity, allowing creatures to \"fall\" toward the Cerulean Void or other islands as they prefer, but only as long as escape from those objects' gravitational pull can be achieved."

This sole illumination provides Abaddon with an eerie half-light that never wanes or waxes, keeping the realm in a perpetual state of twilight with no discernible day-night cycle.",

A splash is enough to cause a {madness/fugue} state, while full immersion causes total {madness/amnesia}; in both cases, a player must attempt a DC 25 Will save to resist the effects of the waters.

Refusal or inability to pay the thanadaemon's price causes the fiend to abruptly overturn its vessel, hurling passengers into the Styx, as does any attempt to bring violence to any passengers aboard the craft. Fortunately for those who pay for passage, Abaddon's denizens understand these rules and do not attack those who partake of the thanadaemons' services. A thanadaemon can pilot its passengers to any location touched by the Styx in the Outer Planes in a matter of 2d6 hours, regardless of the actual distance traveled.",

A character who wishes to use the Styx to reach a specific location in Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell must succeed at a DC 30 Knowledge (planes) check to plot the course. On a successful check, the PC plots a viable course to the desired destination, and the journey takes 2d6 days to complete. If the check was a failure, at the end of the 2d6 days, the traveler ends up elsewhere in Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell, subject to the GM's discretion. At this point a character can attempt a new DC 30 Knowledge (planes) check to plot a new course, even to the previously attempted location. Each journey always takes 2d6 days to complete, regardless of how many attempts have been made to reach a destination."

Alternatively, a creature might fall far enough that gravity diminishes entirely, stranding the unfortunate entity for eternity. Some rifts eventually connect to other planes; the Abyss is known for its many passages and portals, but a rift could take a creature nearly anywhere in the multiverse, with no guarantee of safety upon arrival and rarely an opportunity for a return trip. Other rifts are truly infinite, leaving a creature to fall endlessly until it succumbs to starvation, suffocation, thirst, or the sheer madness of an unending plummet."

The Positive and Negative Energy Planes exert powerful tidal forces upon the Ethereal Plane, generating ethereal mists. However, these forces are not perfectly synchronized, and when the strain from opposing forces grows too great, the Ethereal Plane sometimes releases energy by coalescing ethereal mists into a demiplane. Occasionally, instead of forming a new demiplane, these mists graft themselves onto an existing demiplane, which expands to accommodate the new material. Meanwhile, in the Astral Plane, the ever-shifting currents of the River of Souls combine with energy from the Maelstrom and the Plane of Fire to produce massive, hurricane-shaped astral storms. Like hurricanes on Golarion, these storms have stable eyes at their centers. When conditions are right, the Astral Plane can release some of a storm's energy by creating a demiplane in its eye. These demiplanes can grow over time as they absorb storm-tossed fragments of the Astral Plane into their mutable structures. Astral and ethereal demiplanes are similar in structure, though the differences in their creation leave lingering effects. Because of the role of currents on the River of Souls in their creation, astral demiplanes bear fragments of the nature and memories of passing souls. Meanwhile, ethereal demiplanes can absorb echoes of dreams, most commonly from the pull of the Dimension of Dreams, and particularly from dreams tied to strong emotions. In the absence of outside interference, these lingering fragments determine the demiplane's properties and characteristics.",
			"",
			"While some demiplanes arise from planar forces, others are born when individuals deliberately fracture pieces of the Astral or Ethereal Planes and reshape them into pocket dimensions to suit their needs. Even mortals can weave demiplanes into existence with complex rituals or powerful magic. The most common reason behind the creation of demiplanes is a desire to isolate their contents. Demiplanes serve as ideal, protected havens for experiments, as well as for manipulations of time and space that would prove difficult or impossible to produce in other places.",
			"",
			"The true definition of a demiplane is a matter of debate. In its most restrictive definition, only self-contained pockets of reality formed from the Astral or Ethereal Planes and accessible via typical methods of planar travel - such as {spell/plane shift} - qualify. This definition excludes secluded places that the gods have formed by reshaping portions of other planes, such as {faith/Desna/'s} realm of Cynosure, and places that are difficult or impossible to access via standard methods, such as the mythical Akashic Record and {faith/Rovagug/'s} prison, the Dead Vault.",
			"",
			"Some demiplanes include the word \"Dimension\" in their title, as is the case for the Dimension of Dreams and the Dimension of Time. A dimension is a type of demiplane that breaks two of the common rules most demiplanes share. First, a dimension is always a Transitive Plane that overlays all other planes, including other dimensions. Second, a dimension is an infinite space that encompasses all of reality; it is never a small, finite plane. However, some scholars believe that dimensions are not demiplanes at all, and insist that other Transitive Planes like the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and the Shadow Plane are, in fact, dimensions.",

According to occult lore, the true Akashic Record is a demiplane deep within the {rule/Astral Plane} that contains all information in the multiverse in a single, vast visual library of psychic experiences collected and guarded by powerful aeons. Supposedly, these psychic records provide perfect and unambiguous understanding of all knowledge, and they present this knowledge on command. The existence of such a location flies in the face of nearly every other philosophy and tradition, including the death of prophecy in the Age of Lost Omens, and it would seem to negate all the mysteries of the multiverse.",
			"",
			"The truth of the Akashic Record is shrouded in its own mysteries and uncertainty. No known spell or ritual allows direct travel to the Akashic Record, and divinations about the demiplane often grant contradictory results. Some occult sources tell tales of those who reached the demiplane by piggybacking off the {rule/Dimension of Time}. The most reputable of those sources indicate that the planar travelers gained access to a sort of \"reading room\" of the Akashic Record's library with limited access to the record's knowledge, under the watchful eyes of {monster/lipika/ aeons}. The most extreme tales indicate that the travelers discovered how to alter the record and thus change the past, but supposedly those travelers were lost in the alternate realities their actions created or erased from the timestream.",
			"",
			"According to occult scholars, the crux that holds the Akashic Record together is a danava titan known as the Akashic Guru, a being made nearly invincible by her ability to automatically recall previous versions of herself from the Akashic Record, thereby undoing any injuries she might have sustained - up to and including her own destruction.",
			"",
			"As might be expected given the reverence with which occult scholars speak of the Akashic Record, its putative existence serves as a linchpin they use to account for countless phenomena. These range from humble psychometry all the way up to powerful magic that allows the mightiest psychics to emulate imperfectly Akashic Guru's signature power and restore themselves to a version from the past. Even arcane and divine scholars begrudgingly accept the effectiveness of such spells, but they maintain that the mysterious magic that could be explained by accessing the Akashic Record is not necessarily proof of the record's existence.",

			"Cynosure's presence manifests on the Material Plane as an immense, silvery-blue star that, on the world of Golarion, functions as the north star and is an invaluable aid in navigation. To those Desna welcomes, direct approach to this star does not blind or burn, but instead embraces in a welcome warmth before depositing the stellar traveler on the surface of the demiplane nestled within.",
			"",
			"Cynosure basks in eternal night, its sky a wheeling dome of stars that provides plenty of light to navigate by (treat this light as normal light rather than dim light, as if the star Cynosure manifests as on the Material Plane lit the realm softly while itself being invisible to the eye). The majority of Cynosure is a tranquil landscape of forest glades and luminous pools, interspersed with delicate dwellings of fluted crystal or many-pillared temples of alabaster and marble. When one gazes into one of its numerous bodies of water, the wheeling array of stars reflected within are in fact those on the opposite side of the plane, as if one were looking through Cynosure rather than at a normal reflection. These pools allow swift travel for those who know their secrets. The majority of Cynosure's inhabitants are its petitioners, known as the chosen dreamers. Statistically identical to the chosen petitioners of {rule/Elysium}, chosen dreamers radiate soft nimbuses of glittering starlight. Most were worshipers of Desna in life, but followers of the empyreal lords Black Butterfly and Pulura often find their way to Cynosure as well. Temples to any or all of the three can be found across the plane; the natives often refer to these three collectively as the Starlight Triad. Black Butterfly keeps a small realm within Cynosure. Pulura is a more nomadic demigod who prefers to spend her time in the vastness of the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"The azatas of Cynosure are often more serene and less wild than their Elysian kin, but they share the same love of beauty and freedom. Rarer are the cynosomas, the so-called \"moth angels\" of Cynosure. Shy and retiring, these delicate outsiders prefer the more secluded corners of the plane.",
			"",
			"Desna is the unrivaled ruler of Cynosure. Though she does so with the lightest touch, nothing transpires on Cynosure without her knowledge. She can reshape the plane at her whim, though her alterations are often of unparalleled subtlety - as gradual as the turning stars overhead.",
			"",
			"Desna's palace, the Sevenfold Cynosure, rests at the plane's heart, and it is this feature that functions as \"north\" in the plane. The palace constantly shifts and changes to match the goddess's moods and whims, from ephemeral mistiness to elaborate perfection. Despite this, those invited inside find it as perfect as the most pleasant dream, their every need anticipated and met.",
			"",
			"The Song of the Spheres is absent from Cynosure more often than not, preferring to wander the cosmos. When present, Desna prefers privately hosting friends or lovers rather than holding court. While Black Butterfly and Pulura are the most common of these, many deities have been known to accept Desna's invitation, from {faith/Sarenrae} to {faith/Shelyn} to {faith/Calistria}; tales hold that even {faith/Pharasma}, wearied by her eternal duties, once left her throne for a time to find solace in Desna's realm (and, some whisper, in Desna's arms).",
			"",
			"By and large, Cynosure is a peaceful place, with little to threaten those who share the realm's benevolent whimsy. The most common threats come from without - evil invaders crossing over from the {rule/Dimension of Dreams} or the {rule/Plateau of |Leng}, or malevolent spacefarers such as {monster/mi-go} or {monster/neh-thalggu/s} entering through the star paths. While the natives are long accustomed to repelling such incursions, any visitor who stands beside them in the demiplane's defense may be rewarded. These rewards rarely come in the form of material wealth: Cynosure's dwellers instead offer blessed dreams and wanderers' lore, solace, and secrets."

Rovagug's wrath and power were so great that those who stood against him were devoured; no records exist today to enumerate the number of divinities Rovagug consumed. In time, it became apparent that to prevent his destruction of the Great Beyond, Rovagug would need to be defeated, and as timing would have it, a group of divinities banded together to oppose Rovagug as he turned his attention to the Material Plane world of Golarion.",
			"",
			"The battle against Rovagug on primordial Golarion raged for an era, and the struggle saw the deaths of many more divinities until an unlikely alliance formed. These deities created the Dead Vault - a prison plane linked to Golarion, nestled within the planet's molten core. In the final battle against the Rough Beast, many gods and goddesses came together in cooperation. {faith/Calistria} distracted Rovagug while {faith/Torag} and {faith/Gorum} forged the shell that would become the prison plane, which {faith/Pharasma} then imbued with potent wards against escape. {faith/Sarenrae} delivered the blow that sent Rovagug stumbling back into the Dead Vault. [Dou-Bral](faith/zon_kuthon) drove the spikes of several Star Towers through the world to impale Rovagug within the Dead Vault and prevent him from hearing the prayers of his faithful. {faith/Asmodeus} then used a mysterious key to seal the Dead Vault tight, locking the Rough Beast away, it was hoped, forever.",
			"",
			"As time wore on, though, it became apparent that the Dead Vault is not a perfect prison. Dou-Bral's Star Towers began to degrade in the ages after his transformation into Zon-Kuthon, allowing the Rough Beast to once more grant spells to his faithful. This influence corrupted the inhabitants of the city of Gormuz. Sarenrae, in a rare fit of wrath, smote the city in hopes of quashing Rovagug's faith, only to open a vast pit that allowed Rovagug to periodically unleash his spawn upon the world (this act of Sarenrae's is one she regrets immensely). Yet the prison plane has held well enough that Rovagug himself remains imprisoned within to this day.",
			"",
			"To those who manage the nearly impossible physical journey to Golarion's molten core, the physical boundaries of the Dead Vault are visible from outside as a faceted, topaz-colored gem wrapped in vicious iron bands and innumerable binding runes. The gem appears to contain Rovagug's immobile form, like a bug encased in amber. Those who approach these walls find themselves repelled by an inexorable divine force.",
			"",
			"The interior of the Dead Vault does not actually exist within the world of Golarion, but rather is its own demiplane. It is a massive, hollow shell lit by faint flickers of sickly light and measuring hundreds of miles in diameter, where gravity pulls outward from the center with crushing weight, forcing those who visit to stagger or crawl upon the inner surface so that Rovagug's imprisoned form, impaled by the lengths of crumbling Star Towers, is always visible in the \"sky\" above. The primary inhabitants of the Dead Vault are Rovagug's petitioners, but the demiplane also hosts a population of creatures from the Darklands. Whether these creatures and their homes were locked in the Dead Vault at the time of its creation or came to be absorbed into the Dead Vault later remains one of the demiplane's many disturbing mysteries. The other major denizens of the Dead Vault are legions of qlippoth, once parasites clinging to Rovagug's flanks or following in his wake but swept up and imprisoned alongside him so long ago. Many believe Rovagug itself to be the most powerful qlippoth of them all - a possibility that begs the disturbing question of what deep, undiscovered Abyssal trough may have once served as his divine realm - but for now, Rovagug remains imprisoned far from that theoretical domain."

Even in the worst of circumstances, however, the lucid body is capable of fantastic - even impossible - feats. As a standard action a number of times during the dream equal to the creature's Charisma bonus (minimum 1), the dreamer can attempt one impossible action, such as casting a spell you can't normally cast, gaining an effect of a spell as if it had been cast, or conjuring a magic item. This requires a successful Charisma check (DC = 10 + the level of the spell being cast, level of the spell effect replicated, or half the caster level of the item conjured; nonmagical items are caster level 0). Other fantastic feats are also possible with GM approval.",

A solitary, transient door at the bubble's center provides a visiting creature with access to any moment in its own life, provided it can focus on the memory of that moment long enough to stabilize the doorway, an effort requiring a successful DC 30 Perception check. On a failed check, the traveler is cast back out of the Dimension of Time to its starting point and, depending on the nature of the ritual used, may suffer excruciating or devastating side effects. At the very least, a traveler thus rejected often find herself targeted by creatures such as the hounds of Tindalos. On a success, the traveler can pass through the doorway, whereupon she becomes an invisible and insubstantial presence in her own past, linked to her present body via a shimmering cord similar to the silver cords of astral travelers. {spell/True seeing} allows those in the past to observe the time traveler as a shimmering ghostly figure. Those who visit fragments of their own pasts can observe and listen safely, but someone who attempt to alter his own history never returns, erased from the timeline or trapped forever in an unending temporal loop.",
			"",
			"These journeys do not allow a traveler to truly enter the Dimension of Time, nor do they allow for the exploration of eras before one's own birth or in the future. For such a legendary feat, especially powerful rituals must be utilized. Most of what is known about the dimension has been gleaned from natives of the plane who have traveled beyond the realm, be they the lean and athirst hunters known as the hounds of Tindalos, powerful entities such as {family/time dragon/s} and danava titans, or the strange outsiders known as the iriis. Hints gathered from such creatures speak of a truly alien realm and of denizens composed of living temporal power who can aid others in traveling to and from the dimension. The Outer God Yog-Sothoth is said to be able to access the Dimension of Time, and he may even be a sentient manifestation of the dimension made terrible and aware. Certainly his avatar Tawil at'Umr knows the methods by which a mortal may travel to the Dimension of Time, yet the price such a traveler must pay is rumored to be terrible indeed.",
			"",
			"The true mystery of the Dimension of Time, though, is what actually exists therein. All indications are that the portion of the dimension that can actually support physical life is relatively small. What few hints of this reality have been gathered mention green meadows, sinister forests, an immense ocean that spills over a bottomless cataract, and a mysterious place known only as Stethelos."

			"Hao Jin was a legendary sorceress from the city of Goka in the Dragon Empires, but she has been absent from her home city (and indeed the Material Plane) for many centuries. The crown jewel of her collection was her personal demiplane, the Hao Jin Tapestry. She ripped entire cities and mountains out of their places on Golarion and transported them to this demiplane fully intact, where they were preserved in carefully controlled climates. She also used this so-called \"Woven Museum\" to safeguard her most dangerous artifacts and treasures, but after she left the Material Plane to travel into the Great Beyond, she hid her tapestry away from the world.",
			"",
			"Although the demiplane remained sealed away for centuries, it was far from uninhabited when the [Pathfinder Society](rule/aff_scholars) rediscovered and began to explore it. The places that Hao Jin claimed had not all been abandoned, and the descendants of these original peoples maintain communities to this day across the demiplane. The Hao Jin Tapestry is home to races from across Golarion, including {monster/dark stalker/s} whose ancestors once inhabited the Darklands and {monster/lizardfolk} descended from inhabitants of Osirion's deserts. Unfortunately for these inhabitants, Hao Jin's carefully sculpted climate preservation spells have begun to unravel. The demiplane has developed its own strange weather system from the interactions of its once-carefully controlled ecosystems. Rivers have changed course, deserts have flooded, and oceans have evaporated into salty plains. Those who live within the Tapestry fear that the end of their world may be nigh - and they may well be right."

She used her {eq-misc/Harrow deck} as the foundation and anchor for the realm and called the demiplane the Harrowed Realm.

They killed Sonnorae and devoured her body. This betrayal preserved their free will and granted each Conspirator additional power based upon the part of Sonnorae the Conspirator consumed, but it also gave them knowledge of the world outside of the demiplane and revealed the crushing truth that they would never be able to escape the realm of stories."

			"Jandelay is one of the Great Beyond's most enduring mysteries, perplexing even the great scholars aware of its most infamous and immense resident, the {monster/Oliphaunt of Jandelay}. Alderpash, the first Thassilonian Runelord of Wrath, may have come the closest to unlocking this enigmatic demiplane's secrets, but this was thousands of years ago and none have since come close to matching the now-imprisoned runelord's discoveries.",
			"",
			"Jandelay is a study in contradictions, a demiplane of stoic beauty and tranquil order adrift in the chaotic depths of the {rule/Maelstrom}. Lodged in this plane of entropy, Jandelay represents the antithesis of the Maelstrom, which inevitably restores reality to homogeneous chaos. Jandelay is a living monument to apocalypses, curated by a towering race of mysterious beings called watchers. Whenever a world comes to an end on the Material Plane, a fragment of that world merges into Jandelay. To a human observer, Jandelay might seem an incomprehensible and architectural chimera, a macabre patchwork of countless disparate biomes and edifices surrounded by verdant fields and punctuated with elegant alabaster spires positioned regularly throughout. But to the watchers, Jandelay's organization is perfectly orderly and logical. Fragments of dead worlds are absorbed into Jandelay in rows ordered by each world's time of death, not by whether the nearby fragments share any distinguishable similarities. Unless a major apocalypse, like a dying star, claims several nearby worlds at once, this generally means that there's no relationship between adjacent fragments other than their time of destruction.",
			"",
			"While the watchers stride Jandelay's streets and tend to its needs, the even larger Oliphaunt is Jandelay's greatest champion. Itself a being of utter chaos and destruction, the Oliphaunt might seem an unlikely guardian for a law-infused museum of forgotten worlds, and it might be tempting to theorize that the watchers have trapped it on the demiplane, or even created it and forced it to act as sentinel. But in truth, and despite their considerable powers, the watchers are nowhere near potent enough to achieve such a feat. The true creator of the Oliphaunt, the true warden forcing it to remain Jandelay's guardian and prisoner, is none other than the Oliphaunt itself. The Oliphaunt is a physical, living embodiment of the apocalypses that left the remnants from which Jandelay is made; much as morbid fascination causes onlookers to stare at the aftermath of a horrific accident, the Oliphaunt is compulsively drawn to these remnants of utter annihilation.",
			"",
			"Jandelay's petitioners, called the collected, do not serve a deity. They typically number one per destroyed world, each taken from among the last casualties in that world's apocalypse. While they still forget their own personality like most petitioners, the collected each retain factual information about their lost home worlds and can attempt any Knowledge checks relevant to their worlds' geography, history, and other vital statistics untrained with a +8 racial bonus. Most collected have never known visitors to Jandelay, but if adventurers were to cross the demiplane's threshold, despite being the first such travelers in eons, they would find that most collected are more than willing to share information about their lost worlds, at least as long as the inquiry comes in one of their worlds' long-forgotten languages. Collected cling to their own personal world fragments, and their afterlives are lonely existences, each an isolated oddity bound in a metaphysical cage while the watchers do little but watch, providing little in the way of company. Only the Oliphaunt's occasional rumbling presence punctuates their monotony, bringing with it a moment of nearly recalled panic and final desperation dangling like a stray thread of the petitioner's lost memories."

			"Leng is a realm of nightmares, a cold and desolate world populated by inscrutable alien entities. Although the Plateau of Leng is finite in size, the scope of its truths and horrors is incomprehensible to mortal minds. The demiplane consists of a vast wasteland plateau nestled between two mountain ranges that converge at the most distant point from the Dreaming Shore in a region known as the Cold Waste. {monster/Nightgaunt/s} and {monster/Leng hound/s} fly across the desolate landscape, searching for prey to bring to their dark masters. In scattered villages, such as the settlement of Lelag-Leng, degenerate, vaguely humanoid beings and the scaly, birdlike {monster/shantak/s} perform depraved rituals to appease their frightening gods. For those who come close enough to witness such gruesome acts, a quick death is a rare mercy, as these creatures' concentrated malice is enough to shatter the mind and scar the soul. Only the strongest-willed witnesses manage to avoid being inexorably drawn into the ritual themselves. Occasionally, the creatures bring their sacrifices directly to the Prehistoric Monastery, where a hideous high priest not to be described rules. Travelers who seek to escape Leng may think to flee across the ocean from the Dreaming Shore in hopes that they eventually return to the Dreamlands. The Dreaming Shore is far from lifeless, however. Humanoid-shaped creatures with fanged maws and voluminous robes, known only as denizens of Leng, ply its waters, bringing in slaves captured from both the Dreamlands and the waking world. Many of these ships are bound for Nameless Rock, an island where the denizens' moon-beast masters maintain temples to their unspeakable gods.",
			"",
			"Atop the rocky cliffs of the Dreaming Shore, the ruined city of Sarkomand betrays few clues of its ancient past. Here, denizens of Leng gather each night to trade and engage in dark and violent entertainments. Two stairways at the center of the ruins descend into the mysterious depths of Leng's underworld. Some of the creatures who dwell below defy any sense of reasonable proportion, such as the titanic bholes, whose writhing serpentine bodies stretch for hundreds of feet and end in gaping rows of hooked teeth. {monster/Leng['s version of] ghoul/s and ghasts} also lurk in these depths, with capabilities that far outstrip those of their familiar Material Plane counterparts. These ghasts are caught in an ancient war with {monster/gug/s}, a race of four-armed monstrosities whose heads split vertically into massive fanged maws.",
			"",
			"Leng's mountains are even more perilous. In the Spider Vales, {monster/Leng spider/s} lurk and plot vengeance against the denizens of Leng, who nearly slaughtered their entire race. They eagerly capture and torment anyone foolish enough to wander near their lairs. Another race of spiderlike outsiders, scarlet walkers, feed on the blood and tissue of living creatures.",
			"",
			"The true horrors of Leng's mountains increase as travelers draw closer to their highest, central peak. A row of sentient and malevolent statues marks the border of the Cold Waste, beyond which eternal night reigns. At the top of Leng's tallest mountain stands the fortified castle city of unknown Kadath, its towers reaching several miles above the mountain's peak and casting its dread shadow across the entire realm. Though it is nearly impossible to find sources who can credibly claim to have survived the journey to Kadath, it is said that strange and unknown gods from many worlds dwell within its chambers, with the Outer God Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos, ruling the city above all others."

The expansive caverns below the hill taunt mortal perceptions, twisting space and even seemingly slowing time to produce an endless and inescapable array of panic-inducing chambers. The House of the Bat is only one such chamber, one of the three realms of the bat god Camazotz. When travelers reach Xibalba, the plane watches and lurks, suffocating them in its raw malice. It plagues its targets with piercing wails of suffering and whispered threats, followed by stretches of oppressive silence to allow its victims' minds to dwell upon their situation. Over time, the plane slowly migrates these pitiable souls to the places best suited to enact their worst nightmares.",

Foremost among the sahkils are the demigod sahkil tormentors, who reign from the Black Pyramid at the city's center and concoct ruinous plots in the pyramid's halls and the nigh-infinite caverns of anguish below.",
			"",
			"Xibalba's nature defies narrow classification. From the outside, it appears to be a seamless part of the {rule/Ethereal Plane}, and unsuspecting ethereal travelers can wander right into it. Xibalba's borders reach out unpredictably into the ethereal mists, answering to both their own hunger and the sahkils' will. As an alternative to simply walking in from the Ethereal Plane, however, brave and foolhardy souls who wish to journey to Xibalba of their own volition can reach it directly using planar travel magic. Most such magic functions with cruel accuracy, depositing crusaders in front of the broken souls they wished to rescue or desperate lovers in front of the shattered remnants of their partners."

In this model, a dualistic cosmology would consist of only two Outer Planes, one for each divine force. The precise nature of those planes would rely entirely upon the nature of the gods in question.",
			"",
			"In one example, there is only a Heaven and Hell, with the mortals who lived a good life ascending to Heaven among the {rule/archons} and the wicked descending to Hell to receive punishment at the hands of {rule/devils}. The role of law and chaos is less relevant than that of good and evil in this setting, and any pair of the good and evil planes could stand in for Heaven and Hell. With one deity ruling each plane, the role of demigod becomes one of servitude, each demigod being an extension of the deity's will. A third, intriguing category could exist in the form of demigods who adhere to neither side of this eternal conflict, introducing such a category could erode the draw of a dualistic cosmology.",
			"",
			"Rather than good and evil, a dualistic system based on law and chaos might have a single plane of law and a single plane of chaos complete with a variety of lawful and chaotic outsiders. Depending on their actions and beliefs while alive, adherents of a deity of law might ascend to a lawful plane at the moment of their death, only to be punished for transgressions. By contrast, adherents of chaos might find themselves hurled into a realm that combines the whimsies of {rule/proteans} alongside the destructive horrors of {rule/demons} and the freedom-loving passions of the {family/azata/s}. This dichotomy need not adhere to the concept of alignment at all; instead, its deities could embody other dualistic concepts. For example, a deity of day could vie against a deity of night, with both having positive and negative areas of concern in their portfolios. This system might have one divine power enthroned within the First World and its rival dwelling in the Shadow Plane. Life and death. Love and hate. Fire and water. The possibilities are boundless."

A chaotic neutral woman with no religious beliefs might die only to reopen her eyes and find herself swimming through deep space, reborn as a protean amid a chorus of her kind. By contrast, a penitent man with deep belief in his goddess might die and awaken as a petitioner at her feet, staring up at a sky with alien stars - only to dwell physically there with her for eternity.",

What sort of world would exist in the absence of the celestial, infernal, and even the divine? Without the ever-present threat of divine justice and an eternal reward or punishment, what would such a world look like? Religion would most certainly still exist, but it would rely on pure faith rather than demonstrable divine intervention and direct contact with divine emissaries. Likewise, divine spellcasters would still exist, but their magic would be fueled solely by their internal beliefs (you may restrict choices to classes like {class/cleric/s}, who must select domains, or give players complete freedom as to which domains they wish to pursue for their own personal religions); they would no longer be direct servants of supernatural beings.",

Maybe there is no such thing as a soul, and all who die become {template/ghost/s} unless some other event transforms them into specific undead creatures. Where do these ghosts go? How many would remain behind to haunt the site of their death? Do ghosts simply remain invisible and unseen? Do they drift to the edge of the universe?",

A wizard seeking bloody, destructive revenge might channel his power to create a {monster/balor} and set the creature loose upon his enemies.

Scorched-earth tactics abound; armies of demons march en masse to the gates of Heaven as long as they can manage to physically travel there. The Four Horsemen personally lead their armies down the tree toward the Material Plane, promising their daemons the chance to feast upon all mortal life with nothing but physical distance barring the way. Travel is hazardous, more often than not a question of passing through a war zone as noncombatants struggle to weave between the encamped armies.",

Wars would still occur, of course, but with the only path of transit controlled by the outsider race that emerged from its very substance, the World Tree would be less of a war zone and more a neutral ground between the planes. Outsiders and even mortals could travel upon the tree's branches and up and down its trunk - if their journeys were the will of the World Tree and its chosen servitors. Instead of transit aided by spells and magical components, travelers would offer tribute to the living goddess of the World Tree, hoping for an answer to their prayers in the form of either safe passage or escort."

			"Planar travel requires far more planning than a simple trip to another nation. The first hurdle for explorers to overcome is reaching their desired plane in the first place. Travel methods fall into several broad categories.",
			"",
			"@HL[Spells:] Perhaps the most famous and versatile spell for planar travel is {spell/plane shift}, a reliable method for reaching the correct plane, if not necessarily the correct point on it. This imprecise spell deposits its targets potentially hundreds of miles away from their intended destinations. Thus, after arriving, travelers must orient themselves in an unfamiliar land and may have to contend with hostile threats for several days while they voyage. Some legendary mages have concocted ways to modify the spell to overcome this deficiency, but few spellcasters have proven capable of mastering these complex variations.",
			"",
			"The standard of precise planar travel is the {spell/gate} spell, capable of opening a temporary portal with perfect accuracy to almost anywhere in the Great Beyond. The most cautious and well-supplied planar traveler might consider foregoing traveling with his real form at all and use {spell/astral projection}, temporarily shifting through the Astral Plane and then creating a new body to face danger at his chosen destination.",
			"",
			"In addition to these versatile spells, certain more specialized magic can be used to reach specific planes, such as traveling to the Shadow Plane using {spell/shadow walk}. Travelers can even enter the Dimension of Dreams, a demiplane difficult to reach with conventional planar travel, using a {spell/dream voyage}. What these spells lack in versatility, they make up for in additional features that make journeys faster and safer.",
			"",
			"Returning home can be just as complicated as reaching another plane in the first place. If all else fails, travelers can resort to the same means that they might use to banish intruders from their native plane, casting {spell/dismissal} or similar spells on themselves to return home. As such crude methods risk shunting their targets onto other planes entirely, they are best reserved for desperate situations.",
			"",
			"@HL[Magic Items and Vehicles:] Not everyone who wishes to travel the planes has a practiced spellcaster who is interested in joining them on the journey. Fortunately, there are a variety of magic items well suited to the task of transporting characters between planes. Some of these items are best for those who aren't particular about where on the plane they wind up, such as a cubic gate or well of many worlds. Travelers on a budget can consider using {magic-wondrous/planar keystone/s} to unerringly reach popular destinations. The wealthiest travelers can splurge for more versatile options, such as an {magic-wondrous/amulet of the planes}. They might even purchase a {magic-wondrous/flying skiff}, a vessel capable of sailing between the planes, piloted by the mere thoughts of its captain.",
			"",
			"@HL[Planar Portals:] Planar portals join together specific portions of two different planes, allowing for travel in one or both directions. The most ephemeral of portals are those created by the {spell/gate} spell, which last for mere seconds. Slightly more durable, though often accidental, are **planar breaches,** temporary tears in the fabric of the planes that appear when a weakening of the planes coincides with a powerful magical effect, or when planes come into just the right configuration. Breaches are small, and without outside interference to keep them open, they tend to disappear within a few hours. The most stable types of planar portals are **planar tears** and **soulgates.**",
			"",
			"Tears to the Outer Planes litter the Material Plane. Perhaps the most famous tear in recent years is the Worldwound, a yawning gash connecting the Material Plane to the Abyss. Tears can connect to other planes as well, such as the portals to the First World that lurk deep in some forests where the fey hold considerable influence. Some planar tears, called elemental nexuses, connect locations on the Material Plane that are suffused with elemental energy to the Elemental Planes. For example, the heart of an active volcano may host a connection to the Plane of Fire, and a perpetual hurricane may hold a portal to the Plane of Water at its center.",
			"",
			"Soulgates are far quieter portals, and require specialized attunement or training to detect and activate. Soulgates typically connect planes with the same alignment traits, meaning that most such portals that appear on the Material Plane lead to unaligned planes like the Astral Plane or the Boneyard, but soulgates to various other planes are hidden throughout Golarion."

Everything in the Material Plane has analogues in the First World, but the First World versions are often exaggerated in some way. Mountains are taller, oceans are deeper, and forests grow at unusual angles. Colors are more vibrant, flavors more potent; everything is amplified to oversaturated extremes, the cause of which is the First World's proximity to the Positive Energy Plane.

Creatures are more vivacious, more energetic, and more fecund.

Any creature found on the Material Plane could conceivably be found in the First World, different from their mortal cousins in subtle or dramatic ways.

Some creatures even lead asynchronous lives, having memories of versions of themselves that have not come to pass (or may never) rather than just memories of their pasts. As such, natives of the First World do not always understand the concept of death; this can lead to deadly misunderstandings with travelers from the Material Plane or natives of the First World stranded on the Material Plane.

These breaches typically manifest as circles of mushrooms, puddles of water with a rainbow-hued surface, trees in a peculiar arch, or other seemingly innocuous patterns. Simply stepping through one of these portals is often enough to travel from one plane to the other, but breaches are not always two-sided. Some doorways to the Material Plane are one-way, stranding extraplanar travelers in a seemingly dull and lifeless world, while Material visitors to the First World could be stranded for decades or more as they try to find a way back home. Other means of traveling to and from the First World include powerful spells such as {spell/fey gate}, {spell/gate}, and {spell/plane shift}."

			"Sometimes rings of mushrooms known as \"fairy rings\" mark thin spots that function as gateways into the First World. When fairy rings become corrupted due to pollution, the effects of curses, the machinations of evil fey, or other fell influences, they can become unstable and dangerous, becoming phantom rings. These circles of magical mushrooms function like a magical trap (Perception DC 25, Disable Device DC 30), though a character can use the Survival skill in place of Perception to notice the danger presented by a phantom ring.",
			"",
			"A phantom ring typically occupies a single 5-foot square. A character entering a phantom ring must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be drawn into a gap in reality between the Material Plane and the First World, caught in a fragmented shard of the Ethereal Plane where she is unable to fully pass into the First World or return to the Material Plane. The character is invisible and ethereal, and she can see a dim and warped image of the Material Plane she just left, but she is unable to move more than 30 feet away from the phantom ring, which remains the only thing that appears solid and real in this ethereal pocket dimension. The character is trapped within this realm as if she had been called with a {spell/planar binding} spell.",
			"",
			"After 1d4 rounds, a disembodied spirit emerges from the phantom ring into the pocket dimension to confront the trapped character. This spirit appears as a spectral fey version of the trapped character, and it is treated as an {template/animus shade}, save that it is chaotic neutral in alignment and can exist only inside the pocket dimension created by the phantom ring. The animus shade might be friendly and talkative, or it might be cold, aloof, and demanding. The trapped character can attempt to bargain with the shade for her release, either into the First World or back into the Material Plane, but she must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to successfully persuade her captor. If the trapped character succeeds at this check, she can return to the Material Plane or enter the First World, but if she fails the check, the shade immediately attacks her. If the shade manages to kill the trapped character, it can manifest in the Material Plane, whereupon it is free to spread mayhem and its phantom ring dissolves away into sludge.",
			"",
			"A trapped character can bolster her chances of success when bargaining with the animus shade by offering a bribe of magic items or performing a service. Each animus shade's desires for bribes or service should vary, generally representing strange distortions of the trapped character's personality. For example, a trapped bard might be required to perform a humiliating display of self-mockery, or a barbarian might be required to undertake a diplomatic mission without resorting to combat. Services rendered to an animus shade take place in a {rule/mindscape>s} and typically require three out of five successful skill checks to complete. Bribes must be in the form of a valued magical item worth at least 500 gp per character level of the trapped character. If the service or bribe is successful, the trapped character can roll her opposed Charisma check twice (applying a +4 bonus on each roll) and use the better of the two rolls as her actual result when resolving the opposed Charisma check against the animus shade.",
			"",
			"A trapped creature can always opt to simply fight the animus shade, as both are on the Ethereal Plane, though neither can move more than 30 feet from the phantom ring. If the animus shade is slain, the trapped character reappears in the Material Plane and the phantom ring becomes inert for 2d4 days before becoming active again.",

Non-humanoids gain a +4 bonus on this Will save. Creatures that fail this save are driven to melancholy and are affected as if by {spell/crushing despair}, which persists until either the nonlethal damage is removed or the affected creature spends 24 hours outside of the weeping waste, whichever comes first; if no save is allowed to avoid nonlethal damage, no save is allowed against this {spell/crushing despair} either. In addition to the spell's usual effects, affected creatures cannot benefit from morale effects.",

They become blindly trusting, taking a -5 penalty on Sense Motive checks and a -2 penalty on saves against charm effects, and they take a -5 penalty on initiative checks if combat begins directly after they converse with an intelligent creature. This lonely desperation persists for 1d4 days after leaving the weeping waste."

			"In the case of technological items, artifact status refers to an item that is beyond the means of anyone on Golarion to create or replicate, as well as beyond conventional measures of value. Unlike magical artifacts, technological artifacts can be destroyed just as other items could, and indeed may be quite fragile.",
			"",
			"### Power Generators",
			"",
			"Power generators are a specific type of technological artifact capable of providing large amounts of sustained energy, and that can supply charges to entire compounds. Every robot has a dedicated power generator within it that provides enough energy to run that robot and nothing more. Generators that are free-standing devices or built into complexes can be used to charge technological items capable of being recharged. A device hooked directly to a functioning power generator uses the generator's energy rather than its own stored energy.",
			"",
			"Generators are large, cumbersome devices that are difficult, if not impossible, to move. They must be built on site or into vehicles large enough to transport their heavy bulks. Most of the generators have long since fallen into disrepair, and those few that still function are jealously defended. Some wonder if portable generators exist, but no one has found evidence of any.",
			"",
			"The total amount of energy a generator can provide is known as it's yield - the number of charges it generates per hour. A portion of this yield may be dedicated to devices directly wired into it, such as keeping infrastructure running in a complex-this is referred to as dedicated yield. Dedicated yield isn't available for other purposes while it's providing power to those devices. A generator's available yield is what's left over, and can be used to power or recharge devices that can be removed.",
			"",
			"Two items can be used to draw power from a generator: a power cable and a power receiver. A generator's integrated power transmitter can broadcast power to a receiver within 1,000 feet unless otherwise noted. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the receiver.",
			"",
			"An item that uses a set number of charges per hour reduces a generator's available yield by that amount, making the yield dedicated while the item is attached, as if the item is hard-wired into the generator. An item that uses 1 or more charges each time it's activated (such as most weapons) reduces the generator's yield by that amount each time it is activated. For example, a laser pistol would consume 1 charge from the yield each time it's fired. A nuclear resonator, on the other hand, consumes 5 charges each time it's fired - thus, when attached to a generator, it consumes 5 charges from the generator's yield each time it's used.",
			"",
			"A generator can be forced to exceed its yield, but this can result in disaster. Whenever charges are drawn from a generator in excess of its yield, the generator must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1 per charge over that hour's yield + 5 per incidence of exceeded yield in the past hour). Success indicates that the generator outputs the additional charges (with a 5% chance that the item glitches as though it were timeworn). Failure indicates that the generator doesn't deliver the additional charges and the item doesn't activate. If it fails by 5 or more, the generator shuts down, cutting off all power to all items using it, and cannot be restarted for 1 hour. (Restarting a generator that's shut down in this way requires a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, but other actions may be necessary as well at the GM's discretion.) If a generator fails this Fortitude save by 10 or more, it explodes - the details of this explosion vary by generator type. (Other circumstances may cause a generator to explode, with the DC at the GM's discretion.)",
			"",
			"All generators have hardness and hit points. An active generator that is reduced to 0 hit points must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or explode. All generators are Colossal objects, and thus have an AC of -5. Most generators emit a lot of noise, steam, and other distracting elements, penalizing Perception checks attempted to perceive anything within 60 feet (other than the generator) by the indicated amount."

Using a crafting lab to build a high-tech item consumes an amount of power each day. Days when the crafting lab is without power effectively delay continued construction of a high-tech item, but time already spent building the item is not lost. In addition, crafting an item requires an expenditure of time (from a character with the appropriate crafting feat) and an expenditure of money used to secure the technological components and expendable resources needed for the work.",

When determining the required time, ignore any fixed costs such as the weapon portion of implanted weaponry.",

Ideally, the creator can work for at least 4 hours at a time uninterrupted, but if this is not possible (such as while adventuring), the creator can devote 4 hours of work broken up over the day, accomplishing a net of 2 hours of progress. Work under distracting or dangerous conditions nets only half the progress as well. If the creator can't dedicate at least 4 hours of work during a day (even if broken up or under distracting conditions), any work performed that day is wasted.",
			"",
			"A character can work on multiple technological items at a time, or even in the same day as long as at least 2 hours net labor can be spent on each item. This doesn't let a creator exceed the limits on work accomplished in a single day, but does require separate power expenditures for each item (working on multiple projects at a time is not particularly energy efficient).",

			"Among the most marvelous of technological wonders are artificial intelligences. Each artificial intelligence (or AI) has its own personality and interests, but its actual ability to interact with the world requires a being installed into a robot or structure (known as a host).",
			"",
			"When an AI is installed in a technological structure with an integrated computer network, it can manipulate anything that is connected to that structure, such as traps, doors, or weapons. To destroy an AI in a host structure, either the physical device that contains the AI's programming must be destroyed (the magnitude of this task can vary widely - the host may be merely a single computer with hardness 10 and 20 hit points or an entire building that must be destroyed over multiple encounters or adventures) or all three of its ability scores must be reduced to 0 via ability drain effects directed at the AI's core processor (typically a large computer in the most well-defended part of a complex, but sometimes a processor housed in a robot). Ability damage dealt to an AI at best merely inconveniences it, and at worst renders it comatose for a limited time.",

			"An AI that is installed in a robot enhances that robot with the {template/aggregate/ template}."

			"An artificial intelligence's stat block is similar to that of an intelligent magic item. Note that these statistics reflect only the intelligence itself, not the host. Building an AI stat block requires the following statistics.",
			"",
			"@HL[CR:] An artificial intelligence's CR sets its ability scores, saves, and skill checks. It also sets its XP value for defeating it - this award is typically granted as a story award once the AI has been overcome, but in some cases (such as when an AI is installed in a single robot), this XP award is replaced by the standard XP for defeating that robot.",
			"",
			"@HL[Alignment and Type:] An AI can be any alignment. Its type is \"artificial intelligence,\" and it counts as a construct for all effects that target creature type.",
			"",
			"@HL[Initiative:] The installed AI modifies its initiative check with its Intelligence modifier, not its Dexterity modifier.",
			"",
			"@HL[Senses:] An AI needs access to a robot, cameras, microphones, or other mechanical sensory tools in order to be able to notice things in the outside world. These senses should be listed in the appropriate encounter areas, not in the AI's stats, since it's likely that an AI will have access to a variety of sensory devices over a large area.",
			"",
			"@HL[Defenses:] An AI doesn't have an AC, hit points, or other statistics related to a physical form; it relies on its host robot or structure for those scores. An AI uses its own saving throws only against attacks that target its mind - in most cases, this means it primarily uses its Will save. An AI uses its CR as its effective Hit Dice for determining its base saves - it has good Will saves and poor Fortitude and Reflex saves.",
			"",
			"@HL[Ability Scores:] An AI's base ability scores are 14, 12, and 10. Arrange them in any order desired. For every 2 points of CR it possesses, it gains a +2 bonus to an ability score (assigned by the GM).",
			"",
			"@HL[Skills:] An AI has skill points equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier per point of CR. An AI has a number of class skills equal to its Charisma modifier. These may be any skill, though the most common class skills for AIs are: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (all), Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive.",
			"",
			"@HL[Feats:] An AI has a number of feats equal to half its CR (minimum 1). An AI must meet all prerequisites of its feats. AIs also gain {feat/Technologist} as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"@HL[Languages:] AIs speak Androffan. An AI knows a number of additional languages equal to its {rule/Intelligence} modifier.",
			"",
			"@HL[Special Abilities:] Use this section to cover any unusual abilities the AI possesses."
