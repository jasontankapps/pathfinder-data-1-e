It is one of the primary training academies of universalist magic on Golarion, and the wizards who graduate from the school become well respected, well paid, and highly soughtafter in their homelands. An Arcanamirium crafter is one of the builders of the arcane world, assembling magic items with facility, skill, and power. He is intimately familiar with the craft and practice of imbuing items with arcane power, and works with precision even early in his career to help create some of the most powerful magic items of Golarion.",

You must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

Invoking the spirits takes 10 minutes, during which time the wind listener must be free of distractions and able to concentrate. Once called, the spirits seek out information on the subject of the wind listener's inquiries. This functions as the spell {spell/legend lore} (caster level equal to the wind listener's level), except that the wind listener is free to engage in other activities while spirits investigate on his behalf. The time required for the air spirits to return with this information is equal to what the casting time of the spell legend lore would have been if the wind listener had cast it. The wind listener can use this ability once per week, and only if he does not currently have air spirits searching for information. If the air spirits are currently searching for information, the wind listener can end their task early as a standard action, dismissing the magical effect and not returning any information. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level."

			"Worldseekers are wizards who travel to all corners of the Great Beyond. While neophytes must content themselves with study and practice, the most powerful worldseekers are movers and shakers throughout the Great Beyond, power players of whom even demigods take note. Worldseekers are rare sights on Golarion, but among those few, more are trained in Kyonin and Nex than any other nation; those in Kyonin explore the potential of using elf gates to travel beyond this realm, while those in Nex emulate some of the dimensional exploits of Nex's legendary founder.",
			"",
			"Most worldseekers prefer not to specialize in a school of magic, for having a diverse array of available spells is a boon when exploring the countless wonders of the Great Beyond. Those who do specialize usually do so as conjurers. Conjuration is a poor choice of oppositional school for a worldseeker.",
			"",
			"**Walk the Planes (Sp, Su):** A worldseeker learns every plane's place in the Great Beyond and trains to survive even on the harshest of them. She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks and is constantly under the effects of {spell/endure elements}.",
			"",
			"This replaces Scribe Scroll.",
			"",
			"**Planar Adaptation (Su):** At 8th level, a worldseeker is continually protected from planar environments as by planar adaptation. At 15th level, she can extend that benefit to all allies within 30 feet of her.",
			"",
			"This replaces the school ability normally gained at 6th or 8th level.",
			"",
			"**Planar Associates (Ex):** A worldseeker's travels and dealings across the planes allow her to make connections she can call upon when necessary to gain assistance without needing to resort to planar binding. A worldseeker must choose a {ability/familiar} for her arcane bond. At 5th level, she gains {feat/Improved Familiar} as a bonus feat and must choose an outsider familiar that matches her alignment exactly; she can choose an outsider in this way even if it normally requires a 7th-level spellcaster as its master.",
			"",
			"At 7th level, a worldseeker automatically learns lesser planar ally as a 4th-level wizard spell. She automatically learns planar ally as a 6th-level wizard spell at 11th level, and greater planar ally as an 8th-level wizard spell at 15th level. She can swap out a prepared spell of an equal spell level to spontaneously cast any of these three spells (one 4th-level spell for lesser planar ally, a 6th-level spell for planar ally, and a 8th level spell for greater planar ally).",
			"",
			"The first time each day she casts one of these three spells, the worldseeker reduces the gp value of the material component cost by an amount equal to her caster level &times; 100 (to a minimum cost of 0 gp).",
			"",
			"This alters arcane bond and replaces the bonus feat gained at 5th level.",
			"",
			"**Planar Redoubt (Sp):** At 15th level, a worldseeker creates a planar redoubt, a personal demiplane to which she can retreat to rest and plan. This functions like lesser create demiplane, except the demiplane is up to a single 50-foot cube in size and is permanent.",
			"",
			"This replaces the bonus feat gained at 15th level."
