While the call seizes the changelings' minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.",
				"",
				"Not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling's core.",

				"A changeling character can take an arcane malignancy as a drawback in order to select an additional trait at character creation. Randomly determine the arcane malignancy by rolling a d% and consulting the table below.",
				"",
				"| d% | Arcane Malignancy |",
				"| --- | --- |",
				"| 1-2 | The smallest three toes on each of your feet have fused together. You take a -2 penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, and Perform (dance) checks. |",
				"| 3-4 | Your incisors grow so long and sharp that you have difficulty eating. Eating takes twice as long. Consuming a potion or other magical foodstuff requires a full-round action. |",
				"| 5-7 | You have an extra digit on each hand, which hampers your fine motor skills. You take a -2 penalty on Craft, Disable Device, and Sleight of Hand checks. |",
				"| 8-10 | Your limbs and torso are covered with piscine scales that you must constantly moisten. If more than 1 day passes without you applying at least a gallon of water to them, you take 1d3 points of damage each hour until you do so. |",
				"| 11-13 | Your skin bears a sizable scarlet mark that flushes and lightens with your moods. You take a -2 penalty on Bluff and Disguise checks. |",
				"| 14-16 | One of your eyes has grown enlarged and developed a pale, milky film. Daylight seems uncomfortably bright to you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against light-based spells and effects, and you are automatically dazzled for 1d6 rounds when exposed to bright light or sunlight. |",
				"| 17-19 | The soles of your feet are flat, and you tire quickly. You can hustle for only a half hour before becoming fatigued, and every 4 hours spent traveling by foot in a day deals 1 point of Constitution damage. |",
				"| 20-22 | Your already pallid complexion grows unusually sensitive to the rays of the sun. Exposure to direct sunlight for more than 1 hour at a time makes you sickened for 24 hours. |",
				"| 23-25 | The tip of your tongue is forked and stiff. You have difficulty making yourself understood. You take a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks to fool or persuade others. |",
				"| 26-28 | The painful and stiff swelling of your joints puts you at a disadvantage in combat. You take a -2 penalty on combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to free yourself when grappled or pinned. |",
				"| 29-31 | Your ears have stretched to an abnormal size, making you overly sensitive to loud noises. Whenever you are dealt sonic damage, you take 1 additional point of damage, and you are deafened for 1 minute whenever you take damage from any sonic effect. |",
				"| 32-33 | The pupils of your eyes resemble a cat's, and beasts cannot abide your presence. You take a -2 penalty on Handle Animal and Ride checks. |",
				"| 34-35 | You grow velvety-soft fur along your back, arms, and legs that chafes and catches under clothing and armor, increasing the armor check penalty of any armor by 1 and applying a -1 armor check penalty to ordinary clothing. Clothing and armor can be specially fitted for you, eliminating the increased penalty but increasing their price by 50 gp. |",
				"| 36-37 | You grow an extra row of sharp, crooked teeth. The uneven set of your jaws gives you constant headaches. You take a -2 penalty on concentration checks and saving throws against pain effects. |",
				"| 38-40 | It is nearly impossible to find armor that fits your concave chest and unusually narrow, sloping shoulders. The armor check penalty of any armor you wear increases by 1, and you take a -1 penalty to AC when wearing medium or heavy armor. |",
				"| 41-42 | Your throat balloons out like a frog's, and your voice comes out as an odd croak. You take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks and on Perform (act, oratory, and sing) checks. |",
				"| 43-45 | An oozing sore has developed on your face that refuses to heal and makes you more susceptible to illness. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against disease. |",
				"| 46-48 | Your flesh grows bark, and your major joints have become gnarled and knotted like tree limbs, causing you to move slowly and stiffly. You take a -2 penalty on Reflex saves. |",
				"| 49-51 | Your thin, almost translucent skin is delicate and tears easily. You take 1 point of bleed damage from slashing attacks that deal at least 1 point of damage to you. |",
				"| 52-54 | A massive patch of multicolored warts covers much of your face. People cannot help but stare, and they always remember you once they've seen you. You take a -4 penalty on Disguise checks. |",
				"| 55-57 | Your unruly hair grows with alarming speed. If you do not spend 1 hour trimming and grooming your hair every 48 hours, it snarls in nearby foliage whenever you are outdoors, imposing a -2 penalty to your Armor Class and on attack rolls and Stealth checks. |",
				"| 58-60 | Your limbs are thin and frail. You take a -2 penalty to CMD against disarm, grapple, and trip attempts. |",
				"| 61-63 | Your bones shatter as easily as glass. You take 2 additional points of damage each time you are hit by an attack made with a bludgeoning weapon. |",
				"| 64-65 | One arm is turning to stone, though you retain limited mobility. You take a -4 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of two hands and on attack rolls when wielding a two-handed weapon or fighting with two weapons. |",
				"| 66-67 | You develop an allergy to one spell per spell level from the witch spell list (determined by your GM). Casting or being the target of a spell you're allergic to causes you to break out in a painful rash. This rash deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level, and imposes a penalty on your Charisma equal to the level of the spell. The rash fades after a number of hours equal to the level of the spell. |",
				"| 68-69 | The joints in your unnaturally long thumbs have fused, and you often fumble objects. When you retrieve a stored item, you have a 10% chance of dropping it. |",
				"| 70-72 | Your knees bend backward like a bird's, which makes many athletic movements difficult to master. You take a -2 penalty on Climb and Swim checks, and your running speed is only three times your regular walking speed. |",
				"| 73-75 | A tenacious patch of fungus has sprouted on your back, weakening your system against toxins. You take a -2 penalty on saves against poison effects. |",
				"| 76-77 | Your misaligned eyes affect your ability to judge distances. You take a -2 penalty on ranged attack and damage rolls. |",
				"| 78-80 | When you get flustered, heat builds up in your face until it glows with inner fire. You take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Perform checks when in the presence of 5 or more creatures. |",
				"| 81-83 | Your ears curl up like dried leaves, and you experience difficulty picking up sounds. You take a -2 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks. |",
				"| 84-86 | Your curving, clawlike fingernails grow so long so quickly that they impede you in dangerous situations. You take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and Sleight of Hand checks. |",
				"| 87-89 | One of your legs measures noticeably longer than the other, and you lose your balance easily. You take a -2 penalty to CMD against bull rush and trip attempts. |",
				"| 90-92 | Your eyes have swollen to mere slits. You take a -2 penalty on sight-based Perception checks. |",
				"| 93-96 | You develop a shaggy pelt about your neck and shoulders that makes you overheat quickly. You take a -4 penalty on checks and saves to resist environmental heat effects. |",
				"| 97-98 | You grow a tail that you can't easily conceal and that thrashes violently at inconvenient moments. You take a -2 penalty on Disguise and Stealth checks. |",
				"| 99-100 | You grow vestigial gills. While they grant you no ability to breathe in water, they make it harder for you to catch your breath. When you are fatigued, it takes 12 hours of complete rest to recover. When you are exhausted, it takes 2 hours of complete rest to become fatigued. |"

Whenever the object of your attachment is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, you take a -1 penalty on Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects.

Whenever monetary treasure is divided, you must end up with a greater share of that treasure than your companions or you're wracked with feelings of jealousy and ill will. When treasure is divided, if you do not end up with at least 10% more treasure than any other individual companion does, you have a hard time being helpful to your allies. You become irritable, and can't take the aid another action for the next week."

				"You were reported to a dangerous authority such as the Gray Gardeners of Galt, the high inquisitors of Cheliax, or the Council of Mwanyisa of Mzali, and narrowly escaped death. You second-guess your instincts constantly, leaving you never sure whether or not to trust someone and endangered if you encounter that group's agents again. You can roll twice and take the lower result on Sense Motive checks to get hunches. You cannot reroll this result, even if you have another ability that would normally allow you to do so."

				"",
				"You were badly burned once by volcanic ash, torch-wielding mobs, or some fiery accident, and the scars pain you terribly you whenever you are too near to fire. You take a -1 penalty on saving throws against fire effects. In addition, whenever you are adjacent to open flames or are on fire, you take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until you spend an entire round away from fire. These penalties are not cumulative. (An instantaneous fire effect adjacent to you or affecting you causes this penalty to apply until 1 round after it is gone.)"

				"## {trait/Condescending}",
				"",

You take a -5 penalty on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to improve other creatures' attitudes toward you."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Cowardly}",
				"",
				"You might face dangerous situations with bravado, but you are constantly afraid. Your base speed when frightened and fleeing increases by 5 feet, and the penalties you take from having the cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken conditions increase by 1. If you would normally be immune to fear, you do not take these penalties but instead lose your immunity to fear (regardless of its source)."

			[
				"## {trait/Empty Mask}",
				"",
				"You have spent so long hiding your true identity to escape political enemies that you have lost much of your sense of self. You take a -1 penalty on Will saving throws against compulsions. This penalty increases to -2 against foes who know your true identity."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Entomophobe}",
				"",
				"A harrowing experience with insects when you were young instilled in you a deep-seated fear of vermin of all description, especially when they swarm together. You take a -2 penalty on attacks against vermin, and you take a -2 penalty on saving throws against the nauseated condition of a swarm's distraction ability."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Envy}",
				"",
				"You grew up in or near an opulent, decadent culture that valued nothing more than showing up the material wealth or accomplishments of others, causing the seed of envy to be planted in your heart. For each day you spend without stealing at least 10 gp worth of valuables or other wealth, attempt a DC 20 Will save. If you fail, you take a cumulative -1 penalty on Will and Reflex saving throws and concentration checks (up to a -5 penalty). If you succeed, the penalty is reset to 0."

			[
				"## {trait/Family Ties (Drawback)}",

When a family member makes a request of you, you must fulfill that request or take a -2 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based ability checks and skill checks until you either do what was requested or succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw, which you can attempt once per day at the start of each day. You can't take this drawback if you have no family. If you ever lose your family or lose contact with your family, exchange this drawback for the Doubt drawback."

				"## {trait/Fey-Taken}",
				"",
				"As a child, you were whisked away to the First World by mischievous fey for a time. When you returned, you were ever after considered odd and distant. You long to return there, and find the mortal world dull and at times revolting, so you do not eat as you should and do not question strange visions. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws against disease, illusions, and poison of all kinds, as well as against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of fey."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Forgetful}",
				"",
				"You are easily distracted and prone to forgetting important things. Whenever you leave a location you have been at for longer than 1 hour, you must attempt a DC 10 Wisdom check. If you fail, you leave behind one random mundane item (a purse of money counts as an item)."

			[
				"## {trait/Foul Brand}",
				"",
				"You have the symbol of an evil deity burned into your flesh. If the symbol is on your hand, you take a -1 penalty on Disable Device, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand checks. If the symbol is on your face, you take a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Disguise checks. This does not count as a holy symbol for the purposes of a divine focus for spellcasting."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Guilty Fraud}",
				"",
				"You received something through trickery that you did not deserve, and your guilt for the misdeed distracts you from dangers around you. You take a -4 penalty on Bluff checks against creatures with an attitude toward you of indifferent or better."
			],
			[
				"## {trait/Haunted}",
				"",
				"Something from your past - or a dark secret you presently hold - makes it difficult for you to ever be at peace, and your chronic worry that you might fall to evil influence has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. You take a -2 penalty on saves against spells with the evil descriptor."

				"## {trait/Haunting Regret}",
				"",
