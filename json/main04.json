While the call seizes the changelings' minds around the time their bodies begin maturing, the arcane malignancies that mar their features and extremities have nothing to do with puberty.",
				"",
				"Not every changeling develops a malignancy, and when a changeling does develop a malignancy, it is often unrelated to whatever traits her hag mother has. These transformations are more akin to a magical allergy, manifesting in response to the well of arcane energy bubbling away in the changeling's core.",

Clothing and armor can be specially fitted for you, eliminating the increased penalty but increasing their price by 50 gp. |",

				"| 46-48 | Your flesh grows bark, and your major joints have become gnarled and knotted like tree limbs, causing you to move slowly and stiffly. You take a -2 penalty on Reflex saves. |",
				"| 49-51 | Your thin, almost translucent skin is delicate and tears easily. You take 1 point of bleed damage from slashing attacks that deal at least 1 point of damage to you. |",

				"| 64-65 | One arm is turning to stone, though you retain limited mobility. You take a -4 penalty on all skill checks requiring the use of two hands and on attack rolls when wielding a two-handed weapon or fighting with two weapons. |",
				"| 66-67 | You develop an allergy to one spell per spell level from the witch spell list (determined by your GM). Casting or being the target of a spell you're allergic to causes you to break out in a painful rash. This rash deals 1d4 points of damage per spell level, and imposes a penalty on your Charisma equal to the level of the spell. The rash fades after a number of hours equal to the level of the spell. |",
				"| 68-69 | The joints in your unnaturally long thumbs have fused, and you often fumble objects. When you retrieve a stored item, you have a 10% chance of dropping it. |",
				"| 70-72 | Your knees bend backward like a bird's, which makes many athletic movements difficult to master. You take a -2 penalty on Climb and Swim checks, and your running speed is only three times your regular walking speed. |",
				"| 73-75 | A tenacious patch of fungus has sprouted on your back, weakening your system against toxins. You take a -2 penalty on saves against poison effects. |",
				"| 76-77 | Your misaligned eyes affect your ability to judge distances. You take a -2 penalty on ranged attack and damage rolls. |",
				"| 78-80 | When you get flustered, heat builds up in your face until it glows with inner fire. You take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Perform checks when in the presence of 5 or more creatures. |",
				"| 81-83 | Your ears curl up like dried leaves, and you experience difficulty picking up sounds. You take a -2 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks. |",
				"| 84-86 | Your curving, clawlike fingernails grow so long so quickly that they impede you in dangerous situations. You take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and Sleight of Hand checks. |",
				"| 87-89 | One of your legs measures noticeably longer than the other, and you lose your balance easily. You take a -2 penalty to CMD against bull rush and trip attempts. |",
				"| 90-92 | Your eyes have swollen to mere slits. You take a -2 penalty on sight-based Perception checks. |",
				"| 93-96 | You develop a shaggy pelt about your neck and shoulders that makes you overheat quickly. You take a -4 penalty on checks and saves to resist environmental heat effects. |",
				"| 97-98 | You grow a tail that you can't easily conceal and that thrashes violently at inconvenient moments. You take a -2 penalty on Disguise and Stealth checks. |",
				"| 99-100 | You grow vestigial gills. While they grant you no ability to breathe in water, they make it harder for you to catch your breath. When you are fatigued, it takes 12 hours of complete rest to recover. When you are exhausted, it takes 2 hours of complete rest to become fatigued. |"
