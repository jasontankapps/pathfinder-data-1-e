These creatures relish the taste of living flesh and the sight of life leaving a creature's eyes, but most of all, they enjoy fear. If a nightprowler feels confident in its kill, it prefers to attack with tooth and claw until the victim is crippled, then plunges the area into darkness and glories in the sight of the helpless creature struggling in vain to escape. On an even battlefield, or if a nightprowler realizes that it is outmatched, it summons shadow allies to harry its opponents. Nightprowlers do not respond to bribes or pleas for mercy, and will chase their prey to the ends of the earth.",

			"Nightprowlers do not retreat from fights, even when near destruction - they trust that they will be reborn in the umbral cradle that originally gave them unlife. Even so, these beasts value their own existence, and their powers of judgment do not allow them to undertake obvious suicide missions. If a nightprowler locates a formidable enemy, it often bides its time until it can recruit other undead to the cause. To this end, a nightprowler may promise allies pieces of the spoils, but often reneges on payment once the fight is finished.

Even a truly sadistic mortal doesn't merit a shred of respect in the eyes of a nightprowler. If one of these deadly undead is forced into the service of a mortal master, it makes a poor servant at best. It remains patient and opportunistic, striking at the master's first sign of weakness. While nightprowlers despise mortal existence in all forms, they are known to accept the offerings of creatures that foolishly seek to become their minions. The mortal servants of such a creature are typically psychotic or sociopathic killers who see in the nightprowler a patron of murder and mayhem. Nightprowlers accept the supplications of their minions for a time, but out of either boredom or capriciousness, they inevitably turn their claws on their former servants.",
			"",
			"A mortal who wishes to catch the attention of a nightprowler must carry out a series of gruesome murders as sacrifices to the creature. Any killings will do, but nightprowlers prefer such sacrifices to be innocent victims or the clergy of good-aligned deities. Quick kills displease nightprowlers, while signs of torture on the offerings delight them. Supplicants who kill friends or family members garner special notice from nightprowlers. While pleasing a nightprowler is relatively easy initially, it demands ever-greater massacres using increasingly cruel methods, and it soon tires of even the most wicked mortal master.",
			"",
			"From time to time, nightprowlers stalk the Material Plane alone or in groups. They generally keep to caves, deep forests, and the cover of night when traveling this way. Nightprowlers prefer to move as solitary hunters, but are intelligent enough to collaborate when necessary. Packs of nightprowlers are loosely organized and can erupt into chaos in an instant. A pride forms when a particularly vigorous nightprowler lures others to its cause with promises of tender flesh and glistening entrails. This leader must mastermind sufficient destruction to keep the pride obeisant, for boredom in a nightprowler is a dangerous thing.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the common goal of all nightshades is nothing less than the desecration of all that is pure, and the death of all that lives. Mortals in the grip of madness rant of the coming night when nightshades great and small will march to rid all the planes once and for all of the curse of life. Nightprowlers will be the outriders in that terrible army, the mad ones warn, bringing undead allies with them into that final fray. It is easy to ignore these fevered prophecies or label them the ramblings of the insane. But in the baleful dark, when all lights have been extinguished save for a pair of red eyes, the potential truth in those words is undeniable."

The island must be no larger than 1 square mile in area per Hit Die the nisid has (usually 6 HD), and the nisid must be the only intelligent creature on the island for 1 uninterrupted year to cement the bond.

This Wisdom damage does not heal naturally until the trespasser leaves the nisid's island (though it can be healed through magic normally), slowly driving her mad.

When a trespasser leaves a nisid's bonded island, she must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. Failure results in her memories of the place becoming hazy - especially when it comes to locating it again. She takes a -10 penalty on Survival and Knowledge (geography) checks to determine the island's location or find it again, and the island and the nisid are treated as though under the effects of a permanent {spell/nondetection} spell for any divination spells the target casts (use the nisid's caster level to determine the difficulty of overcoming this effect).

Nisids rarely wear clothing, as they have little need for modesty or protection. They are excellent survivalists, living off what their island can provide.",
			"",
			"Loners by nature, a nisid claims and forms a bond with a single uninhabited island as his territory, and he seeks to preserve the island's untouched sanctity - and his own solitude. Should someone happen upon a nisid's island, whether as a castaway, stranded by a storm, or deliberately seeking something, the nisid first spies on the interloper using {spell/invisibility} and {spell/detect thoughts} to assess her intent. If he determines that the trespasser simply wishes to get off the island, the nisid often offers to help his guest survive and escape (if only to hasten the process and return the island to its isolation). Using magic and his natural skill at survival, he may give the castaway access to water, food, or shelter - in exchange for leaving the island unsullied when she leaves. Those who agree and please the nisid might even be gifted with a final {spell/gust of wind} to send them on their way.",
			"",
			"However, those who arrive with no intention of leaving hastily, or who drastically overstay their welcome without hope of escape, find the nisid a more hostile host, as a nisid finds murder a small price to pay for solitude. Unwelcome guests find the trials of survival and hopelessness to be maddening, and every day drift closer to insanity through the nisid's isolation ability. Once the trespassers have been driven toward madness, the nisid attempts to turn them against each other, sowing distrust and casting {spell/confusion} on large groups. If all else fails, the nisid might coax charmed animals, the nisid's only companions, into attacking interlopers: nothing says \"get off my island\" like a giant beast crashing out of the jungle.",
			"",
			"With no desire to die-only to be left alone - the nisid eschews direct combat as much as possible, preferring to have his enemies deal with each other or succumb to the dangers of the island itself. If pushed to combat, he casts {spell/call lightning} and attempts to strike down his enemies from hiding, using his knowledge of the island to his advantage.",
			"",
			"Even when helping agreeable castaways, the nisid won't make life too easy, lest the trespassers decide to extend their stay. He makes just enough food and water available to sustain the \"guests,\" using abilities like {spell/hallucinatory terrain} to keep any particularly bountiful areas of the island hidden. Should the island be a truly deserted one, perhaps where an ancient civilization once flourished, a nisid is especially vigilant in keeping ruins or artifacts that could attract further interest in the island well hidden. And once a castaway leaves a nisid's island, she rarely finds a way to return.",

The first nisids may have been castaways themselves, banished from the First World until they discovered the small islands on which they could be alone, or other fey spirits who found their little pieces of land suddenly cut off from everything else. Whatever their origin, most nisids have lived solitary lives for decades or centuries - and prefer it that way, finding solace in solitude and having no desire to share their hidden homes.",

			"Nisids can be any gender, but have little interest in companionship or reproduction. With no one around to impress, they don't care about their appearance - though their fey nature still shines through despite their neglect. Over time surviving alone, their hair becomes ragged and their skin grows exceptionally tough. They craft their few weapons out of whatever the island has to offer.",
			"",
			"Nisids have no interest in treasure, as they have no use for it; however, they tend to collect the belongings of those who wash up on their shores and don't escape. They keep their treasure troves well hidden to prevent attracting interest from other trespassers.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nisids might choose any small, uninhabited island as home, regardless of climate. Jungle isles filled with strange fauna are equally as appealing to them as barren rocks in the icy north or island ruins in temperate climes. Some nisids favor deserted islands that once held civilization of some kind as homes. Those who choose such locales have the additional goal of keeping their islands' ruins a secret from outsiders; the last thing a nisid wants is a boat full of explorers and adventurers arriving on his island to plumb its depths, and he will use his abilities to keep such adventurers away.",
			"",
			"Nisids are introverts to the extreme. They have no interest in any kind of company, and engage in conversation for only as long as it takes to accomplish their goals. There is never more than one nisid on an island. No one has learned why nisids prefer such isolation, or what they do in their long years alone. Perhaps they spend time meditating on their leave of the First World - or seek a way back.",
			"",
			"A nisid's only companions are the local fauna, which the nisid charms to act as guardians. Small islands far from continental land are known for their oversized animals, and a canny nisid in residence holds the threat of such beasts as motivation for trespassers to leave or to avoid the island's inner depths-perhaps unleashing the animals upon them should their stay provoke hostility. However, their relationships with dolphins are a bit antagonistic, as the creatures delight in attempts to force the nisid to socialize and guide travelers to their isolated islands."

This \"bone chariot\" functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the skeleton template, but gains the construct type instead of the undead type and has no will of its own - it moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center. An ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the skeleton crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal.

When an ostovite locates the corpse of a larger creature - particularly that of a humanoid or other intelligent being - it doesn't stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the creature's bones, drawing them out and reconstructing them into a twisted parody of their original configuration, with the ostovite resting in a nest-like structure in the sculpture's center. Once it's finished, the ostovite magically animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at last experiencing the thrill of being larger and - to the ostovite's mind - more important. These ghastly creations are generally more disturbing than normal undead, as ostovites' understanding of biomechanics is often crude, potentially resulting in humanoid skeletons that move around on all fours or drag themselves along like landbound octopuses. Like hermit crabs changing shells, ostovites regularly replace their chariots in order to increase their social status and impress potential mates. Though they often squabble over smaller skeletons, when a particularly prime corpse is located, an entire nest of ostovites may band together to create a single bone chariot of epic proportions.",

			"",
			"**Perpetual Renewal (Su)** An ouroboros continually consumes and regrows itself. The duration of any spell or effect that causes an ouroboros to be dazed, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, or stunned can never have a duration of longer than 1 round. Any ability damage or drain an ouroboros receives is automatically healed at a rate of 1d4 points per round per ability. Perpetual renewal functions only while the ouroboros consumes itself.",

So long as the ouroboros continues its self-consumption, its regeneration cannot be suppressed by any form of attack and it benefits from the effects of perpetual renewal, but it cannot use its maw attack or its ruinous blood ability. Any effect that would kill the ouroboros outright merely halves the ouroboros's remaining hit points. Once an ouroboros's hit points are reduced to less than half its normal maximum (198 hit points for a typical ouroboros), the monster ceases its self-consumption, loses its perpetual renewal ability, and gains its maw and ruinous blood abilities. All its movement speeds are doubled when the ouroboros is in this state, but its regeneration can now be suppressed via damage caused by mythic weapons or spells.

They are each a world unto themselves, autonomous and reliant on no other creature for their sustenance or livelihood. An ouroboros can exist forever, constantly eating itself and replenishing its body with its own infinity. Barely sentient, an ouroboros has a powerful, almost pathological will to survive, which drives it to destroy any and all creatures that pose even the slightest threat to its well-being. This propensity to attack without clear provocation or warning has given ouroboroses a reputation for being engines of mindless destruction.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros might appear to be a single creature, but closer inspection reveals the truth: its body is formed from a myriad of smaller entwined serpents, which are not independent creatures and become lifeless once separated from the main body. Those who have examined serpents detached from an ouroboros report that these creatures too are formed from smaller serpents that, when inspected under magnification, prove to be composed of tinier serpents still.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which has many miraculous properties. Many have tried to harness the healing powers of the ouroboros's blood to restore life to the dead or regenerate grievous wounds. While such treatments can be successful, given the application of the correct but obscure occult rituals, ouroboros blood is uniquely suited to the generation of ouroboros flesh and no other. Patients treated in this way typically suffer the fate of those exposed directly to the ouroboros's blood and transform into serpents.",

Iovett's owb prophets are immune to disease and poison, cannot be grappled unless they choose to be, and automatically succeed at combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or pin. They can use {spell/eruptive pustules} at will as a spell-like ability. Iovett's symbol is a stylized tick on a swatch of silk, and its favored weapon is the short sword.",

Husk's owb prophets are immune to bleed, disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison, and they can use {spell/silence} at will as a spell-like ability.

However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite well-established in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.",

They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.",

A paguroida that has embedded magic items with a total caster level that is at least equal to its Hit Dice (11 for a typical paguroida) gains a +4 deflection bonus to its AC and a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A paguroida with embedded magic items whose total caster level is at least twice the creature's Hit Dice doubles these bonuses and gains the advanced creature simple template.

One of their upper limbs terminates in a humanoid hand, while the other ends in a large pincer capable of gripping and crushing prey. A paguroida's face is similar to that of a crab, with protruding eyestalks and a wide mandible-filled mouth, though its torso is distinctly humanoid in shape and size. A typical paguroida stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.",
			"",

			"Paguroidas live solitary but long lives - their isolation and extreme paranoia about interaction with other species precludes many unnatural causes of death. In most cases, a paguroida eventually succumbs to old age after having lived for as many as a dozen centuries. Despite their longevity, paguroidas are not fecund, and they reproduce only once every 200-300 years after reaching reproductive maturity at the age of 150. Female paguroidas each lay a single egg in a secluded location, which they abandon among a small cache of magical items from their shells. Nearby male paguroidas locate the eggs by following the unique magical aura they exude, as well as the magical auras of the items in the eggs' cache-nests. Once fertilized, an egg ceases to emit such an aura, but the male that fertilized it remains nearby to protect it during the 6 months it gestates before hatching.",
			"",
			"Hatchlings are incredibly vulnerable, their shells taking as many as 5 years to harden. Paguroida fathers often give their offspring one or more magical items from their own shells, and they assist the offspring in embedding them and the items from their mothers' cache-nests into their soft shells to bolster their defenses in their first year.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Paguroidas live almost entirely alone, only rarely congregating in groups, generally for purposes of defense or to consolidate resources. Even then, these groups almost never exceed 10 members, as paguroidas have an innate understanding that the valuable items embedded in their shells would draw more treasure hunters to them, negating the advantages of greater numbers.",
			"",
			"Typically making their lairs near ancient ruins filled with long-abandoned magical relics, paguroidas prefer to dwell in underwater grottoes inaccessible from the surface. They protect these lairs with powerful illusions and abjurations, counting on remaining hidden to protect themselves and their treasures from potential thieves. A paguroida who encounters an intelligent interloper first attempts to trick the creature into leaving its territory, preferring to avoid conflict altogether. If discovered and unable to persuade the trespasser to leave, a paguroida may offer one of the magic items from its shell as a bribe to send the unwanted guest on its way. This is often a last resort, however, as most paguroidas know that once granted a single item of power, most creatures will seek more and respond with force if their demands are denied.",
			"",
			"Because of their mutual penchant for hoarding wealth, dragons are a paguroida's primary threat, and the crabfolk avoid even good and neutral dragons out of a strong sense of self-preservation. Only when offered substantial magical wealth as signs of good faith do paguroidas cooperate with dragons, and even then they do so warily."

Though any act of carnal pleasure is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.",
			"",
			"In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid angels' love of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse, and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp.

Several pallid angels served the Whispering Tyrant as commanders in his initial conquest of Ustalav; at least one remains somewhere in the mountains of Virlych, magically entrapped by Arazni before her death at the Tyrant's hands.",
			"",
			"In addition to the angels' role as military leaders, small cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to share in their pleasures. Urgathoa sometimes sends pallid angels to such pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and ensures the cult's corruption to Urgathoa's service.",
			"",
			"Pallid angels and daughters of Urgathoa both hold great authority and honor among the faithful of the Pallid Princess, and many of those who eventually became pallid angels were first elevated to be daughters of Urgathoa upon their mortal deaths. When brought together, pallid angels serve as a martial counterpart to the more ecclesiastical role played by daughters, much like the paladins and clerics of good faiths. In such cases, pallid angels and daughters cooperate in service to the goddess's will, though their relationship is often strained. Pallid angels often treat daughters with subtle pity and condescension for their reduced access to physical pleasures and their less direct relationship to Urgathoa, while daughters frequently hold angels in quiet contempt for their status as living - and thus less perfect - beings."

A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one-before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle's straps interfere with the creature's wings.

By itself, a single pest drake is a tolerated nuisance, eating insects and other vermin in the city. Its distinctive song-like chirp greets passersby and thanks those who throw it scraps of food. When pest drakes gather, however, they become much more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups, becoming deadly, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.",
			"",
			"Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just under a foot in length and weigh 1-2 pounds. They live approximately 10-15 years.",
			"",
			"Centuries ago, a wizard who was jealous of his colleague's bond with a pseudodragon captured a clutch of pseudodragons, determined to create his own draconic familiar. He drained his family's fortune in countless experiments to create a less intelligent and more obedient dragon. His experiments routinely failed, with many of the resulting offspring unable to properly bond as familiars or so frail they died within days of hatching. Decades later, a young paladin of Apsu discovered the wizard's atrocities against dragonkind and confronted the wizard. The wizard's daughter, who had cared for the failed experiments all of her life, released them from their cages, attempting to spare them from her father's magic and the paladin's ire.",
			"",
			"Not long after the paladin left the wizard's mansion, the drakes returned to their pen. The daughter, intending to grant them freedom, released them further and further away from her home, only to discover them back in her courtyard each time she returned. Unable to \"free\" the drakes, she instead created a messenger service with them in an attempt to recover her family's fortune. Her plan did not work quite as intended. The drakes became a decades-long fashion fad that spread like wildfire across Golarion's nobility, especially after it was discovered that the creatures could be easily bred to exhibit a variety of colors, spikes, and frill styles. By the time the drakes fell out of fashion, they had become too embedded in their urban homes to ever be fully removed.",
			"",
			"Unlike their draconic cousins, pest drakes are highly fertile and mature quickly. Mated pairs lay clutches of two to three eggs each year in the spring and fall. The eggs incubate for 2 months, and a hatchling reaches physical and sexual maturity within 5 months. A mated pair of pest drakes remains together while incubating eggs and raising the hatchlings, but they often find new mates within the flock after those young mature. Each adult in the flock takes at least some role in a hatchling's growth, often teaching it which places to frequent for food and which to avoid due to danger. Some smaller flocks have been known to follow people who feed them, even as those people age and move to different homes within the city, passing the tribal knowledge of previous kindness from one generation of pest drakes to the next.",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are not as vicious as their drake cousins, and they rarely attack creatures larger than themselves. They are omnivorous, subsisting primarily on berries, seeds, insects, and small rodents, though those that inhabit cities get the majority of their diet from scraps dropped by the city's inhabitants. Many pest drakes perch patiently in parks where citizens are likely to rest and eat, waiting for a dropped scrap or the opportunity to steal an untended meal. Some pest drakes have learned that chirping, dancing, and other displays often delight the local populace, leading to the drakes getting more scraps of food.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are social, communal creatures that exist almost entirely within cities. Flocks within cities tend to claim sections of the city as their territories and defend these territories from outside menaces, whether those menaces are other flocks of pest drakes, an invasion of stowaway rats on the docks, or new construction in the nobles' district that disrupts their nests. Flocks of pest drakes found outside of cities still frequently gravitate toward humanoid settlements, latching onto tribes or villages. Pest drakes communicate with each other through a mixture of body language, chirps, clicks, and whistles. They can understand basic words and simple commands in the languages of the humanoids around them, but they lack the ability to fully understand or speak a language.",
			"",
			"Masons despise pest drakes. The drakes' acidic biology eventually permeates their roosting places, slowly eating away at the structure beneath. Their acid erodes details on statues, inscriptions on walls, and designs on column capitals. Buildings and statuary made of marble or painted in lighter colors are particularly susceptible to this corrosion, as it slowly darkens the stone and dissolves the paint. Once established, these pests have proven difficult to remove, as they are often too numerous and too prolific to fully exterminate, especially when the local populace so regularly feeds the friendly creatures. In poorer areas where vermin are more prevalent, the citizens often encourage the habitation of pest drakes to help keep the populations of other pests down.",
			"",
			"Many minor nobles still collect and breed pest drakes for racing stock due to their innate ability to always find their way home. Some pest drakes are bred for speed, others for endurance. These races are collectively referred to as \"Rainbow Races\" due to the bright streaks of color that fill the sky when the pest drakes are released. Owners keep racing drakes in housing that limits the drakes' ability to form a bond with others of their kind. Current Rainbow Races have regulations limiting how many pest drakes can be raced at the same time after the Great Drake Disaster in Taldor, in which thousands of half-starved pest drakes were released for a race and subsequently bonded into a flock that decimated the nearby farmland."

Although phycomids are deadly to eat, many goblin tribes view those who eat a phycomid mushroom and survive as great heroes. Needless to say, most goblin lairs that attempt to utilize phycomids as guardians eventually become nothing more than phycomid lairs - a goblin tribe's luck can only hold up for so long, after all."
