Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast.

Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic).

Wearing a bottomwalker's anchor all but guarantees an undersea explorer a swiftly sinking buoyancy, though it also increases her armor check penalty by 1 and decreases her maximum Dexterity bonus by 1 (or sets it at +6, if the wearer didn't have a maximum Dexterity bonus). Compared to simply carrying plenty of dense items, it's unwieldy, but the advantage is that the undersea explorer can detach the anchor in a hurry in order to float to the surface, while unloading a number of dense objects might be a slow process (and could deprive the explorer of valuable gear)."

For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan; it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder. This item only works on oreads and other creatures with rocklike bodies."

To use a code rod, a long, narrow strip of paper is wrapped around the rod in a spiral pattern such that the edge of the paper touches the previous circuit with each pass, forming a continuous surface. A message is written along the length of the rod, one character to each coil of paper, row by row, until the paper is full. Once the message is completed, the strip of paper is unwound, rendering the message indecipherable. It can then be rolled up and sent to the recipient, who wraps it around the other rod and can then read the message. The users can write in plain language or further encode the message.

When any part of the rope is touched to an open flame, it suddenly contracts to one-fifth its original length, pulling any creature or object attached to one side to within 10 feet of the other; if multiple creatures are moved into the same square, they fall prone in randomly determined adjacent squares. Because of the sudden jerk, a creature holding a contracting rope must succeed at a DC 10 Climb check to avoid dropping it as it contracts (unless it is knotted around the creature's waist, clamped in a locked gauntlet, or otherwise firmly attached to the creature). The rope fails to contract if it would pull more than 1,000 pounds horizontally or lift more than 250 pounds vertically. Once activated, the rope slowly unravels to its normal length over the course of 24 hours and can't be activated again until such time has passed."

Creatures that breathe air must hold their breath or suffocate in an area of dead air, though sound, fire, and other effects that rely on a stable atmosphere are unaffected. Undisturbed, the dead air dissipates in 1 minute. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the dead air in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the dead air in 1 round.
