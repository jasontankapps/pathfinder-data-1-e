			"The original source of lycanthropy has long fascinated scholars and philosophers, for it is an affliction that has plagued civilization from the very beginning. Many religious texts point to a woman named Jezelda as the first to spread lycanthropy among the mortals of the world, but strangely, the texts of Jezelda's own worshipers do not support this claim; instead they remain strangely silent upon her history, as if it held a secret the world is not yet meant to know. That Jezelda was once a mortal woman seems apparent enough, and that she suffered lycanthropy seems logical, but her worshipers are noncommittal when asked about her origins. That she exists to be worshiped is enough for the faithful of the Mistress of the Hungry Moon.",

			"Jezelda is a shapechanger and the patron of werewolves. She can appear as a beautiful and dark-haired Varisian woman, a feral and slavering wolf with huge fangs and yellow eyes, or her favored form - an emaciated amalgamation of the two. Regardless of the form she adopts, she always bears a pair of demonic horns atop her head. Despite her association with werewolves and the moon, Jezelda is not a deity of lycanthropy itself. Indeed, she despises non-werewolf lycanthropes and charges her worshipers with seeking out these \"heretics\" for particularly grisly sacrifices in which all manner of silvered torture implements worshipers use with horrifying creativity. Good-aligned lycanthropes in particular provoke Jezelda's ire, and sacrificing them almost always curries her favor."

Your body still retains enough rigidity that you can speak, wield objects and weapons, and wear items like armor.

			"Of the demon lords whose influence can be felt on Golarion, Jubilex may be the one least concerned with maintaining a cult. His favored {monster/omox} demon minions do more to spread his cults than he does - in fact, it's debatable whether Jubilex even realizes he has worshipers. Only among the drow is his faith particularly pervasive; they regard him as a patron of poison and toxins and often consider him a competitor to {faith/Haagenti}. However, even those who worship him tend to think of him not as an entity to be venerated so much as a source of power to be tapped. Yet despite the Faceless Lord's lack of interest in his faithful, he enjoys absorbing the bodies of unwilling mortals from the Material Plane into his protoplasmic bulk, and never turns away any of the sacrifices his worshipers render unto him.",
			"",
			"Jubilex appears as a shapeless, green mass of ooze marbled with dark ribbons of tar and hundreds of glaring red eyes the size of a man's head. In combat, he can lash out with several acidic and poisonous tentacles. The nature of these poisons shifts and changes even between strikes, such that it is difficult - if not impossible - to prepare for their ravages ahead of time. The fact that Jubilex's toxins can affect even creatures that usually can't be poisoned only further secures his role as a lord of poison. The acid secreted by his immense body is particularly potent against flesh and bone, and is likewise capable of damaging creatures normally immune to acid. But assaulting his enemies with irresistible poisons and supernaturally potent acids are only the simplest of the horrors Jubilex is said to be able to unleash. Some who have confronted the Faceless Lord and lived to tell the tale speak of Jubilex drawing fluids like blood and tears from a living creature's body and investing the fluid with the malevolent destructive nature of an ooze before returning the stolen fluids to the donor so that it is consumed, painfully, from within. Others speak of the Faceless Lord's ability to turn the very air into a thick, cloying suspension that is as unpleasant as it is difficult to move through. Even when the air surrounding Jubilex isn't thickened, the overwhelming stink of his presence can kill plants and strip flesh from bone. Surely the demon lord has other foul methods of attack as well - atrocities that none have yet survived to warn the world of."

This first ghoul abandoned his previous life and embraced his new undeath, becoming the demon lord Kabriri. For his first few centuries of existence, he traveled among the worlds of the Material Plane, sampling like a gourmand the contents of graveyards and spreading the infectious \"word\" of his condition to any who would listen - in effect, infecting the inhabitants of innumerable worlds with the first and strongest strain of ghoul fever. Yet wherever Kabriri traveled, he took pains to avoid the burial grounds of elves, and did not spread his word among their kind. Whether his restraint was due to a fragment of shame over his first act of cannibalism or fear of confronting even a tiny fragment of the life he'd left behind, Kabriri left the elven people alone. Repercussions of his avoidance continue to this very day, as the touch of ghouls cannot paralyze elves. In contrast, other humanoids who succumb to the disease find their ears growing long and pointed, as if in some cosmic mockery of the elven form.",

This weapon is capable of transforming those it strikes into ghouls, and causes the flesh of the living to rot away. Kabriri's breath can also transform the living into ghouls, and his gaze can instill an unholy cannibalistic hunger that can drive sane folk to go on murderous, gluttonous rampages."

			"Kazutal, also known as Lady Jaguar, Mother Jaguar, and She of Grace and Might, was worshipped differently thousands of years ago. In ancient times, the Razatlani spread across Arcadia, subjugating other peoples and establishing their own rigid and tyrannical empire. The Razatlani prayed to Kazutal for strength in battle and protection from injury, much as people do today, but few considered her a goddess who cared at all for society or freedom. In this age of chaos and warfare, most of Kazutal's worship was focused on military might, until the catastrophe of Earthfall disrupted the grasp of the Razatlani Empire.",
			"",
			"After Earthfall, Kazutal's surviving clergy used their forces to help other survivors make it through the first few centuries of darkness. Since people depended upon their neighbors to survive, they called on Kazutal's strength to protect every member of the community, as the loss of one person could spell the death of the rest. Through these efforts, a stronger bond of friendship and family blossomed in Kazutal's church. She became a guardian among the ashes, a patron of defense instead of war. Her church grew during that dark time, as her followers sought to unite Arcadia's survivors in the far reaches where the Razatlani Empire had expanded ages ago.",
			"",
			"Kazutal recognizes the importance of improving connections and relationships within a community as the pinnacle of proper protection, for a society with strong community bonds can withstand the worst assaults. Her concept of community revolves around a sense of solidarity and responsibility; actual laws are of less importance, and the restraints of any oppressive dogma must be torn down. Kazutal's priests teach that only a free and open society can truly be strong: cultures that harbor internal hatreds will destroy themselves when placed under pressure."

In turn, he developed labor-saving devices for tilling, irrigating, and fertilizing the soil that quickly earned him a glowing reputation across the city-state. When he came of age, it was his privilege to cart his family's wine to the capital for the annual tasting competition, and when their cask won top honors, the council unilaterally decided that he should receive the cyclopes' blessing.",

The forces of Pol-Ptirmeios rounded up the 17 perpetrators and dragged them back to the ruined village. There he forgave them, proclaiming that new life shall always succeed misfortune, and they too would have their chance to redeem themselves for their crimes. With that, a tree emerged from the shattered homes and bore a single fruit infused with mythic power.",

Once per day as a standard action, you can let out a cry and all animals within 200 feet immediately come to you as quickly as possible. They will not take unnecessarily dangerous risks to reach you, such as leaping over wide streams. This is a magical call, and animals respond even if unable to hear the call due to environmental conditions or deafness.

They are automatically friendly to you but are not obligated to do what you ask.",

As a standard action when an ally is poisoned, you can attempt a Heal check to study the poison. If the result of your check exceeds the DC of the poison by 5, you immediately neutralize the poison and reverse the instantaneous or permanent effects caused by the poison, such as ability damage. You do not heal hit point damage or ability damage or drain caused by any other effects, and you must attempt a separate check for each poison affecting your ally. You must be adjacent to your ally to use this ability. If you fail, you cannot use this ability for either that ally or that poison for 1 week.",

You ignore {rule/cover} or {rule/concealment} from plants, though trees large enough to completely block your vision still provide total cover to the target. You also take no penalties on your ranged attacks due to the effects of wind, and you ignore any miss chance caused by mundane or magical winds.

			"Though commonly worshipped among the elves of Golarion, Ketephys's power is strongest in Sovyrian, the secret ancestral home of elves, where they retreated after the Starstone struck in -5293 AR. The elves returned to Golarion in 2497 AR out of necessity when the demon {monster/Treerazer}, Lord of the Blasted Tarn, moved into Kyonin after being exiled from the Abyss, threatening the sacred elf gate known as the Sovyrian Stone. The normally restrained Ketephys was livid to see the corruption of Kyonin's forests, as once-lush, green woods turned to poison and decay, and the earth rotted under the demon's influence. Ketephys personally led a team of expert archers as part of the battle to save Iadara, restore the forests, and drive Treerazer into the Fierani swamps. Though now returned to his normal peaceful state, Ketephys still swears to eliminate Treerazer and his influence from Golarion completely.",
			"",
			"Ketephys's influence is generally weaker on Golarion than in Sovyrian, but nevertheless many elves in Kyonin worship him. Elven rangers and hunters worship him almost exclusively, as do many smaller communities. Some non-elven hunters worship Ketephys, and the open-minded god accepts these followers so long as they respect nature appropriately.",
			"",
			"Ketephys appears as a russet-skinned elf with the eyes of a hawk, with hawk feathers in place of his hair. He wears a cloak of gray feathers, a simple hunting jerkin, and fur wraps around his ankles; his feet are bare. He is never without his two companions: a hawk named Falling Star and a dog named Meycho. He treats these animals as equals, not pets or servants, and when the three hunt together, each has equal say in their quarry."

As the sun rises in the morning, so do the peasants who work all day with little reward, and Khepri is their divine embodiment, promising freedom from toil and reward for their labor in the afterlife.

As a trickster, Khepri is close friends with {faith/Bes}, and he relishes the distaste that his strange appearance, his pungent aroma, and all that he represents elicit in more refined and civilized gods such as {faith/Bastet}, {faith/Maat}, and {faith/Thoth}.",

Temporary shrines to the scarab god often spring up next to fields or at building sites, where workers make small offerings of a bite of their food or a sip of their beer, and ask Khepri to grant them an easy and productive day of work."

Unsatisfied with the fleeting rush of energy and excitement afforded by these slayings, Kostchtchie proceeded to murder his father as well. After this, the man's taste for bloodshed only grew. But with each murder he committed, Kostchtchie grew more and more concerned that some day, he would himself be slain. Later in life, after he had become a ferocious warlord, Kostchtchie confronted the Witch Queen {monster/Baba Yaga} and tried to force her to grant him immortality.

Kostchtchie fled to the Abyss to hide his shame and nurture his hatred, eventually finding a new purpose as a patron of those {monster/frost giant/s} who turned away from the god {faith/Thremyr} in search of an even more warlike deity. His worship is common not only in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, but also in distant Iobaria and the frozen wastes of the Crown of the World far to the north.",

			"About 300 years ago, Kurgess was merely a strapping farm boy from Taldor, and his mortal life is well-documented. Born to unknown parents, Kurgess was abandoned as an infant upon the doorstep of a Taldan couple who took him in. His extraordinary strength manifested before he even reached puberty - by the age of eight, he could pull a sleigh loaded with his brothers and sisters back and forth across a field all afternoon. One day, Kurgess spotted a traveling merchant on the road who had gotten his carriage stuck in a ditch. The selfless youth shook hands with the stranger before disconnecting the carriage from its train and heaving the entire vehicle out of the ditch unaided. Impressed by the boy's wondrous brawn, the merchant extended an offer: Kurgess could join him in his travels, and together they would roam Taldor, with Kurgess competing in contests of strength and speed. By the time Kurgess turned 20, he was packing stadiums with peasants as well as aristocrats eager to see the so-called Strong Man best time-honored champions at their own games. Unfortunately, Kurgess's vast talent and good-natured sportsmanship earned him the jealousy and bitterness of many of his more unscrupulous rivals.",
			"",
			"Kurgess's final act as a mortal took place at the third annual Raptor Run in Taldor's capital of Oppara. Before the competition, Kurgess's enemies laid down a vicious trap for the Strong Man and any competitors unfortunate enough to be riding alongside him. Kurgess caught wind of the scheme and sacrificed himself, crashing his chariot onto the trap and saving the other athletes. When the clerics pronounced the gladiator dead, the entire city mourned for the champion, and Kurgess became a martyr.",
			"",
			"As legends of his sporting victories and his noble death spread across the Inner Sea region - and even other planes - athletes began looking to Kurgess as a role model, and competitions were often dedicated to him as the embodiment of honor and athleticism. Shortly thereafter, {faith/Cayden Cailean} and {faith/Desna} raised Kurgess to godhood, crowning him with deific powers. Why they did this remains up for debate, but more than a few scholars whisper that Kurgess might actually be the two deities' half-mortal son. He stands as patron of and inspiration for all who engage in physical challenges.",

Lanishra teaches that a warrior's job is to excel at warfare and that manual labor is beneath him. The reward for a warrior's work is the free acquisition of the goods produced by those he conquers - both from their past labors and those carried out under his whip. Lanishra's philosophy is most at odds with those of {faith/Nulgreth} and {faith/Zagresh}, who would rather kill than enslave.

Though not actually a collective consciousness like {faith/Shyka}, Madgh's faces appear to represent different aspects of her personality, though not always the same one; a supplicant who notices the red-haired face radiating maternal affection in one interaction might attempt to curry favor with it the next time, only to find it personifying rage or humor. When necessary, Magdh has even been known to split into three separate women in order to accomplish some task, yet the Eldest often seems reserved or less lucid for a time following such separations."

However, most runes in the possession of his church are holy runeplates, infused with the power of runes as taught to his followers, but not the true runes Magrim carries for his own use.",

Generations, entire millennia, and whole worlds of spirits passed through her court en route to their afterlives. Mortals called Mahathallah the Maiden of Mists, whose gaze pierced any veil and whose whisper parted any fog. She never sought praise, but she came to be worshiped nonetheless as one of the mysterious leaders of her kind: a psychopomp usher. Though her mistress, {faith/Pharasma}, the Lady of Graves, never said as much, she was pleased. Mahathallah, however, could never entirely accept the prayers offered in her name. Her faithful claimed she knew every beginning, every act, and every end, but that wasn't true. Mahathallah knew of every mortal's demise and could predict the dooms of far greater beings - but to her own end she was utterly blind.",

Her appearance endlessly shifts between that of a youthful, though cadaverous, angel wearing a dusk-hued burial gown and that of a rotting crone trailing tatters and shattered wings. This cycle of decay and regeneration advances erratically, sometimes taking as long as a day or as little as a moment. Although typically cold and dispassionate, Mahathallah's state of mind seems to affect her appearance, youth being the mask of her anger and age that of her nihilistic wisdom. Ever-changing, Mahathallah is impossible to depict accurately. Artists often represent her as a vaguely feminine figure cloaked in somber mists, or they portray her by her symbol alone - a glaring eye surrounded by an assortment of occult sigils."

Yet as the infernal lords departed, a voice from within the tomb stopped them. Somehow, the magical trove he floated upon for ages, the fury of the Maelstrom, and the power of Hell combined to remake Mammon as an animating spirit. Mammon collected the gems and riches of his burial treasures, creating from them a gleaming and infinitely changeable new form to serve as his body. Intrigued by this strange resurrection, Asmodeus supplied Mammon with vast wealth from the depths of Nessus and remade Mammon's crypt into a new realm, the Hellish vault of Erebus.",

The vaults of Erebus have grown vast: every type of treasure imaginable fills the realm and contributes to his body. At the heart of Erebus hangs the Argent Prince, a fiendishly beautiful, silvery representation of Mammon's former angelic form. When attending councils with his peers, Mammon instructs a contingent of servants to carry an ark filled with specially chosen riches to Nessus, allowing the archdevil to assume exceptionally majestic forms before his peers."

			"Matravash is the goddess of the eponymous Matra River, which flows nearly 2,500 miles through Vudra and serves as the primary means of travel into the nation's heart from the west. She is seen as a facilitator of civilization, for the river connects communities and allows for the easy sharing of ideas, efficiency in trade, and ultimately passage into the greater waterway of the Obari Ocean - a symbol to Matravash's faithful of the Great Beyond as the final destination of the River of Souls.",
			"",
			"The Wide Water is closely associated with lotus blossoms, which grow in abundance on her calm waters, especially in the warm estuaries near the river's delta. The Azvadeva Pujila speaks of the river's origins, when the entire length of the waterway was rife with deadly rapids. Entranced by the beauty of the lotus blossoms in sheltered eddies, Matravash calmed herself to accommodate the flourishing plants, and found that the travelers who began to ply her waters were welcome visitors. Thus did both Matravash and the lotuses earn their reputation as peaceful, calm, and contemplative entities.",
			"",
			"Despite her position as a goddess of law, Matravash is often seen as a friend to the oppressed, for the Matra offers those without hope in their current homes an escape route which can take them to better places and new opportunities, and her priesthood is scrupulous about not revealing the whereabouts of fugitives who have broken no laws. As with any river fed by heavy seasonal rains such as Vudra's annual monsoons, the Matra swells in its banks regularly, and those who live on or near the water are accustomed to flooding. Matravash tends to these river dwellers closely, setting into motion seeming coincidences that keep those unprepared for such forces of nature out of harm's way. In populated areas, Matravash restrains her waters to rejuvenate the soil of the flood plain without overexerting herself and disrupting the lives of those with whom she has formed an almost symbiotic relationship. Thus are floods seen as the river's gift to farmers rather than the wrath of an angry goddess; expected cycles of ebbing and flowing associated with health and fertility rather than natural disasters."

Her people cried out to her for protection, and the Mother of Hearth and Wall spurred her fellow empyreal lords to cooperate despite their philosophical differences, saving untold millions. With the signing of the Celestial Concordance, Mazludeh found herself in the role of the newly formed nation's matron goddess.",
			"",
			"Mazludeh acts as a guardian of knowledge, protector of settlements, and guiding hand for those who strengthen their community, either literally by creating strong walls, dwellings, and monuments, or figuratively as parents, guards, and especially educators. Her clergy serve not just as spiritual guides, but often as city planners, architects, archivists, engineers, and farmers, all the while striving to maintain a careful balance between the needs of individuals and the needs of the entire community. Her worshipers depict her most frequently as an enormous serpent whose shaggy mane is heavy with figs or eggs, or as a medusa-like woman with serpents for hair, leading many scholars to speculate her divine agency predates humanity, and that she may have once been worshipped by serpentfolk or lizardfolk in a bygone age."

This works like the witch's {hex/forced reincarnation} hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with {spell/reincarnate}, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a {spell/wish} or {spell/miracle} spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect.

Once per day, you can cast {spell/temporal stasis} {feat/heightened} to function as a 9th-level spell. The target of this ability appears to be wrapped tightly in spiderwebs.
