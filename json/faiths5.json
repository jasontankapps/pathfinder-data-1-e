While those who die know grief and pain, their souls can one day go on to be something greater. But those touched by Nhimbaloth know only the agony of death. They do not go on. They simply end.",

When you make a full attack, you can make an additional attack with this tail-wielded dagger. When you do so, you resolve this attack as a primary attack, add your Dexterity modifier to any damage dealt (in addition to any modifiers you might have from Strength), and have a reach that is 5 feet greater than your base reach. Wielding a dagger with your tail in this way does not count as two-weapon fighting for the purposes of determining penalties to attacks made with weapons wielded in your hands. In any round during which you don't make a full attack but you wield a dagger with this tail, it makes a single attack against an adjacent enemy of your choice - if it hits, it deals no damage but distracts the foe enough so that you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against that target.

			">3. **Avatar of Strife (Sp)** You can call upon the Shining Scourge to fill you with his burning light, which spreads mindless warfare everywhere you go. Once per day as a standard action, you can begin radiating an aura of blazing light equivalent to that created by daylight, lasting 1 round per Hit Die. Any creature within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) at the start of its turn or be compelled to attack the nearest conscious creature that round (similar to the \"attack nearest creature\" result of the confusion spell). Worshipers of Nurgal are immune to this effect. As a swift action, you can command a creature affected by your aura to direct its attacks against a creature of your choice within the effect's 60-foot area; this designation lasts until the effect ends.",

Those who follow their ancient traditions believe that countless entities known as *wendo* move among mortals, shaping fate and guiding destiny. Though not gods, the wendo are capricious and demand worship in exchange for cooperation. Only the *wendifa*, juju oracles whose craft is passed down through oral tradition from lost civilizations, can divine what the wendo want. Wendifa lead rites and sacrifices to gain insight from the wendo and offer their followers some protection from the unforgiving forces of nature. Wendifa of great power can bend the spirits of both nature and the living to their will, earning them respect from both foes and followers.",

Those with greater experience know that juju is a living, breathing faith - an ever-evolving collection of traditions transmitted by word of mouth from one generation to the next. Fetishes, power objects, and ancient sigils are the tools of worship, but they are not the heart of juju, nor are the practices of one tribe common to all. ",
			"",
			"The heart of juju is communion with the wendo through elaborate rituals designed to summon the spirits, who carry messages and entreaties to hidden spiritual entities of immense power. These rituals involve idols and sacrifice, music and dance, and the crafting of *metumbe*, detailed pictograms identified with specific wendo. The nature of these rites can range from celebrations and offerings of food to the bloody sacrifice of intelligent beings, depending on a tribe's moral tendencies. Failing to follow the precise directions of a ritual, improperly fashioning a wendo's *metumbe*, or - worst of all - allowing nonbelievers or *hen kudu* (\"lost ones\") to witness a ritual can bring the wendos' wrath, requiring even greater sacrifice to appease the spirits",
			"",
			"Juju is a highly personal faith, with each practitioner keeping to the rituals and taboos handed down from his family or tribe. Though they prefer to stay close to their wendifa for guidance, juju practitioners who travel the world follow their rituals closely, seeking guidance from the spirits while making sure to guard them from the eyes of *ben kudu*",
			"",

Reduced to a single blot of fungoid sentience trapped within a comet, the Great Old One eventually came to Golarion during Earthfall, accidentally plucked from the sky just as the Starstone was in the aboleths' assault upon the doomed nation of Azlant. Where Xhamen-Dor's comet came to rest is unknown, but its cult agrees that the fallen star that bears the Great Old One's core lies in the depths of a large but remote lake somewhere in the world.",

Those infected by the Inmost Blot first become sickly, then begin to simultaneously decay and transform, eventually becoming undead monsters animated by a combination of necromantic energy and the alien fungal masses that writhe in their cores. Cultists of Xhamen-Dor often take these parasitic creatures into themselves under the belief that they will live on as part of the creatures that emerge from their bodies, but just as often use unsuspecting sacrifices to serve as hosts.",

			">3. **Sculptor's Strike (Su)** The strike of your weapons causes a specified foe to calcify and harden into stone, bit by bit, eventually transforming that enemy into a favored child of Xoveron. To use sculptor's strike, you must first designate a foe in sight within 30 feet as a standard action. Once you've designated the foe, whenever you deal damage to that creature with a melee weapon (including unarmed strikes and natural weapons), the creature takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain in addition to the normal damage. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) this drain is reduced to 1 point. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a gargoyle (as per polymorph any object, except no Fortitude save is allowed) and must succeed at a Will save (using this ability's DC) or have its mind also become that of a gargoyle (as per baleful polymorph). When a creature is transformed in this way, all Dexterity drain caused by this effect is instantly healed and the creature's hit points are fully restored. The mental change can be reversed by any effect that removes curses, but the physical transformation can only be reversed by miracle or wish. You can activate sculptor's strike once per day to designate a foe, but once you've done so, that foe remains susceptible to your ability until you or it is slain. If you designate a different foe on a later day, any previously designated foe is no longer designated and can no longer be affected by this ability (unless you designate it once again at a later date).",

You gain a burrow speed of 30 feet, which can be used only in mud, sand, soil, or other soft substances (not solid stone). You gain a +10 bonus on Stealth checks while burrowing. Once per hour, if you take a standard action to emerge from burrowing with a roar and spray of soil, each creature within 30 feet of your emergence that was not aware of your presence must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be shaken and stunned for 1 round and shaken for 2d4 rounds thereafter. The burrowing ability is an extraordinary ability, but the latter part of the ability is a supernatural, mind-affecting fear effect.",
			">3. **The Very Worm That Gnaws (Su)** As a result of your practice of sleeping in parasite-infested mud or soil to fulfill your obedience to Yhidothrus, your flesh has become riddled with an unholy infection. Yet far from being a troublesome condition, these worms are a welcome addition to your life, and as you gain this final boon, your body is devoured from the inside out by a mass of wriggling leeches, maggots, worms, and other horrid vermin, which are thereafter bound together into a cohesive whole by your foul will.

This curse imposes a -6 penalty to the target's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, but its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores do not increase. These penalties do not stack with any existing penalties a creature might already have as the result of advanced age.",

On a failed save, the target painfully advances in years to the next age category. This aging can never have beneficial effects (such as if used against a true dragon). The target gains the penalties associated with the new age category to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, but its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores do not increase. This advanced age effect lasts for 24 hours before it fades and the affected creature returns to its normal age. A venerable creature (including one whose age has been magically accelerated via this ability to venerable, but not one whose age is temporarily advanced from other effects, such as per sands of time) that fails its saving throw against the aging effects of this ability is instantly slain, as if via old age (though the body instantly reverts to its original age appearance upon death). A creature slain by this effect can only be restored to life via {spell/miracle}, {spell/reincarnate}, {spell/true resurrection}, or {spell/wish}. This is a curse effect.",
			">3. **End Time (Sp)** You can call upon the Ravager Worm to temporarily consume time itself in an area surrounding you. You can cast time stop once per day as a spell-like ability. When you use this ability, those in the area of effect are subjected to a powerful vision - that the world they are in becomes wrapped in the endless coils of the Ravager Worm. The affected creatures never glimpse Yhidothrus's head, and know only for the brief instant of eternity they spend in your time stop area that the world around them is fully wrapped in the coils of something more foul than they even imagined.",

Even Yig's most devout worshipers realize the god may simply wish to feed at times, and on these occasions, no amount of devotion can protect the supplicant from death.",

			"Yig is worshiped primarily by nomadic societies and those who live with a close connection to the land; veneration of him is all but unknown in urban regions. He protects communities that honor him in the right ways, particularly if they follow the complex rituals required of his worship through the seasons. His favor can result in bountiful harvests, good hunts, and strong and healthy babies &mdash; at times immaculate conceptions are attributed to Yig, particularly if the resulting children bear crescent-shaped birthmarks upon their brows. Conversely, when a society has displeased or failed Yig, its children are born with crippling or monstrous deformities that leave mothers dead and fathers insane. Yig speaks through the actions of serpents, yet he is rarely worshiped by serpentfolk. Indeed, the Father of Serpents has long been at war with the god Ydersius, although since the decapitation of Ydersius, Yig has turned his attentions elsewhere.",

Certainly he has great power over time and space, and can exist at multiple times in multiple realities. Distance has no meaning to him, yet he seems unable to properly exist in the reality shared by most mortal life. He can only partially intrude upon this dimension, taking on the shape of a slithering mass of iridescent spheres or glowing motes of light when he does. Or perhaps Yog-Sothoth can exist in this world but has no reason to do so, and what mortals see and tremble before is but his shadow.",

Cults often call upon Yog-Sothoth to bless unborn children, turning them into monstrous hybrids that help to prepare the unsuspecting world for the time when the stars themselves shall be right for the Great Old Ones to rule once again."

Once per day as a full-round action, you can drink the blood of a creature that has been dead for no more than 1 hour to gain the benefits of heroes' feast and death knell for 1 hour. The blood you imbibe must come from a creature with a minimum CR of your character level - 2.",
			">3. **Vampirism (Su)** While Zura's favored worshipers are vampires, she still values the service of powerful cult members who yet live, for a living cultist can move about in the light of day and need not fear the weaknesses most vampires do. But this is not to say that Zura denies her greatest followers the bliss and rapture of becoming a vampire, at least for short periods of time. Thanks to your long-standing devotion to the Vampire Queen, you have become one of those chosen few to gain this peek into a vampire's unlife without having to give up living. Once per day, you can infuse yourself with the qualities of a vampire. Apply the vampire template to yourself for the duration of this effect, which lasts for 1d6 rounds plus an additional number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus. When the effect ends, you are staggered for 1d4 rounds. In time, most worshipers of Zura hope to become vampires, and those who do and have this boon find that they can still draw upon its effects to bolster their power. If you are already a vampire and you activate this boon, you gain the advanced creature simple template for the duration of this effect.",

			">2. **Bloodthirsty Savagery (Ex)** Your canines develop into razor-sharp fangs, and you thirst for the blood of the living. You gain a bite attack, dealing 1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature; if you already have a bite attack, it deals damage as though you were one size category larger. Whenever you confirm a critical hit with your bite attack, you consume some of the victim's flesh and blood, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage. When you deal Constitution damage this way, you heal 5 hit points. If you have the blood drain special attack, you gain its benefits whenever you deal damage with your bite attack, as if you had pinned your target.",
			">3. **Vampire's Flesh (Su)** Your flesh is infused with a vampire's undead vigor, and it repairs itself with unnatural speed. You are damaged by positive energy and healed by negative energy, as if you were undead. In addition, you gain fast healing 5 and DR 10/magic and silver. If you are already a vampire, your fast healing and DR both increase by 5. You are staggered whenever you are exposed to direct natural sunlight; if you are a vampire, this replaces your normal weakness to sunlight.",
