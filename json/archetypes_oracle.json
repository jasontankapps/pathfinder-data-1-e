It even seems capable of reaching out to touch those destined to become oracles through other strange methods. However an oracle becomes black-blooded, her divine powers carry within them the weird power of this chilling magical substance. A black-blooded oracle has the following class features.",

The material affects these oracles physically and mentally, altering both physiology and mystic powers. The blood of a black-blooded oracle actually runs black, and wounds she suffers are infected by her own power and are difficult to heal. She is immune to the effects (both beneficial and destructive) of black blood. Positive and negative energy affect a black-blooded oracle as if she were undead: positive energy harms her, while negative energy heals her (this aspect of the curse has no effect if the oracle is undead). The curse also dulls the oracle's coordination somewhat, imparting a -4 penalty on all Dexterity-based skill checks. At 5th level, she gains cold resistance 5. This increases to cold resistance 10 at 10th level, and immunity to cold at 15th level. This ability replaces the oracle's curse.",

She must make a touch attack to hit the target (if she's attacking the creature that caused the wound, she gains a +4 circumstance bonus on her attack roll). If she hits, she deals 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per 2 oracle levels she possesses. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her oracle level (minimum 1/day).",
			">",
			">**Dark Resilience (Su):** The black blood flowing through a black-blooded oracle's veins gives her resistance to many effects to which undead are immune. Once per day, as an immediate action, whenever she fails a saving throw against an ability drain, a death effect, disease, energy drain, paralysis, or poison, she may attempt that saving throw again with a +4 circumstance bonus. She must take the second result, even if it is worse. At 7th level, she can use this ability twice per day. At 15th level, she can use the ability 3 times per day.",

This noxious fluid repulses and freezes all natural life, although certain creatures like aberrations, undead, and black-blooded oracles possess an uncanny immunity to its effects. Any other creature that comes into contact with black blood takes 1d6 points of cold damage - 10d6 points of cold damage per round if fully immersed.",

			"Although black blood isn't itself inherently evil, a pint of black blood can be used as {eq-weapon/unholy water}. A spellcaster who consumes a dose of black blood casts all necromantic spells at +1 caster level for the next 10 minutes, but takes 3d6 points of cold damage and 1 point of Constitution damage by drinking the stuff. Normally, a dose of black blood becomes inert an hour after being harvested from the source in the Land of Black Blood, losing all mystical properties. {spell/Gentle repose} can preserve up to 1 gallon of black blood's magical properties for increased lengths of time, but no other method of stabilizing the stuff has yet been developed. The blood of a black-blooded oracle is diluted and does not have the properties of full-strength black blood."

A tree soul can also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the *ironwood* spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Tree souls are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but can use only those crafted from wood.",

Damage you take in this way cannot be healed by normal or magical means until your bonded tree is healed or destroyed. The damage can reduce you to 0 hit points but not below. If the tree is destroyed, you are considered to be staggered and are unable to cast oracle spells or use supernatural or spell-like class abilities until you bond with a new tree in a ceremony that takes 12 hours to complete. Once per month, you can create a new bond with a different tree in a ceremony at that tree that takes 12 hours to complete. You lose your bond with your previous tree in the process.",

The wood takes on the quality of {eq-material/darkwood} for 1 minute per oracle level. At 11th level, you can have it instead take on the quality of {eq-material/living steel} for the same duration.",
			">",
			">**Living Steel Dolls (Ex):** At 11th level, you add {spell/animate objects} to your list of spells known. When you cast this spell on wooden objects, the objects' wooden parts immediately transform into living steel. If the objects are destroyed or the duration ends, the wooden parts revert back to their original material.",
			">",
			">**Tree Soul Revelation (Su):** At 20th level, your skin takes on the appearance and properties of a tree trunk. This bark-like skin grants you a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and DR 10/slashing. You also regrow any severed limbs except your head within 24 hours as per {spell/regenerate}. Finally, once a day as a standard action, you can assume the form of a {monster/treant}, as per {spell/plant shape III}, for a number of minutes equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",
