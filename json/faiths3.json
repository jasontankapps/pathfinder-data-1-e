			">3. **Avian Mastery (Su)** Any creature flying under its own power (flight from a source other than a spell, spell-like ability, or magic item) that attempts to attack you with a melee attack must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If the creature fails, it can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack you for the remainder of the round. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.",

You can use this spell-like ability up to three times per day. Creatures with fly speeds take a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. If a creature that fails its save against this effect is under the benefits of protection from evil or a similar effect, that effect is immediately and automatically dispelled. You can use this ability against a creature that has not invoked Pazuzu's name, but if you do so, it functions as a normal (non-quickened) charm monster spell that does not dispel protection from evil effects.",

While this effect is active, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, and all ranged attacks against you suffer a 50% miss chance. These supernatural winds can even deflect ranged touch spell effects (such as rays) and massive ranged weapons such as ballista bolts or thrown boulders. As a standard action, you can also direct these winds to assail a creature within 30 feet; this acts as a bull rush or trip attempt, using your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier. You can maintain this wind shield for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, but these rounds need not be consecutive.",
			">3. **Champion of Shibaxet (Sp)** The King of the Wind Demons grants you mastery over the power of the winds. You can cast winds of vengeance as a spell-like ability once per day.",

If you drop to negative hit points while in this determined state, you can continue to act normally, and do not bleed each round due to taking actions. If your determined state ends while you still have a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you die instantly.

You can use this ability when casting a spell that deals hit point damage and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less. You can choose to cast the spell as a full-round action to gain a +4 bonus to its save DC. In addition, you treat all 1s rolled on your damage dice for the spell as 2s instead.",

You gain an extra spell slot of the highest spell level you can cast. If you prepare spells, you can prepare one spell in this spell slot every day from the Chaos or Destruction domain spell lists. You may choose any spell from the lists even if you are an arcane spellcaster, and you can change this spell selection every time you prepare spells. If you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can cast one spell from either of the domain spell lists as if it was on your known spells list.

As a standard action, you can spend one use of your destructive smite to grant its power to any ally within 30 feet, channeling into him the erratic force of Rovagug's rage. Your ally must make the destructive smite within 1 round of being granted the power or its use is wasted. Your ally uses your level to calculate the power of the destructive smite. If you don't have access to the Destruction domain, you instead gain access to the destructive smite granted power but only for your personal use, as normal.",

You gain telepathy with the creatures to a range of 100 feet, and they follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back into the Abyss.

You gain a pair of claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d8 points of slashing damage if you're Medium or 1d6 points of damage if you're Small.",
			">3. **Disintegrating Blow (Sp)** Once per day, you can channel a glimpse of Rovagug's hatred through your weapon, recreating the effects of disintegrate. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack.

For a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds), you can cause flames to wreathe your weapon.

On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast sunburst, as well as taking normal weapon damage.

In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of Dawnflower's Mercies teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae's arms.",

You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead.

If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points.

The entire mansion is under the effects of a guards and wards spell, which refreshes each day. Any food conjured by the mansion is poisoned with dark reaver powder, and the unseen servants can become spiritual allies (although only one can do so at a time).

A transformed creature's type becomes construct, and it gains all traits of the construct type, including lack of a Constitution score. The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait. A transformed creature must be wound once per day with a special key (which appears as part of this transformation); as the key must be inserted into the creature's back, this requires either a successful DC 25 Dexterity or Escape Artist check or another creature's assistance. If the creature is not wound by midnight each night, it becomes immobile and helpless until wound again. A creature transformed into a clockwork doll becomes mindless, with an Intelligence score of 0. It can't use any supernatural or spell-like abilities it had prior to transforming, nor can it cast spells. It also loses all feats and skill ranks. A clockwork doll follows your commands to the letter, but otherwise it remains motionless and takes no actions on its own (unless you command it to react in certain ways, such as serving as a room guardian). This transformation can be reversed only by break enchantment, miracle, polymorph any object, or wish. If the clockwork doll is slain, the creature can be brought back to life via true resurrection. You can only have one clockwork doll under your command at a time. If you create a second clockwork doll, the first one must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it succeeds, it reverts to its previous form with no memories of the time spent as your clockwork doll, but if it fails this save, the clockwork doll crumbles to rubble and is destroyed.

You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity. Making this choice does not require an action, or even awareness that you are being targeted (in which case the ability always functions as best benefits the character in that situation). In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities. Once per week, you can choose to perform the obedience of any lawful or good deity with which you are familiar instead of Sifkesh's obedience. This still grants you your normal benefits from Sifkesh, not those from the other faith.",

Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting spells, that creature becomes filled with false but nevertheless convincing memories of having committed a horrific sin. A nonevil and nongood target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become staggered for 1 round, while a good target must succeed at this Will save or become nauseated for 1 round.

This spell resistance lasts until you use this ability again to blaspheme a different religion or until you fail to perform your daily obedience.",
			">3. **Mass Suicide (Sp)** Your influence can drive entire groups of people to acts of self-destruction. You can cast weird once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assaulting the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who falls prey to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness.

You can cast phantasmal killer three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.",
			">3. **Broken Angel (Ex)** Like that of your Abyssal mistress, your body has fallen to pieces. Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts. You are immune to effects that cause severed limbs or that arise from severed limbs (including the beheading effect of a vorpal sword) and also to bleed effects and bleed damage.

You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on Will saves to disbelieve illusions. If you successfully disbelieve an illusion and communicate this fact to others, such viewers gain a +6 bonus (of the same type as above) on their saving throws to disbelieve the illusion.",

All the creatures disguised appear to be of a single race or creature type; creatures in the group that could not be disguised as that creature type (such as an animal companion in a group of humanoids) cannot be affected by this ability. This effect lasts 10 minutes per Hit Die you possess.",
			">3. **The Protecting Veil (Su)** You can shield an area, and those within it, from both mundane and magical observation. As a full-round action, you can meditate to veil an area with an illusion extending in a 30-foot radius around you. During this round, you can't take any other actions, including free or swift actions. The illusion appears as a general concept you envision and can't be changed once in place. The illusion affects only visual observation and scrying; it doesn't create or disguise smells, sounds, or tactile properties. You may maintain the illusion for up to 1 hour, but if you leave the square you were occupying when you initiated it, the illusion is dispelled. The DC to disbelieve the illusion is equal to 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier.",

Once per day, as a free action when you hit with a melee attack, you can cause images of a creature the target most fears to erupt from your weapon right before its eyes. Resolve this effect before rolling damage for the attack; this functions as phantasmal killer, and the target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to recognize the image as unreal. On a failed save, the phantasm touches the target, which must then succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (against the same DC) or die from fear. Even if the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of damage as well as the damage from the successful melee attack. Unlike phantasmal killer, this effect cannot be turned upon you if the subject possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy.",
			">3. **Illusive Revenge (Sp)** You have learned how to use illusions to torment your enemies even long after battle is over. Once per day, you can cast phantasmal revenge as a spell-like ability upon a recently slain creature, which rises as a ghastly image to seek out its killer. This illusive ghost is always veiled, even if it never was so in life. After the target attempts its Will saving throw (DC = 17 + your Charisma modifier), regardless of whether the attempt was successful, the ghost tears off its veil to reveal an image of the killer's own face.",

Mind-affecting spells you cast that would normally grant an additional saving throw or a bonus on saving throws for opposing the target's nature do not grant these bonuses or saves, as long as the intended course of action is lurid or perverse (such as causing a druid to lust after her animal companion, or a brother and sister to lust after one another).

You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle.

The blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The blade lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level, though the blade immediately vanishes if it leaves your hand.
