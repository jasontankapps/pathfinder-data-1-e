If the creature fails, it can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack you for the remainder of the round. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.",

You can use this spell-like ability up to three times per day. Creatures with fly speeds take a -4 penalty on saving throws against this effect. If a creature that fails its save against this effect is under the benefits of protection from evil or a similar effect, that effect is immediately and automatically dispelled. You can use this ability against a creature that has not invoked Pazuzu's name, but if you do so, it functions as a normal (non-quickened) charm monster spell that does not dispel protection from evil effects.",

While this effect is active, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class, and all ranged attacks against you suffer a 50% miss chance. These supernatural winds can even deflect ranged touch spell effects (such as rays) and massive ranged weapons such as ballista bolts or thrown boulders. As a standard action, you can also direct these winds to assail a creature within 30 feet; this acts as a bull rush or trip attempt, using your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier. You can maintain this wind shield for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, but these rounds need not be consecutive.",

You can use this ability when casting a spell that deals hit point damage and has a casting time of 1 standard action or less. You can choose to cast the spell as a full-round action to gain a +4 bonus to its save DC. In addition, you treat all 1s rolled on your damage dice for the spell as 2s instead.",

You gain an extra spell slot of the highest spell level you can cast. If you prepare spells, you can prepare one spell in this spell slot every day from the Chaos or Destruction domain spell lists. You may choose any spell from the lists even if you are an arcane spellcaster, and you can change this spell selection every time you prepare spells. If you are a spontaneous spellcaster, you can cast one spell from either of the domain spell lists as if it was on your known spells list.

As a standard action, you can spend one use of your destructive smite to grant its power to any ally within 30 feet, channeling into him the erratic force of Rovagug's rage. Your ally must make the destructive smite within 1 round of being granted the power or its use is wasted. Your ally uses your level to calculate the power of the destructive smite. If you don't have access to the Destruction domain, you instead gain access to the destructive smite granted power but only for your personal use, as normal.",
			">3. **Apocalyptic Ally (Sp)** Once per day as a standard action, you can tear a violent breach between your location and the Outer Rifts - the deepest, foulest pits of the Abyss - and summon forth a pair of nyogoth qlippoth. You gain telepathy with the creatures to a range of 100 feet, and they follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back into the Abyss. The qlippoth don't follow commands that would cause them to act in overtly good or lawful ways.

For a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds), you can cause flames to wreathe your weapon. Any weapon you hold while this ability is active becomes a +1 flaming burst weapon. (You can use this ability on a ranged weapon, but can't apply it directly to a piece of ammunition.) If you drop the weapon or give it away, the flame effect on that weapon immediately ends. If the weapon you hold has an enhancement bonus greater than +1, use the higher bonus.

You can add your exalted levels to any cleric levels you have to calculate the power of your channel energy ability. In addition, you can spend three of your daily uses of your channel energy ability to channel an especially powerful burst of healing that manifests as a bright burst of sunlight around you. Anyone healed by your channeled energy sunburst who is currently suffering from poison or a nonmagical disease can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 sacred bonus to end the poison or disease effect.",
			">3. **Angelic Ally (Sp)** Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a movanic deva to aid you. You gain telepathy with the movanic deva to a range of 100 feet. The deva follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home.

You can channel positive energy by consuming a single use of your lay on hands ability instead of two uses. If you don't have the lay on hands class feature (or if you have lay on hands but can't use it to channel positive energy), you instead gain a +4 sacred bonus on Heal checks.",

On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast sunburst, as well as taking normal weapon damage. The sunburst effect you generate affects only the target you have struck, not an area of effect as it would normally. If you miss with your attack, the sunburst ability is wasted.",

In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of Dawnflower's Mercies teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae's arms.",

You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and {main/inflict |spell/s>_groupings} so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead.

If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon.",

			">3. **Charnel Retreat (Sp)** The Blood Marquis grants you a tiny corner of his domain of Charnelhome to use for your own pleasures. Three times per day, you can create a portal to this place. This acts as mage's magnificent mansion, except the mansion exists as part of the Abyss (all planar traits apply) and the portal can be seen and used by anyone. This realm continues to exist when not in use, although foodstuffs and servants are magically replenished each day. In addition, the realm is lethal to invaders. The entire mansion is under the effects of a guards and wards spell, which refreshes each day. Any food conjured by the mansion is poisoned with dark reaver powder, and the unseen servants can become spiritual allies (although only one can do so at a time). You and creatures designated by you are unaffected by these hazardous effects.",

			">2. **Life in Blood (Su)** When your veins are opened, you revel in the glorious pain and exalt in the knowledge that you are closer to your unholy patron. Such wounds do not imperil your life but instead invigorate you. You treat bleed effects as fast healing. For example, if you suffer an effect that causes bleed 5, you take no damage from the effect and instead gain fast healing 5. This ability activates automatically the first time each day you suffer a bleed effect, and it continues until you are fully healed. After that point, the ability ceases to function and does not work for 24 hours, during which time bleed effects affect you normally. If you are affected by multiple bleed effects during the time in which this ability is active, you always gain fast healing equal to the most powerful bleed effect.",

As a swift action, you can imbue a natural weapon you have or a manufactured weapon you wield with the vicious special ability for 1 round. During this round, whenever you take the 1d6 points of damage from using a vicious weapon (whether it's one you created with this ability or otherwise), you gain a profane bonus to Armor Class and saving throws equal to the amount of damage taken until the start of your turn in the next round. This bonus does not stack with itself if you use a vicious weapon multiple times in a round, but a higher roll can increase the bonus gained. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, but these rounds need not be consecutive.",
			">3. **Bloodbath (Su)** You wield daggers like paintbrushes, crafting an exquisite masterpiece of blood and gore with every surgical stroke. Whenever you use a dagger to deal damage to a creature, you also deal bleed damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This bleed damage stacks with bleed damage you have from other abilities. Whenever a creature within 15 feet of you takes bleed damage from a wound you inflict, the blood flows to you and into your wounds, healing you for an number of hit points equal to the bleed damage taken this way.",

The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait. A transformed creature must be wound once per day with a special key (which appears as part of this transformation); as the key must be inserted into the creature's back, this requires either a successful DC 25 Dexterity or Escape Artist check or another creature's assistance.

You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity.

In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities.

			">3. **Mass Suicide (Sp)** Your influence can drive entire groups of people to acts of self-destruction. You can cast {spell/weird} once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assaulting the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who falls prey to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness.

You can cast {spell/phantasmal killer} three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.",

Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts.

During this round, you can't take any other actions, including free or swift actions. The illusion appears as a general concept you envision and can't be changed once in place. The illusion affects only visual observation and scrying; it doesn't create or disguise smells, sounds, or tactile properties. You may maintain the illusion for up to 1 hour, but if you leave the square you were occupying when you initiated it, the illusion is dispelled. The DC to disbelieve the illusion is equal to 10 + your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier.",

			">2. **Killer Illusion (Sp)** You can channel illusions through your weapon to terrify and even slay your enemies. Once per day, as a free action when you hit with a melee attack, you can cause images of a creature the target most fears to erupt from your weapon right before its eyes. Resolve this effect before rolling damage for the attack; this functions as {spell/phantasmal killer}, and the target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to recognize the image as unreal. On a failed save, the phantasm touches the target, which must then succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (against the same DC) or die from fear. Even if the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 3d6 points of damage as well as the damage from the successful melee attack. Unlike phantasmal killer, this effect cannot be turned upon you if the subject possesses telepathy or is wearing a helm of telepathy.",
			">3. **Illusive Revenge (Sp)** You have learned how to use illusions to torment your enemies even long after battle is over. Once per day, you can cast {spell/phantasmal revenge} as a spell-like ability upon a recently slain creature, which rises as a ghastly image to seek out its killer. This illusive ghost is always veiled, even if it never was so in life. After the target attempts its Will saving throw (DC = 17 + your Charisma modifier), regardless of whether the attempt was successful, the ghost tears off its veil to reveal an image of the killer's own face.",

Mind-affecting spells you cast that would normally grant an additional saving throw or a bonus on saving throws for opposing the target's nature do not grant these bonuses or saves, as long as the intended course of action is lurid or perverse (such as causing a druid to lust after her animal companion, or a brother and sister to lust after one another).

You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle. If the resulting form would be lethal, the target gains a +4 bonus on the save.
