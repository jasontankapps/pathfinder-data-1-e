In those early days, Dagon had no name and no real intellect or personality of his own; he was only an immense, ravenous sea monster that swam through the depths of Ishiar, feeding on anything unfortunate enough to cross his path. It was through the consumption of countless demons and once-mortal petitioners that Dagon gained sentience and in so doing infused his terrible form with the influence of mortal sin. He is aware of his origin as a nearly mindless qlippoth and does not seek to return to this state; on the contrary, reveling in the awareness he earned, the demon lord has spent eons building up his presence on countless Material Plane worlds. Although he bears the qlippoth no ill will, he does not suffer their intrusions into his realm."

He often broods during such times - right up until he undertakes a violent rampage. The church of Dahak is similar, especially on Golarion where it is currently engaged in a \"civil\" phase.

			"Damerrich is a silent, monolithic figure clad in black stone armor. His handsome, hairless face is mostly hidden behind his helm; only his weary eyes are clearly visible. Once Damerrich commits to combat, he strikes heavily and without hesitation. Centuries of death wear on Damerrich's soul, but only because of the solemn responsibility, not because of guilt or reluctance - when the time comes for action, Damerrich's blow is sure. The Weighted Swing holds no room for regret.",
			"",
			"Judges, whether appointed officials in city courthouses or village leaders acting as part of a tribunal, pray to Damerrich for guidance in their judgments. Good people may understand the need for executions but shrink from the act; Damerrich and his agents help reassure them when executions are appropriate or take the burden of mortal guilt upon themselves. Those wrongly sentenced to death pray for intercession from Damerrich, and can hope to receive help in the form of one of his divine agents. Corrupt judges and careless executioners rouse the Weighted Swing's ire like nothing else. Similarly, if an accused deserving of death is set free, Damerrich's agents might appear both to perform the just execution and to chastise those who set the criminal free. The Weighted Swing does not take pleasure in his grim but necessary task, and those who take the matter of execution too lightly or who sadistically revel in the act may expect retribution from Damerrich's chosen elimination squad of shield archons, Those of the Heaving Hand.",

He thinks of himself as superior to other demon lords, especially those who began their route to power as mortal souls.

She challenges those who would corrupt her domain or who have wronged her friends or followers, striking at them with burning starlight, bad luck, and energies alien to Golarion.",

When Desna wishes to reveal her true nature, she transforms her common clothing into a billowing silken gown and grows brightly colored butterfly wings on her back, although in somber situations her wing colors are pale and moth-like."

Doloras was charged with holding the line against a decades-long incursion of demons rushing the outskirts of Erastil's realm in Heaven. But when several solar angels were dragged off as prisoners into the Abyss, including Doloras's three brothers, Doloras followed, alone, to hunt the demons she thought responsible.

She even found herself enjoying the act of inflicting pain on helpless souls so much that even when it became clear that these demons weren't part of her brothers' kidnapping party, she continued.",

			"Later, Doloras discovered what came as no surprise: the gates of Heaven were closed to her. She had fallen from grace, but as she had now found salvation through an absence of emotion, she set herself about finding a home that suited her better.

As for her angelic siblings, to this day they mourn her as dead, though they harbor deep suspicions about their sister's true fate.",

Doloras would have her choice of spire and all that she wished to outfit her new home, in exchange for viciously torturing specific souls whenever he asked. Without reservation, Doloras agreed, and ever since she has resided on the Spike of Our Lady's Pain. Unlike many fiends, the Sadistic Angel does not seek dominion; she wishes only to inflict her emotionless, bloodthirsty vision on those set before her. She was willing to ally with the other Queens of the Night when {faith/Eiseth} drew them all together, so long as Doloras was free to torment her choice of captives - a condition the other queens have happily granted. She regards the mortal-given title of Whore Queen with characteristic indifference, and those who try to hurl the epithet at her often find themselves upon her rack, thus providing Doloras as much joy as one such as her can feel."

She promotes mating, families, and tribes, not because she is a nurturing deity, but because she believes in strength in numbers and fostering strong warriors. Dretha is the patron of crafts, yet all orc gods are war gods, and Dretha is no different. The Dark Mother blesses those who fight jealously to defend their mates, children, lands, and possessions from enemies who would steal or destroy them.",

Orcs typically claim Dretha is the mate of the male god their tribe holds in highest esteem. Dretha is the most widely revered of the orc gods, and while tribes may come to blows over which orc god is superior, all acknowledge the Dark Mother."

			"Erastil, also known as Old Deadeye, is an ancient deity who first became known on Golarion when early humanoids began to domesticate and dominate their natural surroundings. Pastoral legends claim that Old Deadeye crafted the first bow as a gift to mortals so that they might learn to hunt and survive in the dangerous world. Though civilization has continued to advance beyond simple villages, Erastil remains popular in tradition and in the frontiers of the world, a transitional figure between the worship of the Green Faith and the religions of cities.",
			"",
			"Erastil is primarily a nature deity focusing on the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their challenging lives. He is also a god of close-knit communities and families, and has a protector aspect that only surfaces when such things are threatened. Erastil eschews crusades and brazen heroism, and he has no grand plans to eradicate chaos and evil from the world; he simply wants people to be able to live their lives in peace without the threat of being devoured by monsters, conscripted into an army, or destroyed by world-ending magic. He is a stern patriarch whose spirit is as hard as wood. He isn't afraid to face down a bully, nor is he too proud to calm a frightened child. He teaches how to read the turning of the seasons, how to know when to sow and reap, how to tell when livestock are sick or gravid, how to poultice a wound and set a broken leg, how to spot a straggling sheep or the signs that a dog has gone rabid. He believes that cooperation leads to friendship and safety, and that if mortals respect the gifts of nature, it will sustain them. He loves customs that encourage strong family bonds - no matter how quaint they are by modern standards - and enjoys hunting for sustenance but not for sport. Happy weddings and new babies make him smile. He is not one to spout philosophy, and instead gives practical advice and hands-on teaching.",
			"",
			"Erastil's avatar is an upright hunter with the head of an elk, clad in well-used leathers and carrying a simple bow. Old legends say that halflings and humans each see him as a member of their own race, even when members  of both races are looking at him at the same time. Some representations show him as fully human - usually of Ulfen or Kellid heritage - depicting how he sometimes appears to children, lost travelers, or those he simply doesn't wish to reveal his divine nature to. In most stories, Old Deadeye's arrows never miss, and a few communities still own a spent arrow supposedly once fired by Erastil, passed down through the generations and treasured for its connection to the god."

Further, Dispater often calls on Erecura to arbitrate disputes between high-ranking devils and others under his purview. A planar traveler who has run afoul of one of Dispater's designated underlings, who needs a favor before visiting the Market of Breaths, or who has been duped or exploited in the city's bowels might appeal to Erecura for resolution. In particularly desperate cases, an adventurer might appeal to Erecura to overturn a decision that one of Dispater's underlings or the First King himself has handed down.",

Despite her realm's perilous location, the dais's surface is entirely free of cleansing fire. Flora in the form of flaming-red bushes and vines wind elegantly throughout the dais's rocky terrain, sustaining all manner of strange wildlife, including intelligent, rabbit-like creatures with fiery tails who, curiously, do not actually burn with any heat. Other creatures that live here include an expansive community of {monster/fire veela/s} who worship their beloved Feronia absolutely.",
			"",
			"Feronia spends much of her time in a great commune built atop the dais's tallest spires. Most believe she lives there with her fiery children, whom she's said to have conceived over the millennia with various divine and semi-divine beings. Her most famous and only confirmed son is {faith/Ragathiel}, the product of Feronia's short-lived marriage to the archdevil {faith/Dispater}; while their son was still a babe, Feronia amicably left Hell, taking Ragathiel with her, and nurtured him until he became an empyreal lord. The number of other nascent divinities Feronia currently protects remains unknown, but she is said to have thwarted several divine plots to retrieve or slay her charges. Similarly, suitors - even those of a divine nature - who try to insinuate themselves into the Cradle of Flames are invariably rebuffed, as Feronia insists on meeting and courting potential love interests on her own terms.",
			"",
			"Although her natural state is said to be a massive, shapeless flame shot through with intricate rivulets of shining gold, she often takes the form of a beautiful, black-skinned woman with molten eyes, a swan made of pure flame, or a phoenix with a crown of gold and sapphires."

His face is dominated by a fanged mouth from which clouds of smoke, thick rivulets of magma, and tongues of fire emerge. Flauros has the ability to spew out gouts of supernaturally hot molten rock that can scorch and burn even those normally immune to fire. He can also command the viscosity of lava, causing it to run like water, thicken into a mud-like consistency, or harden instantly into rock. He uses the latter ability not only to trap foes immersed in lava, but also to swiftly shape weapons of volcanic glass that burn with fire. Yet it is Flauros's command over volcanoes that is most devastating; legends tell of the demon lord causing new volcanoes to emerge from the ground to raze entire regions that have slighted him.",

The Mistress of Fire, a jealous and vindictive elemental lord named {faith/Ymeri}, has long waged war against Flauros for the salamanders' worship, but Flauros has traditionally emerged the victor. The demon lord has even been known to work portals into the hearts of volcanoes in his domain, burning through reality to connect to the equally violent volcanoes that line the borders between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire - all for the sole purpose of tormenting Ymeri by leading armies of demons on periodic assaults against her domains."

Widely worshiped in Hongal, Kaoling, Minkai, and Shokuro, he is the god of archery, horsemanship, and war. General Susumu leads a great army of samurai and warriors who died gloriously in battle, and has been known to appear at great conflicts, sometimes merely watching, and other times joining in for the sheer joy of fighting. In his humanoid form, General Susumu has red skin and great bristling eyebrows and wears ornate black o-yoroi armor. He rides a black winged horse into battle and carries an iron longbow that shoots arrows of fire. When his anger is truly roused, he appears as an immense crimson dragon with eyes of fire and obsidian tusks.",

When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the {umr/swallow whole/ universal monster ability}. Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.

In addition, when you confirm a critical hit, your target takes 1 point of {rule/bleed} damage for every 2 character levels you have. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of their turns.

On a hit, the target is affected as if the subject of {spell/horrid wilting} cast by a wizard of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum CL 20th), as well as normal weapon damage. If you miss with your attack, the use of this ability is wasted.",

Instead, Ghlaunder revels in the world's sickness, and his followers infest communities as surely as any parasite, often in the guise of devout priests of other religions, while working to cultivate filth and fever. His cultists are indiscriminate in their targets - young, old, fit, or frail, it matters not - so long as they pass their affliction on to the next, then they to another, and like the candle held too close to the curtain, the world alights in infection and death.",

The mothers of dying infants or the infirm often appeal to Ghlaunder, and the god sometimes grants respite from sickness.

In truth, both of these appearances constitute her true form; she favors neither one over the other. In the form of a frog, she has the ability to unleash a soul-shattering croak that can carry for miles through swamplands, even seeping across planar boundaries to lure or drive mad those who hear it. This is the legendary song of the swamp, and few that listen to it are left unchanged, their thoughts increasingly obsessed with tracking down the source of the song to offer themselves to Gogunta as meals - or as something more unspeakable. When confronted by those she simply wishes to kill rather than feed upon or mate with, Gogunta can attack with her multiple acid-dripping tongues, her many fanged maws, and her sharp talons. Those swallowed by Gogunta spend ages in stasis in one of her many stomachs, and when she belches them up, it is as twisted, frog-like mutants who serve as her minions forevermore."

He believes in strength and power, the verdict of the sword, and the music of clashing iron. He does not favor good or evil, and the only right he confers upon mortals is the right to fight for their next breath.

Before this conflict, his name was not known, but as human clashed with orc, Gorum rose into prominence as the divine personification of horrible, exhilarating war. Wherever was has risen throughout the world ever since, Gorum has been there to inspire mortals to greatness on the battlefield. Under his iron gaze, the worthy find glory - and those who fall are forgotten.",

Despite advances in magic, technology, and the tools of war, Our Lord in Iron is remarkably constant, for his focus is on battle itself, not the reasons for it or the types of weapons used. Whether a battle is between orcs and humans, goblins and dwarves, or elves and creatures from beyond the stars, Gorum is there to glory in the vital energy of conflict.",

			"Artistic depictions of Gorum are uncommon, as his followers prefer mighty deeds and boastful words to quieter, more permanent works of art. Of the depictions that are created, however, his image, shape, or shadow is often drawn in blood or hammered together out of scraps of metal. A few temples with forges have molds for casting weapons, and the spillover channels in the molds lead to hand-sized receptacles shaped like spiked, armored men with Gorum's symbol on their chests.
