			"Onos promotes travel through the planes, especially the Inner Planes, as a way of discovery and a means of witnessing the raw elements that form reality. Onos is difficult for many mortals to understand, as it is more of an animated force than a being with a distinct personality. When it speaks to its followers, it is always direct and to the point, not bothering with cryptic parables or mysterious symbolism.",
			"",
			"Onos is the god of embassies, thus many shrines and temples to this deity were found in Azlanti outposts throughout Golarion, but most places dedicated to the worship of Onos exist elsewhere on the Inner Sphere, such as the Elemental Planes. The largest and most extravagant temples of Onos are in the City of Brass and similar planar outposts, serving as safe havens and meeting places for planar travelers in inhospitable locations.",
			"",
			"Priests of Onos are for the most part polite and welcoming, especially to strangers. They bear a calm temperament, and they and are rarely roused to anger. Though Onos doesn't count law among its areas of concern, many of its priests serve as mediators, a role that suits them well, for studying the balance between primal forces is paramount to their faith and understanding of reality.",
			"",
			"While Onos was an obscure deity even at the height of the Azlanti Empire, the God of Many Doors still has many worshipers, though few of them reside on Golarion now. Planar travelers whisper prayers to Onos each time they call forth a gate or shift between planes of existence.",

			"While Orcus is served by many undead, and becoming an undead creature is a goal that nearly all of his living cultists obsess over, very few {template/vampire/s} or {monster/ghoul/s} are counted among these undead servitors, since {faith/Kabriri} has domain over ghouls and {faith/Zura} over vampires. This isn't so much a metaphysical barrier as it is a philosophical one; the conflict between Orcus and other gods and demigods associated with undeath is legendary, with Orcus's wrath as powerful and immediate against these competitors as it is against faiths that actively seek to destroy undead. To the priesthood of Orcus, the {template/lich} is generally held as the height of power and the most glorious method of transcending life, not only due to the power a lich wields but also due to the simple fact that one must actually work to become a lich. Transforming into a lich requires patience, power, skill, and talent, and worshipers of Orcus often regard those undead spawned merely from being transformed by another undead creature via disease or otherwise as lesser incarnations of the undead state of being. To the worshipers of Orcus, there is no difference between a vampire and a leper. Vampirism is a disease, and like all diseases, it spreads most quickly among the weak - as a result, Orcus cultists maintain that vampires represent the weakest form of undeath. Accidental undeath ranks only slightly higher, but even then the lich who spent the majority of his living existence working toward a singular transformation feels jealousy and frustration over those who become {template/ghost/s} simply by chance after death. To Orcus cultists, even mindless undead like {template/skeleton/s} and {template/zombie/s} are \"purer\" forms of undeath than ghosts, ghouls, and vampires, for as mindless as skeletons and zombies are, they exist only as a result of a necromancer's skill at magic. They are not creations of mere chance or misfortune but calculated additions to the world, and as such their place in the church is much more valued.",
			"",
			"Orcus appears as an immense humanoid with a ram's head, bat-like wings, cloven feet, and a long tail ending in a stinger. In combat he is a true terror, capable of injecting lethal toxins via his tail, breaking bones with his hooves, and even inhaling the soul from a living creature's body, yet all these tools of pain and misery quail before what he wields in one festering hand - the legendary *Wand of Orcus*. This weapon slays with but a touch, and yet this is only one of its many powers."

			"Pazuzu appears as a humanoid with eagle's feet and talons, a demonic avian head, two pairs of bird wings, a scorpion tail, and a writhing snake in place of his genitals. Pazuzu is an aggressive demon fond of possessing mortals and using them to work his evils upon the world. It is said that Pazuzu can hear his name when anyone speaks it - and that this may be all that is needed to invite possession by the demon lord. He is the patron of all evil things that fly, particularly {monster/harp/ies>y} and {monster/vrock/s}. His breath is a cloud of locusts, and legend tells that at the dawn of civilization his first breath of air upon the Material Plane spawned the demon that, in time, would become {faith/Deskari}.",
			"",
			"Although Pazuzu can indeed hear his name whenever it is spoken, locate a creature if his name is spoken three times in the same breath, and possess those he so pinpoints when he and the speaker are on the same plane, it is in fact relatively rare for Pazuzu to act upon these opportunities. Typically, he takes advantage of this ability when the speaker is in a region where he feels his reputation needs bolstering, but in most cases he only does so when the speaker does so innocently or out of ignorance. One of Pazuzu's great joys is possessing and destroying the life of an innocent, be it a holy warrior, a naive prince, or a very young person. When he takes control of such a victim, Pazuzu takes his time in taking apart all that victim holds dear. Friends, family, and loved ones bear the brunt of Pazuzu's wrath, and it is only when, often several months or even years later, the victim's life has been reduced to shambles that Pazuzu relinquishes his spiritual hold over the victim. In most cases, the victim has been driven to despair or has even grown to see Pazuzu as her only ally, and gratefully continues to serve even after release from possession.",
			"",
			"The demon lord can hear his name spoken by his cultists as well but rarely comes to their aid or answers their call - cultists who cannot fend for themselves or bolster Pazuzu's reputation on their own, after all, hardly deserve aid. More often than not, when a cultist begs for help or attempts to attract Pazuzu's attention in this way, the demon lord becomes enraged and sends an agent to smite the speaker - or at least to look on and mock as the desperate cultist fails."

			"In life, Phlegyas was an arrogant but gifted man. He was cast out from {faith/Shelyn/'s} church for his blasphemy and pride, but the clergy's attempt to wipe away Phlegyas's legacy was undone, as the mortal's name survived among admirers and detractors alike. Pharasma saw this form of immortality as fundamental to mortal experience and raised Phlegyas up to be a patron both of art outlasting its creator and of those who spurned the gods. As a symbol of creations outliving their creators, she is also the usher of new parents, especially those who die in childbirth. Unlike Shelyn's domain of beauty, the Consoler of Atheists embodies resonance, and the works Phlegyas inspires are as often painful or horrifying as they are beautiful.",
			"",
			"Time and perspective cooled Phlegyas's resentment of the divine, and now she and her servants offer respite to atheists who arrive at the Boneyard. Those godless souls who show potential she reserves to train as psychopomps.",
			"",
			"Phlegyas is the most human of the ushers: a tall, broad-shouldered woman wearing a simple, plaster domino mask and carrying an oar she uses to ferry those who spurn the call of their gods. Her realm is the Anonymous Loggia, a museum of works by long-forgotten creators that still remain linchpins in mortal cultures."

He led an entire army against one of the iron fortresses of Avernus and burned the castle to the ground with holy fire, single-handedly maiming Infernal Duke {faith/Deumus} in the process.

Those who have taken vows, especially those of duty or vengeance, hold Ragathiel as their ideal, and his agents sometimes assist those who have been grievously wronged and now seek righteous vengeance."

			"Strange and silent Rhan-Tegoth bears some similarities to {faith/Chaugnar Faugn} in that much of its existence seems to have been spent in waiting. Texts mention a time when Rhan-Tegoth was active and alive and ruled an empire to the north on an unknown world far beyond Golarion, yet when its worshipers abandoned it, Rhan-Tegoth transformed into an immobile statue of an unknown material. Yet immobility should not in this case be taken for inactivity, as those who spend time in proximity to this strange statue find themselves compelled to undertake increasingly violent sacrifices before the slumbering Great Old One &mdash; mere proximity is apparently enough to enable the ancient entity's mind to reach out and influence lesser intellects than its own.",
			"",
			"While records of Rhan-Tegoth's waking periods and its activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors persist of certain chants capable of temporarily stirring the god from its eternal hibernation and restoring life and mobility to its petrified form. What purpose such chants could serve, one can only guess, for the Great Old One invariably devours those with the temerity to rouse it. The ancient texts do agree that when Rhan-Tegoth does finally waken of its own accord, the End Times themselves shall be upon all worlds. Yet it is unclear whether the apocalypse wakens the Herald of the End Times, or whether the god's wakening triggers the end of all. Legends state that if Rhan-Tegoth could be eradicated, this shared apocalypse could be forever avoided, yet a method of destroying something that fundamentally embodies immortality has baffled even the gods.",
			"",
			"Many statues of Rhan-Tegoth exist, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to discern which of these is the actual slumbering god. These statues depict a creature with a globular torso; six long, sinuous limbs tipped in crab-like pincers; and a head with three fishy eyes and a long proboscis."

When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains.

Slayings that take hours to finish are fine, but when you can keep victims alive for days or even weeks, constantly allowing them to clutch at near escapes or moments of hope only to snatch them away and ultimately  ending their lives, the murders are so much more rewarding. Shax is particularly fond of eating the eyes of his living victims, but not until he is certain they have seen the filthy tools and bloodstained devices he intends to use upon their bodies.",

Wounds have a way of bleeding profusely in Shax's presence, and Shax can command blood to blind or even choke those whose bodies it flows from, to spread out in a crimson pool to make reaching a bleeding victim difficult, or even to lash out with stinging tendrils at those nearby, which makes combat with the demon lord a grisly, gory mess. Bleeding wounds bolster Shax, making such encounters even more dangerous."

After the death of her mother, a goddess of love, Shelyn took on her area of concern. She also shared the space in Azlanti religion with her brother [Dou-Bral](faith/zon_kuthon), and the two were worshiped as one in many cases. They were inseparable for ages, and ancient depictions show the siblings creating brilliant masterpieces and singing duets that could bring even the most surly curmudgeon to tears. However, one day the two had a terrible fight and Dou-Bral departed for spaces unknown. Shelyn was utterly devastated about losing her brother and feared the worst for his fate. From that point forward, up until the end of the empire, depictions of Shelyn showed her wearing a veil and dark clothing to mourn the loss of her sibling. Art in the empire took on a more somber tone in those years. Painters produced works using dull shades, and musicians played slow introspective songs in somber keys.",

The target can resist this transformation if it wishes with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A transformed creature's type becomes construct, and it gains all traits of the construct type, including lack of a Constitution score. The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait. A transformed creature must be wound once per day with a special key (which appears as part of this transformation); as the key must be inserted into the creature's back, this requires either a successful DC 25 Dexterity or Escape Artist check or another creature's assistance. If the creature is not wound by midnight each night, it becomes immobile and helpless until wound again. A creature transformed into a clockwork doll becomes mindless, with an Intelligence score of 0. It can't use any supernatural or spell-like abilities it had prior to transforming, nor can it cast spells. It also loses all feats and skill ranks. A clockwork doll follows your commands to the letter, but otherwise it remains motionless and takes no actions on its own (unless you command it to react in certain ways, such as serving as a room guardian). This transformation can be reversed only by {spell/break enchantment}, {spell/miracle}, {spell/polymorph any object}, or {spell/wish}. If the clockwork doll is slain, the creature can be brought back to life via {spell/true resurrection}. You can only have one clockwork doll under your command at a time. If you create a second clockwork doll, the first one must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it succeeds, it reverts to its previous form with no memories of the time spent as your clockwork doll, but if it fails this save, the clockwork doll crumbles to rubble and is destroyed. If you are slain, any clockwork doll you've created automatically reverts to its previous form (no save required to avoid destruction).",

Your arms become boneless and flexible, with sucker-covered, starfish-shaped \"hands.\" While you can still manipulate objects and wield weapons with these appendages, they also grant you two tentacle primary natural attacks. Each tentacle deals damage appropriate to your size (1d6 if you are Medium). These tentacle attacks have a reach 5 feet greater than your normal reach, and you gain the grab and constrict abilities (your constrict damage is equal to the damage you deal with one of your tentacles plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier); you can grab a creature up to one size category larger than you this way.

A creature that remains trapped in Shivaska's chains too long eventually succumbs to their power and is transported, across planes if necessary, to a small cell deep inside Shivaska's clockwork lair in the Abyss.

			">2. **Blasphemer's Piety (Ex)** Your blasphemous soul adapts effortlessly to reflect the convictions of others. When you are targeted by an effect based on alignment or patron deity, you can choose to be treated as having the alignment and faith of the creature originating the effect (you don't need to know that creature's alignment or faith to make this choice). You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity. Making this choice does not require an action, or even awareness that you are being targeted (in which case the ability always functions as best benefits the character in that situation). In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities. Once per week, you can choose to perform the obedience of any lawful or good deity with which you are familiar instead of Sifkesh's obedience. This still grants you your normal benefits from Sifkesh, not those from the other faith.",
			">3. **Baptism of Sin (Su)** Your unholy magic infects the souls of mortal creatures, washing away their morality and drawing them into the Lady of Heresy's tender embrace. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting spells, that creature becomes filled with false but nevertheless convincing memories of having committed a horrific sin. A nonevil and nongood target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become {misc/staggered} for 1 round, while a good target must succeed at this Will save or become {misc/nauseated} for 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to baptism of sin for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.",

Once per day as a standard action, you can utter blasphemy or heresy against a single religion other than the worship of a demon lord. A worshiper of the targeted religion must be able to hear your utterance, or this ability fails. You gain spell resistance equal to your Hit Dice + 11 against spells cast by worshipers of the religion you spoke out against. This spell resistance lasts until you use this ability again to blaspheme a different religion or until you fail to perform your daily obedience.",
			">3. **Mass Suicide (Sp)** Your influence can drive entire groups of people to acts of self-destruction. You can cast {spell/weird} once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assaulting the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who falls prey to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness.

You can cast {spell/phantasmal killer} three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.",
			">3. **Broken Angel (Ex)** Like that of your Abyssal mistress, your body has fallen to pieces. Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts. You are immune to effects that cause severed limbs or that arise from severed limbs (including the beheading effect of a {magic-enh/vorpal} sword) and also to {rule/bleed} effects and bleed damage. You automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points.",

Many believe Sifkesh was originally a powerful {monster/erinyes} devil who became one of Hell's first heretics.

In recent years, because of the high number of {race/fetchling} worshipers in Sivanah's church, theologians have begun to claim the Seventh Veil originally hailed from the Shadow Plane.

			"",
			"Sobek appears as a muscular man with the head of a mighty crocodile, wearing a headdress with tall plumes, curling horns, and a solar disk. He is the son of {faith/Neith} and {faith/Set}, and while he occasionally supports his father, Sobek more often stands alone. He has no wife, but he lusts after the war goddess {faith/Sekhmet} and expends great effort trying to impress her with his strength and potency. Sobek sometimes accompanies {faith/Ra} on his solar barge, joining the sun god in his nightly battles against {faith/Apep}.",
			"",
			"Kings venerate Sobek as a symbol of pharaonic potency and might. He is a patron of soldiers and armies, and he is worshiped by barbarians, druids, fighters, rangers, and warriors as well. Farmers often give offerings to Sobek so that he will enrich their fields and protect their livelihood. Sobek's temples are almost always situated on riverbanks, and are rarely found more than a few miles from a river. The crocodiles living in the neighboring rivers are exalted by the priesthood and the faithful as the direct offspring of the god, or are even seen as living incarnations of Sobek himself. Most of his temples contain pools holding crocodiles sacred to Sobek, and their regular feeding is incorporated into worship. These honored reptiles are mummified and interred upon their deaths with all the respect and esteem that marks human funerals."

You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle.

Paragon to deviants and lecherous maniacs of all types, Socothbenoth views all of creation as his personal arena of pleasure. His tastes, and those of his faithful, tend to run to the violent and destructive. He is fond of changing his form on a whim to aid in whatever pleasures he currently seeks, but his true form is that of a lithe, handsome man with black eyes, long black hair, pointed ears, and numerous body piercings of metal and bone. Of all the demon lords, Socothbenoth is the least demonic in appearance, and he can pass as an incredibly attractive half-elf or elf in most societies without resorting to his mastery of changing shape. He is often seen in the company of albino serpents of all sizes, and it is said that they follow the commands he whispers without fail."

			"More entities have borne the title of Horseman of War than that of any of the other three Horsemen - as is only fitting for such a violent role. The current Horseman of War, Szuriel, the Angel of Desolation, is reported to have held the title longer than any previous Horseman, though it's unclear whether this is a matter of record or a deliberate distortion. Certainly very few can (or are willing to) say who the previous Horseman of War was, though it is widely told that Szuriel slew him at the summit of the Cinder Furnace, elevating her to her current status and granting her a reputation that discourages any rivals within her ranks.",
			"",
			"At first glance, Szuriel seems a triumphant angelic figure standing 20 feet tall. With ivory skin, flowing golden hair, a flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of immaculate silk, and the wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high - an awe-inspiring goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel's eyes bleed constantly, with rivulets of blood running down her cheeks and falling to the ground, leaving behind the twin trails of crimson. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth full of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more fitting for a shark or dragon than anything humanoid."

His beak and talons shine like platinum as well, but are actually {eq-material/cold iron}, and never catch the moonlight to betray his position. His devout say that Tanagaar's beak is sharp enough to sever the head off a {monster/babau}, and with his mighty talons he can snatch and crush two {monster/dretch/es} at a time. His presence is always preceded by a flock of owls native to the surrounding region unless he requires discretion.",
			"",
			"Tanagaar sometimes takes the form of a humanoid as well, preferring the guise of an 8-foot-tall muscular man with shoulder-length black hair and a close-trimmed gray beard. Backwoods foresters and lumberers tell tales of encountering Tanagaar in this form - the celestial being's luminous golden owl eyes always betray his otherworldly nature.",
			"",
			"Tanagaar concerns himself with watching the borders of Heaven from the depths of the Unbent Forest on the lowest slopes of the mountain. There he maintains a force of {monster/hound archon} scouts who assist him in patrolling and defending their divine realm. The Arulent Eye keeps tabs on the rest of the multiverse's borders with the help of his elite order of {monster/spyglass archon/s}, who all sport the heads of owls and can supposedly dive from a mile up to strike at an enemy on the ground in a matter of seconds."
