			"",
			"**Shears (Su)** An anhana carries a pair of gardening shears about 10 inches long. In the hands of an anhana, these shears deal damage as per a +1 short sword two sizes larger than the anhana. An anhana can use its Weapon Finesse feat with its shears. If an anhana's shears are lost or destroyed, it can make another pair with a week of work and a few scraps of metal.",
			"",
			"**Speak with Water (Sp)** Once per day, four anhanas who are working together can speak with any body of standing or flowing fresh water at least as large as an anhana. This ability functions like stone tell. Flowing water can generally speak about events happening upstream (even distantly upstream), but not events happening downstream.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Peaceful and kindly woodland creatures, anhanas tend to forest trees and befriend animals and foresters. Although an anhana has the general appearance of a young halfling woman, her unnatural eyes and erratic demeanor mark her as a fey creature. Anhanas are wise, clever, and helpful. They use their magical shears to tend to the forest, encouraging its growth and development so that nature and civilization can exist in harmony. Anhanas return kindness with generosity, but they use their otherworldly abilities to confound and delay enemies of the forest.",
			"",
			"An anhana stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Anhanas are never children; they step fully formed from mature oak or maple trees in deep forests. Although an anhana forms at her full - if small - size, she is unclothed and her skin is covered with wedges of bark matching the tree that produced her. A newly sprouted anhana has the Hit Dice and abilities presented above, but cannot speak and has only an unformed impulse to aid others and protect the natural world. The anhana's tree produces a low, celebratory thrumming for a few days after the anhana sprouts. This noise carries far, but is audible only to fey and plant creatures. Mature anhanas recognize the thrumming and seek out the new arrival to welcome her into their sisterhood. Anhanas share clothing and other gifts with their new sister and teach her music, kindness, and woodcraft. Most anhanas absorb their bark-like coverings within a few weeks, but all anhanas can temporarily extend sharp wedges of bark from their skin to deter foes.",
			"",
			"A tree that produces an anhana is usually one with a benevolent history or divine connection, such as having shaded a weary saint or growing where a nature goddess once stepped. Hamadryads hint that they have the ability to tend a tree with magic so that it sprouts an anhana, but they keep the precise process secret.",
			"",
			"All anhanas are friends of the natural world. They speak freely and softly with animals, attempting to befriend even predators. They prune flowers and trees to encourage growth rather than harm or cull the plants. Anhanas in a sisterhood can amplify their understanding of the natural world and communicate with streams and lakes.",
			"",
			"Although benevolent in their stewardship of the forest, anhanas understand that nature preys upon itself. An anhana does not mourn a fat rabbit captured by an owl or a creeping vine that kills a host tree. Similarly, an anhana does not begrudge a woodcutter his livelihood, but instructs the woodcutter how to harvest wood with the least impact on the forest.",
			"",
			"Anhanas subsist on a diet of nuts and berries. They prefer not to spend all their time gathering sustenance, so they carefully prune and tend berry bushes and nut trees to maximize their yield. Lacking any particular connection to these particular bushes and trees, however, anhanas are likely to wander to some other part of the forest and leave the nuts and berries for another to find and enjoy.",
			"",
			"Anhanas can live to be several centuries old. As their physical appearance does not change as they age, it is nearly impossible to distinguish an old anhana and from a young one. If an anhana does not die of disease or misfortune, she eventually feels a calling to return to nature. The anhana - aided by her sisters if possible - journeys to a deep stream or lake, sinks below the surface of the water, and permanently diffuses her essence into the water itself.",
			"",
			"Anhanas can sprout in any climate, but they are most common in temperate forests. In boreal forests, anhanas sometimes retain their woody skin (these anhanas have a +2 natural armor bonus, but lack the thorn body spell-like ability). Jungle anhanas are skilled climbers and often live their lives among the canopies of great trees instead of on the ground (these anhanas have a climb speed of 30 feet, but they lack the speak with water spell-like ability).",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Anhanas are uncommon, but several groups inhabit the Verduran Forest and the Duroth Wood of Iobaria. Those few anhanas that live in the Fangwood are susceptible to the Blight, and most anhanas who sprout there have the blighted fey template.",
			"",
			"Although these kindly fey originate in deep forests, they enjoy helping civilized folk who have good hearts and intentions. Anhanas often loiter near well-traveled paths or on the outskirts of settlements that abut an old forest. They spend their days tending to the forest so that it exists in harmony with people, and can be seen pruning back overgrown thornbushes, explaining directions to lost travelers, and entertaining local foresters with their cheerful songs. Though generally peaceful, they use their abilities to confound and oppose those who would destroy or irreparably harm forests.",
			"",
			"Unlike many fey, anhanas are not shy. They eagerly approach strangers on forest paths to say hello and offer assistance. Believing that it is impolite to startle others, they often announce their presence by rustling bushes or using ghost sound to simulate the sound of a tinkling bell or babbling river. Anhanas don't seem to understand that this \"courtesy\" is sometimes alarming to others.",
			"",
			"Anhanas prefer to congregate in groups of their own kind called sisterhoods. Sisterhoods sometimes occupy a single grove or glen for decades, earning a reputation as kindly forest spirits, while other sisterhoods wander throughout their forests. Sisterhoods dissolve when individual members disagree about whether or where to travel, although the members separate peaceably.",
			"",
			"Anhanas have a sixth sense for the emotions of others. They hide from angry or hateful people but are attracted to happy travelers. Anhanas are also drawn to the scared or desperate, such as lost children or starving runaways, and do their best to provide aid. At times, this aid is as simple as sharing a nourishing handful of nuts or giving clear directions back to a main road, but an anhana might also offer more direct assistance, such as confounding a wicked pursuer. Anhanas have little understanding of or regard for the laws of civilization, and they just as eagerly aid a goodhearted fugitive as they would a well-intentioned sheriff.",
			"",
			"Anhanas are fundamentally flighty and erratic, despite their goodly nature. They rarely carry through with long-term plans, no matter how sincerely agreed to, and they are prone to wandering away from an area for no reason at all, even if they have carefully tended to it for months or years.",
			"",
			"Although most anhanas enjoy being helpful, they have a strong sense of personal space and don't like being too close to people or animals. They have an irrational phobia of being touched by any creature besides other anhanas, and they almost reflexively activate their thorn body ability if physical contact seems to be imminent.",
			"",
			"An anhana can be summoned with a summon nature's ally IV spell."

			"**Aura of Courageous Inspiration (Su)** An animate aria continually emanates a rousing song to bolster its allies (typically the construct's creator and any creatures designated as allies by the construct's creator). Allies within 90 feet of the animate aria that can hear its music receive a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. As a standard action, the animate aria can increase these bonuses by 2 for 1 round.

This ability is constant and cannot be suppressed by the animate aria.",
			"",
			"**Dissonance (Ex)** As creatures of sound, animate arias are particularly vulnerable to sonic effects. A bard who succeeds at a DC 25 Perform check while using his countersong ability negates the animate aria's aura of courageous inspiration and natural invisibility abilities (making it appear as a humanoid-shaped cloud of prismatic color). In addition, an animate aria in the area of a silence spell or effect takes 2d6 points of damage each round.",
			"",
			"**Natural Invisibility (Ex)** Although an animate aria remains invisible whenever this ability is not suppressed, even when attacking, its constant song allows other creatures to pinpoint its location. Any creature within 30 feet of the animate aria that can hear automatically identifies the squares containing the animate aria. Because an animate aria's invisibility is inherent, it is not subject to the invisibility purge spell.",

Its true appearance is vague and nebulous, but it reacts to the fears and emotions of those around it, taking on a nightmarish appearance that differs for each viewer.",
			"",
			"An animate dream can find satisfaction and sustenance by passing one of its ghostly limbs through a mortal's body - the act infusing the mortal with negative energy that sates the animate dream's unnatural hunger. But by forcing a creature into a state of sleep, terror, or both, the animate dream can gain a much more satisfying meal, feeding on the emotions released in such states. It uses its spell-like abilities to this end, for each creature it harms with its nightmares, drives temporarily insane with confusion or fear, or outright slays with phantasmal killer provides the monster with more nourishment. An animate dream forced to go for a long period of time without feeding does not starve to death, but does grow increasingly feral and violent in nature.",
			"",
			"Animate dreams sometimes associate with other creatures from the Ethereal Plane or that have associations with dreams and nightmares, such as night hags, phase spiders, and xills. Sometimes these alliances are mutually beneficial, but in many cases the animate dreams are treated as slaves. Night hags in particular like enslaving animate dreams, and sometimes use their essence as a component in creating heartstones."

By disguising itself as a wig, animate hair is able to subtly influence the creature that wears it. At first, the hair merely makes its host more vain, but when the opportunity presents itself, the animate hair compels its host to murder. Though not particularly intelligent, animate hair possesses lingering instincts that cause it to urge these murders cautiously, and usually only when its host is unobserved.",

It treats these weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons. It cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. An animated tank has its weapons arranged on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun attacks and one Hotchkiss 6 pounder attack each round.

			"The brains of great military commanders and tacticians need not go to waste simply because their mortal bodies have been slain. Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks - a common war wagon on First World War battlefields - few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside - that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.",
			"",
			"### Variants",
			"",
			"Viktor Miloslav is rumored to have created variations on the normal Mark V tank during his brief explorations into self-animated war machines during World War I.",
			"",
			"\"Female\" Animated Tank (CR 11): So named because it lacked the heavier Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns of its more robust counterpart, this variant makes up for its lack of explosive firepower with a bristling barrage of machine gun fire, being able to make up to five attacks per round with its Maxim M1910 machine guns. The tanks are otherwise identical in most respects, and few find a female animated tank's lack of Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns a relief when faced with its withering machine gun attacks.",
			"",
			"The \"Moving Fortress\" (CR 13): Once word of Viktor Miloslav's inventions spread to Germany, the engineers there tried to replicate the effects he'd achieved, though it's unknown to what degree they succeeded. Should one of these specimens have survived, it would have been much more highly armored, built on the base of the German A7V tank - designed literally like a tracked, armored land ship. A moving fortress has 2 additional Hit Dice, and its natural armor bonus is increased by 5. Its single main gun, more robust than the Hotchkiss 6 pounder, deals an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the moving fortress is equipped with six Maxim M1910 machine guns.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"An animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than crafting the construct's tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank's creation requirements - beyond the body of an intact tank - an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in the chaos of war on Earth.",

Each creature within 30 feet of the daemon must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected by crushing despair for as long as it remains within the aura. Creatures that fail their save remain affected by the aura for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the radius. The anisydaemon gains Fast Healing 5 for as long as at least one creature is affected by its aura. Additionally, creatures that fail their save cannot sleep or receive any benefits of rest while under the effects of the aura. An anisydaemon can activate or deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Devour Soul (Ex)** Any creature that dies while affected by one of the anisydaemon's mind-affecting abilities - including its aura of worry - has its soul devoured by the fiend's second mouth. That creature cannot be resurrected by any effect short of miracle, wish, or direct intervention from a deity while the anisydaemon lives. Creatures whose souls have been devoured by an anisydaemon can be resurrected normally if the anisydaemon is slain.",
			"",
			"**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)** An anisydaemon can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as it's standing in an area of at least dim light or shadow, an anisydaemon can hide itself from view without actually hiding behind anything. This ability has no effect if the anisydaemon is not in an area of at least dim light or in an area of shadow of at least Medium size.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Possession (Ex)** As a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity if the target is aware of the daemon, an anisydaemon can enter the shadow of any creature to which it is currently adjacent. While within a shadow, the anisydaemon is considered to be sharing its target's space, though while the daemon is within a shadow, neither creature takes any penalties from squeezing. The anisydaemon can still affect creatures within 30 feet of itself with its aura of worry, though the daemon can target only the shadow's owner with its psychic magic or spell-like abilities. While within a shadow, an anisydaemon is considered incorporeal and takes half damage from spells and magic weapons. Ghost touch weapons affect it normally. An anisydaemon that dies while possessing a creature's shadow is immediately ejected to a random empty space adjacent to the creature. An anisydaemon can leave a shadow it is possessing as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If it does so, it is ejected into a free space of its choice adjacent to the creature whose shadow it was possessing. When an anisydaemon is possessing a creature's shadow, that creature cannot benefit from morale bonuses of any kind. An anisydaemon can use its Stealth skill to hide while within a shadow.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Weakness (Ex)** An anisydaemon exposed to natural sunlight is unable to use any of its psychic magic or spell-like abilities and cannot project its aura of worry.

			"",
			"Anisydaemons average around 14 feet tall and weigh about 1 ton. Occasionally, some anisydaemons reach truly monstrous sizes after coaxing countless victims to their deaths. These fiends often grow additional mouths on other parts of their bodies, such as their hands or torsos, which magnify the power of their psychic whispers. Despite their bulk, those attempting to escape an anisydaemon discover the fiends can squeeze into impossibly small spaces in pursuit.",
			"",
			"Anisydaemons are most often found in slave cities in Abaddon, stalking the mortal populace and keeping their minds too worn down to foster hope and too distracted by the problems their own minds produce to consider rebellion. However, they sometimes take sabbaticals on the Material Plane to find fresh souls to torment and devour.",
			"",
			"The fiends have smooth, hairless, almost rubbery black skin. They're bipedal, with arms and legs that end in claws as sharp as a surgeon's blade. But by far, their most disturbing feature is their eyeless faces adorned with two wide maws. From the top maw comes a constant susurrus of whispers that seems to access any listeners' deepest worries and insecurities, while the bottom mouth waits to snatch the souls of the creature's victims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"While they originate in Abaddon and are most often found there, anisydaemons can be found in any location with large amounts of people. They typically do their work alone, and they see others of their kind or of a comparable strength more as rivals for the same resources than as allies. Anisydaemons have been known to work in groups of up to seven of their own kind, but only when commanded to do so by a summoner or a daemon even more powerful than the group of them together.",
			"",
			"Anisydaemons can be found working in the interests of any of the Horsemen. For the Horseman of War, they often help drive up levels of anxiety and paranoia between different groups, eventually culminating in each group believing that their best hope for survival is to eliminate the others. For the Horseman of Famine, anisydaemons often target the wealthy in times of scarcity and press upon their worries of starvation, leading them to hoard what little food is available and allowing countless poor to starve. The Horseman of Pestilence uses these daemons during outbreaks of sickness to convince the healthy their only hope of survival is to eliminate the sick, as such violence often ends up helping sickness spread anyway. Under the Horseman of Death, these fiends whisper of the horrible fates that await mortals after death and watch as the subsequent worry leads mortals to commit heinous acts to lengthen their life spans, ironically leading their souls closer to Abaddon in the process."

			"Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts - such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations. (A desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.)",
			"",
			"In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite. Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground. A creature carried underground can still breathe with difficulty (the ankheg needs to breathe as well, so its tunnels are relatively porous), but is often eaten alive before its allies can rescue it.",
			"",
			"Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like - they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] &times; 10). Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too many burrow at once.",
			"",
			"Although ankhegs resemble immense vermin, they are in fact much more intelligent than the typical arachnid and, given time and a talented trainer, can even be trained to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. The fact that even \"domesticated\" ankhegs are prone to squirting acid when frightened or startled makes them unsafe at best in most heavily populated regions, but for more savage races like hobgoblins, troglodytes, and particularly orcs, ankhegs make popular guardians or even pets."

While these arms provide no locomotive aid - their scissorlike edges are too delicate to support any weight - these additional appendages allow ankhravs to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied by ankheg drones.",

While they and their spawn wreak havoc on any attempts to build settlements in their territory, their sturdy carapaces and valuable organs can be worth a fortune if sold to the right alchemist or collector. There are always a few scouts and trappers willing to risk the dangers of hunting ankhravs.",
			"",
			"Every winter, ankhravs retreat into their hives to give birth to the next generation of ankhegs. During this time, each ankhrav is tended to by ankheg drones as its flared abdomen produces an incubating egg sac nearly the size of its body. Sustaining this sac uses much of the stores claimed by the ankhrav's hunting season, and without ankheg servants most ankhravs would starve to death, drained by the process of birthing the next generation of drones. If an ankhrav has a large hive with scores of drones and plentiful food, it may give birth to one or two young ankhravs, which leave their birthplace to establish their own hives at 2 years of age.",

Any creature that interacts with a shadow double can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the duplicate (DC 10 + 1/2 the ankou's Hit Dice + the ankou's Charisma modifier, typically DC 24). Against a creature that recognizes a shadow double for what it is, the double functions as a shadow conjuration. Shadow doubles take double damage from spells with the light descriptor.

Over the course of a month, the ant lion undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis - when it emerges, its body has become elongated and thin and it has gained a set of enormous, lacy wings. Depending on the region, giant adult ant lions are often called giant lacewings, giant damselflies, or giant spindleflies, but regardless of their regional name, they remain ravenous and deadly, replacing the sand trap cunning of their larval form with swift flight and greater battlefield mobility."

Occasionally, however, an ooze in the presence of a powerful psychic spellcaster becomes infused with some measure of both sentience and personhood, and yearns to join the company of civilized beings. When a spellcaster completes a particularly stressful ritual or powerful mental feat in close proximity to the right mixture of primordial slimes that make up a nascent ooze, a piece of the spellcaster's mind breaks off and infuses the ooze, creating a being called an apallie.",
			"",
			"A newly formed apallie is typically convinced that it is a member of its creator's race. Its greatest desire is to join the society of its progenitor, and it alters its form to insinuate itself into humanoid settlements. Such impostors are easily discovered, however, as an apallie's true nature reasserts itself as soon as the sun begins to rise. An ooze discovered in this way often finds itself run out of town, forced to try its luck in the next settlement, though some particularly stubborn apallies simply assume a new form and return the next night under a different guise.",
			"",
			"Apallies are nocturnal creatures, for any contact with the rays of the sun forces them to return to their true, amorphous forms. Even when its form is forcibly reverted, an apallie insists it is truly a member of its creator's race, and that it has somehow been subjected to a terrible curse. Despite the ooze's relatively high intelligence, this unreasonable attachment to its self-image persists even in extreme circumstances. If the apallie's creator was a different size from the apallie, the apallie still tries to imitate that creator, attempting to pass as a small elf, human, or member of another race to which its progenitor belonged, and refuses to acknowledge the size difference.",
			"",
			"Apallies are more common in large cities that provide sewers and other enclosed venues to hide in during the day and a healthy nightlife scene in which they can pose as humanoids when it's dark. Some apallies find acceptance, and even success, in such environments, though the small oozes never stop trying to prove themselves to be humanoids, and any relationships in which they engage (whether platonic or romantic) nearly always end in a predictable disaster.",
			"",
			"In its true form, an apallie weighs about 40 pounds and stands about 3 feet tall."

An aphorite can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, but the rounds do not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The primary inhabitants of the perfect city of Axis are the race known as axiomites, outsiders born of lawful neutral souls whose primary focus is to serve Axis in one of three ways: the construction and tending of inevitables, the expansion and maintenance of the city itself, and exploring and calculating the laws and constants that underpin all reality in hopes of using this knowledge to bring order to the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"But the axiomites are ill-suited to interactions with mortals. As creatures of pure order, they find it difficult to deal with creatures who have the free will to choose their own destinies and to interpret (or even willfully ignore) laws. Ancient axiomites long pondered a solution to problematic encounters with visitors from the Material Plane. The answer they arrived at was the creation of a new form of life - a melding of their own perfection of order with the unpredictable and fragile bodies and minds of mortal humanoids.",
			"",
			"Thus, the first aphorites came to be. Although these women and men were always welcome in Axis, the perfect city was not their true home. Infused with a spark of mortality and the influence of the Material Plane, aphorites were created to serve as diplomats, translators, and envoys between the axiomites and the myriad cultures of the countless Material Plane worlds. As native outsiders, aphorites have free will of their own, and they live and die just as other mortals do. Though akin in many ways to other native outsiders such as aasimars, ganzis, and tieflings, the aphorites differ in that they are not the results of unions between outsiders and mortals. While the original population was forged in Axis by the axiomites, new aphorites are born to aphorite parents. In cases where an aphorite and a humanoid have a child, the offspring is either a newborn aphorite or a member of the humanoid parent's race. Originally, the aphorites were created with nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified as a result of generations spent on the Material Plane. Today, an aphorite always appears humanoid in form with golden skin that flickers and periodically coruscates with sparkling crystalline dust, and eyes and hair that tend toward metallic hues (with copper, gold, and silver being common colors). Beyond this, they can appear similar to dwarves, elves, and humans, or any other Medium humanoid race. The heritage of the immutable order of Axis has long prevented the formation of aphorites of other sizes, but exceptions have occurred with increasing frequency as each new generation of aphorites is born on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Aphorites do not exist in large numbers on most Material Plane worlds, and Golarion is no exception. The first aphorites to arrive on Golarion did not seek to establish their own race as a distinct cultural element, but instead to assimilate into established societies to help guide the formation of laws and bolster potential interactions with the citizens of Axis. But as the aphorite race spread, something that the axiomites should have anticipated occurred: as native outsiders with the ability to choose their own destinies, many aphorites became intrigued by the societies they were living in. There are some limits to this acceptance of new societies; aphorites who embrace chaos are considered outcasts and troublemakers by their kin, despite the fact that these aphorites are natural expressions of mortals' defining characteristics.",
			"",
			"Smart and strong, aphorites are as likely to become the focus of attention and admiration as they are the victims of jealousy and hatred. Their ordered and structured personalities often cause strained relations with more capricious or mischievous neighbors and can be a source of conflict with cultures who highly value individual expression of thought, such as that of the elves. Races with stronger tendencies toward law typically build stronger bonds with aphorites. Dwarves in particular enjoy the company of aphorites and find the birth of an aphorite among their own kind a welcome event, as aphorites have an intuitive understanding of the crafting so integral to dwarven society.",
			"",
			"While not all aphorites are inherently lawful, most relish structure and order in their lives. Ideas of morality, however, are less clear cut to aphorites. While most can appreciate scholarly studies of the philosophy of good and evil and recognize the differences between them, this divide does not influence them to the same extent that the structure of law versus the disorganized madness of chaos does. Consequently, most aphorites are lawful neutral. Typically, aphorites drawn to theology choose lawful gods as patrons, with the worship of Abadar in particular resonating with their inherent desires and goals of building a perfect society. When an aphorite embraces chaos, other aphorites often treat their wayward kin with a mix of curiosity, horror, and pity. Chaotic aphorites themselves tend to be loners and have little interest in the traditions of their own kind, instead seeking out other societies to join.",
			"",
			"Most aphorites, no matter the culture they are raised in, eventually experience a longing to see the world beyond the boundaries of their birthplace. Be it by choice or chance, aphorites seem predisposed to the life of an adventurer. Always seeking to better understand not only the world, but themselves as well, aphorites excel when they are placed in situations where their intellects might shine. Being both cunning of mind and naturally strong, aphorites gravitate toward classes which blend the arts of spellcasting and combat, such as magus or warpriest.",
			"",
			"Aphorite names typically reflect the society they are raised in, so an aphorite raised among humans would have a name befitting a human child, while an aphorite raised by dwarves would have a name drawn from dwarven heritage."

			"**Razmiri Aversion (Ex)** The Razmiri conditioning received in life is difficult for an apostasy wraith to overcome. If confronted by a Razmiri priest or anyone successfully disguised in that garb, the apostasy wraith must make a Will save. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Hit Dice + the Charisma modifier of the highest-level Razmiri priest present. The apostasy wraith needs to make this saving throw only once per encounter, regardless of the number of Razmiri priests present. If the saving throw fails, the apostasy wraith is forced to flee as if affected by the Turn Undead feat.

These souls disavow the legitimacy of all gods, and return to the Material Plane to sow their vengeance.",
			"",
			"An apostasy wraith exists in a state of constant conflict, torn between its burning shame at falling for such duplicity in life and its scorn and hatred toward believers for whom faith proved to be genuine. Their primary motivation is to wreak vengeance upon the false priesthood of Razmir, but that faith's mental conditioning is so effective as to make it difficult for an apostasy wraith to even approach its quarry. If able to overcome its aversion, its wrath is terrible. Otherwise, an apostasy wraith gladly vents its rage upon followers of other gods in an effort to make them see - even if only for a moment - the despair of finding one's faith misplaced."

			"Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and heal the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.",
			"",
			"A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms are sparkling heralds of comfort and succor. Each mote archon within a swarm is a tiny, virtually mindless creature as light as dandelion fluff. A mote archon has the form of a spherical rune with sharp edges. No two mote archons seem to have the same shape, but because the tiny creatures glow brightly, their exact form is difficult to discern. Their glow is a white light the strength of a candle flame; unlike lantern archons, mote archons cannot change the strength or color of their glow.",
			"",
			"Mote archons naturally gravitate to the nearest of their kind, floating erratically over or around obstacles as they move toward each other. When clustered in swarms of a few hundred individuals, they develop a hive mind and a distinct personality. This personality is as mutable as the swarm itself; a mote archon swarm that loses a few dozen members might become grim or despondent, while a swarm that gains more members becomes cheerful. As mote archon swarms speak little, these differences in temperament often manifest through the lethargy or agitation of individual lights within the swarm. Regardless of their current personalities, mote archon swarms remain driven to help the sick or injured and cannot stand idle in the face of suffering.",
			"",
			"Although they are creatures of healing, mote archon swarms are easily angered. The surest method to anger a mote archon swarm is to threaten harm to any creatures it deems under its care. A mote archon swarm is also enraged by acts of senseless butchery or wanton violence. When roused to anger, a mote archon swarm descends upon its enemies with righteous fervor. As each mote archon has sharp edges, a darting swarm of the creatures can shred skin; however, the swarm has sufficient control over its component motes for it to flay enemies but leave allies unharmed. When infuriated, the individual components of the swarm oscillate rapidly until their rage ignites them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms are rarely found outside of Heaven, where they tend to injured angels and archons in the wide pavilions that celestials use as hospitals. Celestial armies commission mote archon swarms as field medics, and the glittering swarms accompany the Heavenly forces in their wars against the legions of evil. In these great clashes, mote archon swarms dart about the battlefield, attacking foes while healing allies. A mote archon swarm's desire to heal sometimes overcomes its better judgment, however, and it might staunch an enemy's mortal wound or target a desperately injured enemy along with its allies when it uses its mass cure light wounds ability. Mote archon swarms see this not as an error, but as a measure of grace that lowers the aggregate amount of suffering in the universe.",
			"",
			"Mote archons are generated as a celestial byproduct during the ascension of an archon into a more powerful form. An archon who has served Heaven as a warrior or crusader produces few or no motes, whereas a diplomat or peacemaker might produce as many as a dozen, and an archon dedicated to easing suffering and healing the sick might engender dozens of motes each time it ascends to a higher form. The motes thus produced are mindless, inclined to do no more than seek out others of their kind and avoid causing harm. (A mote caught between these two directives - such as a mote cupped in clasped hands that could escape only by slicing free with its sharp edges - simply oscillates in place until a resolution presents itself.) Only when motes gather in large numbers does a personality appear, but this is independent of the personalities of the archons who shed the component motes.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms tend to act more spontaneously than other archons. When creatures under their care have recovered sufficiently, mote archon swarms abandon the immediate area, giving in to wanderlust. Mote archon swarms encountered outside of Heaven have usually slipped through a portal or gateway in such meanderings. Although these itinerant swarms find healing work to occupy their time, they eventually pine for the familiar fields of Heaven.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms enjoy the company of other celestials dedicated to healing. They particularly admire brijidines and sometimes follow these fiery azatas with exuberant devotion. Eventually, a mote archon swarm's adoration gives way to irritation over an azata's flighty recklessness, however, so the swarm returns to the more serious business of tending to the sick or wounded."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Though bastion archons are among Heaven's most powerful defenders, their formation results from the intertwining of lesser archons, starting with the least of them all, lantern archons. Rarely, when a group of at least nine lantern archons is turned back by an overwhelming invading force of fiends, the group can use their gestalt ability to form a whirling globe that stands its ground.",
			"",
			"This brave act of defiance usually lasts only half a minute, buying the lantern archons' allies time to escape before the gestalt is overcome. In such dire situations, a nearby shield archon - a combatant of Heaven more suited to serving as a bulwark against tides of evil - can transpose itself with the squad of lantern archons, using teleportation to take their place. But this interaction of abilities has unpredictable outcomes, and rarely, rather than swapping places, the two entities meld in a brilliant flash of light that sends nearby evil outsiders reeling, leaving a crater with a nascent bastion archon lodged in its center. The bastion archon is initially stuck in the ground where it formed, but it retains many of its component creatures' defensive and offensive abilities. If it survives, it eventually pulls together a huge, four-armed body from the surrounding terrain until it is clad in the stone of the Holy Mountain itself, in the process becoming infused with power greater than that of any other archon. A fully formed bastion archon stands 30 feet tall and weighs 15 tons.",
			"",
			"Even after a bastion archon has freed itself from its creation crater, it rarely moves far, preferring to defend the place that was once so nearly overcome by invading forces. Indeed, convincing a bastion archon to abandon its self-selected post is so futile that \"trying to budge a bastion\" is a common phrase in Heaven for attempting the impossible. However, there have been a few rare instances when a particularly large crusade into Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell has prompted a bastion archon to serve as a forward base for the forces of Heaven, helping establish a formidable foothold that requires a truly terrible counteroffensive to uproot.",
			"",
			"In battle, a bastion archon is akin to the eye of the storm, standing firm and unmoved by the chaotic melee around it as its allies clash with invading fiends. It provides shelter to Heaven's servants, slamming enemies into dust or holding them aloft just long enough to rend them to shreds with its magnificent beam of holy light. Given the choice between pursuing a retreating evil army or tending to the wounded, a bastion archon almost always prefers the latter, following its indelible instincts to protect and heal.",
			"",
			"The one threat most likely to stir a bastion archon from its typically rigid methodology is a balor, the fiery winged demons that sometimes serve as generals during demonic invasions. Given the opportunity, a bastion archon wades through a vast army of demons in a single-minded effort to get to the strategic head and cut it off, leading to a confrontation that often ends explosively - either when the archon falls or the balor erupts into massive fireball during its death throes.",
			"",
			"Bastion archons hold in reserve an explosive last resort in the event they are felled in battle: an explosion of light that destroys the archon, heals its allies, and consecrates the ground around it. This final sacrifice gives its (likely overwhelmed) allies a last-ditch chance at victory, and the site of a bastion archon's death is often thereafter considered a sacred place of remembrance.",
			"",
			"A particularly unusual bastion archon by the name of Anvil Fist serves in the deepest caverns of the Forgeheart in Heaven, patrolling without end to keep invaders from the Abyss at bay. Anvil Fist is one of the longest-serving of its kind, and it has recently begun to act strangely, wandering into empty tunnels and staying there for days, speaking only in vague aphorisms when questioned. Some worry that Anvil Fist's millennia-long battle against chaotic abominations has begun to destabilize the archon, while others believe its uncharacteristic behaviors are the result of a qlippoth lord's vile machinations. Still others theorize that Anvil Fist may be nearing an apotheosis to something greater, perhaps becoming the first incarnation of an archon of power akin to the mightiest balor lords, infernal dukes, or veranallia azata elders.",

Although a codex archon's expertise allows it to more easily slay creatures of the type it studies, it usually prefers to avoid violence and uses its knowledge to coax more information out of creatures it meets. A spellcaster who calls or summons a codex archon can generally conjure one with whatever specialization she seeks unless the foe or topic is one that is little known to the forces of Heaven or an unorthodox combination (GM's discretion). Though they prefer their heavenly homes to the chaotic Material Plane, summoned codex archons may deign to serve for a time as assistants or even instructors in mortal libraries, academies, and temples.",

A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw. A hammer archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds.

			"",
			"**Immovable Object (Su)** When not in the archon's possession, a hammer archon's lucerne hammer can be picked up or moved by only another hammer archon or a lawful outsider of at least the same CR as the hammer archon.

			"**Reverberation (Ex)** A hammer archon's body is harmonically attuned to provide it with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally, whenever a character strikes a hammer archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality.",

Many hound archons and shield archons with martial inclinations ceaselessly endeavor to rise to the heights of power that being a hammer archon represents.",

Those who show they can lead squadrons of other archons to victory against overwhelming odds or can make tactically sound decisions under pressure take the first steps to a legendary transformation.

			"Hammer archons spend the majority of their time on the fields of battle, whether assaulting an outpost of Hell or clashing with legions of daemons over a nexus of power on the Material Plane. Unless injured by a particularly potent foe, these archons require only brief respites before charging back into the fray. When not fighting, hammer archons struggle to not betray their impatience to re-enter conflict. They pass their idle hours polishing their armor and maintaining their lucerne hammers. As such, the areas of Heaven where these celestials reside are often filled with the rhythmic sound of hammers ringing against steel.",
			"",
			"A hammer archon without his hammer is a diminished version of himself, so each archon fervently guards his weapon, sometimes forming such a deep bond with it that it gains a modicum of sentience. Though not fully intelligent, these weapons respond to their owners' moods with noticeable alterations of the symbols on their heads and hafts. No matter what, a hammer archon who is divested of his weapon in the heat of battle ignores all other threats until he can retrieve it. This sometimes forces the archon to make poor strategic choices, a fact that savvy foes take advantage of when fighting one of these celestials.",
			"",
			"Hammer archons often have only cursory relationships with other hammer archons. They are usually sent on solo assignments or asked to lead armies of other celestials, so they rarely have opportunities to interact with one another. When they do, they speak only of past conquests in cool but cordial tones. A hammer archon knows that others of his kind are unflinching followers of law, so he never questions the others' actions or decisions. When required to act as a team, hammer archons understand that the situation must be dire indeed. They discuss strategy with the same professional attitude, and often reach a consensus very quickly.",
			"",
			"Though hammer archons and shield archons vary greatly in rank and strength, they sometimes form close ties. The hammer archons see themselves as mentors to the other celestials, offering advice and providing opportunities for the shield archons to gain the power they need to ascend. More often than not, these relationships prove to be quite dangerous for the shield archons, as the hammer archons drag them into battles that are well beyond their capabilities. However, those few shield archons who survive these ordeals gain enough experience to take class levels and eventually transform into more powerful archons.",
			"",
			"Many hammer archons share a particular hatred for mariliths. These demons can possess a martial prowess equal to that of hammer archons, and are usually at the command of fiendish armies. A marilith's many bladed weapons can bypass a hammer archon's damage reduction and immunities, so hammer archons seek to sunder them before they can cause too much damage. A battle between a hammer archon and a marilith is an awe-inspiring sight to behold, as the two titans struggle to gain advantage over each other."

Hound archons loathe killing mortals and prefer to disarm or incapacitate even evil individuals when they can. Against fiends and the irredeemably corrupt, though, they show no mercy.",
			"",

Under the guise of unassuming but friendly strays, such secret defenders might follow their ward or guard their post subtly for years.",
			"",
			"In Heaven's armies, exceptional hound archon paladins lead their fellows into combat, taking on roles as captains and knights. They lead incursions against fiendish holdings, whether that entails strikes against daemonic fortresses or liberating the captives of night hag soul collectors. Such missions make hound archons perhaps the most likely celestials one might encounter upon the Lower Planes, and packs of swift-moving wolves occasionally reveal themselves to be welcome saviors to those lost within such realms. Regardless of their orders, hound archons universally exhibit a particular hatred of canine fiends, abandoning all mercy and going out of their way to put an end to the evils of barghests, glabrezus, yeth hounds, and similar depraved outsiders.",

The archons can remain in this form for 2d4 rounds.

			"Friendly and curious beings, lantern archons eagerly converse with and assist other creatures. Their bodies, however, are merely globes of spiritual purity and pale light, and though they might interact with their surroundings through pure force of will, such interaction proves too weak to help with most physical tasks. Their evasive natures make them exceptional at scouting - at least in areas where strange lights aren't unusual - relaying messages, and overwhelming enemies with surprise and group tactics. Although they appear fragile, their forms guard them against all but the most profane attacks.",
			"",
			"A lantern archon always glows, usually as bright as a torch. They have total control over the color of light they shed, and take great pleasure in modulating their colors and brightness in time to music or to entertain other creatures. Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil.",
			"",
			"Small but fast and zealous, lantern archons make excellent support troops in celestial armies, swarming over weak opponents or teleporting en masse to flanking positions to cut off reinforcements or escape routes. These miniature archons work well together and know that there is great strength in numbers, uniting in times of need and desperation to form gestalts with greater control over their surroundings. Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.",

They prefer to use their bows in battle, though they are comfortable charging antlers-first into melee as well. Each was created from the spirit of a mortal hero of Erastil's faith, hand-picked by the god to aid his followers in the world and defend some of the Outer Sphere's least tamed wildernesses. Though none remember the specifics of their mortal lives, they retain the skills of trained woodland warriors. Most are more practical than hound archons, willing to kill evil mortals if doing so is necessary to protect the innocent.",

			"Stag archons are experienced trackers and scouts. Occasionally Erastil sends one to look after a specific village or farmstead, particularly in a dangerous frontier area. They watch in animal form, luring lost children to safety and leading hungry hunters to easily-caught prey. They have a deep-seated hatred of cold riders and other evil fey, and they gather in great numbers to pursue and take down those defilers of the wilderness.",

The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per {spell/greater dispel magic} (CL 13th). An Ardoc moilant cannot use this ability if it is grappling a creature with its vise-pincers.",

Attacks that the moilant makes with its vise-pincers ignore the hardness of objects with a hardness of 15 or less. When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target's armor or shield (Ardoc moilant's choice).",

Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.",
			"",
			"Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.",

			"",
			"Every component of an Ardoc moilant's form is designed for labor, from its low, squat shape with wide feet to prevent destruction of valuable terrain, to its rune-engraved pincers that can both bore through stone and lift delicate cargo. Although not built with combat as a primary function, Ardoc moilants can be used in battle with no additional modification. They are sometimes employed as secondary enforcers or guards to watch over valuable mines, factories, or palaces under construction. An Ardoc moilant's impressive size is often sufficient to dissuade any potential threats, but persistent trespassers soon find that a moilant's gripping pincers and shovel-shaped head are formidable weapons. Although every component of an Ardoc moilant is created by or enhanced with magic, its magical nature is most apparent in its rune-carved pincers, which can create powerful magical shock waves.",
			"",
			"Ardoc moilants are particularly clever, able to evaluate outcomes and approach assigned tasks with a keen understanding of engineering principles. One of the many secrets the Ardocs keep about the construction process is that this sophisticated programming relies on patterning from a human soul. Though this patterning is vital to the moilants' utility and popularity, the patterning ritual is exceptionally painful and sometimes fatal to the human source.",
			"",

			"",
			"As constructs built by the Ardocs' arcane masters, moilants have no society in the traditional sense - at least according to the Ardoc family. Customers have noted, however, that Ardoc moilants seem to exhibit patterns of behavior that hint at a deeper level of consciousness and an inner drive for companionship. Unless presented with constant activity, the labor-constructs tend to gather in small groups, or even with other machines or constructs. Most Ardoc moilants are created with the ability to speak a language selected by the buyer. They speak only rarely, and their deep, gravelly voices sound like metal scraping on metal. All moilants acquire distinctive personalities and notable quirks over time, such as collecting certain types of small items or pushing rubble into shapes that mimic the runes on their pincers. Diligent owners might demand a readjustment or refund from the Ardoc family when their moilants start to demonstrate too much individual initiative, but some moilants leave their masters and strike out on their own before this readjustment can occur.",

Any creature in the cloud must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated as long as it remains in the cloud. Any creature that fails to save against this nausea is also exposed to the ascomoid's poison (see above). The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Oversized fungi, ascomoids are frequently mistaken for giant puffballs until they begin to move, rolling toward any living prey that they sense. Once they have crushed the life out of a creature, they quickly move on, leaving spores behind in their victim's body to grow new ascomoids. Ascomoids can grow to a width of 10 feet, but they rarely weigh more than 400 pounds.",

			"",
			"Although they are typically solitary creatures, ascomoids dwelling in areas of ample moisture with generous sources of food - or frequent unwitting passersby - sometimes form deadly clusters. Such colonies of these giant fungi often lurk in large caverns among other pallid vegetation. Given ascomoids' ability to detect vibrations, the slightest quake or potential footfall sets them rolling, turning their cavernous lairs into churning meat grinders. Bounding about violently, groups of ascomoids sometimes take hours to settle back down, unable to distinguish between the movements of prey and the tumbling of their own kind. In some cases, ascomoids have been known to lair at the top of steep rises, crushing climbers as they roll in terrible fungal avalanches.",
			"",
			"Those crushed by an ascomoid or who fall victim to an ascomoid's spores face a revolting end, their bodies becoming hosts to quick-growing colonies of rampant fungi. Immature ascomoid mold sprouts quickly, typically appearing within 24 hours. After 48 hours, such victims become so overgrown with this furry, brown-green mold that they can no longer be restored to life by {spell/raise dead}, as their bodies are too vitally pervaded and thoroughly consumed by the swiftly spreading mold. Within a month, a new ascomoid emerges from the foul mess.",

In cases where a forgemaster is not abandoned, or when its task can actually be completed, it might retain its sense of self. These forgemasters are fiercely driven to accomplish whatever is necessary for their release, even making deals with their hated efreet enemies. Multiple salamanders bound to nearby forges often form close bonds with each other.",

As long as the forge burns, the forgemaster is rejuvenated after it is destroyed. The ritual that originally binds the salamander also directly connects the forge to the Plane of Fire, so extraordinary measures are necessary to extinguish it. Powerful water- or cold-based abilities, such as the breath weapon of an ancient or older {family/silver dragon} or the drench ability of an {monster/elder water elemental}, can suppress or sever this connection long enough to douse the forge's flames. The forge then becomes mundane and can be dismantled to prevent the forgemaster from rejuvenating."

An ashullian's senses permeate its bower, allowing it to perceive the entire area with its blindsight and to touch, taste, smell, and hear everything within it. An ashullian always has line of effect to any area of its bower, and can cause any of its spell-like or supernatural abilities to originate from any point within its bower instead of from its own space.

The humanoids vanished, and their ashullian prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors.

			"An ashullian's eyeless, eellike head has a small, lipless mouth full of unsettling humanlike teeth. Its elongated cranium sits above a supple neck and four sharp-tipped tentacles. Its torso splits into two thick tails as long as the rest of its body. An ashullian's transparent, leathery skin reveals a body cavity with swirling iridescent ribbons of fluid in place of organs. Ciliated clefts and soft, flexible spines - the ashullian's sensory apparatuses - run along its back and arms.",

			"Although their ancestors lived in the Plane of Water, the ashullians beneath Kaer Maga are now native outsiders. Their artistic abilities are stunted, degenerate versions of those of their progenitors, who may still swim within enormous sensory galleries in the Elemental Plane of Water. Ashullians on Golarion can realize their grand visions only within their bowers, exercising incredible control in pursuit of their inscrutable artistry. Within a bower, the diverse contents' own sensory elements - such as the coarse texture of rusted mail, the sour taste of reagents, and the stink of decaying flesh - are combined with whorls of scent, sounds, and other minor manifestations injected by the ashullian. An ashullian can create and move objects within its bower by thought alone, and can even suspend basic physical laws there; if an ashullian chooses, an object remains eternally suspended in the water in defiance of gravity, or remains dry despite being submerged. An ashullian revels in the synesthetic glory of its bower, but other creatures find the multisensory experience overwhelming.",
			"",
			"The ancient magic that brought ashullians to the Drowned Levels keeps most of them trapped there. A few, though, have escaped their prison via purloined magic, while others have simply vanished without a trace. Ashullians whisper that these paragons transcended their existence through ultimate artistic mastery and seek to follow these mythical examples.",
			"",
			"Ashullians are spawned singly and mature on their own. Ashullians grow slowly and can reach 300 years old. The bodies of deceased ashullians are almost always incorporated into the bowers of younger ashullians as an artistic statement about aging or the transience of life.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"When not tending to their individual bowers, ashullians search the Drowned Levels for inspiration and clues to a means of escape. Ashullians are not the only occupants of these dismal, sodden halls; water elementals and other aquatic creatures swim through the ashullians' domain. Ashullians are generally content to let familiar creatures pass, although they have an intense fixation on visitors from the surface. These visitors are first pestered for trinkets and curios, but eventually restrained and stripped layer by layer so the ashullian can experience their full sensory measure. Occasionally, visitors escape an ashullian's attention by presenting a novel artistic display and fleeing while the creature is occupied. Ashullians are rarely welcome within another ashullian's bower, as each considers its own artistic experiments to be superior to those of its kin and is unabashedly critical of others."

			"",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots. These remarkable plants can see minute movements in the earth and air and detect changes in light and heat through their broad leaves, giving them exceptional awareness of the area around them. Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target's size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant's roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries.",
			"",
			"An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant's ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby.",
			"",
			"Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine's seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape. Tales often tell of assassin vines appearing in flower beds or infiltrating greenhouses, murderous surprises planted by rivals and enemies or arbitrary doom dropped by unsuspecting wing."

			"Few asurendras were born to their might - they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works.",
			"",

Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their \"enlightened\" hatred.",
			"",
			"**Death:** All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living.",
			"",
			"**Sacrilege:** Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use {spell/miracle} as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design.",
			"",
			"**Shaping:** Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper's vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper's hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability.",
			"",
			"**Create Asura (Su):** As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a {monster/tripurasura} that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura - beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.",

			"Ages ago, a short-sighted god sought to punish his flock for a perceived slight, infusing a champion with a fragment of his power and sending it to wreak havoc. The champion did as commanded, tearing apart the faithful and showering their city with blood. The deity heard the tearful cries of the mortals, pleading for mercy and insisting that any kindly god would never visit such hatred upon his people. The god felt an upwelling of shame for having engineered such violence, but rather than accept responsibility or undo the damage, the god appeared before the city and forsook the divine champion, insisting that it was a raving beast sent by some less caring patron than himself. Empowered by their lying god's words and magic, the people praised him, rallied, and killed the champion. From this act of betrayal - and the remains of the slaughtered champion - rose the first hishandura.",

This reflection of the original hishandura's divine mandate drives these asuras to slaughter living creatures, destroy beautiful works, and listen for the piteous cries for mercy from the fearful and faithful alike. Hishanduras can see effortlessly through the smoke of burning buildings, locate the cowering weak and wounded, and extract hateful revelations from the bloody precipitation flung by their blades.

			"A hishandura's camaraderie is especially strong with the divine engines of destruction known as {family/behemoth/s}. Behemoths and hishanduras rarely attack one another. Instead, hishanduras delight in finding signs of dormant behemoths, waking them, and reveling in the resulting destruction. The longer the beast has slumbered, the more suggestible it seems to be to the asuras' insistence that the behemoth has been forgotten or betrayed, as though being abandoned by the gods for so long makes the behemoths bitter.",
			"",
			"Unlike other asuras, hishanduras rarely remain in the same place for long. They become restless when lingering in a site they have demolished or despoiled and are quick to move on and seek out a new target. This is only partially due to impatience, as hishanduras also dislike having to face holy champions seeking retaliation for their despoliation. It isn't the threat of defeat that irritates the hishanduras, but rather the possibility that some paladin might appear to vindicate her blind obedience to her god by killing the fiend.",
			"",
			"Hishanduras distrust any beings placed above others, and distance themselves from asura ranas, whom they see as hypocrites. Hishanduras who honor asura ranas do so because they see truths in their violent teachings, not because they consider the ranas as lords to be slavishly obeyed. These hishanduras favor violent and vindictive patrons such as {faith/Chugarra}, the Guru of Butchers; {faith/Chupurvagasti}, Lady of Poison Mist; and {faith/Zurapadyn}, the Beast Who Waits in Smoke."

			"Thinking her divine realm so glorious that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful oracle to identify her enemies. The oracle told her that she had no reason to fear invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.",
			"",
			"A japalisura is 7 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"Despite having a single mind to control many limbs, japalisuras are exceptionally dexterous and capable of performing numerous tasks simultaneously. They easily operate two bows at once, smoothly alternating between reloading and firing. Japalisuras never want for ammunition, plucking arrows from the air as if drawing them from some invisible quiver. It's unclear from where exactly these arrows originate, although every japalisura's ammunition shares the same fletching and design. One theory is that these asuras are drawing replicas of the arrows carried by the slain demigods, though effects that inhibit summoning don't impede their ability to draw forth these arrows in any way.",
			"",
			"Japalisuras have a knack for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, hatefully manipulating their prophecies as though they were independent or even in defiance of conventional soothsaying. Where magic fails, they are adept at reading humanoid emotions, making up attractive lies and pandering to biases to confirm their clients' worst fears and prejudices.",
			"",

			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Like most asuras, japalisuras favor temples and churches as their lairs. The more a location is associated with prophecy, the better. As a result, japalisuras often settle in and around druids' groves, oracular caves, cyclops lairs, and the like, especially if those locations continue to attract the occasional pilgrim seeking answers. This makes abandoned sacred sites of Magdh, Pharasma, and Sivanah especially attractive. Japalisuras take a special delight in identifying perilous romantic relationships, posing as servants of Naderi and stealthily presenting at least one of the lovers with predictions of future difficulties to encourage self-destructive behavior.",
			"",
			"Japalisuras know that their fearsome miens tend to distress visitors, yet the asuras lack any supernatural means of disguising themselves. Instead, many japalisuras favor hiding out of sight and dealing with visitors from behind screens or within darkened alcoves. In these circumstances, the asura rarely emerges unless doing so would convince a reticent visitor to cooperate or if necessary to destroy someone who poses a threat to the asura's ongoing operations. Rarely, a japalisura operates openly, relying on either its reputation or its monstrous allure to attract disciples. Such is the case for Holkomion of Iblydos, who claims to have rediscovered the sacred art of mythspeaking. At least one warrior claims to have attained mythic power as a result of Holkomion's guidance, yet most find that the japalisura's prophecies in fact direct petitioners to assassinate hero-gods.",
			"",
			"More often, a japalisura maintains a small cult to communicate its oracular guidance. A japalisura accepts only the most devout followers into such coteries. With such humanoid puppets, the asura can dispense divinations telepathically without having to show itself. These cults take myriad forms but typically operate outside of large population centers to avoid too much scrutiny. The japalisura Zalmiac poses as the Varisian harrower Madame Vhelanosz, virtually never leaving the wagon from which she interprets her cards. Her pernicious prophecies have incited scores of murders - especially against Desnans and Pharasmins, whom she goads into killing each other - and her loyal cohort of ex-Sczarni assistants ensure nobody asks too many of the wrong questions.",

			"Tripurasuras, or sly ones, are among the weakest asuras, manifestations not of divine mistakes but instead creations of the most powerful of asuras exhibiting their loathing of the gods by creating blasphemous mockeries of their creations. A newly created tripurasura most commonly exists for one of two reasons: to give an asurendra sage the raw materials it needs to create more powerful asuras, or to seek out mortals - especially mortal spellcasters - to recruit into the asura cause.",
			"",
			"Using its power to assume a pleasing or innocuous form, a tripurasura wanders the world, seeking pious mortals to corrupt. When it encounters a promising spellcaster (typically one who has some sort of link to a church or religion, but not necessarily a divine spellcaster), the tripurasura presents itself as an apprentice, pilgrim, or other type of curious student eager to learn from the spellcaster. The tripurasura keeps its true nature and its powers hidden, and seeks opportunities to steer its \"master\" away from decisions it might have made in good conscience to acts that promote the collapse of religious belief, faith, and society. When, as it inevitably does, the wayward spellcaster runs afoul of justice or is confronted by those seeking revenge, the tripurasura fades away to watch the final stage of the spellcaster's fall from grace, then seeks a new victim in another city or region.",
			"",
			"Some spellcasters, on the other hand, actually seek out these tiny fiends to employ as familiars. A tripurasura greatly values these opportunities, since it need not abandon its master once its work is done and can continue to spread its agenda for as long as its master survives. A spellcaster must be lawful evil, at least 7th level, and have the Improved Familiar feat to gain a tripurasura as a familiar.",

They are fearsome when roused to battle, though they prefer insinuating themselves into opponents' minds over direct, physical confrontation.",

The unwitting divine servant was the first victim, and wracked with madness, he claimed the treasure for himself and fled.
