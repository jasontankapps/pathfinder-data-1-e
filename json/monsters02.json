			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.",
			"",
			"Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand.",
			"",
			"Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.",
			"",
			"In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.",
			"",
			"Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities - never without the deity's approval - or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).",
			"",
			"Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.",
			"",
			"Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child - while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.",
			"",
			"All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Peaceful and kindly woodland creatures, anhanas tend to forest trees and befriend animals and foresters. Although an anhana has the general appearance of a young halfling woman, her unnatural eyes and erratic demeanor mark her as a fey creature. Anhanas are wise, clever, and helpful. They use their magical shears to tend to the forest, encouraging its growth and development so that nature and civilization can exist in harmony. Anhanas return kindness with generosity, but they use their otherworldly abilities to confound and delay enemies of the forest.",
			"",
			"An anhana stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Anhanas are never children; they step fully formed from mature oak or maple trees in deep forests. Although an anhana forms at her full - if small - size, she is unclothed and her skin is covered with wedges of bark matching the tree that produced her. A newly sprouted anhana has the Hit Dice and abilities presented above, but cannot speak and has only an unformed impulse to aid others and protect the natural world. The anhana's tree produces a low, celebratory thrumming for a few days after the anhana sprouts. This noise carries far, but is audible only to fey and plant creatures. Mature anhanas recognize the thrumming and seek out the new arrival to welcome her into their sisterhood. Anhanas share clothing and other gifts with their new sister and teach her music, kindness, and woodcraft. Most anhanas absorb their bark-like coverings within a few weeks, but all anhanas can temporarily extend sharp wedges of bark from their skin to deter foes.",
			"",
			"A tree that produces an anhana is usually one with a benevolent history or divine connection, such as having shaded a weary saint or growing where a nature goddess once stepped. Hamadryads hint that they have the ability to tend a tree with magic so that it sprouts an anhana, but they keep the precise process secret.",
			"",
			"All anhanas are friends of the natural world. They speak freely and softly with animals, attempting to befriend even predators. They prune flowers and trees to encourage growth rather than harm or cull the plants. Anhanas in a sisterhood can amplify their understanding of the natural world and communicate with streams and lakes.",
			"",
			"Although benevolent in their stewardship of the forest, anhanas understand that nature preys upon itself. An anhana does not mourn a fat rabbit captured by an owl or a creeping vine that kills a host tree. Similarly, an anhana does not begrudge a woodcutter his livelihood, but instructs the woodcutter how to harvest wood with the least impact on the forest.",
			"",
			"Anhanas subsist on a diet of nuts and berries. They prefer not to spend all their time gathering sustenance, so they carefully prune and tend berry bushes and nut trees to maximize their yield. Lacking any particular connection to these particular bushes and trees, however, anhanas are likely to wander to some other part of the forest and leave the nuts and berries for another to find and enjoy.",
			"",
			"Anhanas can live to be several centuries old. As their physical appearance does not change as they age, it is nearly impossible to distinguish an old anhana and from a young one. If an anhana does not die of disease or misfortune, she eventually feels a calling to return to nature. The anhana - aided by her sisters if possible - journeys to a deep stream or lake, sinks below the surface of the water, and permanently diffuses her essence into the water itself.",
			"",
			"Anhanas can sprout in any climate, but they are most common in temperate forests. In boreal forests, anhanas sometimes retain their woody skin (these anhanas have a +2 natural armor bonus, but lack the thorn body spell-like ability). Jungle anhanas are skilled climbers and often live their lives among the canopies of great trees instead of on the ground (these anhanas have a climb speed of 30 feet, but they lack the speak with water spell-like ability).",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Anhanas are uncommon, but several groups inhabit the Verduran Forest and the Duroth Wood of Iobaria. Those few anhanas that live in the Fangwood are susceptible to the Blight, and most anhanas who sprout there have the blighted fey template.",
			"",
			"Although these kindly fey originate in deep forests, they enjoy helping civilized folk who have good hearts and intentions. Anhanas often loiter near well-traveled paths or on the outskirts of settlements that abut an old forest. They spend their days tending to the forest so that it exists in harmony with people, and can be seen pruning back overgrown thornbushes, explaining directions to lost travelers, and entertaining local foresters with their cheerful songs. Though generally peaceful, they use their abilities to confound and oppose those who would destroy or irreparably harm forests.",
			"",
			"Unlike many fey, anhanas are not shy. They eagerly approach strangers on forest paths to say hello and offer assistance. Believing that it is impolite to startle others, they often announce their presence by rustling bushes or using ghost sound to simulate the sound of a tinkling bell or babbling river. Anhanas don't seem to understand that this \"courtesy\" is sometimes alarming to others.",
			"",
			"Anhanas prefer to congregate in groups of their own kind called sisterhoods. Sisterhoods sometimes occupy a single grove or glen for decades, earning a reputation as kindly forest spirits, while other sisterhoods wander throughout their forests. Sisterhoods dissolve when individual members disagree about whether or where to travel, although the members separate peaceably.",
			"",
			"Anhanas have a sixth sense for the emotions of others. They hide from angry or hateful people but are attracted to happy travelers. Anhanas are also drawn to the scared or desperate, such as lost children or starving runaways, and do their best to provide aid. At times, this aid is as simple as sharing a nourishing handful of nuts or giving clear directions back to a main road, but an anhana might also offer more direct assistance, such as confounding a wicked pursuer. Anhanas have little understanding of or regard for the laws of civilization, and they just as eagerly aid a goodhearted fugitive as they would a well-intentioned sheriff.",
			"",
			"Anhanas are fundamentally flighty and erratic, despite their goodly nature. They rarely carry through with long-term plans, no matter how sincerely agreed to, and they are prone to wandering away from an area for no reason at all, even if they have carefully tended to it for months or years.",
			"",
			"Although most anhanas enjoy being helpful, they have a strong sense of personal space and don't like being too close to people or animals. They have an irrational phobia of being touched by any creature besides other anhanas, and they almost reflexively activate their thorn body ability if physical contact seems to be imminent.",
			"",
			"An anhana can be summoned with a summon nature's ally IV spell."

Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks - a common war wagon on First World War battlefields - few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside - that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers.",
			"",
			"Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever.",

			"",
			"\"Female\" Animated Tank (CR 11): So named because it lacked the heavier Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns of its more robust counterpart, this variant makes up for its lack of explosive firepower with a bristling barrage of machine gun fire, being able to make up to five attacks per round with its Maxim M1910 machine guns. The tanks are otherwise identical in most respects, and few find a female animated tank's lack of Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns a relief when faced with its withering machine gun attacks.",
			"",
			"The \"Moving Fortress\" (CR 13): Once word of Viktor Miloslav's inventions spread to Germany, the engineers there tried to replicate the effects he'd achieved, though it's unknown to what degree they succeeded. Should one of these specimens have survived, it would have been much more highly armored, built on the base of the German A7V tank - designed literally like a tracked, armored land ship. A moving fortress has 2 additional Hit Dice, and its natural armor bonus is increased by 5. Its single main gun, more robust than the Hotchkiss 6 pounder, deals an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the moving fortress is equipped with six Maxim M1910 machine guns.",
			"",

			"An animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than crafting the construct's tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank's creation requirements - beyond the body of an intact tank - an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in the chaos of war on Earth.",

			"**Aura of Worry (Su)** Anisydaemons project a 30-foot aura of anxiety and insecurity. Each creature within 30 feet of the daemon must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected by crushing despair for as long as it remains within the aura. Creatures that fail their save remain affected by the aura for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the radius. The anisydaemon gains Fast Healing 5 for as long as at least one creature is affected by its aura. Additionally, creatures that fail their save cannot sleep or receive any benefits of rest while under the effects of the aura. An anisydaemon can activate or deactivate this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Devour Soul (Ex)** Any creature that dies while affected by one of the anisydaemon's mind-affecting abilities - including its aura of worry - has its soul devoured by the fiend's second mouth. That creature cannot be resurrected by any effect short of miracle, wish, or direct intervention from a deity while the anisydaemon lives. Creatures whose souls have been devoured by an anisydaemon can be resurrected normally if the anisydaemon is slain.",
			"",
			"**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)** An anisydaemon can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as it's standing in an area of at least dim light or shadow, an anisydaemon can hide itself from view without actually hiding behind anything. This ability has no effect if the anisydaemon is not in an area of at least dim light or in an area of shadow of at least Medium size.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Possession (Ex)** As a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity if the target is aware of the daemon, an anisydaemon can enter the shadow of any creature to which it is currently adjacent. While within a shadow, the anisydaemon is considered to be sharing its target's space, though while the daemon is within a shadow, neither creature takes any penalties from squeezing. The anisydaemon can still affect creatures within 30 feet of itself with its aura of worry, though the daemon can target only the shadow's owner with its psychic magic or spell-like abilities. While within a shadow, an anisydaemon is considered incorporeal and takes half damage from spells and magic weapons. Ghost touch weapons affect it normally. An anisydaemon that dies while possessing a creature's shadow is immediately ejected to a random empty space adjacent to the creature. An anisydaemon can leave a shadow it is possessing as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If it does so, it is ejected into a free space of its choice adjacent to the creature whose shadow it was possessing. When an anisydaemon is possessing a creature's shadow, that creature cannot benefit from morale bonuses of any kind. An anisydaemon can use its Stealth skill to hide while within a shadow.",

			"",
			"Anisydaemons average around 14 feet tall and weigh about 1 ton. Occasionally, some anisydaemons reach truly monstrous sizes after coaxing countless victims to their deaths. These fiends often grow additional mouths on other parts of their bodies, such as their hands or torsos, which magnify the power of their psychic whispers. Despite their bulk, those attempting to escape an anisydaemon discover the fiends can squeeze into impossibly small spaces in pursuit.",
			"",
			"Anisydaemons are most often found in slave cities in Abaddon, stalking the mortal populace and keeping their minds too worn down to foster hope and too distracted by the problems their own minds produce to consider rebellion. However, they sometimes take sabbaticals on the Material Plane to find fresh souls to torment and devour.",
			"",
			"The fiends have smooth, hairless, almost rubbery black skin. They're bipedal, with arms and legs that end in claws as sharp as a surgeon's blade. But by far, their most disturbing feature is their eyeless faces adorned with two wide maws. From the top maw comes a constant susurrus of whispers that seems to access any listeners' deepest worries and insecurities, while the bottom mouth waits to snatch the souls of the creature's victims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"While they originate in Abaddon and are most often found there, anisydaemons can be found in any location with large amounts of people. They typically do their work alone, and they see others of their kind or of a comparable strength more as rivals for the same resources than as allies. Anisydaemons have been known to work in groups of up to seven of their own kind, but only when commanded to do so by a summoner or a daemon even more powerful than the group of them together.",
			"",
			"Anisydaemons can be found working in the interests of any of the Horsemen. For the Horseman of War, they often help drive up levels of anxiety and paranoia between different groups, eventually culminating in each group believing that their best hope for survival is to eliminate the others. For the Horseman of Famine, anisydaemons often target the wealthy in times of scarcity and press upon their worries of starvation, leading them to hoard what little food is available and allowing countless poor to starve. The Horseman of Pestilence uses these daemons during outbreaks of sickness to convince the healthy their only hope of survival is to eliminate the sick, as such violence often ends up helping sickness spread anyway. Under the Horseman of Death, these fiends whisper of the horrible fates that await mortals after death and watch as the subsequent worry leads mortals to commit heinous acts to lengthen their life spans, ironically leading their souls closer to Abaddon in the process."

			"Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts - such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations. (A desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.)",
			"",
			"In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite. Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground. A creature carried underground can still breathe with difficulty (the ankheg needs to breathe as well, so its tunnels are relatively porous), but is often eaten alive before its allies can rescue it.",
			"",
			"Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like - they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] &times; 10). Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too many burrow at once.",
			"",
			"Although ankhegs resemble immense vermin, they are in fact much more intelligent than the typical arachnid and, given time and a talented trainer, can even be trained to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. The fact that even \"domesticated\" ankhegs are prone to squirting acid when frightened or startled makes them unsafe at best in most heavily populated regions, but for more savage races like hobgoblins, troglodytes, and particularly orcs, ankhegs make popular guardians or even pets."

While these arms provide no locomotive aid - their scissorlike edges are too delicate to support any weight - these additional appendages allow ankhravs to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied by ankheg drones.",

			"Though a significant danger to locals, ankhravs are also a highly valued resource for local tribes and the humans of Trunau. While they and their spawn wreak havoc on any attempts to build settlements in their territory, their sturdy carapaces and valuable organs can be worth a fortune if sold to the right alchemist or collector. There are always a few scouts and trappers willing to risk the dangers of hunting ankhravs.",
			"",
			"Every winter, ankhravs retreat into their hives to give birth to the next generation of ankhegs. During this time, each ankhrav is tended to by ankheg drones as its flared abdomen produces an incubating egg sac nearly the size of its body. Sustaining this sac uses much of the stores claimed by the ankhrav's hunting season, and without ankheg servants most ankhravs would starve to death, drained by the process of birthing the next generation of drones. If an ankhrav has a large hive with scores of drones and plentiful food, it may give birth to one or two young ankhravs, which leave their birthplace to establish their own hives at 2 years of age.",

Despite the ooze's relatively high intelligence, this unreasonable attachment to its self-image persists even in extreme circumstances. If the apallie's creator was a different size from the apallie, the apallie still tries to imitate that creator, attempting to pass as a small elf, human, or member of another race to which its progenitor belonged, and refuses to acknowledge the size difference.",

Once a megaprimatus resorts to violence, it shows no mercy, and its enemy must either escape or die.",
			"",
			"A megaprimatus's diet consists of plants - especially large bunches of fruits or melons - and meat. Larger dinosaurs and megafauna are favored prey for the beast, and the megaprimatus enjoys the fight just as much as the meal.",
			"",
			"Creatures that clearly don't pose any danger to a megaprimatus, such as smaller dinosaurs or even humanoids, can usually coexist in its domain. A population of herd dinosaurs or a humanoid settlement can thrive in its territory as the megaprimatus chases off giant predators. People living in this sort of situation might collect large quantities of fruit and deliver it to the ape to prevent it from getting so hungry it goes on a rampage and inadvertently crashes through their homes.",
			"",
			"Its tendency to overlook smaller creatures can lead to a megaprimatus's downfall, because it is woefully underprepared to deal with the ingenuity of humanoids, whose implements of war are powerful enough to bring down a creature even as mighty as a megaprimatus."

The effect cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the aphorite is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. An aphorite can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, but the rounds do not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The primary inhabitants of the perfect city of Axis are the race known as axiomites, outsiders born of lawful neutral souls whose primary focus is to serve Axis in one of three ways: the construction and tending of inevitables, the expansion and maintenance of the city itself, and exploring and calculating the laws and constants that underpin all reality in hopes of using this knowledge to bring order to the Great Beyond.",
			"",
			"But the axiomites are ill-suited to interactions with mortals. As creatures of pure order, they find it difficult to deal with creatures who have the free will to choose their own destinies and to interpret (or even willfully ignore) laws. Ancient axiomites long pondered a solution to problematic encounters with visitors from the Material Plane. The answer they arrived at was the creation of a new form of life - a melding of their own perfection of order with the unpredictable and fragile bodies and minds of mortal humanoids.",
			"",
			"Thus, the first aphorites came to be. Although these women and men were always welcome in Axis, the perfect city was not their true home. Infused with a spark of mortality and the influence of the Material Plane, aphorites were created to serve as diplomats, translators, and envoys between the axiomites and the myriad cultures of the countless Material Plane worlds. As native outsiders, aphorites have free will of their own, and they live and die just as other mortals do. Though akin in many ways to other native outsiders such as aasimars, ganzis, and tieflings, the aphorites differ in that they are not the results of unions between outsiders and mortals. While the original population was forged in Axis by the axiomites, new aphorites are born to aphorite parents. In cases where an aphorite and a humanoid have a child, the offspring is either a newborn aphorite or a member of the humanoid parent's race. Originally, the aphorites were created with nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified as a result of generations spent on the Material Plane. Today, an aphorite always appears humanoid in form with golden skin that flickers and periodically coruscates with sparkling crystalline dust, and eyes and hair that tend toward metallic hues (with copper, gold, and silver being common colors). Beyond this, they can appear similar to dwarves, elves, and humans, or any other Medium humanoid race. The heritage of the immutable order of Axis has long prevented the formation of aphorites of other sizes, but exceptions have occurred with increasing frequency as each new generation of aphorites is born on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Aphorites do not exist in large numbers on most Material Plane worlds, and Golarion is no exception. The first aphorites to arrive on Golarion did not seek to establish their own race as a distinct cultural element, but instead to assimilate into established societies to help guide the formation of laws and bolster potential interactions with the citizens of Axis. But as the aphorite race spread, something that the axiomites should have anticipated occurred: as native outsiders with the ability to choose their own destinies, many aphorites became intrigued by the societies they were living in. There are some limits to this acceptance of new societies; aphorites who embrace chaos are considered outcasts and troublemakers by their kin, despite the fact that these aphorites are natural expressions of mortals' defining characteristics.",
			"",
			"Smart and strong, aphorites are as likely to become the focus of attention and admiration as they are the victims of jealousy and hatred. Their ordered and structured personalities often cause strained relations with more capricious or mischievous neighbors and can be a source of conflict with cultures who highly value individual expression of thought, such as that of the elves. Races with stronger tendencies toward law typically build stronger bonds with aphorites. Dwarves in particular enjoy the company of aphorites and find the birth of an aphorite among their own kind a welcome event, as aphorites have an intuitive understanding of the crafting so integral to dwarven society.",
			"",
			"While not all aphorites are inherently lawful, most relish structure and order in their lives. Ideas of morality, however, are less clear cut to aphorites. While most can appreciate scholarly studies of the philosophy of good and evil and recognize the differences between them, this divide does not influence them to the same extent that the structure of law versus the disorganized madness of chaos does. Consequently, most aphorites are lawful neutral. Typically, aphorites drawn to theology choose lawful gods as patrons, with the worship of Abadar in particular resonating with their inherent desires and goals of building a perfect society. When an aphorite embraces chaos, other aphorites often treat their wayward kin with a mix of curiosity, horror, and pity. Chaotic aphorites themselves tend to be loners and have little interest in the traditions of their own kind, instead seeking out other societies to join.",
			"",
			"Most aphorites, no matter the culture they are raised in, eventually experience a longing to see the world beyond the boundaries of their birthplace. Be it by choice or chance, aphorites seem predisposed to the life of an adventurer. Always seeking to better understand not only the world, but themselves as well, aphorites excel when they are placed in situations where their intellects might shine. Being both cunning of mind and naturally strong, aphorites gravitate toward classes which blend the arts of spellcasting and combat, such as magus or warpriest.",
			"",
			"Aphorite names typically reflect the society they are raised in, so an aphorite raised among humans would have a name befitting a human child, while an aphorite raised by dwarves would have a name drawn from dwarven heritage."

			"**Superlative Healer (Su)** A mote archon swarm can use the Heal skill to provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison as a swift action; to treat a disease as a move action; and to treat a deadly wound as a full-round action. Creatures to be treated must share the mote archon swarm's space, but the mote archon swarm can treat any number of creatures within its space with the same action. A mote archon swarm does not require a healer's kit to treat deadly wounds.",
			"",
			"**Vibrating Combustion (Ex)** As a swift action, a mote archon swarm can vibrate rapidly for 1 round, heating the air and dealing 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 26 half) in addition to swarm damage at the end of its turn. Creatures that begin their turns in the swarm's area risk {rule/catching on fire}. A creature that succeeds at its save against this ability is immune to catching on fire at the start of its next turn. A burning creature can't attempt to extinguish itself as long as it is in the mote archon swarm's space. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mote archons are tiny, floating runes less than an inch across. Individually, they are benign and nearly mindless creatures, but mote archons are virtually never found alone, congregating naturally in groups of hundreds or thousands of their kind. Together, these swarms of mote archons have a unified personality and an overwhelming drive to comfort the sick and heal the injured. They are most often found on the battlefields of Heaven tending to injured angels and other archons, and never hesitating to defend creatures under their care. Angry mote archons oscillate rapidly until they ignite and swarm over enemies with fiery retribution.",
			"",
			"A mote archon swarm has no appreciable weight.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms are sparkling heralds of comfort and succor. Each mote archon within a swarm is a tiny, virtually mindless creature as light as dandelion fluff. A mote archon has the form of a spherical rune with sharp edges. No two mote archons seem to have the same shape, but because the tiny creatures glow brightly, their exact form is difficult to discern. Their glow is a white light the strength of a candle flame; unlike lantern archons, mote archons cannot change the strength or color of their glow.",
			"",
			"Mote archons naturally gravitate to the nearest of their kind, floating erratically over or around obstacles as they move toward each other. When clustered in swarms of a few hundred individuals, they develop a hive mind and a distinct personality. This personality is as mutable as the swarm itself; a mote archon swarm that loses a few dozen members might become grim or despondent, while a swarm that gains more members becomes cheerful. As mote archon swarms speak little, these differences in temperament often manifest through the lethargy or agitation of individual lights within the swarm. Regardless of their current personalities, mote archon swarms remain driven to help the sick or injured and cannot stand idle in the face of suffering.",
			"",
			"Although they are creatures of healing, mote archon swarms are easily angered. The surest method to anger a mote archon swarm is to threaten harm to any creatures it deems under its care. A mote archon swarm is also enraged by acts of senseless butchery or wanton violence. When roused to anger, a mote archon swarm descends upon its enemies with righteous fervor. As each mote archon has sharp edges, a darting swarm of the creatures can shred skin; however, the swarm has sufficient control over its component motes for it to flay enemies but leave allies unharmed. When infuriated, the individual components of the swarm oscillate rapidly until their rage ignites them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms are rarely found outside of Heaven, where they tend to injured angels and archons in the wide pavilions that celestials use as hospitals. Celestial armies commission mote archon swarms as field medics, and the glittering swarms accompany the Heavenly forces in their wars against the legions of evil. In these great clashes, mote archon swarms dart about the battlefield, attacking foes while healing allies. A mote archon swarm's desire to heal sometimes overcomes its better judgment, however, and it might staunch an enemy's mortal wound or target a desperately injured enemy along with its allies when it uses its mass cure light wounds ability. Mote archon swarms see this not as an error, but as a measure of grace that lowers the aggregate amount of suffering in the universe.",
			"",
			"Mote archons are generated as a celestial byproduct during the ascension of an archon into a more powerful form. An archon who has served Heaven as a warrior or crusader produces few or no motes, whereas a diplomat or peacemaker might produce as many as a dozen, and an archon dedicated to easing suffering and healing the sick might engender dozens of motes each time it ascends to a higher form. The motes thus produced are mindless, inclined to do no more than seek out others of their kind and avoid causing harm. (A mote caught between these two directives - such as a mote cupped in clasped hands that could escape only by slicing free with its sharp edges - simply oscillates in place until a resolution presents itself.) Only when motes gather in large numbers does a personality appear, but this is independent of the personalities of the archons who shed the component motes.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms tend to act more spontaneously than other archons. When creatures under their care have recovered sufficiently, mote archon swarms abandon the immediate area, giving in to wanderlust. Mote archon swarms encountered outside of Heaven have usually slipped through a portal or gateway in such meanderings. Although these itinerant swarms find healing work to occupy their time, they eventually pine for the familiar fields of Heaven.",
			"",
			"Mote archon swarms enjoy the company of other celestials dedicated to healing. They particularly admire brijidines and sometimes follow these fiery azatas with exuberant devotion. Eventually, a mote archon swarm's adoration gives way to irritation over an azata's flighty recklessness, however, so the swarm returns to the more serious business of tending to the sick or wounded."

			"",
			"**Holy Beam (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a bastion archon can unleash a concentrated beam of holy energy from the shining beacon that is its face.

Evil creatures in the area of effect also take 20d6 points of damage from the holy beam - this damage comes from sacred energies and cannot be reduced by energy resistance, but a creature that succeeds at its Reflex save negates the blindness and takes only half damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Rending Beam (Su)** A bastion archon that hits a single creature with two of its slam attacks can blast the target with a swift pulse of holy light that blinds the target for 1 round and deals 5d6 points of damage if the target is an evil creature. A target can attempt a DC 25 Reflex save to negate the blindness and take half damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"**Ultimate Sacrifice (Su)** When a bastion archon is slain by an evil creature, it erupts in a 40-foot-radius burst of positive energy that restores 100 hit points to good-aligned creatures and consecrates the ground in the area. The area is treated as the subject of a hallow spell (CL 20th) with an associated bless spell effect for 1 year thereafter.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Though bastion archons are among Heaven's most powerful defenders, their formation results from the intertwining of lesser archons, starting with the least of them all, lantern archons. Rarely, when a group of at least nine lantern archons is turned back by an overwhelming invading force of fiends, the group can use their gestalt ability to form a whirling globe that stands its ground.",
			"",
			"This brave act of defiance usually lasts only half a minute, buying the lantern archons' allies time to escape before the gestalt is overcome. In such dire situations, a nearby shield archon - a combatant of Heaven more suited to serving as a bulwark against tides of evil - can transpose itself with the squad of lantern archons, using teleportation to take their place. But this interaction of abilities has unpredictable outcomes, and rarely, rather than swapping places, the two entities meld in a brilliant flash of light that sends nearby evil outsiders reeling, leaving a crater with a nascent bastion archon lodged in its center. The bastion archon is initially stuck in the ground where it formed, but it retains many of its component creatures' defensive and offensive abilities. If it survives, it eventually pulls together a huge, four-armed body from the surrounding terrain until it is clad in the stone of the Holy Mountain itself, in the process becoming infused with power greater than that of any other archon. A fully formed bastion archon stands 30 feet tall and weighs 15 tons.",
			"",
			"Even after a bastion archon has freed itself from its creation crater, it rarely moves far, preferring to defend the place that was once so nearly overcome by invading forces. Indeed, convincing a bastion archon to abandon its self-selected post is so futile that \"trying to budge a bastion\" is a common phrase in Heaven for attempting the impossible. However, there have been a few rare instances when a particularly large crusade into Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell has prompted a bastion archon to serve as a forward base for the forces of Heaven, helping establish a formidable foothold that requires a truly terrible counteroffensive to uproot.",
			"",
			"In battle, a bastion archon is akin to the eye of the storm, standing firm and unmoved by the chaotic melee around it as its allies clash with invading fiends. It provides shelter to Heaven's servants, slamming enemies into dust or holding them aloft just long enough to rend them to shreds with its magnificent beam of holy light. Given the choice between pursuing a retreating evil army or tending to the wounded, a bastion archon almost always prefers the latter, following its indelible instincts to protect and heal.",
			"",
			"The one threat most likely to stir a bastion archon from its typically rigid methodology is a balor, the fiery winged demons that sometimes serve as generals during demonic invasions. Given the opportunity, a bastion archon wades through a vast army of demons in a single-minded effort to get to the strategic head and cut it off, leading to a confrontation that often ends explosively - either when the archon falls or the balor erupts into massive fireball during its death throes.",
			"",
			"Bastion archons hold in reserve an explosive last resort in the event they are felled in battle: an explosion of light that destroys the archon, heals its allies, and consecrates the ground around it. This final sacrifice gives its (likely overwhelmed) allies a last-ditch chance at victory, and the site of a bastion archon's death is often thereafter considered a sacred place of remembrance.",
			"",
			"A particularly unusual bastion archon by the name of Anvil Fist serves in the deepest caverns of the Forgeheart in Heaven, patrolling without end to keep invaders from the Abyss at bay. Anvil Fist is one of the longest-serving of its kind, and it has recently begun to act strangely, wandering into empty tunnels and staying there for days, speaking only in vague aphorisms when questioned. Some worry that Anvil Fist's millennia-long battle against chaotic abominations has begun to destabilize the archon, while others believe its uncharacteristic behaviors are the result of a qlippoth lord's vile machinations. Still others theorize that Anvil Fist may be nearing an apotheosis to something greater, perhaps becoming the first incarnation of an archon of power akin to the mightiest balor lords, infernal dukes, or veranallia azata elders.",

			"**Axiomatic Barrage (Su)** As a standard action, a hammer archon can slam the head of his hammer against the ground, creating an ordered pulse of energy in a 30-foot-radius burst. Only chaotic and neutral (nonlawful) creatures are harmed by this energy, which deals 10d6 points of damage to chaotic creatures (or 10d8 points of damage to outsiders with the chaotic subtype) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (as per slow). A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw. A hammer archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Immovable Object (Su)** When not in the archon's possession, a hammer archon's lucerne hammer can be picked up or moved by only another hammer archon or a lawful outsider of at least the same CR as the hammer archon. A hammer archon's lucerne hammer has double the hardness and 50% more hit points than a normal lucerne hammer. This quality persists for 24 hours after the hammer archon's death.",
			"",
			"**Inevitable Sunder (Ex)** When a hammer archon attempts a sunder combat maneuver against an item held or wielded by a chaotic- or evil-aligned creature (or a creature with the chaotic or evil subtype), the hammer archon ignores the target item's hardness.",
			"",
			"**Reverberation (Ex)** A hammer archon's body is harmonically attuned to provide it with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally, whenever a character strikes a hammer archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hammer archons are the unstoppable champions of celestial armies, called to fight against paragons of evil and chaos when all hope seems otherwise lost. Their powerful hammers sweep through lesser enemies and shatter shields and weapons with ease. Each hammer archon's plate armor gleams like polished silver and resists even the strongest blows from hammers and other bludgeoning weapons.",
			"",
			"A hammer archon stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"Those archons who continually proves themselves in battle, either by striking down hordes of demons or by holding back a single pit fiend long enough for reinforcements to arrive, may get promoted to the rank of hammer archon. This process can take centuries, even millennia, but the lawful-aligned outsiders would brook no shortcuts. Many hound archons and shield archons with martial inclinations ceaselessly endeavor to rise to the heights of power that being a hammer archon represents.",
			"",
			"The most ambitious hammer archons strive to prove themselves worthy of becoming star archons, often taking on positions of authority in important conflicts. Those who show they can lead squadrons of other archons to victory against overwhelming odds or can make tactically sound decisions under pressure take the first steps to a legendary transformation. Other hammer archons are content to remain as they are, with the knowledge that an army with too many generals and not enough soldiers is no kind of fighting force at all.",

			"Hammer archons spend the majority of their time on the fields of battle, whether assaulting an outpost of Hell or clashing with legions of daemons over a nexus of power on the Material Plane. Unless injured by a particularly potent foe, these archons require only brief respites before charging back into the fray. When not fighting, hammer archons struggle to not betray their impatience to re-enter conflict. They pass their idle hours polishing their armor and maintaining their lucerne hammers. As such, the areas of Heaven where these celestials reside are often filled with the rhythmic sound of hammers ringing against steel.",
			"",
			"A hammer archon without his hammer is a diminished version of himself, so each archon fervently guards his weapon, sometimes forming such a deep bond with it that it gains a modicum of sentience. Though not fully intelligent, these weapons respond to their owners' moods with noticeable alterations of the symbols on their heads and hafts. No matter what, a hammer archon who is divested of his weapon in the heat of battle ignores all other threats until he can retrieve it. This sometimes forces the archon to make poor strategic choices, a fact that savvy foes take advantage of when fighting one of these celestials.",
			"",
			"Hammer archons often have only cursory relationships with other hammer archons. They are usually sent on solo assignments or asked to lead armies of other celestials, so they rarely have opportunities to interact with one another. When they do, they speak only of past conquests in cool but cordial tones. A hammer archon knows that others of his kind are unflinching followers of law, so he never questions the others' actions or decisions. When required to act as a team, hammer archons understand that the situation must be dire indeed. They discuss strategy with the same professional attitude, and often reach a consensus very quickly.",
			"",
			"Though hammer archons and shield archons vary greatly in rank and strength, they sometimes form close ties. The hammer archons see themselves as mentors to the other celestials, offering advice and providing opportunities for the shield archons to gain the power they need to ascend. More often than not, these relationships prove to be quite dangerous for the shield archons, as the hammer archons drag them into battles that are well beyond their capabilities. However, those few shield archons who survive these ordeals gain enough experience to take class levels and eventually transform into more powerful archons.",
			"",
			"Many hammer archons share a particular hatred for mariliths. These demons can possess a martial prowess equal to that of hammer archons, and are usually at the command of fiendish armies. A marilith's many bladed weapons can bypass a hammer archon's damage reduction and immunities, so hammer archons seek to sunder them before they can cause too much damage. A battle between a hammer archon and a marilith is an awe-inspiring sight to behold, as the two titans struggle to gain advantage over each other."

Most lantern archons speak in airy, echoing voices, with tones that range from somber whispers to hurried chirping. Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light. As lantern archons never sleep or eat, they make excellent watchers and guardians. Lantern archons light many settlements in the celestial realms in lieu of mundane or magical illumination, serving as disguised sentinels always watchful for approaching evil.",

Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status.",

			"**Resounding Burst (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can snap its vise-pincers closed with enough force to produce a shock wave of sound and disruptive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per {spell/greater dispel magic} (CL 13th).

Attacks that the moilant makes with its vise-pincers ignore the hardness of objects with a hardness of 15 or less. When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target's armor or shield (Ardoc moilant's choice).",

Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.",
			"",
			"Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.",

			"",
			"Every component of an Ardoc moilant's form is designed for labor, from its low, squat shape with wide feet to prevent destruction of valuable terrain, to its rune-engraved pincers that can both bore through stone and lift delicate cargo. Although not built with combat as a primary function, Ardoc moilants can be used in battle with no additional modification. They are sometimes employed as secondary enforcers or guards to watch over valuable mines, factories, or palaces under construction. An Ardoc moilant's impressive size is often sufficient to dissuade any potential threats, but persistent trespassers soon find that a moilant's gripping pincers and shovel-shaped head are formidable weapons. Although every component of an Ardoc moilant is created by or enhanced with magic, its magical nature is most apparent in its rune-carved pincers, which can create powerful magical shock waves.",
			"",
			"Ardoc moilants are particularly clever, able to evaluate outcomes and approach assigned tasks with a keen understanding of engineering principles. One of the many secrets the Ardocs keep about the construction process is that this sophisticated programming relies on patterning from a human soul. Though this patterning is vital to the moilants' utility and popularity, the patterning ritual is exceptionally painful and sometimes fatal to the human source.",

			"As constructs built by the Ardocs' arcane masters, moilants have no society in the traditional sense - at least according to the Ardoc family. Customers have noted, however, that Ardoc moilants seem to exhibit patterns of behavior that hint at a deeper level of consciousness and an inner drive for companionship. Unless presented with constant activity, the labor-constructs tend to gather in small groups, or even with other machines or constructs. Most Ardoc moilants are created with the ability to speak a language selected by the buyer. They speak only rarely, and their deep, gravelly voices sound like metal scraping on metal. All moilants acquire distinctive personalities and notable quirks over time, such as collecting certain types of small items or pushing rubble into shapes that mimic the runes on their pincers. Diligent owners might demand a readjustment or refund from the Ardoc family when their moilants start to demonstrate too much individual initiative, but some moilants leave their masters and strike out on their own before this readjustment can occur.",

Bounding about violently, groups of ascomoids sometimes take hours to settle back down, unable to distinguish between the movements of prey and the tumbling of their own kind.

The ritual that originally binds the salamander also directly connects the forge to the Plane of Fire, so extraordinary measures are necessary to extinguish it. Powerful water- or cold-based abilities, such as the breath weapon of an ancient or older {family/silver dragon} or the drench ability of an {monster/elder water elemental}, can suppress or sever this connection long enough to douse the forge's flames. The forge then becomes mundane and can be dismantled to prevent the forgemaster from rejuvenating."

			"**Bower (Su)** By spending 1 hour in intense concentration, an ashullian can designate a 50-foot-radius area within 200 feet as its bower. An ashullian's senses permeate its bower, allowing it to perceive the entire area with its blindsight and to touch, taste, smell, and hear everything within it. An ashullian always has line of effect to any area of its bower, and can cause any of its spell-like or supernatural abilities to originate from any point within its bower instead of from its own space. While inside its bower, the ashullian can use its {spell/telekinesis} and {spell/major creation} spell-like abilities at will to affect any creatures and objects located within. The ashullian's bower remains in place until the ashullian dies, moves more than 200 feet from the bower, or creates a new bower. A {spell/dispel magic} spell or effect cannot dispel an ashullian's bower, although it can suppress the bower as though it were a magic item.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Tentacles (Ex)** An ashullian treats its tentacle attacks as primary natural attacks.",
			"",
			"**Synesthetic Masterpiece (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds, an ashullian can briefly channel its artistic mastery to flood its bower with an overwhelming multisensory experience. Non-ashullians within its bower must each succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or take 5d8 points of sonic damage and be staggered for 1 round, and must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 5d8 points of damage and be fascinated for 1 round (during this round, the creature does not view anything within the bower that does not attack the affected creature as a potential threat). A creature that fails both saving throws is stunned for 1d4 rounds, rather than staggered or fascinated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Blind, contemplative artists from the lightless depths of the Elemental Plane of Water, ashullians coaxed sounds, tastes, and other diverse stimuli into miles-wide galleries among the plane's freezing currents. A powerful race of subterranean humanoids beneath Kaer Maga coveted the ashullians' abilities and tore open a planar rift that captured several ashullians but also flooded the humanoids' underground chambers with icy water. The humanoids vanished, and their ashullian prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors. Ashullians seek objects that realize their eclectic and unpredictable aesthetic sense and showcase whatever oddities they find - which could include anything from a sodden scroll or a jeweled brooch to a severed foot-by wearing them in their flesh or displaying them in their magical bowers.",
			"",
			"Ashullians are not inherently aggressive, but they demand that strangers contribute curios for their art. An ashullian's sense of a \"curio\" is utterly alien to most creatures, and can range from a bauble or scarf to a moist lump of bread or a long strip of newly flayed skin. Denying an ashullian is likely to provoke its rage.",
			"",
			"A typical ashullian's lithe form measures 16 feet from head to tails and weighs only 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"An ashullian's eyeless, eellike head has a small, lipless mouth full of unsettling humanlike teeth. Its elongated cranium sits above a supple neck and four sharp-tipped tentacles. Its torso splits into two thick tails as long as the rest of its body. An ashullian's transparent, leathery skin reveals a body cavity with swirling iridescent ribbons of fluid in place of organs. Ciliated clefts and soft, flexible spines - the ashullian's sensory apparatuses - run along its back and arms.",
			"",
			"Although their ancestors lived in the Plane of Water, the ashullians beneath Kaer Maga are now native outsiders. Their artistic abilities are stunted, degenerate versions of those of their progenitors, who may still swim within enormous sensory galleries in the Elemental Plane of Water. Ashullians on Golarion can realize their grand visions only within their bowers, exercising incredible control in pursuit of their inscrutable artistry. Within a bower, the diverse contents' own sensory elements - such as the coarse texture of rusted mail, the sour taste of reagents, and the stink of decaying flesh - are combined with whorls of scent, sounds, and other minor manifestations injected by the ashullian. An ashullian can create and move objects within its bower by thought alone, and can even suspend basic physical laws there; if an ashullian chooses, an object remains eternally suspended in the water in defiance of gravity, or remains dry despite being submerged. An ashullian revels in the synesthetic glory of its bower, but other creatures find the multisensory experience overwhelming.",
			"",
			"The ancient magic that brought ashullians to the Drowned Levels keeps most of them trapped there. A few, though, have escaped their prison via purloined magic, while others have simply vanished without a trace. Ashullians whisper that these paragons transcended their existence through ultimate artistic mastery and seek to follow these mythical examples.",
			"",
			"Ashullians are spawned singly and mature on their own. Ashullians grow slowly and can reach 300 years old. The bodies of deceased ashullians are almost always incorporated into the bowers of younger ashullians as an artistic statement about aging or the transience of life.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"When not tending to their individual bowers, ashullians search the Drowned Levels for inspiration and clues to a means of escape. Ashullians are not the only occupants of these dismal, sodden halls; water elementals and other aquatic creatures swim through the ashullians' domain. Ashullians are generally content to let familiar creatures pass, although they have an intense fixation on visitors from the surface. These visitors are first pestered for trinkets and curios, but eventually restrained and stripped layer by layer so the ashullian can experience their full sensory measure. Occasionally, visitors escape an ashullian's attention by presenting a novel artistic display and fleeing while the creature is occupied. Ashullians are rarely welcome within another ashullian's bower, as each considers its own artistic experiments to be superior to those of its kin and is unabashedly critical of others."

This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty.",
			"",

			"**Hibernate (Ex)** After gorging itself on innumerable tons of deep sea life and unfortunate travelers, an aspidochelone floats to the surface and goes into a deep hibernation with only its mottled back jutting from the waves. While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island. A hibernating aspidochelone is considered to have taken 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a rock or island. ",
			"",
			"An aspidochelone rouses from its hibernation for one of two reasons: hunger or disturbance. After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day. If awakened in this manner, an aspidochelone typically dives to escape its attacker, then rises again to consume it. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hibernation of Ages (Ex)** An aspidochelone in hibernation continues to exude its captivating scent. Over time, birds attracted by the aspidochelone's pheromones come to roost on the whale, inadvertently bringing the seeds of small plants and shrubbery to grow in the cracks upon the aspidochelone's thick hide. The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island. Thus, any aspidochelone who has spent more than 10 years hibernating gains an addition +10 bonus on its Stealth check to look like a natural island.",
			"",
			"**Watery Grave (Ex)** A startled aspidochelone descends rapidly into the depths of the sea, creating an undertow in the water that pulls creatures above the whale down with it. Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A legendary creature of the sea, aspidochelones are eldritch whales of titanic size. When floating near the surface of the water, aspidochelones have frequently been mistaken by desperate sailors for small islands due to the craggy, mottled flesh of their steeply humped backs. Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it.",
			"",
			"An aspidochelone appears to be a huge whale with an extraordinarily thick, rock-like hide. From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island."

			"The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots.

Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target's size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant's roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries.",
			"",
			"An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant's ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby.",
			"",
			"Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine's seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape. Tales often tell of assassin vines appearing in flower beds or infiltrating greenhouses, murderous surprises planted by rivals and enemies or arbitrary doom dropped by unsuspecting wing."

The asurendra can use a standard action to direct one blade to attack a target up to a distance of 50 feet away, or use a full-attack action to cause all six blades to attack up to six different targets up to a distance of 50 feet away, each to a different location if desired. Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes.

Most asurendras are 19 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Few asurendras were born to their might - they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works.",
			"",
			"In battle, an asurendra does its best to destroy all enemies, taking a moment to ensure death when any foe falls. Asurendras enjoy eating the bodies of fallen foes, and some can even use the flesh and bone of those they consume to create new asuras to serve them.",

Like philosophers dispensing wisdom, they teach their ways to others so that more asuras might ascend into perfection. Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their \"enlightened\" hatred.",
			"",
			"**Death:** All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living.",
			"",
			"**Sacrilege:** Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design.",
			"",
			"**Shaping:** Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper's vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper's hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability.",
			"",
			"**Create Asura (Su):** As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a {monster/tripurasura} that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura - beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal.",

Each non-asura in the area is blinded for 1d3 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 26 Reflex save. A blinded creature can wipe the gore from its eyes as a standard action, removing the blindness; alternatively, another creature adjacent to a blinded creature can wipe away the gore as a standard action. Jumping into a body of water or being subject to an effect that creates a lot of water (such as {spell/create water} or {spell/hydraulic push}) also removes the blindness. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Scent of Carnage (Ex)** A hishandura's sense of smell is especially sensitive to blood and fresh injuries.

			"Ages ago, a short-sighted god sought to punish his flock for a perceived slight, infusing a champion with a fragment of his power and sending it to wreak havoc. The champion did as commanded, tearing apart the faithful and showering their city with blood. The deity heard the tearful cries of the mortals, pleading for mercy and insisting that any kindly god would never visit such hatred upon his people. The god felt an upwelling of shame for having engineered such violence, but rather than accept responsibility or undo the damage, the god appeared before the city and forsook the divine champion, insisting that it was a raving beast sent by some less caring patron than himself. Empowered by their lying god's words and magic, the people praised him, rallied, and killed the champion. From this act of betrayal - and the remains of the slaughtered champion - rose the first hishandura.",
			"",

			"",
			"A hishandura's body hums with destructive passion. This reflection of the original hishandura's divine mandate drives these asuras to slaughter living creatures, destroy beautiful works, and listen for the piteous cries for mercy from the fearful and faithful alike. Hishanduras can see effortlessly through the smoke of burning buildings, locate the cowering weak and wounded, and extract hateful revelations from the bloody precipitation flung by their blades. They can bypass nearly any defense to inflict their malign punishments, effortlessly teleporting past guards and discorporating to slip through portcullises.",

			"",
			"A hishandura's camaraderie is especially strong with the divine engines of destruction known as {family/behemoth/s}. Behemoths and hishanduras rarely attack one another. Instead, hishanduras delight in finding signs of dormant behemoths, waking them, and reveling in the resulting destruction. The longer the beast has slumbered, the more suggestible it seems to be to the asuras' insistence that the behemoth has been forgotten or betrayed, as though being abandoned by the gods for so long makes the behemoths bitter.",
			"",
			"Unlike other asuras, hishanduras rarely remain in the same place for long. They become restless when lingering in a site they have demolished or despoiled and are quick to move on and seek out a new target. This is only partially due to impatience, as hishanduras also dislike having to face holy champions seeking retaliation for their despoliation. It isn't the threat of defeat that irritates the hishanduras, but rather the possibility that some paladin might appear to vindicate her blind obedience to her god by killing the fiend.",
			"",
			"Hishanduras distrust any beings placed above others, and distance themselves from asura ranas, whom they see as hypocrites. Hishanduras who honor asura ranas do so because they see truths in their violent teachings, not because they consider the ranas as lords to be slavishly obeyed. These hishanduras favor violent and vindictive patrons such as {faith/Chugarra}, the Guru of Butchers; {faith/Chupurvagasti}, Lady of Poison Mist; and {faith/Zurapadyn}, the Beast Who Waits in Smoke."

When it makes a full attack with both bows, the penalties for fighting with two weapons apply and can be offset with feats such as {feat/Two-Weapon Fighting}. The japalisura can apply extra attacks from other sources, such as {feat/Manyshot} or {feat/Rapid Shot}, to only one of its bows per round. For the purpose of calculating the penalties for fighting with two weapons, a japalisura treats shortbows and composite shortbows as light weapons, and it treats other bows as one-handed weapons.",

			"**Hateful Prophecy (Sp)** A japalisura can cast {spell/augury} or {spell/divination} for a willing creature, in which case the spell provides information that pertains to that creature's future rather than that of the asura. Upon completing the casting of the spell-like ability, the japalisura can attempt a Profession (soothsayer) check opposed by the creature's Sense Motive check. If successful, the japalisura twists the prophecy in such a way to convey impending violence or betrayal, subjecting the creature to the effects of {spell/vengeful outrage} with an indicated enemy of the asura's choice. The creature can resist the vengeful outrage effect with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Arrows (Su)** As a swift action, a japalisura with at least one free hand can create 10 mundane arrows. It can have no more than 20 such arrows in existence at a time, and its arrows are always destroyed when fired, whether they hit their target or not.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Thinking her divine realm so glorious that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful oracle to identify her enemies. The oracle told her that she had no reason to fear invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.",
			"",
			"A japalisura is 7 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"Despite having a single mind to control many limbs, japalisuras are exceptionally dexterous and capable of performing numerous tasks simultaneously. They easily operate two bows at once, smoothly alternating between reloading and firing. Japalisuras never want for ammunition, plucking arrows from the air as if drawing them from some invisible quiver. It's unclear from where exactly these arrows originate, although every japalisura's ammunition shares the same fletching and design. One theory is that these asuras are drawing replicas of the arrows carried by the slain demigods, though effects that inhibit summoning don't impede their ability to draw forth these arrows in any way.",
			"",
			"Japalisuras have a knack for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, hatefully manipulating their prophecies as though they were independent or even in defiance of conventional soothsaying. Where magic fails, they are adept at reading humanoid emotions, making up attractive lies and pandering to biases to confirm their clients' worst fears and prejudices.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Asura}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Like most asuras, japalisuras favor temples and churches as their lairs. The more a location is associated with prophecy, the better. As a result, japalisuras often settle in and around druids' groves, oracular caves, cyclops lairs, and the like, especially if those locations continue to attract the occasional pilgrim seeking answers. This makes abandoned sacred sites of Magdh, Pharasma, and Sivanah especially attractive. Japalisuras take a special delight in identifying perilous romantic relationships, posing as servants of Naderi and stealthily presenting at least one of the lovers with predictions of future difficulties to encourage self-destructive behavior.",
			"",
			"Japalisuras know that their fearsome miens tend to distress visitors, yet the asuras lack any supernatural means of disguising themselves. Instead, many japalisuras favor hiding out of sight and dealing with visitors from behind screens or within darkened alcoves. In these circumstances, the asura rarely emerges unless doing so would convince a reticent visitor to cooperate or if necessary to destroy someone who poses a threat to the asura's ongoing operations. Rarely, a japalisura operates openly, relying on either its reputation or its monstrous allure to attract disciples. Such is the case for Holkomion of Iblydos, who claims to have rediscovered the sacred art of mythspeaking. At least one warrior claims to have attained mythic power as a result of Holkomion's guidance, yet most find that the japalisura's prophecies in fact direct petitioners to assassinate hero-gods.",
			"",
			"More often, a japalisura maintains a small cult to communicate its oracular guidance. A japalisura accepts only the most devout followers into such coteries. With such humanoid puppets, the asura can dispense divinations telepathically without having to show itself. These cults take myriad forms but typically operate outside of large population centers to avoid too much scrutiny. The japalisura Zalmiac poses as the Varisian harrower Madame Vhelanosz, virtually never leaving the wagon from which she interprets her cards. Her pernicious prophecies have incited scores of murders - especially against Desnans and Pharasmins, whom she goads into killing each other - and her loyal cohort of ex-Sczarni assistants ensure nobody asks too many of the wrong questions.",

Attic whisperers linger in the places where they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtors' prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded. When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skull - this does not impact the creature's abilities in any way, but it usually seeks out a small animal's skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests.",

The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children.",

			"",
			"Aurumvoraxes are very aggressive creatures, and lead solitary lives except when they mate. Adults typically claim the hunting area within a mile of their warrens, ruthlessly driving away other predators. In addition to fresh meat, aurumvoraxes are fond of gnawing on metals (particularly gold and copper), though whether they do this to sharpen their teeth or because of some nutritional need is unknown. Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \"golden gorger\" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts.",
			"",
			"In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its prey is dead.",
			"",
			"A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary.",
			"",
			"Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued for training as guard beasts. A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young.",
			"",
			"An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster - in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them."

			"**Arcane Pincers (Ex)** A champion automaton's pincers function as claw attacks but have been magically treated to make them more powerful. A champion applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its pincers. If a champion automaton grabs a creature smaller than itself with a pincer, the champion automaton does not gain the grappled condition and can move normally while holding the creature in its pincer. While holding a creature in a pincer, the champion automaton loses access to that pincer attack and gains an additional slam attack. If the champion automaton uses this slam attack against a creature or object while a creature is held in its pincer, the held creature takes damage equal to the slam attack on a hit. The champion automaton must still maintain the grapple every round, but it can do so as a free action. The grappled creature can attempt to break free as normal.",
			"",
			"**Energy Beam (Ex)** A champion automaton can focus the energy in its core to emit either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone as a standard action. The beam deals 8d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (Reflex DC 20 half). Half of the damage dealt is fire damage and half is force damage. A champion automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d4 rounds. A champion automaton can use its energy beam when it is grappling or being grappled. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Warrior's Resolve (Ex)** The innate determination and instinct in a champion automaton's core grants it an insight bonus to AC equal to its Wisdom bonus (if any). Additionally, this resolve grants the champion a number of bonus hit points per Hit Die equal to its Wisdom bonus (if any).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Of all the warriors of the Artificer Conclave, champion automatons are the best suited for combat. Before the empire's collapse, champion automatons served on the front lines of the Jistka Imperium's armies, facing the empire's foes head-on. Although champion automatons were not invincible, most who encountered one, let alone a battalion of them, were quick to face defeat.",
			"",
			"Champion automatons are enormous constructs typically made from a combination of magically treated stone and metal, which allows them to withstand the powerful blows typically encountered in battle. Although these bodies are extremely heavy, the magical energies that power them allow the automatons to move as quickly as most other combatants, if not faster. A typical champion automaton is 14 feet tall and weighs 2 tons, though the Artificer Conclave created some bigger champion automatons to take on the largest enemy genies, with some reaching as much as 40 feet in height.",
			"",
			"The most notable features of a champion automaton are its enormous pincers. The durability of its body and the magical ritual that reinforces the pincers' structure allows a champion automaton to swing its pincer with tremendous force. In combat, these constructs use the pincers to clamp onto particularly pesky enemies. Once a champion has successfully grabbed an enemy, it remains free to keep swinging its pincer, slamming its captive foe into other enemies to damage both creatures.",
			"",
			"The other devastating weapon of a champion automaton is the automaton core itself. The potent core constantly collects planar energy at an impressive rate in order to power the large constructs. A champion automaton can focus excess energy into a deadly beam of force capable of destroying structures or slaying large numbers of foes. Although it takes some time to recharge its energy reserves between blasts, a champion remains formidable. The champion automaton's energy beam is not the only type of energy weapon the Conclave created, but it quickly became the standard across the majority of automatons.",
			"",
			"The Artificer Conclave chose all manner of Jistkan warriors to serve as their champions, from lowly foot soldiers up to the most decorated generals. The bodies of the champion automatons more than made up for a lack in combat prowess, and warriors of great skill found that their new bodies greatly improved their innate abilities, allowing them to make the most of these new construct forms. Of note were the twin champions Kifir and Orla, whose specialized frames allowed them to join together and share their combat instincts to create a fury never before seen on the battlefield. This fury was lost to time, however, as the pair mysteriously vanished after an Osirian ambush.",
			"",
			"Many champion automatons abandoned their posts once the Jistka Imperium's demise was a certainty. Those who remained eventually faced destruction on the battlefield. The rest sought other fights, traveling to the far corners of Golarion - an effort that continues to this day. Historical footnotes mention terrifying constructs jumping into great battles, seemingly without an agenda. These mysterious constructs would fight against whichever side seemed strongest, only to depart as quickly as they arrived once they appeared satisfied with the outcome of the battle. Even today, these champion automatons show up in areas such as the Worldwound, the furthest depths of the Darklands, Iscadero Island in Arcadia, and the Valashmai Jungle in Tian Xia.",
			"",
			"Of the champion automatons that left Golarion, most now reside in the city of Axis, finding satisfaction in their existence and taking on more subdued lives in the planar city when not seeking battle on the planes. Occasionally, these automatons join inevitables in their missions, serving as additional muscle when the outsiders need assistance but wish to avoid pulling other inevitables away from their duties. Champion and stalker automatons frequently cross paths in Axis, as their automaton cores have a tendency to subtly pull towards each other, and they often meet up to spar or trade old tales of battles long forgotten by history. One group of champions and stalkers unites once a decade to host a simple tournament on the outskirts of Axis. The tournament invites all combatants within the city to test their prowess against the automatons, with the winner awarded the title of a lost Jistkan hero.",

			"Familiar automatons were the most common of the automatons created within the Jistkan Imperium. The Artificer Conclave found itself overwhelmed with requests to join the group from hundreds of individuals they deemed unworthy of the more powerful automaton frames. Rather than turn these individuals away and risk the ire of so many Jistkans, the Conclave decided instead to transplant the majority of these individuals into familiar automatons. These familiars also served as a way for the Conclave to test new technologies and perfect the creation of automaton cores.",
			"",
			"All interested citizens were accepted to become familiar automatons so long as they could afford their automaton frame and the automaton core, though some were granted free of charge in order to allow further experimentation. As these automatons served as prototypes for a number of different technologies, most of the first few generations of familiars quickly failed and left their cores stranded without a body. The majority of these stranded cores were hidden away or used as parts in further research. Thanks to breakthroughs made with the aid of these cores, future generations of automatons were more stable and had the potential to remain intact indefinitely. A few existing accounts of automaton core creation reference some cores activating before their creation was complete, seemingly activated by the will of an individual lost from an early generation, though no records corroborate these notes.",
			"",
			"The Artificer Conclave experimented with a number of different forms and frames for the familiar automatons. The design of these forms had aesthetics in mind more than function, which led to the construction of especially elaborate familiars. Eventually, they settled on common animal shapes such as birds, dogs, and snakes, though cats quickly became one of the favorites. Wealthy individuals occasionally requested automaton frames modeled after rare creatures such as faerie dragons, imps, or lantern archons. This trend served the Conclave well, as they could charge high prices for more extravagant frames and then use the income they generated to fund the research and construction of more powerful automatons.",
			"",
			"A familiar automaton is usually the same size and twice the weight of the creature after which it is modeled. For the most part, non-feline familiar automatons use the same statistics as the cat-based familiar automaton presented here, but more powerful familiar automatons may have additional abilities better suited for their more unique frames. On rare occasions, a familiar automaton bears spells engraved in markings on its body - usually signature spells of ancient mages, engraved on their forms by request. Some mages today keep these automatons as their personal familiars. A 7th-level lawful spellcaster with the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat can select a familiar automaton as a familiar. These familiars serve well due to their innate ability to understand magic and magical items.",
			"",
			"Although most familiar automatons housed lowerranking citizens and worker-artificers, a number of these familiars housed more notable individuals. A number of judge-artificers and priest-artificers intentionally chose to become familiars rather than taking any of the more powerful automaton forms. The reasons for this varied from humility to a desire to escape from the conflict in which the Jistka Imperium was embroiled. Regardless of the reason, these high familiars, as they came to be known, each had their own powerful abilities. Some high familiars of note include the Judge Lord Valmen, who took on the form of an arbiter inevitable, and Urthilan the Star Priestess, who took a frame resembling a cassisian angel.",
			"",
			"Familiar automatons were not designed for combat but nevertheless feature a number of abilities to assist in fights. The most notable ability is the strange disease that each familiar automaton carries. What was originally a flaw of a familiar's automaton core eventually became a standard feature. Each of these cores leaks a minimal amount of energy that manifests as a disease known as arcane fever, technically a form of radiation sickness brought on by exposure to this planar energy. In a true twist of irony, the disease seems to be most potent against wizards, as they quickly forget how to prepare their spells as they slip further into the symptoms of the potent fever.",
			"",
			"Most familiar automatons do not bother searching for new automaton cores. The nature of a familiar automaton's body generally allows for any core to take dominance of the frame and discard the previous mentality; as such, most familiars tend to stay as far away from other cores as possible, content with their existing nature and unwilling to subject their frames to a new psyche. A rare few familiars have learned to maintain their minds across multiple cores, however, and these often work with other automatons to collect more cores, a practice that allows the familiar to live on far longer than it could on its own.",
			"",
			"As they were the most numerous automatons at the fall of the Jistka Imperium, familiar automatons are the most common variety found throughout Golarion. A familiar automaton's intelligence usually allows it to avoid detection when it likes, though scholars all over the world report sightings of these automatons in a variety of forms. The technological nature of Numeria allows familiar automatons to hide in plain sight, where onlookers believe the constructs to be curiosities or projects of local tinkerers - though a spellcaster who doesn't want to be forcibly separated from her familiar would be careful to keep a familiar automaton out of the eye of the Technic League.",
			"",
			"While most familiar automatons remain on Golarion, a sizable number reside elsewhere throughout the Great Beyond. The city of Axis houses quite a few familiar automatons, relaxing in peace as they go unnoticed among the strange citizens of the Eternal City. They tend to serve as messengers between the city's denizens, especially other automatons, an exception to most who tend to avoid others of their kind. Among champion automatons, familiars serve as chroniclers, recording great battles and sharing them with other champions; among stalkers, familiars usually act as solving to solve feuds or overseeing two hunters staging contests of skill where the familiar automaton serves as an impartial judge.",
			"",
			"The Boneyard also contains a surprising number of familiar automatons. Here, the constructs walk among the souls awaiting judgment, serving as temporary companions for petitioners. The nature of a petitioner's memory means that the petitioner usually does not recognize a familiar automaton but still retains a strong association with a beloved pet from its former life. This association provides comfort for especially distressed petitioners. Thanks to their ability to ease wary souls, a few [catrina psychopomps](monster/catrina) establish friendships with familiar automatons, the two working in tandem to make the wait for judgment as painless as possible.",

			"**Arcane Hooks (Ex)** A master automaton's hooks are treated as having the {magic-enhancement/ghost touch} property and as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A master automaton applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its hooks. When a master automaton hits with a hook, it can attempt a reposition combat maneuver as a free action. With a successful combat maneuver check, the master automaton can move its target to any square within its reach. If both hook attacks hit the target, the master automaton gains a +5 bonus on the combat maneuver check.",
			"",
			"**Automaton Sense (Ex)** A master automaton can sense and locate other automatons within 500 feet as if it had blindsense, and it can detect automatons within 60 feet as if it had blindsight.",
			"",
			"**Consume Core (Ex)** A master automaton can consume the life energy found within an automaton core as a standard action. Consuming a core in this manner destroys the automaton core and grants the master a +1 bonus to natural armor and on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 24 hours. Consuming a second automaton core within this 24 hour period causes the bonuses to become permanent. A master automaton can never gain more than a +10 bonus by consuming automaton cores. If a master automaton consumes the automaton core of another master automaton, it gains that master automaton's permanent bonuses gained by the consume core ability, if any, and add these bonuses to its own permanent bonuses.",
			"",
			"**Energy Beam (Ex)** A master automaton can focus the energy in its core to fire either a 90-foot line or a 60-foot cone of energy as a standard action. The beam deals 20d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (Reflex DC 30 half). Half of the damage is fire damage and half is force damage. A master automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d3 rounds. A master automaton can use its energy beam when it is grappling or being grappled. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Core (Ex)** A master automaton's automaton core is filled with extremely potent life energy, granting the master an insight bonus to AC and on saving throws equal to the master automaton's Charisma bonus (if any). Additionally, this energy grants the master automaton a number of bonus hit points per Hit Die equal to its Charisma bonus (if any).",
			"",
			"**Reconstruction (Ex)** A master automaton is able to reconstruct itself if its body is destroyed. The master automaton's automaton core uses its energy to rebuild the automaton's body over the span of 1d10 days. If the core is located in Axis, the reconstruction requires only 1d10 hours. Once reconstructed, the master automaton reactivates with full hit points and any bonuses it had gained from the consume core ability. Only destroying a master automaton's automaton core prevents this reconstruction.",

			"Master automatons are the most powerful among their kind. The highest-ranking leaders of the Artificer Conclave reserved these frames for themselves, intent on using their power to keep the rest of the automatons, and the other masters, in check. Most master automatons did not enter combat, instead choosing to serve as strategists and advisors.",
			"",
			"While every master automaton is customized to serve the needs of the Conclave, they all command the same basic abilities. Most notable is their ability to detect and destroy automaton cores, an ability developed in case it became necessary to stop rogue automatons. Each master's frame is created with an arcane resonance that matches that found in automaton cores, allowing a master automaton to destroy and consume a core with ease. An unexpected side effect of this destruction process, however, is that a master absorbs the destroyed core's energy, which empowers the master.",
			"",
			"This knowledge soon led to an arms race among the masters as they sought more automatons that they deemed as deserving of destruction. A large number of automatons were destroyed and consumed before this arms race eventually reached a deadlock, when the masters intentionally destroyed the means of creating new automaton cores in an attempt to cut off their rivals. This marked the end of the Artificer Conclave, and the masters soon went into hiding.",
			"",
			"Today, the masters hide among the planes, mostly in especially remote or dangerous areas. Very few masters remain on Golarion. These masters resurface only when they find leads on a large collection of automaton cores or a particularly powerful automaton, biding their time until the perfect moment to strike. A few masters did not fall prey to avarice, though, and instead serve as advisors to particularly powerful beings, such as great rulers or powerful mages, hoping to steer them away from Jistka's past mistakes. Others still continue their search for knowledge, exploring the multiverse at their leisure to collect new knowledge and meet new personalities. Of particular note is the master automaton Anquira, who makes it very public that she is on a quest to speak with the other masters in the hopes of piecing together the lost knowledge of automaton creation to help restore the automatons to their original forms.",

The council is made up of some of the first automatons, having developed the technology that allowed their creation. Each member of the council was transplanted into a personalized master automaton with abilities far beyond those of the rest of the Conclave. The council vanished shortly before the coming of the Night Plague in -3064 AR, but their names and titles remain, burned into every automaton core as a signature from a fragment of their own life energy. &emsp;Agnanh of the High Watch &emsp;Busmin the Ridiculed &emsp;Enoh of the Seven &emsp;The Fallen Master &emsp;Hinmar the Final Scholar &emsp;Judge Lord Drus &emsp;The Imposter Inperantike &emsp;The Miser of the Lost &emsp;Tehkis, Death's Terror &emsp;The Unchained Servant",

			"**Automated Crossbow (Ex)** A sharpshooter automaton's automated crossbow is treated as a Large [+2 flaming heavy crossbow](magic-enhancement/flaming). The powerful weapon is treated as a siege weapon for the purposes of wind effects, wind wall, and similar effects. While the crossbow is built into the automaton, the automaton adds its Strength bonus as a bonus on damage rolls and reloads as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Bolt Volley (Ex)** As a standard action, a sharpshooter automaton can fire a spray of arrows that covers a 30-foot-radius area. If it uses a full-round action, the size of the area increases to a 50-foot radius. It makes a single attack roll against all creatures in the area using its highest base attack bonus at a -4 penalty. Each creature struck takes 6d8 points of damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage. The sharpshooter automaton can use this attack once every 1d4 rounds as it must regenerate its ammunition, but it can continue to use its automated crossbow as normal during this time.",
			"",
			"**Energy Beam (Ex)** A sharpshooter automaton can focus the energy in its core to make a ranged touch attack against a creature within 120 feet as a standard action. The beam deals 15d6 points of damage on a hit; half of this damage is fire damage and half is force damage. Upon striking its target, the energy beam explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the explosion area, including the original target, take 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 24 half). The sharpshooter automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Sharpshooter's Sense (Ex)** A sharpshooter automaton's core is instilled with a knack for combat awareness, granting it all-around vision. Additionally, it adds its Wisdom modifier as a bonus on Reflex saves.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Sharpshooter automatons contain the minds of the best archers and crossbow specialists known throughout the Jistka Imperium, who competed in tournaments to earn the right to an automaton body. They served as the artillery of the automatons, attacking enemies with such precision and at such a great distance that many targets fell long before they were aware of an imminent attack.",
			"",
			"Efficiency was the key of the sharpshooter automaton's design. Their frames are just large enough to house the components necessary to power the construct alongside their magical weapons. Though the frames followed a similar pattern of design across these automatons, many sharpshooters chose to embellish their forms with intricate runic patterns or fearsome designs reminiscent of tattoos. A sharpshooter automaton is typically 4 feet tall and weighs 215 pounds. The largest sharpshooter automatons, however, housed extremely large ranged weapons or even siege weapons, such as ballistae capable of destroying a keep's walls.",
			"",
			"A sharpshooter automaton's automaton core directs a considerable amount of its power to the arcane propulsion that allows the construct to fly. This energy appears invisible to the naked eye, but creatures capable of detecting magical auras perceive it as something resembling a magical flame. This propulsion constantly releases excess energy capable of burning creatures too close to the sharpshooter.",
			"",
			"The technology that fuels a sharpshooter's flight similarly powers its weapon. The crossbow built into most sharpshooters siphons planar energy from the automaton core and reconstitutes it to create the large bolts its weapon requires. These bolts allow a sharpshooter automaton to fire enormous volleys without ever lacking ammunition. Once a bolt leaves the automaton's reserve, it becomes relatively unstable, however, and generally dissipates in minutes, returning to the parts of the Great Beyond from which it was drawn.",
			"",
			"Although most sharpshooter automatons use crossbows as their weapon of choice, archers of all kinds volunteered to become the new constructs, as the automaton's expert construction allowed for perfection of an archer's skill. The first sharpshooter automatons took to the skies in early combat, raining death on their enemies, but they soon found that sandstorms and other magical protections rendered an aerial approach ineffective. In time, they eventually learned to overcome such defenses, but as a whole they were too few to shift battles in favor of the Jistka Imperium. Among the most notable of these heroes was Khimar of the High Watch, whose volleys were said to resemble torrential downpours.",
			"",
			"Since the fall of Jistka, the sharpshooter automatons scattered to the winds, intent on finding their own purpose in a world without a land or people they could call their own. Even with their planar abilities, some sharpshooter automatons remained on Golarion. Leveraging the freedom granted by their flight, these automatons can be found around the world, seemingly as wanderers. A number of them act as itinerant saviors, slaying large creatures on the verge of attacking villages or rescuing travelers caught in tough spots. Occasional tales crop up among travelers claiming that they were saved from peril by a rain of bolts, but that when they returned to the site of the rescue hours later, they found nothing. Other sharpshooter automatons keep watch in the skies, hovering thousands of feet in the air over important structures and locations throughout Golarion. While the locations appear random to a modern observer, most of these are places important to the individual automaton or of significance in Jistkan history, such as locations mentioned in the Poleiheira.",
			"",
			"Now, besides those few on the Material Plane, most sharpshooter automatons reside in Axis with others of their kind. However, a few visit the Maelstrom on a regular basis, pushed toward the chaotic uncertainty of these planar depths by some sort of melancholy. These automatons tend to avoid other creatures and keep to themselves, and most proteans know that even in that chaotic realm, the constructs remain quite powerful, and thus keep their distance. Although the automatons in the Maelstrom are few, they are generally quite familiar with their favored region of the plane, and their powerful sight allows them to keep track of the chaos for miles in every direction. Most notable among these self-exiled sharpshooter automatons is Alvara the All-Seer. Those who know of her claim that the millennia through which she has stayed in the Maelstrom allows her to accurately understand and even predict the nature of the chaotic seas in which she resides.",

			"Stalker automatons house the minds of the greatest hunters of the Jistka Imperium, serving as the best scouts and assassins among the automatons. Unmatched at pursuing targets, they set out individually or in deadly groups to follow their quarry for days on end, using their construct forms to outlast even the hardiest of targets.",
			"",
			"The bodies of stalker automatons were designed to emulate the various large cats that stalked the Jistka Imperium, such as aurumvoraxes, kamadans, and mountain lions. These creatures served as a basis for the strength and design of the bodies, but members of the Artificer Conclave took it upon themselves to improve upon what they found lacking in nature. A stalker automaton is typically 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds, but the oldest of their kind remember the construction of larger stalker frames, including those that resemble creatures such as bears and drakes.",
			"",
			"A stalker's automaton core uses a combination of illusion and transmutation magic to physically alter the makeup of its body to better blend into its surroundings, altering features like color and texture. Although the stalker's frame consists mostly of metal, its planar-powered camouflage is capable of extraordinary adaptive feats, such as including creating the appearance of moss or leaves when appropriate. This effect is mostly an illusion, however, and those capable of seeing past such images can see the automaton for what it is.",
			"",
			"A number of hunters jumped at the chance to become more animal-like in their new automaton bodies. The new bodies afforded these hunters enhanced instincts, which allowed them to connect with their quarries on a more primal level. While stalker automatons initially used their new bodies to hunt Jistka's enemies, they quickly took to using their new skills for their own purposes, setting off on their own to seek out the hunts they longed for. Soon, stalker automatons were seen throughout the Inner Sea region, chasing after quarries that even the bravest monster hunters dared not approach.",
			"",
			"The boldest stalkers took to hunting beyond the Material Plane and sought their next targets across the Great Beyond. These stalkers chase dangerous prey throughout the multiverse, hunting outsiders of all kinds, including elementals and genies as well as angels and demons. Most of these stalkers are content with just shadowing these more elusive targets, satisfied in the fact that they can trail them unnoticed for days or weeks. Only the most brazen or most foolish stalkers dare attack these creatures, especially on the creatures' home planes. Rare are the stalkers that attack outsiders and remain intact, but a notable exception is one of the first stalkers, known simply as Mulvara the Quarry-bound. Rumors abound of her hunts, but the most consistent thread in these tales is her ability to consume part of the quintessence of her quarries, granting her untold powers.",
			"",
			"In combat, stalker automatons are a subtle force unrivaled by even the most cunning rogues or deadly assassins. Stalkers are capable of stepping between planar boundaries and reaching the Astral Plane instantly. This ability allows them to appear between different parts of the battlefield in the blink of an eye, not through typical planar travel but instead utilizing a kind of planar overlap similar in nature to {spell/ethereal jaunt}.",
			"",
			"While pursuing a target, a stalker automaton will first trail its quarry long enough to understand the creature's tactics so that it can strike strategically at a later time. Due to their innate sense of honor, many stalkers prefer to make themselves known before an encounter or at least strike when the target is aware and ready. Stalkers see striking a creature while that target is at its strongest as the only way to prove their combat superiority. The automatons do understand their own limitations, however, and against targets they deem truly fearsome or powerful, they attack with every advantage possible. If it fails to overcome a target, or the target proves itself a worthy opponent, a stalker retreats, content with the outcome and leaving its opponent in peace.",
			"",
			"Though stalker automatons typically live secluded lives, it is not uncommon for them to create tight-knit packs, especially after bonding during a successful combat or hunt. These packs take on group names that match their hunting style or the previous success such as Those of the Cliff and the Titan Slayers. The packs rarely have a true leader, instead rotating leadership among its members. The current leader locates the next hunt and the pack follows. Once the hunt is complete, another member finds the next hunt she deems worthy.",
			"",
			"Today, stalker automatons remain interspersed throughout the planes and the Inner Sea region, with most residing either in Axis or among the remnants of Jistkan ruins. Those within Axis tend to live more subdued lives, seeking out the inevitables and axiomites of the city to learn their ways, though most stalkers eventually grow disinterested in the outsiders' rigid manners and make their own way in Axis. They often go on to serve as guides for those seeking information about the planes and their denizens, or even as teachers, sharing their hunting prowess with other skilled trackers.",
			"",
			"The few stalker automatons that remain on Golarion seem intent on recovering as many remaining automaton cores as they can. The rarity of these artifacts makes for a hunt as worthy as any creature. These automatons tend to be more solitary in fear of other stalkers or master automatons seeking them out to claim their caches of cores. Stalker automatons also see themselves as the guardians of Jistkan ruins, attacking creatures that might stumble upon lost technology too powerful for the modern age or those few surviving creatures still housing remnants of the Night Plague.",
			"",
			"One pack that makes its presence well known is Those That Sought the Beast. The especially powerful stalker automatons in this pack appear to have garnered some spark of divine might in their travels.

But these aggressive creatures don't wait to happen upon a corpse; they actively hunt their prey, with a viciousness more akin to that of wolves than swine.",
			"",
			"Mating within a herd or a plague happens nearly constantly on Avernus and the other layers of Hell, and gestation is a mere 4 months. The spawn, once birthed, have to fend for themselves, though mature females try to protect the young creatures from males in the grouping, which are quick to scoop up the babies as a quick but unsatisfying snack. Thus do only the strongest and meanest of young razorbacks survive their first year of life. While boars and daeodons nurse their young, female Avernus razorbacks lack the anatomy to do so. In order for spawn to grow up strong and fierce, they must hunt and feed upon fresh corpses. This magical energy sustains the spawn like mother's milk would a terrestrial mammal, and without it, the spawn weakens and is abandoned, trampled, or devoured by the adult males.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once native to Avernus alone, the razorbacks have expanded their territories to the other layers of Hell, though not as deep as Nessus, due in part to Asmodeus's strategic use of Nessian warhounds to guard his borders, as the Prince of Lies sees razorbacks as a blight and refuses to let them linger for long in his domain. Strangely, razorbacks typically do not fare well outside of Hell. While they can survive for a time elsewhere, their prodigious breeding activity is greatly diminished when they are away from Hell's infernal energies. The Pit's greatest minds postulate the razorbacks need the waters of either the marshy ocean of Eridanos or the lethargic run of the River Styx to trigger their breeding cycle, though a handful of breeders on other planes have cast some doubt on such a theory, claiming an alchemical formula can replicate the catalyst throughout the multiverse.",
			"",
			"Razorback groupings are ruled by the largest and meanest female. She has to be strong enough to cow the other females into obedience, and to keep the far more aggressive but typically smaller males in check. The females of a group wage a constant war for dominance, with older, weaker females quickly supplanted by younger, stronger candidates for leadership. On the rare occasions when a male claims dominance over a group, its days are inevitably numbered - a male alpha will eventually tear the group apart through its own aggressive nature and unthinking hunger.",
			"",
			"Domesticated Avernus razorbacks are sparse outside of Avernus itself, in part because the savage boars often turn on their masters. In Cheliax and other mortal realms where people are used to treating with the forces of Hell, some brave or foolhardy souls keep Avernus razorbacks to assist them in getting rid of their political enemies without leaving any physical evidence or chance of resurrection in their wakes.",
			"",
			"Among those who know about these secret razorback farms, rumors circulate that some of the infernal livestock have escaped and begun breeding in the Chelish wilderness. Skilled hunters have attempted to track the beasts to verify the rumors and hopefully end the threat they pose, but no evidence of razorback plagues in the wild has yet come to light. That the beasts' victims have no corpses to discover leads many to believe no evidence is to be found.",
			"",
			"### Byproducts",
			"",
			"The strange gastric peculiarities of Avernus razorbacks aside, these animals are coveted for a number of byproducts particular to the species. The blood, meat, and tusks can all be harvested for special use, as detailed below.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Blood:** The fresh blood of the Avernus razorback seems to keep some of the strange soul energies of the digested for a period of time. As long as a razorback has feasted on a sentient creature within the last month, it can be slaughtered and its blood harvested in place of a blood sacrifice of a sentient and even innocent creature, for up to 1 week after the slaughter occurs.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Tusks:** The tusks of the largest razorback can be fashioned into vicious daggers, and count as 151 gp worth of raw materials needed in the creation of a masterwork dagger. A successful DC 26 Craft (weapons) check and 1d3 days of work are required to create a masterwork dagger from such a tusk.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Meat:** Though it may seem strange given the beasts' diverse, often disgusting, and sometimes morbid eating habits, the meat of the Avernus razorback is a delicacy craved throughout Cheliax, especially in Egorian. Connoisseurs of the infernal flesh say that you can taste the hate of the beast, which adds to its delectable flavor. Not only that, the meat acts as a mild narcotic. See the rules on {rule/drugs and addiction}.",

			"Keen-witted and powerful avian predators, axe beaks compete with wolves and hunting cats for prey upon vast, open steppes and prairies. Although feared for their boldness and territorial natures, these giant birds prove eminently tamable, making useful guardians, hunters, and even steeds when kept well fed. Axe beaks are relatively social creatures, forming small groups in which both males and females hunt together. They nest in immense mounds made of sticks, branches, leaves, and whatever else they can scavenge (including the bones and equipment of previous meals), with each nest used by a large group of axe beaks. Females typically lay clutches of 1d4+1 eggs once per year, which the parents take turns keeping warm for 2 months before they hatch.",

Yet even a city of order such as Axis, open as it is to visitors from across the planes, must deal with its own internal law and order on a daily basis. The Axial monitors are tasked with preventing disturbances of order and, when crimes do occur, investigating them to bring the perpetrators to justice.",

The creature's triangular torso has three shoulders, each with two powerful arms. Two pairs of its arms are humanoid, while the third set is mismatched, with one a long, undulating tentacle and the other an articulated limb of banded iron ending in a maul-like head. Below its waist, the creature's body divides into a tripod of legs, each ending in a long foot.",
			"",
			"Axial monitors only attack those presenting a disturbance to Axis's order, whether through the commission of a crime or another civil malfeasance. They call for surrender before a fight and prefer to subdue opponents rather than slay them. Their mandate is to bring prisoners into their dispatch stations so they can be examined and interrogated, and the reasons for their disturbance identified and measured in formal reports. These reports are provided directly to the Godmind, which calculates the mathematically ideal method to counteract and prevent any such future disturbances. After incarceration and calculation, an offender is either set free or transferred to one of the city's rehabilitative prisons under escort by Axial monitors. Although they follow this same process for nearly all creatures, the Axial monitors show no mercy or leniency to proteans and always attack these embodiments of disorder with lethal force on sight.",

			"Axial monitors maintain a low profile unless in pursuit of a criminal or when investigating a crime. The city is so orderly than many visitors to Axis - and indeed, some residents - never see an Axial monitor or know they exist. Their rarity engenders several mysteries about their creation and their purpose. It is unclear whether Axial monitors are created by axiomites, are created from axiomites, or are incarnations formed by Axis itself to maintain its mathematically perfect conceptions of peace and order. Axial monitors do not seem to be a distinct species because they do not procreate or age. Axial monitors have never been observed to eat, drink, or sleep, and some speculate that their fortified dispatch stations must be where the creatures rest. The only non-monitors allowed inside these dispatch stations are criminals and rare axiomite specialists, but they are restricted to chambers near a station's arched entrance. No one, except perhaps the Godmind itself, knows precisely how many Axial monitors there are, which lends some credence to the theory that they are generated directly by the Godmind or the city itself as need dictates.",
			"",

			"Inevitables served both as the original law enforcement in the city of Axis and as its shock troops in the first war between law and chaos when the Outer Planes were young. However, as inevitables have expanded their role to enforcing the will of law across the multiverse and to combating chaos in all its incarnations, Axial monitors assumed many of the inevitables' former law-enforcement duties within the city.",
			"",
			"Axial monitors keep the peace in Axis in as harmonious a way as possible, and are never seen outside of Axis. They do not patrol the streets of the Eternal City, as peace officers in other cities do, but are dispatched directly by the Godmind. An Axial monitor's unflappable countenance and unusual appearance - bordering between bizarre and comical - is off-putting and alien to most creatures. Few creatures expect sympathy or kinship from the strange-looking Axial monitors, and it is likely that the Godmind purposely calculated their manner and appearance for precisely this effect."

The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes.

			"Though among the most capricious and mercurial of azatas, nualidus are strongly protective of natural waterways across the multiverse. They despise polluters and those who use water to cause pain and suffering, such as the captains of slave ships. This attitude remains constant, despite nualidus' tendency to make and break relationships with others in moments.",
			"",
			"These azatas are constantly on the move, rarely staying in one place for very long. Their persistent need to travel makes it difficult for nualidus to complete any but the simplest of tasks in an amount of time most mortals would find acceptable, but nualidus have long memories. An individual nualidu might return to a location hundreds of years later to finish a job they started, even if everyone else involved long ago forgot or died of old age. Nualidus also act similarly in combat, flowing between opponents and across the terrain, only to flee if they become bored. They rely heavily on their natural powers and spell-like abilities to shove foes around the battlefield.",
			"",
			"Nualidus are made recognizable by the elemental water making up much of their lithe, sylvan forms, which draw down into long, serpentine tails. This water constantly churns; no matter what kind of surface a nualidu travels across, their waters remain clean and fresh. A nualidu's hair color ranges from the sparkling blue of tropical waters to seafoam green, and matches that of their twinkling eyes. A typical nualidu stands a little over 5 feet tall and is quite slender, weighing only 130 pounds.",
			"",
			"Nualidus form from the souls of virtuous members of aquatic races, or else from the souls of moral people who spent the majority of their lives near or on water, such as kind dockworkers, sailors, and lighthouse keepers. Little remains of their mortal traits or memories upon their creation, aside from hazy memories of sunsets upon the waves and familiar ports of call, which nualidus might spend the entirety of their immortal existences trying to locate. Their bodies are clear and cool upon creation, but darken considerably with age, until their roiling forms resemble the blackest oceanic trenches.",
			"",
			"Nualidus generally spring from the waters of Elysium, in the strongest concentrations of chaotic influence, and it is no coincidence they are extremely capricious and impermanent. From their personalities to their long tails, the aquatic outsiders resemble proteans as much as they do their fellow celestials, and whispers up and down the planes claim that they are the children of some ancient god's dalliance with a protean lord. Proteans are widely varied in their relations to the curious azatas, with many considering nualidus distant kin while others see them as a mockery of proteans' ideally chaotic forms.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Azata}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"When not on Elysium, nualidus travel natural waterways and oceans, experiencing the extremes of the natural world. They tolerate manufactured canals to a much lesser extent, as such courses are often polluted by the mortals who created them. If the source of the contamination seems readily apparent, a nualidu usually attempts to rectify the problem regardless of locals' needs or wishes. In most cases, though, the issue is endemic of civilization, and no nualidu can stand to remain in one place long enough to change an entire society.",
			"",
			"A nualidu has no permanent place of residence and generally eschews shelter, preferring to rest under the stars on beaches or in underwater caves. Despite their mercurial and transient nature, these celestials are very community-oriented, forming small pods of like-minded individuals who travel together to pursue a common interest or goal. Nualidu pods fluctuate constantly as members find other interests or new members join, but when together, pods are as protective as any human family. To threaten or insult one nualidu in a group is to threaten or insult the entire pod.",
			"",
			"More so than other azatas, nualidus relish courtly titles, and often invent grandiose new ones, accumulating a long list of honorifics as time passes. Most eventually grow bored with titles they're accrued and shed them without a second thought, only to collect new ones during their next journeys. The more bombastic and flamboyant a title, the longer it holds a nualidu's interest and remains part of their name. While their epithets tend to reference their exploits and triumphs, nualidus are no strangers to exaggeration. Some particularly pretentious titles include \"the Marquis of a Thousand Waves,\" \"the Exalted Maharajah of the Unstoppable Current,\" \"the Jubilant Savior of the Laughing Stream,\" and \"the Grand Caliph of Inundations, Bane of Droughts.\" A nualidu's titles might be both masculine and feminine, as their attitudes toward gender are as fluid as their personalities.",
			"",
			"Nualidus despise anything they see as a perversion of their treasured water, especially human drinks such as coffee, tea, and alcohol. They look down on all who drink such abominations, considering them classless at best, and directly insulting at worst. Depending on the nualidu's mood, the outsider might either politely refuse such an offered libation or launch into a screed demonizing the substance and all the harm it has caused mortalkind. A particularly incensed nualidu may even go so far as to seek out the nearest brewery or winery and destroy it. This attitude rarely extends to naturally derived fluids, such as fruit juices and plant nectar.",
			"",
			"### Calling a Nualidu",
			"",
			"A nualidu can be called with lesser planar ally, although it is very difficult to call the same nualidu more than once. The azatas prefer tasks that contribute in some way to the protection or cleaning of a body of water, and generally accept payment with gems or valuable stones that have been eroded by flowing water into unique and organic shapes. They also demand at least a token amount of respect from their callers, and most nualidus require their callers to treat them politely and to memorize, if not directly use, at least a handful of their myriad titles."

			"**Burst of Restoration (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a prydanu can strengthen its aura to undo the physical tampering of others. Each creature within its aura suffering from a detrimental or unwanted transmutation effect can attempt a new saving throw against the effect. This power also works on any afflicted lycanthrope, entothrope, or similar creature, granting it a new saving throw to remove its affliction. At the GM's discretion, burst of restoration can have a special effect on creatures permanently mutated by magic, such as [fleshwarps](template/fleshwarped_creature) or [Mana Wastes mutants](template/mana_wastes_mutant). A creature undergoing this greater effect loses its unwanted acquired templates or reverts back to its original form, but it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 2 permanent negative levels as a result of the sudden and dramatic change to its physiology. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Clarity's Grace (Su)** A prydanu's aura protects those around it from mind control and all forms of deception, both magical and mundane. All allies within her aura gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities and on Sense Motive skill checks. A prydanu's aura negates illusions. This functions as {spell/globe of invulnerability}, except it can affect only spells or spell-like abilities from the illusion school and can affect spells of any spell level.",
			"",
			"**Lucid Rain (Su)** Once per week as a full-round action, a prydanu can create an area of light rain centered on her with a radius of 120 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any creature touched by the rain that is under the effects of a mind-affecting spell or effect can attempt a new saving throw to end those effects. Prydanus often use this ability during naturally occurring rainstorms on villages or cities they feel may be in trouble.",
			"",

			"Prydanus are fierce champions of Elysium who use their talents to undo the work of oppressors by revealing their deception and releasing their victims from bondage. Among the prydanus' most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.",
			"",
			"Prydanus pride themselves on being guardian figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu's ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.",
			"",
			"Radiant and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility underwater. Their striking silver eyes are framed with long, feathery lashes and match their metallic-colored nails and lips. A prydanu's hair varies from one individual to another but is usually several shades and decorated with jewels, flowers, shells, or other such adornments.",
			"",

When it comes to underwater prowess, their sleek musculature and powerful wings place them on par with naturally aquatic creatures. This aptitude is a point of pride for prydanus, who enjoy racing marine life to prove their expertise.",
			"",

			"Prydanus enjoy the company of their kin, finding particular companionship in ghaeles and yamahs. Prydanus are athletic creatures, and their fondness for swimming and flying is well documented; presenting it a gift of artwork depicting seascapes or a collection of feathers and shells is a way to get on its good side. They are also quite sentimental and keep small trinkets from places and people they've helped, often displaying these tokens in the form of small charms worn on bracelets or necklaces or woven into their colorful locks.",
			"",
			"After using their powers to free creatures from domination and forced transformation, prydanus often continue to care for them even after their liberation to ensure they're safe before continuing on their way. Though these sojourns are fleeting even by mortal standards, prydanus easily become emotionally attached to the creatures they save, and saying farewell is difficult for them. As such, most prydanus leave their companions' sides in the middle of the night, when most are sleeping, to make the parting easier.",
			"",
			"When not battling against tyranny, prydanus enjoy studying emancipated societies to view the daily life of mortals left to make their own choices. They chronicle these thoughts and observations in journals, which they then share with other celestials in Elysium."
