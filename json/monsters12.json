A creature trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean floor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe - one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.",
			"",
			"Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.",
			"",
			"Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.",
			"",
			"Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.",
			"",
			"Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them.",
			"",
			"### Infamous Deeds",
			"",
			"Primarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them worthy of their notoriety.",
			"",
			"Humanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well - a field of the creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the day of the attack, which many claim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not normally available to the gigas clams. Many of the merfolk still yearn to reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings.",
			"",
			"In the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji River delta, where they feed on the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the river's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures. The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry that the clams might organize a retributive assault.",
			"",
			"### Adventure Hooks",
			"",
			"Gigas clams tend to remain passive during the cooler months, but those who venture too close to their homes during the wrong season might run afoul of the giant mollusks.",
			"",
			"- A trio of scavenger ships recently returned from looting Azlanti ruins only to meet their fate at the hands of a gigas clam, which smashed the ships to pieces and littered their treasures all over the sea floor below. Only the captain and two sailors survived the ordeal; the captain wants to return and claim what's his, while his two crew members want to have nothing to do with the sea for a long while.",
			"- In response to sightings of a gigas clam breaching the water this past summer near Corentyn, the Chelish Navy issued notice of a substantial bounty on the strange beasts. Several folk plan to set sail to hunt the creature. One ship in particular is crewed entirely by tengus, who keep a mysterious contraption covered with oiled canvas on their ship's deck and guard it day and night."

A hideous and gigantic being of size beyond reason and composed of some of the multiverse's most powerful souls, this mythic gigas soon tore itself into pieces while struggling against its uncompromising quaternary nature.

			"Hunting below the waves secures only a precarious living, and forges don't burn underwater. To acquire worked goods and supplement their income, many Low Azlanti turn to scavenging. Shipwrecks, storm-washed flotsam, and jetsam abandoned to dodge customs officers all offer a wealth of goods now beyond the reach of their human creators and free to any aquatic creature strong and brave enough to claim them. Those gillmen who pick the bones of sunken hulks must compete with other ocean-going scavengers, from sharks and giant crabs to sahuagin. Fierce battles can erupt over new opportunities, just as surface peoples may battle over a mine or treasure-laden tomb. Truly successful scavengers often conceal or booby-trap their most lucrative discoveries, or recruit additional gillmen to help them guard a find and swiftly pick it clean. Groups of gillmen ranging in size from small gangs to large organized companies may claim especially treacherous waters and identify these jagged reefs, stormwracked passes, and monster-infested shoals with distinct markers, which canny sailors learn to use for navigation.",
			"",
			"While most ship scavengers content themselves with recovering lost treasures from past accidents or battles, a greedy few cause shipwrecks by moving buoys, extinguishing lighthouses, disseminating false charts, and sabotaging vessels. The worst are little better than pirates, prying ships apart from below the waves or setting them aflame, then slaughtering the crew as they leap into the ocean. Whether they're malign or merely opportunistic, ship scavengers are unlikely to share a wreck's treasures, even - or especially - with its air-breathing former owners."

But when the need arises, an emissary transforms into a spy, provocateur, or saboteur capable of facing incredible threats, undermining overly curious surface dwellers, and retrieving Azlanti artifacts never meant for the clumsy hands of non-Azlanti humans. Most walk a fine line, gathering agents and contacts to assist them while keeping their underlings forever ignorant of their true goals.",

With access to all manner of twisting, secluded hideaways, these gillmen can lead the overly curious into undertaking convoluted quests while the Low Azlanti accomplish their real objectives. Victims who survive the emissaries' poisons or monster attacks may look forward to a short, desperate future spent trapped in lightless sea caves unseen by landwalkers' eyes for 10,000 years."

They claim to be the sacred children of a vile foreign god of fermentation, though Qadiran tales describe them as bandits and vagabonds cursed for their gluttony. Given that ginevers are both argumentative and prone to exaggeration, the truth of their origins is likely lost to history.",

			"Their near-human appearance allows ginevers to blend into society, avoiding notice so long as they control their appetites and avoid scrutiny. With this natural camouflage, they may have dwelled in city shadows for far longer than is known, only emerging in greater numbers as Taldor declines. While a ginever's gaze can transform even water into some form of alcohol, the magically created spirits are of low, burning quality, and so what little coin the ginever collects is quickly spent on high-quality ales, liquors, and wines."

			"Girallons are among the jungle's most dangerous predators. They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four muscular arms are capable of inflicting incredible damage on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary girallons are usually young males looking to start their own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack intruders without warning, including strangers of their own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring around their target and suddenly close in.",
			"",
			"While most girallons are little more than beasts, ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes hint that the girallon wasn't always the stupid creature it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. With each generation, these first girallons grew more and more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest part of the jungle. In addition to their intellects, these girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called \"high girallons,\" these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent girallon generally speaks whatever language the local humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange ruined cities in the jungle or mountains, and conduct raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends of four-armed \"high girallons,\""

			"Sometimes referred to as \"lore roaches\" by scholars familiar with the Outer Planes, gishvits are natural inhabitants of the lawful plane of Axis. Often associated with the native axiomites and scrivenites, gishvits occupy a mundane role on Axis, maintaining vast stores of knowledge within their booklike bodies. Transcribing knowledge from living creatures, a gishvit stores information in its body in the form of written text, preserving the acquired knowledge within itself. Because of this unique method of information gathering, gishvits are treasured by information brokers and spellcasters on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"A gishvit varies between 1 to 2 feet in length, often weighing no more than 8 pounds.",
			"",
			"The booklike body of a gishvit is indicative of its ultimate purpose: the consumption and storage of knowledge. For as long as the ordered realm of Axis has existed, gishvits have clambered throughout its seemingly endless streets and meandered within its many archives of knowledge. Some scholars believe that these creatures first emerged from the quintessence of Axis as companions to axiomites and {monster/scrivenite/s}. While axiomites tend to ignore the pesky little creatures, scrivenites associate with the booklike outsiders, sometimes even treating them like pets more than pests.",
			"",
			"A gishvit has a set of razor-sharp teeth that emerge from the edges of its cover page and back page, though it lacks the strength to use them with great effectiveness. These teeth are visible only when the outsider opens its mouth. A set of similarly sharp insectile limbs emerge from within the gishvit's body, acting as legs that can be retracted at a whim to act as embellishments for the gishvit's spine. A whipping, silken bookmark tongue that issues from between the pages of its body completes the gishvit's odd anatomy.",
			"",
			"A gishvit absorbs knowledge from its surroundings and from individuals who wish to store their memories and experiences within the creature's pages. Once the small outsider has consumed a sufficient amount of knowledge, it darts off to digest the information. This digestion takes place over several hours, during which the gishvit's interior pages fill with the stored lore.",
			"",
			"Gishvits understand all spoken languages thanks to their truespeech ability, though they lack vocal cords and the ability to speak. Only creatures capable of telepathic communication can engage a gishvit in conversation, and even then, such conversations are generally dominated by the gishvit's ravenous desire for new information or its hope to hibernate and mull over the stored information after filling its pages with stores of memories and experiences. Despite having considerable insight into numerous topics, even without ingesting any knowledge from other creatures, a gishvit finds little joy in relating such information through conversation. Negotiators find conversations with gishvits incredibly difficult, and though gishvits rarely have the chance to converse with other beings, they still find most conversations a detraction from their endless urge to transcribe knowledge.",
			"",
			"In addition to being able to collect a wealth of information into their small forms, gishvits are known for their knack for transcribing accurate information. Since they interact directly with subjects' experiences and memories, they have the ability to cut through bias and misremembered experiences. This makes the information stored within a gishvit valuable to court proceedings and other instances where the truth is more important than a potentially flawed statement.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most inhabitants of Axis are powerful enough to pay gishvits little more heed than a creature from the Material Plane would associate with most common vermin. Despite the creatures' lowly status, several factions on the lawful plane employ gishvits as negotiation tools or unintentional spies. In these roles, the little gishvits excel, as they are able to extract knowledge from negotiators and put it to paper or collect valuable and accurate information from stationed guards. Still, many creatures on Axis have far more reliable means of extracting information, so they instead relegate gishvits to a pitiable status as planar vermin. It is not uncommon for an eager gishvit to pester a creature enjoying a meal inside one of Axis's many restaurants to spend time with it in hopes of adding lore to its pages, or for a patron of the plane's many archives to find herself accosted by a whipping bookmark tongue when she picks it up by accident while the creature was resting on a shelf.",
			"",
			"On both Axis and the Material Plane, a satiated gishvit quickly enters a state of gradual torpor, followed by a period of hibernation. Such gishvits often seek to rest in large archives or repositories, hiding among hundreds or thousands of similar-looking mundane books. They then wait for centuries at a time, content to rest with the knowledge they have digested. After several centuries, a gishvit willingly discards its digested knowledge. It is then instinctually compelled to repeat the process of acquiring and digesting new information. Sadly for the gishvit, it often finds itself trapped in a now-long forgotten archive, unable to escape. In these unfortunate circumstances, the next creatures to enter the gishvit's sealed-off home are immediately assaulted by the knowledge-ravenous creatures.",

			"",
			"Unlike their more aggressive cousins, the carnivorous geodes known as glimmerhollows rely entirely on the enticement of rich mineral deposits to attract prey. They still leach minerals from the earth around them for food, but they use some of those minerals to grow wondrous crystal formations. Creatures that lust after such treasures, either for wealth or for food, find that the glimmerhollow relishes the minerals in their bodies above all else.",

Like carnivorous crystals, they originated on the Plane of Earth, but even in those endless tunnels, glimmerhollows are fairly uncommon. Of course, it is precisely because they are not well known that glimmerhollows manage to survive.",
			"",
			"A glimmerhollow hunts by moving into a small cavern or similar space and spreading itself over the chamber's interior, covering the walls, floor, and ceiling, while leaving an opening for prey to enter. If no natural cave of sufficient size is available, the glimmerhollow wedges itself into a crack or fissure, spending a day or more to slowly burrow and consume enough earth and rock to create a niche for itself. Once inside, it uses consumed minerals to grow a layer of crystals on its inner surface.",
			"",
			"These crystals are spectacular to behold. The formations can be heavy and impressive or thin and delicate. They may be squat clusters or sharp spikes. Whatever form they take, the crystals create the false image of a massive geode, filled with some of the purest, most exquisite specimens ever seen. Some of the crystals even possess an inherent luminosity, causing the whole space to glint and sparkle. The glimmerhollow can use this luminosity to generate a hypnotic effect that draws in victims.",
			"",
			"Like other oozes, glimmerhollows can produce pseudopods to defend themselves, often using them to drag victims that resist the other lures into their central cavities. Glimmerhollows prefer, however, to let greed, hunger, or their hypnotic power bring in targets. Once the prey is inside, an ooze quickly snaps the trap shut. The crystals that once promised treasure now serve as lacerating gizzard stones. Victims are macerated and mixed with acidic digestive fluids to break them down into their constituent mineral elements, which the glimmerhollow absorbs. The process usually kills the prey quickly, either through injury or suffocation, but digestion can take several days, depending on the size of the creature's meal.",
			"",
			"On the Plane of Earth, glimmerhollows prey on the plane's native creatures that eat rocks and gems. In general, this means crysmals and xorns, though they demonstrate a preference for xorns. If a crysmal is inside a glimmerhollow and a xorn is nearby, the ooze will wait long enough for the crysmal to escape, hoping to fool the xorn into thinking its chamber is a safe place to gather food. On the Material Plane, glimmerhollows rarely encounter xorns, but they have developed a taste for living creatures, whose bodies contain several delectable minerals as well as carbon, which it can also convert into crystalline materials.",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows reproduce by a form of mitosis. Given time and enough food, mature glimmerhollows grow to about one and a half times their adult size. Then the ooze splits, forming two identical creatures that slither into the darkness to feed on rock and mineral deposits until they are big enough to make geode traps of their own.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows are solitary creatures and have no discernible culture or society. Their method of feeding requires them to stay far apart from one another unless food is abundant. Generally, if two glimmerhollows encounter one another, they will fight until one kills or drives out the other.",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows relocate when an area has been exhausted of prey. Over time, they may come across well-traveled paths. They instinctively avoid areas that are too busy, instead keeping to hidden paths and niches nearby. This allows them to capture the occasional curious, unwary traveler without drawing too much attention to themselves.",
			"",
			"### Treasure",
			"",
			"Although the crystal formations inside a glimmerhollow's trap serve the creatures as lures, many of them do have great monetary value. After slaying a glimmerhollow, characters can harvest a small trove of precious and semiprecious gems and crystals. These are mainly grade 3, 4, or 5 crystals, but at least one gem will be a greater precious gem (grade 6) worth at least 3,500 gold pieces.)",
			"",
			"In perhaps one or two out of a hundred cases, a glimmerhollow's strange anatomy produces an extremely rare crystal, like a blue garnet, red emerald, or brilliant green diamond. Such a specimen could be worth more than 10,000 gold pieces simply for its rarity, but these gems are also prized by alchemists who can use them in elixirs, potions, tinctures, or even wondrous items. In Sothis, Atet-Anath (N female human alchemist 9) is adept at using powdered gemstones to enhance her potions, and claims some of her most spectacular results came from gems harvested from a glimmerhollow. Rumors circulate that she is seeking a way to capture and contain a glimmerhollow so she can study it and determine how to influence the crystals it produces."

A gloomwing loose on the Material Plane is active for 2 to 3 hours at dawn and again for 2 to 3 hours at dusk, preferring to spend the remaining hours of the day hiding in abandoned buildings, caves, or deep canyons or foliage where the shadows are thickest. During its periods of activity, it flies through the sky on the hunt for creatures to attack and implant its eggs in - the gloomwing does not need to eat, leaving this urge to propagate its species as its primary drive.",

The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad wizard's experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anticivilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker genesis. These botanists theorize that gluttongrass is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of gluttongrass have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by famine and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified growing seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly famine and starvation are not requirements for this plant's growth.",
			"",
			"Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless plant, gluttongrass is far from harmless. Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of gluttongrass have been known to extend their roots toward one another, merging and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest gluttongrass fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years.",
			"",
			"### Gluttongrass Field",
			"",
			"The thing that makes gluttongrass so dangerous when encountered as a field is the simple fact that the plants merge and link their root systems once enough of the plant monsters take root in close proximity. If at least 12 gluttongrasses take root in a single contiguous area, their roots begin to commingle. As long as the gluttongrasses do not move from their locations for at least 24 hours, this process completes and the carnivorous plants merge into a gluttongrass field.",
			"",
			"Once a gluttongrass field has formed, all of the individual gluttongrasses pool their hit points into one shared pool-thus, a patch of 12 gluttongrasses (the minimum required to make a field) has a total of 108 hit points. No single gluttongrass in the field dies until all of these pooled hit points are depleted, but a gluttongrass field forever loses its mobility and cannot uproot. Any area effect that deals damage to multiple gluttongrasses within a gluttongrass field treats the field as a single creature for the purpose of determining points of damage dealt to the field as a whole."

			"The slyest and largest female gnolls sanctified by the chosen of Lamashtu are paired with the most savage males, and a little more than half the time, the resulting litter includes at least one flind. The flind pup is often female. A breeding female flind produces only flinds, though flinds' litters tend to be smaller than those of normal gnolls. Male flinds who breed with female gnolls produce a litter with a flind about three quarters of the time. More capable of focus, cunning, and planning than gnolls, flinds are typically found in leadership roles within gnoll bands and tribes, and frequently lead hunting parties. Like gnolls, flinds use ambush tactics and often make slaves of surviving foes, yet a flind is more likely to go on the offensive when the odds are closer to even. Flinds still prefer the advantage of attacking in numbers - they just don't need the advantage to be overwhelming. In addition to using intimidation against enemies, flinds embrace flanking tactics and specialized uses of their unusual weapon, the flindbar.",
			"",
			"Flinds assign gnolls lower in the pack hierarchy the task of crafting {eq-weapon/flindbar/s}. Flinds are very particular about these weapons, and a gnoll who fails to properly weight and polish a flindbar can expect a savage mauling from the flind who demanded the weapon.",
			"",
			"A flind is roughly 7 feet tall and weighs between 280 and 315 pounds. Flinds have brindled or spotted fur, and are primarily russet in color with patches of black."

The gnoph-keh can place the center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold aura. Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else.

The creature prefers to travel on all six when using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the gnophkeh's ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its ability to move and see in such conditions without any disadvantage, the creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells."

It's said the frog-talkers bathe in mud and leeches every fortnight to renew their dedication to their patron, the god of filth and blood - and based on their pale complexions and emaciated frames, few doubt it. These mysterious witches often live alone, or surround themselves with acolytes and terrified goblin minions given to them by superstitious chieftains.",

Others claim that they're indeed goblins, but controlled by hideous brain-leeches that have wriggled into their ears. And still others say that worshiping the filth god is scary enough on its own.",
			"",
			"Regardless of what their origins may be, frog-talkers are powerful spellcasters who vomit up swarms of swamp creatures to do their bidding and fry disobedient minions with sizzling lightning. The only mortal creatures a frogtalker seems to truly respect are (naturally) frogs, and most keep a frog or toad on their person at all times. But the most worrying aspect of frog-talkers is that they don't appear to feel fear - an otherwise omnipresent aspect of goblin life."

			"**Hibernate (Ex)** Although it can live in extreme conditions, a goezspall still requires food and water. To survive when sustenance is not available, a goezspall can enter a state of hibernation at will; doing so takes 1 minute. While in this state, it can take no actions and is effectively helpless, as if it were in a deep sleep. A goezspall can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes-while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for the creature. If a goezspall is jostled or damaged while hibernating, it can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 24 hours to awaken from hibernation. A goezspall can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, a goezspall needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.",

This bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

From the frozen north to the depths of the deepest caverns, these bizarre, segmented creatures thrive in any environment, including the depths of the sea, boiling hot springs, and even, some claim, the void of space. Though not typically hostile, these omnivores hunt aggressively when hungry, especially after months or years in hibernation. A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some lore describes smaller and larger specimens."

			"The goldpebble is a stony-scaled water snake that came into existence thanks to a greedy Taldan alchemist of a forgotten time. This ambitious experimenter attempted to create a fecund creature whose body would turn to gold after it died, ensuring an endless supply of wealth with little effort. She found a water snake that bred in shallow pools and produced dozens of offspring, and its biology responded well to her initial tests. The original snake's scales contained trace amounts of minerals and served as a clever camouflage in the wild, and the alchemist combined magical techniques with selective breeding to coax the species' scales into naturally producing nuggets of gold.",
			"",
			"At first, the experiment seemed to be going well; early generations demonstrated traces of gold in their scales, and as they sloughed away their skin with age, the cast-off scales contained enough gold to justify the alchemist's efforts. However, the snakes grew in size with each generation, and soon the breeding pools the alchemist had created could not contain them. Worse, the amount of gold each snake produced didn't increase, but rather seemed to decrease until only glittering flakes remained.",
			"",
			"Frustrated, the alchemist redoubled her efforts and saturated the breeding pools with transmutative alchemical reagents, mercilessly culling any snakes that failed to produce new growth. While this did little to increase the mineral content of the creatures' scales, it did invest them with a supernatural venom that causes victims' blood to slowly turn to water. When the overzealous alchemist next came to harvest her treasured pets, the goldpebbles struck, killing her and escaping into a nearby stream; they can now be found all across the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"A fully grown goldpebble is about 12 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Goldpebbles are solitary creatures, except for when they gather during the twice-annual breeding frenzy for which the alchemist selected the original species as a test subject. They often lurk in rivers and streams, mimicking the smooth river stones along the bed and waiting for some unlucky wanderer to notice the shimmering traces of gold in their skin. Once the target is near, the creature ambushes the unsuspecting victim, sinking its narrow teeth into the target's skin and attempting to drag its target below the water. In addition, most goldpebbles have the unusual and instinctive ability to cause the water around them to grow extremely cold, making it harder for a surprised victim to hold its breath. Weaker prey will often succumb to this attack, drowning and settling to the river floor to serve as dinner for the goldpebble. However, even if the victim of the goldpebble's bite manages to escape, it's not yet out of danger. Hours after the attack, the victim's blood begins to transmute into frigid water. Symptoms of this transformation vary, though they often resemble anemia or frostbite, as vital nutrients and oxygen have trouble reaching their destination and the victim's body temperature plummets from the inside outward. If condition is left untreated, the frigid water bleed into the victim's lungs, causing it to drown.",
			"",
			"During the breeding season, goldpebbles are even more dangerous than usual. Gathering in shallow pools and lakes, they turn the water into a glimmering froth, laying and fertilizing eggs in the cold mud of the riverbed before returning to their usual streams. When the eggs hatch, hundreds of tiny snakes slither in every direction in search of territory. With little control over their ability to cool surrounding waters, the young goldpebbles sometimes unintentionally flash-freeze their nursery pool in this initial burst of activity. The tiny offspring that survive find their way into streams, wells, and even irrigation systems, sometimes striking at innocent passersby. Despite the juvenile snakes' diminutive size, the result for their victims is always the same: they end up gasping for breath on dry land, their skin turning chill and blue while their horrified loved ones look on.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Even though they are solitary ambush hunters, goldpebbles don't exist in an ecological vacuum. Several different creatures have adapted to the presence of goldpebbles, and the snakes have also learned to take advantage of the creatures that share their habitats.",
			"",
			"In the mineral-rich waters of caves or the runoff from mining operations, a goldpebble sometimes deliberately nests upstream of a basidirond, a plant creature that causes powerful hallucinations that can enhance the goldpebble's glimmering scales in the eyes of its potential prey. Once the goldpebble has made its kill, the victim's blood flows into the basidirond's roots. Of course, if this blood is mingled with the goldpebble's transmutative venom, it can lead to an unfortunate end for the basidirond. Another creature that benefits from proximity to the goldpebble is the giant dragonfly. These carnivorous insects take advantage of the water snake's ambush tactics, seeking out lurking goldpebbles and laying their eggs in the nearby shallows. When the giant dragonfly nymphs hatch, they swarm around the goldpebble, instinctively attempting to eat it but unable to break through its stony skin. When the goldpebble brings down a victim, though, the nymphs are often able to devour most of the kill before the goldpebble's transmutative poison can do its work. Goldpebbles in this situation have to be more aggressive in their hunting, since the nymphs consume a majority of their kills, and these goldpebbles tend to develop more brilliantly colored scales that better attract victims.",
			"",
			"### Gempebbles",
			"",
			"One of the side effects of its rapid breeding cycle is the goldpebble's ability to adapt to its environment. The alchemist's original manipulations of the goldpebble's mineral-laced scales have changed slowly over time in some subpopulations of the snake, meaning that some goldpebbles have scales that, instead of being struck through with streaks of gold, glitter like gems or other precious stones. There are clans of dwarves who attempt to capitalize on this adaptiveness despite the creature's dangerous poison. They harvest young goldpebbles and then pour them into crevices in deep caves, in locations where they suspect veins of precious gems exist but are too difficult or dangerous to mine effectively. When the surviving snakes are fully grown, they return to the more spacious caves of the mine as gempebbles, ready to be harvested - and just as likely as their gold-streaked cousins to attack their dwarven stewards."

In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it slowly grows to its normal size between transformations.

If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender. The hammer storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they are normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral).

			"Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals or communities.",
			"",
			"The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its \"empty\" state only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the herald.",
			"",
			"As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the company of other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its sense of \"taste\" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability.",
			"",
			"Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity, the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and more embarrassing over the centuries."

			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Grasslings are sneaky, inquisitive fey creatures that populate wild grasslands. Resembling a crude, four-armed doll made of long blades of green grass, a grassling's body contains virtually no flesh or muscle: just fresh, tough grass. Despite their fibrous construction, grasslings are made up of magic and whimsy as much as they are of vegetation; they are fey creatures, not plants.",
			"",
			"Each of a grassling's four arms ends in a hand with grass blades that protrude like claws. These claws are supernaturally sharp and can slice flesh with ease, although grasslings prefer stealth and deception to direct combat. Their excellent reflexes allow them to twist away from danger with great agility and reach hiding spots before an observer can blink. Grasslings are capricious and delight in playing pranks - which range from harmless to mean spirited - upon larger creatures.",
			"",
			"A typical grassling stands about 3 feet tall and weighs 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Grasslings roam freely across the plains they call home, keeping out of sight of larger creatures and exploring as their whimsy strikes them. Grasslings value their freedom and mobility above all else and hate having their travels blocked or their lands curtailed.",
			"",
			"Formed from small seeds sprouted by a mature grassling parent, young grasslings are carefully planted in areas with plenty of sun and wind. A grassling's parent monitors the region closely to protect the immature grassling from predators or natural dangers. A grassling must grow for one full spring and summer - a period called \"rooting\" - before it can step out of the soil and walk on its own, and young grasslings frequently perish if uprooted early. Hence, a grassling's parent will uproot and transplant its young in only the most dire of situations. A grassling parent considers these few months of tending its immobile young to be both boring and confining, and it abandons the new grassling almost immediately once its ward can move on its own.",
			"",
			"Grasslings primarily subsist on small insects, which they skewer on their long claws and munch on at their leisure. When food is scarce, a grassling can bury its feet in the earth and draw sustenance from the soil, as when it was young, but this method of eating makes grasslings sluggish and cross.",
			"",
			"Although their bodies don't provide sustenance for carnivores, grasslings are particularly appealing to many herbivores. Drawn by the small fey's nutritious scent, herbivores are likely to attempt to nibble at any grassling that ventures within reach, and it doesn't take a grassling long to realize the dangers such creatures pose.",
			"",
			"Grasslings avoid direct confrontation with non-fey unless surprised or cornered. If a grassling expects trouble, it prefers to set simple traps or confound its opponents with trickery. Grasslings don't particularly care whether these tricks harm or even kill their opponents, so a blundering foe might stumble into a patch of poisonous thorns or pursue a grassling into the hunting ground of a vicious predator. Grasslings are good at tying knots quickly, particularly in vegetation, so tripwires and snares are common grassling traps.",
			"",
			"Grasslings can live to be many centuries old, but they are susceptible to blights that afflict mundane grasses. Older grasslings begin to yellow along their stems and lose their ability to deal bleed damage; eventually, their claws weaken and become so flimsy that the grassling cannot feed itself. With no other option, these elderly grasslings plant themselves in the ground and await death.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Grasslings live in wild plains and rarely travel into other terrains. They sometimes venture into farms, pastures, or other civilized open spaces near settlements, but such visits are usually short. Grasslings are uncomfortable with the ordered design and straight rows that appeal to civilized humanoids. Furthermore, pastures are occupied by large herbivores such as cows, horses, or sheep - creatures that make grasslings nervous - and fields sometimes contain scarecrows, which grasslings see as abominable totems attempting to mimic the grassling form. Yet, despite their misgivings, grasslings can't seem to avoid occasional trips into settled lands. Driven by their relentless curiosity, grasslings want to know who would contort nature in such ways and what pranks or trouble would most vex such creatures. This curiosity extends to constructed mechanisms. While unfamiliar with the purpose of most mechanical devices, grasslings are good at taking them apart or rigging them to fail in catastrophic ways. This is more often due to mere inquisitiveness rather than a surfeit of maliciousness, although some grasslings become deliberate saboteurs when presented with the opportunity.",
			"",
			"Grasslings enjoy the company of other fey and are sociable among their own kind. When they congregate together in groups, called tufts, they attempt to outdo each other with boasts and dares; invariably, these dares lead to reckless behaviors as the grasslings attempt to prove themselves braver, tougher, or more daring than their kin. As a result, permanent grassling communities are rare. With the exception of the minimal sentiment that connects a grassling parent to its child during rooting, grasslings aren't particularly attached to each other, and a grassling is likely to leave others to their fates if serious danger arises.",
			"",
			"Humanoids are fixated with taming the unusual and dangerous environments that grasslings call home; as a result, grassling friendships with humanoids are rare. The most significant exceptions are druids, elves, and other folk who inhabit natural environments peacefully; grasslings find more commonality with such creatures and might even befriend them. These companions frequently learn - often through necessity - that keeping a grassling occupied with a puzzle box or a mechanical toy prevents it from getting bored and wandering into danger or casually disassembling vital equipment.",
			"",
			"Most grasslings have a keen fascination with fire. Tales regarding the capricious creatures are relatively rare because grasslings are so few in number, but the fairy stories about them that circulate among humanoids nearly always end with a grassling becoming entranced by fire, approaching it too closely, and burning up. While these stories aren't true-grasslings are too green to be particularly flammable and too clever to accidentally immolate themselves-grasslings do indeed enjoy watching the chaotic dance of open flames and aren't above creeping near a traveler's campfire or setting something ablaze just to watch the flames. Older grasslings know how quickly a brushfire can sweep across the wild plains they call home, however, and aren't prone to starting fires that could damage their territory (although damaging someone else's is less of a concern)."

In spite of the differences in their experiences, those who have encountered grays universally find their presence alien, condescending, and sinister. Grays' movements and expressions are disturbing and inhuman, and their intentions remain inscrutable. Through telepathic contact with the beings, their victims detect a constant, unwavering malevolence. Beyond that, the grays' faces and full, black eyes show little emotion. Their movements are efficient, and they frequently spend several seconds in deliberation before each move they make. They seem to communicate with their own kind using only telepathy, forgoing even body language or eye contact."

			"Standing over 9 feet tall and weighing in excess of 4,000 pounds, a gray render is a solitary and savage predator. Renders are gifted with immense strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding within. Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely.",
			"",
			"Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamp. The render acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they attack it. Most animal \"pets\" grow to accept its presence, and primitive humanoid \"pets\" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the gods. A render's bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years, after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites.",
			"",
			"Renders are generally not malicious, and only attack if hungry or if they or their pets are threatened. A render protecting its pets fights to the death."

			"**Absorb Magic (Ex)** When a green man strikes a creature with his slam attack, he immediately attempts to absorb one magical effect from the target. Treat this as a targeted dispel magic (CL 20th), with the green man preferring to target effects that prevent his vines' grapple attempts, like freedom of movement. When the green man absorbs magic in this way, he regains a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell effect he absorbed.",
			"",
			"**Deific (Su)** A green man grants divine spells to worshipers. This does not require any specific action on the green man's behalf. The domains granted by a green man vary according to the green man's alignment. Most green men are neutral and grant access to the domains of Plant, Protection, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. A neutral good green man grants access to the domains of Good, Plant, Protection, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Purity, and Seasons. A neutral evil green man grants access to the domains of Evil, Plant, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Decay, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. Regardless of his alignment, a green man's favored weapon is the sickle. If a druid worshiping a green man chooses to take a domain, the druid must choose the Plant domain, regardless of alignment. The green man's holy symbol is that of a masculine face made of leaves, but the exact expression and appearance of the face varies by green man, and each is unique in detail.",
			"",
			"**Green Caress (Su)** Non-plant living creatures within 60 feet of a green man slowly begin to transform into non-magical plants. Treat this effect as the spell {spell/green caress}, save that the green man need not touch a creature to begin the effect. A creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save against this effect once upon first entering the aura. If successful, that creature partially resists the effect as per the spell description and is immune to that particular green man's aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the effect persists until the creature transforms or the effect is removed (unlike with the spell, it is not limited to a maximum duration of 7 days). Also unlike the spell, this effect is not contagious, and a spellcaster who attempts to stop this green caress via break enchantment, miracle, polymorph any object, remove curse, or wish does not risk becoming targeted by the effect. This aura, being supernatural in nature and not a spell or spell-like ability, cannot be stopped via dispel magic. A green man can select creatures to be unaffected by his aura as an immediate action, but he must be aware of them to grant such clemency, and he cannot reverse the effects of the aura once inflicted. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Green Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that the green man can only use this ability on plant creatures. A green man's green empathy check bonus is equal to his HD plus his Charisma modifier (+43 for the typical green man).",
			"",
			"**Summon Plants (Sp)** Three times per day as a swift action, a green man can summon any combination of plant creatures whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the {umr/summon} universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.",
			"",
			"**Thorns (Su)** A green man's thorns are ranged touch attacks with a range increment of 120 feet. A creature damaged by a green man's thorn moves at half speed and can't take 5-foot steps, fly, or use air walk, either naturally or magically, until the target or another creature pulls out the thorn as a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Vines (Ex)** A green man can extend up to six thorny vines from his body to attack foes. These act as primary natural melee attacks that deal bludgeoning and piercing damage and have a reach of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Wilderness Insight (Ex)** When in a natural area with foliage present, the plants whisper to the green man and grant him an insight bonus to his AC equal to his Wisdom bonus. This bonus is included in the statistics above, but it is lost in areas where plant life is not present in large quantities (typically the case for desert, underground, or urban locales).",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Ancient beyond measure, the legendary green men are avatars and guardians of the primeval forest. Green men are the naturally occurring apotheosis of such woodland terrains. Most care little for other aspects of nature, from animals to geology, focusing exclusively on the flora of their home forest and the seasonal impact of weather. They grant spells enthusiastically to intelligent plants that worship them and somewhat more hesitantly to other sentient races who prove themselves friends of plants. Sometimes called \"leshy kings\" in esoteric texts, the enigmatic green men are said to be the ones who first taught druids the secrets of creating leshies, yet they themselves are far more powerful than these tiny creations.",
			"",
			"Most green men keep out of the way of the \"animal races\" as long as they leave the forest alone, while the rare benevolent and malevolent green men actively spread their influence over their home forests. Benevolent green men are kindly and nurturing patriarchs to all within their domain, even non-plants. Their territories are blessed with beautiful flowers and peaceful groves. Malevolent green men are twisted and sadistic bullies, and are fortunately the rarest of these paragons of plant life. Their territories are marred with poisonous plants, thorny vines, and twisted trees. What few animals remain in such regions are either vicious enough to stand up to their plant tormentors or are allowed to remain to provide sport."
