			"For most practitioners of the arcane arts, learning magic requires a great deal of study and practice. Even for those who draw magic from their blood, the effort can be taxing. Not so for the archmage. This master of the arcane draws power from the very fabric of reality itself, learning to weave magic easily and naturally.",
			"",
			"The archmage is the master of arcane magic, and many of the abilities of this path enhance your ability to cast arcane spells or greatly increase their potency. In addition, may of the options in this path increase your knowledge of magic and of those who wield it. At the highest tiers, you can begin to break down the walls between the different types of magic and alter the very fabric of reality itself.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As an archmage, you use your abilities to add a great deal of power to your arcane spells, enabling them to blast through defenses and cripple foes. Your mastery over the arcane arts and your vast knowledge are of great benefit to the rest of your group, and your talent at getting the most out of magic items can prove invaluable. Although you gain little in the way of defenses, your overwhelming offensive capabilities more than make up for it - though you should still avoid being engaged in melee.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** The archmage is the most common path selection for characters capable of casting arcane spells, particularly sorcerers and wizards. Bards, summoners, and witches will find that this path has a great deal to offer, though some other paths might also prove useful to them.",
			"",
			"***Bonus Hit Points:*** Whenever you gain an archmage tier, you gain 3 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.",
			"",
			"### Path Features",
			"",
			"As you gain new tiers, you gain the following abilities.",
			"",
			"***Archmage Arcana:*** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			">*Arcane Surge (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot. If you prepare spells, this spell must be one you prepared today (even if you have already cast it); if you're a spontaneous caster, this spell must be one of your spells known. If the spell requires a saving throw, any non-mythic creatures affected by the spell roll twice and take the lower result. If you must attempt a caster level check for the spell to overcome a creature's spell resistance, you can roll your caster level check twice (adding your tier to each) and take the higher result. You can't add a metamagic feat to a spell you cast using this ability.",
			">",
			">*Mage Strike (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee attack. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. If you expend one arcane spell that you've prepared or arcane spell slot that you have available, you gain a bonus on the attack roll equal to double the spell's or slot's level, and the attack deals an additional 2d6 points of energy damage (your choice of acid, cold, electricity, or fire) per level of the spell or slot expended. The normal damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction, but the energy damage is still affected by resistances and immunities.",
			">",
			">*Wild Arcana (Su):* As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast any one arcane spell without expending a prepared spell or spell slot. The spell must be on one of your arcane class spell lists, must be of a level that you can cast with that arcane spellcasting class, and must have a casting time of \"1 standard action\" (or less). You don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known. When casting a spell in this way, you treat your caster level as 2 levels higher for the purpose of any effect dependent on level. You can apply any metamagic feats you know to this spell, but its total adjusted level can't be greater than that of the highest-level arcane spell you can cast from that spellcasting class.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the archmage path abilities lists or from the universal path abilities lists. Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select those abilities.",
			"",
			"***True Archmage (Ex):*** At 10th tier, whenever you cast an arcane spell that targets one or more non-mythic creatures, each of those creatures must roll any saving throws against the spell twice and take the lower result. You gain spell resistance equal to 15 + your highest arcane caster level, but only against arcane spells. Once per round when your spell resistance protects you from a spell cast by an enemy mythic creature, you regain one use of mythic power."

			"You can select these path abilities at any tier.",
			"",
			"***Abundant Casting (Ex):*** Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as \"one creature/level\" or \"one or more creatures\"), add your tier to the number of targets the spell can affect. For example, a 5th-level wizard/1st-tier archmage can target up to six creatures when casting haste (five from caster level 5th and one from 1st tier). Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a spell that affects only one target (such as \"one creature\") to have the spell affect an additional target. If the spell requires you to succeed at a melee touch attack, you must [hold the charge](rule/duration) in order to make a second touch attack.",
			"",
			"***Arcane Endurance (Ex):*** Treat your caster level as 4 higher when determining the duration of spells you cast. This doesn't alter any other variable effects of the spell.",
			"",
			"***Bloodline Intensity (Su):*** Your mythic power intensifies your sorcerer bloodline. Select an additional bloodline feat from your bloodline's list of feats. You must meet the prerequisites for that feat. You can also cast each of your bloodline spells once per day without them counting toward the number of spells you can cast per day. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Competent Caster (Ex):*** You automatically succeed at concentration checks to cast arcane spells. This ability doesn't apply to spells of the highest spell level you can cast. ",
			"",
			"***Coupled Arcana (Ex):*** Whenever you spend a standard action, move action, or swift action to activate an arcane school power, bardic performance, bloodline power, hex, or magus arcana, you can also activate an ability that uses mythic power as a free action. The mythic ability you activate must require the same action type as the other ability you activated or faster (a swift action is faster than a move action, and a move action is faster than a standard action). ",
			"",
			"***Coupled Phenomena (Su):*** Whenever you spend a standard action, move action, or swift action to implant a mesmerist trick (including masterful tricks), or use a discipline power, focus power, spirit power, touch treatment, or utility wild talent, as a free action you can also activate an ability that uses mythic power. The mythic ability you activate must require the same action type as the other ability you activated or a faster one (a swift action is faster than a move action, and a move action is faster than a standard action).",
			"",
			"***Crafting Mastery (Ex):*** You can craft any magic item as if you had the necessary item creation feats. If you actually have the item creation feat needed for a magic item you're crafting, whenever you attempt a skill check to create that item, roll twice and use the higher result, and you make twice as much progress on the item for any time spent. This ability does not reduce the item's cost or any other requirements. ",
			"",
			"***Deep Understanding (Ex):*** You automatically identify any arcane spell cast within 60 feet of you if it's on your class's spell list and you're of a high enough level to cast it. Whenever you attempt to identify a non-artifact magic item using detect magic, you automatically learn its properties and command words in the first round of the spell (no Spellcraft roll needed), but you can't automatically determine whether it's cursed. ",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Breach (Su):*** You are adept at breaching magical defenses and overcoming resistance to your magic. When attempting a caster level check to dispel an effect, overcome spell resistance, or otherwise determine whether your magic affects a target (such as with knock or neutralize poison), roll twice and take the higher result. ",
			"",
			"***Elemental Bond (Su):*** You are connected to one of the elemental planes. Select one elemental plane: air, earth, fire, or water. Whenever you cast a spell with a descriptor matching that plane, add your tier to your caster level for that spell. You gain resistance 10 against an energy type associated with your chosen plane - electricity for air, acid for earth, fire for fire, and cold for water. At 6th tier, this resistance increases to 20. At 9th tier, this resistance increases to 30. ",
			"",
			"***Enduring Armor (Su):*** You are protected by armor made of force. This armor grants you an armor bonus to AC equal to 3 + your tier. This ability is an abjuration effect with a spell level equal to your tier. If this armor is dispelled or otherwise ended, you can reactivate it as a swift action. ",
			"",
			"***Energy Conversion (Su):*** Whenever you cast a spell with the acid, cold, electricity, or fire descriptor, you can expend one use of mythic power to switch the energy type to a different one of those energy types. If the spell normally has its original energy type as a descriptor, it loses that descriptor and gains the new type as a descriptor. All other effects of the spell remain unchanged. ",
			"",
			"***Enhance Magic Items (Ex):*** Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges. ",
			"",
			"***Expanded Implement Knowledge (Su):*** Choose a single implement school you have access to. For each spell level that you can cast, you add one additional spell from that school of magic to your list of spells known. Additionally, by expending one use of mythic power as a swift action, you can add 2 points of mental focus to a single implement associated with the chosen implement school. These points of mental focus are created from the expended mythic energy and do not come from your daily allotment of mental focus. You must be touching the implement in which the mental focus will be invested when you use this ability.",
			"",
			"***Flash of Omniscience (Ex):*** Your ability to recall information is astounding. When you take 10 on any Intelligence-based skill check, add your tier to the result. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ask one question as if using divination. The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + your highest arcane caster level + your tier (maximum 100%). The answer doesn't come from a divine agent, but from your own native understanding; therefore, the answer is never cryptic. If you don't get a correct answer, it's like failing a Knowledge check, and you can't use this ability on this question again. ",
			"",
			"***Flexible Counterspell (Su):*** Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter others' spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. This ability otherwise works like readying an action to counter a spell, except instead of using the exact spell or {spell/dispel magic}, you can instead expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the target spell. ",
			"",
			"***Flexible School (Ex):*** Select one wizard arcane school that is not your arcane school. You gain powers from that arcane school, treating your tier as your wizard level for the purposes of these powers. Once you have chosen the arcane school, it cannot be changed. You cannot select an arcane school that is one of your opposition schools. You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability. You can choose this ability up to three times, each time selecting another arcane school other than your own.",
			"",
			"***Greater Familiar Link (Su):*** You have bound yourself so deeply to your familiar that your life forces are intertwined. Anytime you or your familiar takes damage, you may split the damage evenly between you and your familiar as if using {spell/shield other}. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but it works only if you're conscious and both you and your familiar are alive. You must have a familiar to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Harmonious Mage (Ex):*** Your wizardly studies have moved beyond the concept of opposition schools. Select two opposition schools. These are no longer opposition schools for you, preparing spells from one of these schools now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer take the -4 Spellcraft penalty for crafting items from an opposition school. You must have the arcane school class ability to select this ability, and your arcane school can't be universal. ",
			"",
			"***Mythic Bloodline (Su):*** When determining the effects of your bloodline powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have a sorcerer bloodline power that can be used multiple times per day, such as metamagic adept, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Mythic Hexes (Su):*** Your hexes are more effective against non-mythic targets. When you use a hex that requires a saving throw against a non-mythic target, that target is automatically affected for 1 round (which doesn't count toward the hex's duration) and can't attempt a saving throw to resist the hex. On your turn the next round, the creature attempts its saving throw as normal. If it succeeds at this saving throw, it breaks free of the hex; otherwise, it's affected as normal. You must have the hex class feature to select this ability. You can select this ability twice. If you select it a second time, it also affects your major hexes. ",
			"",
			"***Mythic School (Su):*** When determining the effects of your arcane school powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. If you have an arcane school power that can be used multiple times per day, such as blinding ray, you gain a number of extra uses of that power equal half your tier (minimum 1). You must have the arcane school class feature to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Necromantic Mastery (Su) [Cenotaph]:*** When casting a necromancy spell, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to increase its caster level by your tier (minimum 2).",
			"",
			"***Perfect Preparation (Ex):*** You have discovered the secret to preparing spells without having to refer to outside sources. You no longer need to prepare spells from a spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or a familiar (if you're a witch). You still must spend the normal amount of time preparing spells. You may keep or discard your spellbook or familiar. ",
			"",
			"***Rapid Preparation (Su):*** You can prepare a spell in an open spell slot in only 1 minute instead of the normal 15 minutes. You can prepare spells in all of your available spell slots in only 15 minutes instead of the normal 1 hour. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to instantly prepare one spell in an open spell slot. ",
			"",
			"***Reactive Ward (Su) [Mana Well]:*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ward against a spell that would require you to make a saving throw. You attempt a Spellcraft check instead of your saving throw, with a natural 1 automatically failing and a natural 20 automatically succeeding as normal for saving throws. If you succeed at this check against a spell that has a reduced effect with a successful saving throw, it has no effect on you instead. You must choose to use this ability before rolling the saving throw, and you must be capable of using either verbal or somatic components to enact the ward.",
			"",
			"***Remixer (Ex):*** You can instantly remix any potion you touch to alter its effects. You can expend one use of mythic power to change the spell or formula contained in a potion or extract to that of any spell or extract you have prepared of the same spell level. The resulting potion uses the caster level of the original potion. The new spell contained in the potion or elixir must be one that could normally serve as a potion. If the effect you are trying to use requires expensive material components, you must provide them at the time of the change. The DC of a Perception check to successfully identify the powers of the potion (normally equal to 15 + the potion's caster level) increases by an amount equal to your tier.",
			"",
			"***Resilient Arcana (Su):*** Your spells and effects become more difficult to identify and dispel. Add your tier to the DC of any checks to identify your spells, recognize them as they are being cast, or dispel them using {spell/dispel magic} or similar effects. ",
			"",
			"***Sensory Link (Su):*** As a standard action, you can see and hear through your familiar's eyes and ears. While using this ability, you can't see or hear using your normal senses. You can speak through your familiar using any language you know, even if the familiar can't normally speak. You may end the link and restore your own senses as a standard action. While linked, you can expend one use of mythic power to cast a spell and have it originate from your familiar instead of you. You must have a familiar to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Shapeshifting Mastery (Ex):*** Your ability to magically adopt other forms is unparalleled, and you can expertly translate your arcane might into brawn. You add half your tier to the caster level of spells or extracts from the polymorph subschool. While under the effects of a spell or extract of the polymorph subschool, you can use your caster level instead of your base attack bonus when making natural attacks that rely on your new form.",
			"",
			"***Shifting Mastery (Su):*** Whenever you cast or use an arcane polymorph spell, you can grant the target the ability to expend 1 minute of the spell's duration to assume another form allowed by the spell. Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing. ",
			"",
			"***Spellbane Counterstrike (Su):*** With a quick sprint, you retaliate against the caster of a spell you countered. When you successfully counter a spell, you can move up to your speed as part of the counterspell action, as long as you end your movement with the target of the counterspell within melee reach. Your movement from this ability doesn't count toward your total movement for the round. If the target's casting would have provoked an attack of opportunity, you can immediately take an attack of opportunity against the target. ",
			"",
			"***Telekinetic Master (Su):*** You can use mage hand or open/close at will as a standard action, and you can affect unattended magical objects with mage hand. The weight limit for these abilities increases by 5 pounds per tier. Treat your caster level as 2 levels higher when casting levitate, telekinesis, and similar spells. ",
			"",
			"***Throw Spell (Su):*** When casting a melee touch spell, you can expend one use of mythic power to throw that spell as a ranged touch attack. The range of this thrown spell is 10 feet per tier. If the spell allows you to make multiple melee touch attacks, you may make any number of the attacks as melee touch attacks and throw the rest as you see fit.",
			"",
			"***Transformative Familiar (Ex):*** Your familiar is able to assume the shape of a single masterwork amulet, ring, staff, wand, or weapon. While it's in this form, treat the familiar as an intelligent magic item with the familiar's mental ability scores but no magical abilities. You can add magical enhancements, intelligent item powers, and intelligent item senses as if you possessed the appropriate crafting feat. (For example, if your familiar transforms into a staff, you could craft it into an intelligent staff of fire as if you possessed the {feat/Craft Staff} feat.) You must still pay for enhancements as normal. As a standard action, the familiar can transform into and out of its item form and does so in such a way that you can have it immediately equipped when the transformation is complete. While in item form, your familiar retains its original hit points, but gains the hardness of the item it transforms into. If your familiar takes enough points of damage in item form to become broken, it automatically reverts to its familiar form and cannot change to item form again until it is healed to its maximum hit point total. You must have a familiar to select this path ability."

			"***Arcane Metamastery (Su):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick any one metamagic feat you know that increases the slot level of the spell by 0 or 1 levels. For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any arcane spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on an arcane spell you cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though this doesn't affect spells already cast). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select this ability, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat you can choose goes up by 1, to a maximum of 4.",
			"",
			"***Arcane Potency (Su):*** Choose one of your arcane spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level arcane spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This ability doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same arcane spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.",
			"",
			"***Bloodline Immunity (Su):*** The intense power of your sorcerer blood makes you immune to the weapons you rely on. You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your bloodline spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your bloodline spell list affect you normally. You must have the bloodline class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Component Freedom (Ex):*** When you cast an arcane spell, you can ignore one component of the spell: focus, material, somatic, or verbal. You can ignore a focus or material component only if its total value is equal to or less than 100 gp &times; your tier. You can select this ability more than once; each time you take this ability, the number of components you may ignore for each spell you cast increases by 1.",

			"***Eldritch Flight (Sp, Su):*** You gain a bonus on Fly checks equal to your tier. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to fly (as the {spell/fly} spell) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. At 6th tier, you instead gain a supernatural fly speed of 60 feet (40 feet if you wear medium or heavy armor, or are carrying a medium or heavy load).",

			"***Infectious Spell (Su):*** You know no limits when it comes to the potency and ravaging effects of your spells. Whenever you cast a spell that specifically targets a limited number of targets (such as \"one creature/level\" or \"one or more creatures\") and has a duration longer than 1 round, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the spell infectious. Each round on your turn, so long as at least one creature is still under the effect of the infectious spell, the spell targets one additional enemy per mythic tier you possess. The range of the spell is the same, but it originates from a creature currently affected by the spell (your choice). A creature affected by an infectious spell suffers all of the effects of the original spell (and may attempt any saving throws as appropriate at the original save DC), but the duration does not reset (meaning the effect ends for all affected targets when the original duration of the spell expires). A creature can only be targeted by a given infectious spell once per casting. Once a round passes without any additional creatures affected by the spell, the spell stops being infectious. This ability can only affect spells whose level is equal to or less than double your tier.",
			"",
			"***Many Forms (Su):*** You can alter your appearance at will as if using alter self. You can expend one use of mythic power to change shape as if using polymorph, with a duration of 1 minute per tier. Your caster level for this ability is a number equal to 10 + your tier. At 6th tier, the duration of the polymorph ability increases to 10 minutes per tier.",
			"",
			"***Mirror Dodge (Su):*** When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the square into which you teleport.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Amplification (Su):*** Whenever you cast a psychic spell, you can expend one use of mythic power to apply a single phrenic amplification you know to the spell, without expending any points from your phrenic pool to do so. The phrenic amplification added in this way does not count against the normal limit of one phrenic amplification per spell. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Spellpower (Sp):*** You have a pool of magical power you can draw upon for casting {rule/mythic spells}. Up to twice per day, you can use this power to cast a mythic spell without expending any uses of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times; each time you do, you gain two additional uses of this ability per day.",
			"",
			"***Reverse Scrying (Su):*** When you notice a scrying sensor created by a scrying magical effect, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to use that sensor to observe its creator. If the initial scrying effect allows the target a saving throw, the sensor's creator can attempt a saving throw with a DC equal to 10 plus double your tier to realize you are attempting to observe it and block this attempt. If you act strangely once you notice the sensor, its creator might realize you're aware of it; at the GM's discretion, you may need to attempt a Bluff check against the creator's Sense Motive. If your reverse scrying goes unnoticed, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to control what the caster perceives, as if you had cast false vision with a duration of concentration and a caster level equal to double your tier.",
			"",
			"***Speedy Summons (Su):*** When you cast a summon monster spell, the casting time is 1 standard action instead of 1 round. If you expend one use of mythic power, the casting time becomes 1 swift action. If you're a summoner, as a full-round action you can expend one use of mythic power to summon your eidolon. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this ability. ",
			"",
			"***Spell Sieve (Sp):*** If you successfully counterspell an arcane spell that is on your spell list and of a level you can cast, you can absorb the countered spell's power and use it for your own purposes. On your next turn, you can cast that spell as a spell-like ability using your arcane spellcaster level as the caster level.",
			"",
			"***Tangible Illusion (Su):*** You can temporarily transform an illusory object into a real one. As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to temporarily transform a single object created by an illusion spell that you cast into a physical, nonmagical version of that object. The object lasts for 10 minutes per tier, after which it reverts to being an illusion (or vanishes, if the duration of the original illusion has expired). During that time, the illusion gains all the physical properties of the depicted illusory object. You must touch the illusion to use this ability, and the object can be no larger than 5 cubic feet per tier. For example, if you create an illusory stone door, you transform it into an actual nonmagical stone door.",
			"",
			"***Teleportation Master (Su):*** You have become an expert at teleportation magic. You can expend one use of mythic power when casting any spell of the teleportation subschool to visualize your destination before you fully materialize there, gaining sensory information of the area as though via a clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. After gaining this sensory information, you can choose to alter your teleportation destination by up to 100 feet in any direction. The new destination must be a legal location for the effect."

			"You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.",
			"",
			"***Channel Power (Su):*** You gain the ability to channel raw arcane power into a spell. You can also expend one use of mythic power when casting an arcane spell to increase its damage by 50%. If the spell has a duration greater than 1 round, the duration doubles. Any saves required by the spell take a -4 penalty, although for mythic creatures, this penalty is reduced to -2. This spell ignores any spell resistance the targets have, although targets immune to the spell or to magic still retain that protection.",
			"",
			"***Divine Knowledge (Ex):*** You can use arcane power to cast a small number of divine spells. Choose three 1st-level spells from the cleric spell list or three 1st-level spells from the druid spell list. You can add those spells to your spellbook (if you're a magus or wizard) or familiar (if you're a witch) for free and can cast those spells as if they were arcane spells on your class list. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you choose three more spells from the same class's spell list (cleric or druid), and the highest spell level you can select from increases by 1 (up to 2nd level the second time and up to 3rd level the third time). You must be a magus, witch, or wizard to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Dominion over Outsiders (Ex):*** You have a way with words when dealing with extraplanar forces called to the Material Plane to serve you. When bargaining with outsiders called via a planar binding or similar spell, you add a bonus equal to your tier on Charisma checks against the called creature and on caster level checks to prevent the creature from escaping your magic circle. In addition, you can expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the Hit Dice of the outsider to attempt to bind the outsider to perform a task for up to a year and a day. The creature gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to refuse this request. If the outsider agrees to carry out this request, it is bound to perform that task for up to a year and a day or until otherwise released (either by completing the task or by your will). You cannot regain that use of mythic power until the outsider is released, effectively decreasing your total number of uses of mythic power per day by the number of uses spent to bind the outsider.",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Reciprocation (Su):*** You can choose to take extra damage from an arcane spell to replenish mythic power. When you are hit by or fail a saving throw against an arcane spell that deals hit point damage, as an immediate action you can choose to take damage as if that spell were affected by the {feat/Maximize Spell} feat. If the spell's damage can't be increased by the Maximize Spell feat or is already under the effect of the Maximize Spell feat, you instead take double damage from it. The spell's damage ignores your spell resistance, energy resistance, energy immunities, and other protections against damage. If you take at least 25 points of damage from the spell, you regain one use of mythic power.",
			"",
			"***Sanctum (Su):*** You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it - a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.",
			"",
			"***Star Walker (Su):*** You can transform your power to enable you to travel great distances. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to surround yourself with a bubble of air enclosed by a thin iridescent layer of force. While this bubble offers no protection from attacks, you can propel yourself through the air at great speed. As long as you concentrate, you gain a fly speed of 240 feet per round. If you cease concentrating, the bubble stops and then sinks 30 feet per round until it reaches the ground and collapses; you can expend one use of mythic power before the bubble collapses to regain control.",
			"",
			"In the void of outer space, the bubble's speed is much faster. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system takes 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond takes 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Ceasing concentration while in the void of outer space has no effect on the bubble - it continues traveling in the previously stated direction at the same speed until an outside force slows it down. The air in the sphere is constantly refreshed and kept at a constant temperature, protecting occupants from the void of space, but not necessarily the harsh climates of other planets or planes. By expending two additional uses of mythic power, you can increase the size of the bubble to a 10-foot-radius sphere and you can bring along up to 11 Medium creatures within the bubble. Other creatures can enter or exit the bubble freely."

			"The champion is the pinnacle of skill at arms and armor. No ordinary fighter could hope to match the skill with a blade, a bow, or an axe that surges within a mythic champion. The champion turns aside blows and shatters shields with every movement, all while racing gracefully across the chaotic battlefield. When the screams of fallen foes die down, the champion stands strong and defiant in blood-spattered armor, hefting a weapon and shouting a terrifying war cry.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As a champion, your role is to take the fight to your enemies. Using devastating melee powers, you can crush your enemies before they even have a chance to harm you and your allies. Few can match your skill at arms or your ability to perform amazing feats of strength. The champion abilities allow you to control your foes, move easily around the battlefield, and challenge a large number of foes all at once. The rest of the party can count on you to dominate any melee you charge into.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** While members or nearly any class could be champions, those who focus on melee attacks - barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, monks, paladins, and rangers - will find the abilities in this path most attractive and useful. However, even magi or rogues could find that the path of the champion is an excellent way to augment their abilities.",

			"*Distant Barrage (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a ranged attack at your highest attack bonus. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. When making this attack, ignore the target's cover and concealment other than total cover, and add your tier to the attack roll. Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"*Fleet Charge (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to move up to your speed. At any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"*Sudden Attack (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee attack at your highest attack bonus. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. When making a sudden attack, you roll twice and take the better result, adding your tier to the attack roll. Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the champion path abilities lists or from the {rule/universal path abilities/ lists}. Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***Legendary Champion (Ex):*** At 10th tier, whenever you make an attack roll against a non-mythic foe and miss, you may immediately roll again. You must take the second roll, even if it's lower. Once per round when you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, you regain one use of mythic power."

When making a charge attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to include a single Acrobatics check made to jump, adding 10 feet per tier to the height or distance you jump. You take no falling damage from the height gained as part of this leap. If your attack hits, you may deal an amount of additional damage equal to the falling damage appropriate for the height you reached. Alternatively, you may replace your melee attack from this charge with a grapple check. If you successfully grapple a creature, you bring it to the ground with you at the end of your jump, and it takes an appropriate amount of falling damage for the height it was at when you grappled it.",
			"",
			"***Always a Chance (Ex):*** You don't automatically miss when you roll a 1 on an attack roll.",
			"",
			"***Always Armed (Ex):*** You don't take any penalties from using an improvised weapon. In addition, whenever you confirm a critical hit with an improvised weapon, you can treat its critical multiplier as &times;3 instead of &times;2, but the weapon is destroyed.",
			"",
			"***Armor Master (Ex):*** You don't take an armor check penalty or incur a arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor or using a shield (including a tower shield). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus of light armor doesn't apply to you. You can select this ability up to three times. The second time, it also applies to medium armor. The third time, it also applies to heavy armor.",
			"",
			"***Backlash (Ex):*** You strike back at those who penetrate your defenses. Whenever an adjacent enemy confirms a critical hit against you, that enemy also provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you have used all of your attacks of opportunity for the round, you may expend one use of mythic power to make this attack of opportunity anyway.",
			"",
			"***Blowback (Ex):*** As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one melee or ranged attack at your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, your foe is also knocked directly away from you a distance equal to 10 feet per tier. If the foe strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it couldn't travel. If it strikes another creature, both it and the creature it strikes take half this damage.",
			"",
			"***Burst Through (Ex):*** When you charge, you can move through allies and opponents almost as if they were not there to obstruct your path. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.",
			"",
			"***Clean Blade (Ex):*** Whenever you score a critical hit, as a free action you can make a ranged touch attack to fling the blood and gore at another opponent within 30 feet. If the touch attack hits, the foe is sickened for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If the touch attack is a critical hit, the foe is also blinded for the same duration. A blinded foe can spend a full-round action to remove the gore and end the blindness. At the GM's discretion, creatures that are immune to disease, those that live in filth (such as otyughs), or those that revel in bloodshed (such as demons) might be immune to the sickened effect of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Climbing Master (Ex):*** You gain a climb speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks. If you already have a climb speed, your base climb speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, you retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing. You can climb perfectly flat or smooth surfaces, treating them as if they had a Climb DC of 40.",
			"",
			"***Crusader (Ex):*** Your prowess and ability draw countless followers to your banner. You gain followers as if you had the {feat/Leadership} feat. In addition, you add your tier to your leadership score when determining the number of followers you gain. Whenever you are within 100 feet of such followers, each follower can use the surge ability once per day without needing to expend mythic power. The followers use the same die type as your surge ability. If you have or gain the Leadership feat, you gain followers from both this ability and the Leadership feat (in effect doubling the number of followers gained).",
			"",
			"***Devastating Smash (Su):*** Whenever you attack a construct or object, treat its hardness (or damage reduction in the case of constructs) as 10 less than normal. Add your tier to damage rolls against constructs and objects. If you expend one use of mythic power as part of an attack against a construct or object, you treat its hardness (or damage reduction) as 0 and add double your tier to damage instead.",
			"",
			"***Endless Hatred (Ex):*** You can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to increase all of your favored enemy bonuses by 2 for 1 minute. When you use this ability, for the rest of your turn any attacks you make against a favored enemy bypass all damage reduction. You must have the favored enemy class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Ever Ready (Ex):*** Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack roll and damage roll equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the {feat/Combat Reflexes} feat. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th tier, the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round increases by one.",
			"",
			"***Flash of Rage (Ex):*** Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet is struck by a critical hit, you can enter a rage as a free action on your next turn. This rage functions as the barbarian class feature, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. You aren't fatigued after this rage. If you have the rage class feature, these rounds don't count toward your daily uses of that ability, you can use abilities that require patience and concentration while in this rage (although you are still restricted when using your rage class feature normally), and these rounds of rage don't count toward the total number of rounds of rage used when determining how long you are fatigued. Rounds of rage granted by this ability don't stack, but the duration is reset if another critical hit occurs.",
			"",
			"***Impossible Speed (Ex):*** Your base land speed increases by 30 feet. In addition, if you expend one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base land speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier.",
			"",
			"***Imprinting Hand (Su):*** By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.",
			"",
			"***Juggernaut (Ex):*** Little can stand in your way when you charge forth into battle - even solid doors and walls don't stand a chance. While charging, you may attempt a free Strength check to break through a single door or wall in your path. You can expend one use of mythic power while performing this charge to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Strength check to break the object. If you destroy the object, you can continue your charge as though it were never there. If you fail to destroy the object, your movement ends in the square before that object. Note that destroying integral parts of a structure may trigger a collapse (treat as a cave-in) at the GM's discretion. This ability can be combined with other path abilities and effects that modify charge attacks, such as the *burst through* path ability. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you may break through one more wall or door during your charge, and the circumstance bonus on your Strength check increases by 10 (to a maximum of a +30 circumstance bonus).",
			"",
			"***Lesson Learned (Ex):*** Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.",
			"",
			"***Limitless Range (Ex):*** Multiply the range increment on all of your ranged and thrown weapons by 5 feet, and these weapons no longer have a maximum range increment for you. You can throw any melee weapon as if it had a range increment of 20 feet - this increment isn't multiplied by 5, but the weapon doesn't have a maximum range increment.",
			"",
			"***Meat Shield (Ex):*** You can use a creature you're grappling to protect you from harm. If you're grappling a creature and are attacked with a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against your grappled opponent. If you succeed, the incoming attack targets your grappled opponent instead of you. If you fail, the grappled opponent breaks free from the grapple and the incoming attack targets you as normal.",
			"",
			"***Mounted Maniac (Ex):*** Your unstoppable momentum while mounted is terrifying. Whenever you charge a creature while mounted, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of your target, adding your tier to the result of the check. If you expend one use of mythic power, any creature demoralized by this ability is frightened instead of shaken. The duration of this condition is dependent upon your check, as noted in the Intimidate skill.",
			"",
			"***Mule's Strength (Ex):*** You treat your Strength score as 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity. This bonus applies to encumbrance, the maximum weight you can lift over your head, dragging and pushing, and so on. You can take this path ability multiple times. Each time you do, you treat your Strength score as an additional 5 points higher when determining your carrying capacity.",
			"",
			"***Myth Slayer (Ex):*** Mythic characters of at least 1st tier who gain mythic power from a cyclops myth-speaker can select this ability.",
			"",
			"When you use the surge mythic ability against a creature whose mythic tier or rank is higher than yours, you add the difference between your tiers as a bonus to the surge result; if the surge applied to an attack roll, the attack also deals additional damage equal to your tier. In addition, you can use the surge mythic ability twice per day without using one use of mythic power, but only when the roll modified is against a mythic creature.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Ki (Su):*** As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain 2 points in your ki pool (up to your maximum). For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks with unarmed strikes or monk weapons bypass all damage reduction. You must have the ki pool class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Rage (Su):*** As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain 1/4 your maximum number of rage rounds (minimum 4 rounds). For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks while raging bypass all damage reduction. You must have the rage class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Smite (Su):*** As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain one use of your smite evil ability. For the rest of your turn, your successful attacks against evil creatures bypass all damage reduction. You must have the smite evil class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Weapon Training (Ex):*** Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapon groups. You gain proficiency with all weapons in this group. If you possess a feat such as {feat/Weapon Focus} that requires you to choose a kind of weapon, you can instead apply the effects of that feat to all weapons from that weapon group. When wielding a weapon from that group, add a number equal to your tier to your CMD against disarm and sunder attempts made against that weapon. You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select this ability, it applies to a different weapon group.",
			"",
			"***Overcharged Blast (Su):*** Whenever you use one of your kinetic blasts, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to apply one additional infusion to the blast, beyond the normal limit of one form infusion and one substance infusion per blast. Additionally, whenever you use this ability, you reduce the total amount of burn you would accept from the blast by 2 (to a minimum of 0).",
			"",
			"***Punishing Blow (Ex):*** Any opponent you hit with a melee or ranged attack loses the benefits of regeneration and fast healing for 1 round. In addition, if you score a critical hit against the target, it loses the benefit of its damage reduction for 1 round. A creature whose regeneration can't be suppressed or ignored (such as the tarrasque) is immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"***Sniper's Riposte (Ex):*** You're an expert at defending yourself while aiming a ranged weapon. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity from making ranged attacks. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the Stealth check penalty for sniping for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Sunder Storm (Ex):*** As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a sunder combat maneuver against each opponent within reach, selecting one item on each opponent to sunder. The damage from these sunder attempts ignores item hardness. If you destroy an item in this way, you drive the shattered pieces of the item into the flesh of its wearer or wielder, dealing 1d6 + a number of points equal to your tier of piercing damage. This damage bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"***Swimming Master (Ex):*** You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks. If you already have a swim speed, your base swim speed increases by 30 feet. You can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to 10 &times; your Constitution score, but afterward you must succeed at checks as normal to avoid drowning. If you expend one use of mythic power, for 1 hour your base swim speed increases by 10 feet per mythic tier.",
			"",
			"***Tear Apart (Ex):*** You can attempt to rend the armor of your opponent, reducing its effectiveness. Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day. Lesser restoration restores 1d4 points of natural armor bonus, and restoration restores all of it.",
			"",
			"***Titan's Bane (Ex):*** You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks made by the creature, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.",
			"",
			"***Uncanny Grapple (Ex):*** Upon making a successful grapple combat maneuver check against a creature you are grappling, you can perform one of the following actions: throw, crush, or swing. For a throw, you can throw the target of your grapple up to 10 feet per tier; if the creature strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of the remaining throwing distance and lands prone. For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a two-handed weapon. If you succeed at a melee attack against an opponent adjacent to the target, both that opponent and the grappled creature take 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage from this attack + 1-1/2 &times; your Strength modifier.",
			"",
			"***Wall Smasher (Ex):*** Whenever you succeed at a ki throw or a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver, you can smash your opponent against a wall (or suitable large obstacle) within the range you could move the target into as a result of the maneuver, dealing unarmed strike damage to your opponent and the wall. If you expend one use of mythic power when you use this ability, this damage ignores the hardness of the wall. If the damage destroys the wall, you move the opponent into the space beyond the wall and it immediately falls prone."

Mythic creatures receive a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your Strength modifier + your tier), while non-mythic creatures do not. An affected creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and one of its limbs (your choice) is mangled.

Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves fall prone and are staggered for 1 round. Non-mythic creatures that succeed at their saves and mythic creatures that fail are staggered for 1 round. Mythic creatures that succeed at their saves are unaffected. You are not affected by this ability, and you may designate a number of creatures up to your tier to also not be affected.",
			"",
			"***Incredible Parry (Ex):*** You gain the {prestigeclass/duelist}'s parry ability, and may expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to the parry roll. If you already have the duelist's parry ability, you can use incredible parry and duelist's parry in the same round, electing to not make two attacks and instead parrying up to two attacks.",
			"",
			"***Maneuver Expert (Ex):*** You do not provoke any attacks of opportunity when you attempt a combat maneuver check. As a free action, you can expend one use of your mythic power whenever you attempt a combat maneuver check to gain the benefits of the Improved and Greater feats tied to that maneuver. You must decide to use this ability before making the roll.",
			"",
			"***Master Grappler (Ex):*** You are a legendary wrestler, and few can withstand your mighty throws, holds, and blows. While using the *uncanny grapple* path ability, if you throw a creature into a solid object, that object takes the same amount of damage as the creature; if this is enough to break the object, the creature continues to move through it. If you throw the creature into another creature, resolve the attack as a bull rush by you, except the thrown creature moves with the bull rush and does not incur any attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares. If you crush the creature, you can choose to deal either 1d6 points of lethal damage per tier or 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per tier, and you can limit the damage you deal to the amount required to render the target unconscious. If you swing the creature as a weapon, add your tier to the amount of damage you deal to both creatures; if you score a critical hit, the target of the swing attack also takes damage from a melee natural attack from the creature you are swinging (if it has one; choose randomly if it has more than one). You must have the uncanny grapple champion path ability to take this ability.",
			"",
			"***Maximized Critical (Ex):*** Whenever you score a critical hit, the weapon's damage result is always the maximum possible amount you could roll. This doesn't affect other dice added to the damage, such as from sneak attack or the flaming weapon special ability. For example, if you score a critical hit with a longsword (1d8/&times;2), treat the sword's damage dice as if you had rolled 8 both times, then add any other damage bonuses that you would normally apply to a critical hit.",
			"",
			"***Mighty Hurler (Ex):*** You gain the {umr/rock throwing} and {umr/rock catching} universal monster abilities. The range increment of your rock throwing ability is 10 feet per tier. You can use these abilities with any solid, mostly inflexible object, not just rocks. The maximum size of an object you can throw is two size categories smaller than you. You can take this ability three times. Each additional time you select it, the range increment increases by an additional 10 feet per tier and the maximum size of an object you can throw increases by one size category.",
			"",
			"***Penetrating Damage (Su):*** Whenever you deal damage to a creature with damage reduction, you can overcome one of the following types of damage reduction: chaotic, cold iron, evil, good, lawful, magic, or silver. You can change this type with each attack. This ability only aids in overcoming one type of damage reduction; if the creature's damage reduction requires a combination of different types of damage, you must be able to overcome the other types using other means.",
			"",
			"***Precision (Ex):*** Your deadly attacks are far more likely to hit their target than those of others. Whenever you make a full attack, your attack bonus on the additional attacks you gain by having a high base attack bonus is 5 higher. This ability can't give any of these attacks a higher attack bonus than your base attack bonus. For example, a 12th-level fighter normally has a base attack bonus of +12/+7/+2; with this ability, his base attack bonus is +12/+12/+7. This ability doesn't reduce the penalties from two-weapon fighting or other situational penalties on attack rolls (such as {feat/Combat Expertise}, {feat/Power Attack}, fighting defensively, or harmful conditions). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the attack bonus on additional attacks increases by another 5.",
			"",
			"***Titan's Rage (Su):*** You can cause yourself to grow in size, becoming a terrifying sight to behold. As a standard action (or a free action if you have the rage class feature), you can expend one use of mythic power to increase your size to one size category larger. This grants you a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, imposes a -2 penalty to Dexterity, grants you a +2 natural armor bonus, increases your natural reach by 5 feet, and increases your weapon damage based on the new size of your weapons. This size increase lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, and doesn't stack with any other spell or ability that alters your size.",
			"",
			"***To the Death (Ex):*** You can shrug off wounds that others would find devastating. When below 0 hit points, you don't fall unconscious, but are instead staggered. You lose 1 hit point at the end of each turn when you take a standard action while staggered in this way.",
			"",
			"***Unorthodox Infusion (Su):*** You learn to master an infusion beyond those that normally apply to the elements in which you specialize. You learn a new infusion of your choice, regardless of that infusion's associated blasts. You can apply the chosen infusion to any blasts you are capable of using, even if they are not one of that infusion's associated blasts. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Unstoppable Shot (Ex):*** You can use a ranged or thrown weapon to make a single powerful shot that shoots through all creatures in a line. As a standard action, make a single ranged attack roll and resolve the attack against all targets in a straight line up to the maximum range of your weapon, stopping at any barrier the attack couldn't penetrate. Roll damage once and apply that damage to each creature hit by the attack. Before making the attack roll, you can expend one use of mythic power to bend the path of the attack up to two times as it strikes targets or objects. Each deflection can alter the line of the attack up to 90 degrees, allowing you to shoot around corners or cover."

This ability can be selected twice. The second time it is selected, it also applies to mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"***Fistful of Daggers (Ex):*** When you could make a full attack with thrown weapons, you can instead make a single attack roll at your highest attack bonus and apply the result to any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage once and deal it to all creatures hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. You must throw one weapon at each target. Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of {rule/concealment} for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.",
			"",
			"***Kinetic Font (Su):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to open up a wellspring of kinetic energy within yourself. Each round, beginning on the round in which you use this ability, you can reduce the total amount of burn you would take for a single blast or utility wild talent by 1, to a minimum of 0. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to half your mythic tier. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Perfect Strike (Ex):*** You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to deliver a perfect strike. A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a &times;2 weapon deals &times;3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike. Perfect strike can be used in conjunction with any champion's strike if you expend uses of mythic power for each ability separately.",
			"",
			"***Seven-League Leap (Ex):*** Your leap is so mighty that you defy gravity. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks made to jump. The distance you can jump in a round is not limited by your movement speed. If you are carrying no more than a light load, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a powerful jump that lets you sail through the air. In order to use this ability, you must be able to run in a straight line for 1 minute. Any obstacles or impediments that prevent you from completing this sprint uninterrupted prevent you from being able to use this ability, though the expenditure of mythic power is not wasted. At the end of your 1-minute sprint, you attempt an Acrobatics check and leap a distance up to half the check's result in miles, rounded down to the nearest mile (for example, an Acrobatics check result of 29 would allow you to jump 14 miles). This trip takes 1 round per mile, and you reach a maximum height at the apex of your arc equal to half the distance traveled. You do not take falling damage from using this ability. You must have a clear arc of travel to complete this jump; if you strike an obstacle mid-jump, you and the obstacle each take a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 &times; the number of miles you have left to travel. If this damage destroys the obstacle, you continue your jump; otherwise, your jump comes to an end and you fall, taking falling damage as appropriate. You cannot aim this leap accurately, and always land 50 to 5,000 feet (5d%) from your intended destination.",
			"",
			"***Shatter Spells (Su):*** You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted {spell/greater dispel magic}, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.",
			"",
			"***Sweeping Strike (Su):*** Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target."

			"Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful - indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.",

Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.",

			"***Guardian's Call:*** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"*Absorb Blow (Su):* As an immediate action, whenever you take hit point damage from a single source (such as a dragon's breath, a spell, or a weapon), you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the damage you take from that source by 5 per tier (to a minimum of 0 points of damage taken). If you have another ability or effect that reduces damage (such as protection from energy), reduce the damage with the absorb blow ability before applying any other damage-reducing effects. For every 10 points of damage that this ability prevents, for 1 minute you gain DR 1/epic and 5 points of resistance against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The DR and resistances stack with any other DR and resistances that you have.",
			"",
			"*Beast's Fury (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount with some of your mythic power. As an immediate action, that creature can move up to its speed and make an attack with one of its natural weapons. When making this attack, the creature rolls twice and takes the higher result. Any damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. A creature affected by this ability can take these actions in addition to any others that it takes during its turn.",
			"",
			"*Sudden Block (Su):* As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the ally's AC against this attack. The creature making the attack must make two attack rolls and take the lower result. Once the attack is resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",

Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***True Defender (Su):*** At 10th tier, whenever you take damage from a melee or ranged attack scored by a non-mythic creature, the damage is halved. This reduction is applied after all other reductions in damage, such as energy resistance or damage reduction. Once per round, when an enemy scores a critical hit against you, you regain one use of mythic power."

Whenever you succeed at a saving a throw against a disease or poison, you become immune to that disease or poison for a number of hours equal to half your tier. If you are affected by the disease or poison and succeed at a saving throw to cure it, you automatically cure yourself of the affliction (even if it would normally require more than one saving throw to cure), and you become immune to it for a number of hours equal to half your tier.",
			"",
			"***Armor Master (Ex):*** You don't take an armor check penalty or incur an arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor or using a shield (including a tower shield). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus of light armor doesn't apply to you. You can select this ability up to three times. The second time, it also applies to medium armor. The third time, it also applies to heavy armor.",
			"",
			"***Armored Might (Ex):*** You treat the armor bonus from your armor as 50% higher than normal, to maximum increase of half your tier (minimum 1). For example, if you are 4th tier and wearing +2 breastplate, you treat the armor's +6 armor bonus as +8 (50% of +6 is +3, limited to +2 by half your tier).",
			"",
			"***Avenging Maneuver (Ex):*** Taking grievous wounds only empowers you. Any creature that confirms a critical hit with a melee attack against you provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can use this attack of opportunity only to attempt a bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting this combat maneuver check.",
			"",
			"***Borrow Elements (Su):*** When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you store some of this energy within yourself and can direct it outward through your attacks. Whenever you take energy damage, you gain an amount of energy of that type equal to 1/2 the damage taken (after any resistances or immunities are applied). Whenever you hit with a melee attack, you may expend 5 points from the pool of one energy type to have the attack deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of that type. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to release all stored energy of one type as a ray with a 60-foot range. The ray deals 1d6 points of energy damage for every 5 points of energy stored. If unused, the stored energy harmlessly dissipates 1 minute after the last time you took energy damage of any type.",
			"",
			"***Burst Through (Ex):*** Whenever you charge, you can move through squares containing allies and opponents almost as if they were not obstructing your charge. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.",
			"",
			"***Draw Fire (Su):*** As an immediate action, when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an immediate action by expending one use of mythic power.",
			"",
			"***Empathic Healing (Su):*** You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.",
			"",
			"***Ever Ready (Ex):*** Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the {feat/Combat Reflexes} feat. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th tier, the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round increases by one.",

			"***Fast Healing (Ex):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain fast healing 5 for 1 minute. This ability can be taken a second time at 3rd tier or higher and a third time at 6th tier or higher. Each additional time you take this ability, the fast healing increases by 5.",
			"",
			"***Guarded Gathering (Su):*** Whenever you use your gather power class feature, the gathered energy swirls around you, forming a protective barrier. You gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to half your mythic tier (rounded down, minimum 1).",
			"",
			"***Guardian's Shout (Ex):*** Your warning shouts keep allies from danger. Whenever you attempt a Reflex save to avoid an effect that affects multiple creatures, you can expend one use of your mythic power to call out a warning to your allies. Any allies within 100 feet who can hear you gain a bonus equal to your tier on their saving throws against that effect.",
			"",
			"***Immovable (Su):*** Add your tier to your CMD whenever an enemy attempts a bull rush, drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against you. If the check is successful, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to cause it to fail instead.",
			"",
			"***Imprinting Hand (Su):*** By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.",
			"",
			"***Indefatigable Traveler (Ex):*** You can run and charge while fatigued or exhausted, and you ignore the movement penalty while exhausted. When [traveling overland](rule/overland_movement), you can expend one use of mythic power to be able to hustle for a number of hours equal to your tier without taking nonlethal damage or becoming fatigued (this is in addition to the 1 hour per day normally allowed for hustling). In a day of normal walking, you can walk 8 hours plus 1 hour per tier before you must start making Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"***Irrepressible Soul (Su):*** Your true self can't be buried beneath disguises or magical effects. Once per round as a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to end one effect that is currently affecting you. When you use this ability, you make an additional saving throw against the effect at its original DC, even if one would not normally be allowed. This ability can end only polymorph effects, charm and compulsion effects, domination effects, illusion effects that change your appearance, and any effects that control or conceal your true identity. If you succeed at the second saving throw, the effect immediately ends.",
			"",
			"***Knowledgeable Guardian (Su):*** Add double your tier as a bonus on Knowledge checks you attempt to identify monsters, including checks made to learn any special powers and vulnerabilities. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to telepathically communicate the knowledge you obtain from this check to all allies within 100 feet.",
			"",
			"***Lesson Learned (Ex):*** You adapt quickly to the perils presented in battle. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.",
			"",
			"***Mule's Strength (Ex):*** You treat your Strength score as 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity. This bonus applies to encumbrance, the maximum weight you can lift over your head, dragging and pushing, and so on. You can take this path ability multiple times. Each time you do, you treat your Strength score as an additional 5 points higher when determining your carrying capacity.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Companion (Su):*** Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Mercy (Su):*** When you use the mercy paladin class feature, your caster level check to remove curses, diseases, and poisons automatically succeeds unless the affliction is from a mythic source. If you expend one use of mythic power when using a mercy, you add {spell/break enchantment} to its effect, using your paladin level as your caster level. You must have the mercy class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Pack Wild Shape (Su):*** When you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Partial Transformation (Su):*** You have refined control over your transformation ability. When using wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to only partially transform into or out of animal form. For example, you could transform your hands into tiger claws and your head into a tiger's head (giving you low-light vision and scent, and allowing you to make claw and bite attacks but still wear armor and use worn magic items normally), transform into a deinonychus with human hands (allowing you to still manipulate objects and wear rings), or transform into a constrictor snake with a humanoid head (allowing you to speak and cast spells with verbal components). You may make one such change per round as a free action for the duration of that use of wild shape. For example, if you change into a tiger, this ability allows you to partially transform yourself from tiger form to your normal form and back as needed until the duration ends or you fully return to your normal form. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Quick Recovery (Ex):*** Whenever you are dazed, dazzled, deafened, sickened, or stunned, reduce the duration of that condition by half (minimum 1 round). Any other effects relating to the source of that condition are unaffected; for example, if you are panicked and sickened from an eyebite spell, the panicked effect has the normal duration even though you are sickened for only half as long. You can select this ability twice. The second time you select it, you also reduce the duration of the blinded, nauseated, and paralyzed conditions by half.",
			"",
			"***Raise Animal (Su):*** By burying the corpse of a dead animal (at least its bones) and expending one use of mythic power, you raise it from the dead overnight. You can use this ability on an animal companion, familiar, or bonded mount even if it is not a creature of the animal type. At 1st tier, this functions like {spell/raise dead}. At 3rd tier, this functions like {spell/resurrection}. At 6th tier, this functions like {spell/true resurrection}.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Disarm (Ex):*** You can use a ranged attack to disarm an opponent. Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.",
			"",
			"***Relentless Healing (Su):*** You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a healing spell or using a class feature that heals damage to apply that healing to the dead creature. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.",
			"",
			"***Retributive Reach (Ex):*** Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an attack of opportunity. If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the attack roll and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Sacrificial Shield (Ex):*** Once per round when you would normally be hit by a weapon attack, you can use your shield to block the attack. You must be using a shield in order to use this ability. Subtract your shield's hardness and hit points (see [Table 7-12](rule/breaking_things)) from the damage of the attack and apply the remaining damage to your hit points. If the shield takes enough damage to destroy it, it's destroyed. Otherwise, it gains the broken condition, even if the damage was not enough to give it the broken condition under other circumstances. You can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to negate any damage dealt to the shield, though you still take any damage that exceeds its hardness and hit points. You can choose to negate the damage after the damage is rolled.",
			"",
			"***Supreme Tracker (Su):*** If you have something that carries a creature's scent (such as a personal item or piece of flesh), you can expend one use of mythic power to create a supernatural bond that allows you track that individual. As a free action, you can sense the creature's general direction and distance, as well as know whether it is alive, dead, destroyed, dying, or undead. The creature must be on the same plane as you for this ability to function. For the purpose of spells and effects that block scrying and divination, your caster level for this effect is a number equal to double your tier. At 6th tier, you can track the creature if it's on a different plane than you.",

			"***World's Heart (Su) [Star Tower]:*** While touching the ground, you gain a bonus on Strength checks and to your CMD equal to half your mythic tier (minimum +1). As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power while touching the ground to remove the exhausted or fatigued condition and gain a bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls equal to half your mythic tier (minimum +1) for 1 round. For the purposes of this ability, you are considered to be touching the ground when you are outside or underground and on the ground, or when you are touching the floor in a stone or earthen building built on solid ground."

When this ability is active, any creature moving out of one of your threatened squares, even when making a 5-foot step or using a form of movement that doesn't usually provoke attacks of opportunity, provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If your attack of opportunity hits and deals damage, the creature remains in its current space and its movement ends. Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of a charge.

If you succeed, you learn the type of teleportation effect (such as dimension door) and the creature's intended destination, and then may prevent the effect (as if using a quickened dimensional anchor, using your character level as your caster level) or accompany the opponent as if you were part of its gear with negligible weight.",

You can apply infusion wild talents to the blast, and you accept burn for doing so. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",

			"***Parry Spell (Su):*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to block a spell targeting you or an ally adjacent to you. The spell must be a ray, a single-target spell, or a spell that creates an effect targeting one creature (such as acid arrow), and the level of the spell's spell slot must be equal to or lower than your tier. Make an attack roll as if making an attack of opportunity. If the result of the attack roll is greater than the spell's attack roll or save DC, the spell has no effect on the intended target (though other targets from the same spell, such as multiple targets of scorching ray, are affected normally). A spell that has neither a DC nor an attack roll (such as {spell/magic missile}) can't be affected by this ability. You must declare using spell parry after the spellcaster's target is announced, but before the target's saving throw or attack roll is made.",
			"",
			"***Possess Companion (Su):*** You can expend one use of mythic power to project your soul from your body and into your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount as if possessing that creature with the magic jar spell. Unlike with magic jar, the companion creature's soul remains within its body, allowing you to know what it knows and share its memories. This effect lasts until you end it as a standard action.",
			"",
			"***Shadow's Embrace (Su) [Star Tower]:*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to become both corporeal and incorporeal for 1 round. During that round, you can instantly shift between corporeal and incorporeal as an immediate action.

The radius of the sphere is equal to 5 feet per tier, and only creatures within the sphere receive the benefits of this effect. Anyone who steps outside of the sphere immediately loses the benefits of this ability until she steps back inside the sphere.

If you're healed to full hit points, you come back to life and gain 1 permanent negative level for each minute you were dead (these negative levels can be removed as normal). Until you're healed to full hit points, you don't regain consciousness and are still dead no matter what other abilities you might have.

You are helpless and can't move or take other actions, nor replenish mythic power, but you age and consume bodily resources as though each year that passes were 1 minute. For example, if you could normally hold your breath for 3 minutes, you can use this ability to survive without air for 3 years. You remain partially aware during this stasis and can detect any lethal threats within 5 feet of you. There are several ways to end this stasis. By expending one use of mythic power as a full-round action, you can awaken from your stasis at any time. If you take damage while in stasis, you immediately awaken, though you are staggered for 1 hour. Finally, you can use sheer force of will to awaken from stasis without expending mythic power, taking 1d4 weeks for you to awaken.

There is no limit to the number of allies you can put into stasis in this way, but you must expend three additional uses of mythic power for each ally.",

			"***Take the Hit (Ex):*** You are a living shield for your allies. Whenever an adjacent ally takes damage from a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can split the damage. You take half of the damage (rounded down), and your ally takes the remaining amount.

If you do, add your channel energy damage to the damage from the critical hit.

The conditions needed to bring the channel energy into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the channel effect occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur.

Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it.

For example, realizing that someone is concealing an emotion doesn't necessarily tell you what emotion the person is hiding, whether she's lying, or why. This ability has no effect against mythic creatures. You can select this path ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you must choose an additional option.",

			"",
			"***Instrument of Faith (Su):*** You gain DR 15/- against attacks made with your deity's favored weapon. You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to attempt a disarm or sunder combat maneuver check against each opponent within 60 feet that is wielding your deity's favored weapon. You decide individually whether to disarm or sunder each opponent's weapon. Attempt one combat maneuver check, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and adding your tier to the total, and use that result against all opponents.",
			"",
			"***Inverted Spontaneous Casting (Su):*** If you can spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast the opposite type of spell (i.e., you can spontaneously cast inflict spells if you can normally cast cure spells, or cures spell if you can normally cast inflict spells). When spontaneously casting the opposite type of spell, you must use a spell slot that is at least 1 level higher than that of the spell you want to cast. For example, if you can spontaneously cast cure spells and want to spontaneously cast inflict light wounds, you must expend a 2nd-level spell slot.",
			"",
			"***Mighty Summons (Su):*** Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains DR 5/epic for the duration of the summoning. If you cast a summon spell to summon more than one creature, you summon one additional creature of the same type. If you cast a summon spell to summon just one creature, you can expend one use of mythic power to give it the agile or savage [mythic simple template](rule/mythic_simple_templates) for the duration of the summoning.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Companion (Su):*** Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Domain (Su):*** When determining the effects of your domain's granted powers, you're considered 4 levels higher. This increases the effects of powers you have access to, but doesn't grant you powers at a lower level than normal. Once per day, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to regain the use of all your domain granted powers as if you had rested for 8 hours. If you're an oracle, all aspects of this ability apply to your revelations instead of to domain granted powers. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Wild Shape (Su):*** Choose one form you can take using wild shape. Using wild shape to take this form doesn't count against your daily uses of wild shape. You can select this ability multiple times. Each time you select it, choose another form to not count against your daily uses of wild shape. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Overflowing Grace (Su):*** When you heal a creature with positive energy (such as by channeling positive energy to heal the living, using cure spells, or using lay on hands), any affected creature at full hit points (whether already at full hit points or healed to full hit points by your channeled energy) gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. If you channel negative energy to heal undead, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.",
			"",
			"***Pack Wild Shape (Su):*** Whenever you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Plantbringer (Su):*** All plants within a 1-mile radius of you grow at double their normal rate and don't suffer from any diseases or maladies. Furthermore, allied plant creatures within 30 feet of you gain fast healing equal to your tier. If you use plant shape or wild shape to take the form of a plant, you gain this fast healing in plant form.",
			"",
			"***Relentless Healing (Su):*** You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to apply healing magic to that creature. This healing can be from a spell or effect you cause or from a magic item you wield. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.",
			"",
			"***Shielding Phantom (Su):*** Your phantom is especially adept at protecting you and your allies from harm. The shield and circumstance bonuses granted by your spiritual interference class feature are both increased by an amount equal to half your mythic tier.",
			"",
			"***Sustained by Faith (Su):*** You require no food, water, or sleep. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation. If you are 3rd tier or higher, you can expend one use of mythic power in order to also not need to breathe for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Symbol of the Holy (Su):*** As a standard action, you can create a wooden holy symbol dedicated to your deity. If it ever leaves your possession, it fades away after 1 hour. Whenever you use this holy symbol as a divine focus when casting a spell, you don't need to have any other material component, unless that component costs more than 50 gp per tier you possess.",
			"",
			"***Tongue of the Land (Su):*** Animals, elementals, fey, and plants are magically able to understand you when you speak Druidic, as if you were using speak with animals or tongues. If speaking to creatures of different types at the same time, you can allow all of them to understand you or speak understandably to just one type at a time. For example, if speaking to a group of animals and fey, you can make yourself understandable to all of them, just to the animals, or just to the fey.",
			"",
			"***Water of Life (Su):*** Any potions you consume have the maximum effect, as if they were created using the {feat/Maximize Spell} feat. You can quickly create a temporary potion by casting a spell into a pint of water. The spell must be a valid choice for the {feat/Brew Potion} feat and have a spell level no higher than your tier. The targeted liquid becomes a potion of that spell. If not consumed, the temporary potion reverts to normal water after 1 hour per tier."

			"***Abundant Healing (Su):*** When you use a spell or class ability to heal a creature's hit point damage, you can apply excess healing (over the target's full hit points) to one ally adjacent to you. You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.",
			"",
			"***Alignment Insight (Ex):*** You can automatically detect the alignment of any outsider you can see. This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment (such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment. For example, when casting holy smite, you could treat all lawful neutral creatures as lawful good or lawful evil, all chaotic neutral creature as chaotic good or chaotic evil, or all neutral creatures as neutral good or neutral evil.",
			"",
			"***Animal Friend (Ex):*** If you have the wild empathy ability, you can use it as a free action once per round. If you don't have that ability, you can instead attempt Diplomacy checks (with a -8 penalty) to improve the attitude of animals as if they were intelligent creatures. Add your tier to wild empathy or Diplomacy checks to influence animals.",
			"",
			"***Blessed Companion (Su):*** Select one animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. It gains DR 5/epic. This ability can be taken a second time at 6th tier or higher and a third time at 9th tier or higher. Each additional time it's taken, the DR increases by 5.",
			"",
			"***Divine Metamastery (Su):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick any one metamagic feat you know that increases the slot level of the spell by 0 levels or 1 level. For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any divine spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on a divine spell cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though any metamagic effects on spells already cast remain). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat goes up by 1 to a maximum of 4.",
			"",
			"***Divine Potency (Su):*** Choose one of your divine spellcasting classes. You gain four bonus 1st-level divine spell slots for that class (like the bonus spells gained from a high ability score). This doesn't change your number of spells known. You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same divine spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on. This ability can't grant you bonus spells for a spell level that you don't have the ability to cast.",
			"",
			"***Domain Immunity (Su):*** You don't take damage or suffer harmful effects from spells on your domain spell list, even ones you aren't of a high enough level to cast. If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning. Beneficial effects of spells on your domain spell list affect you normally. If you're an oracle, this ability applies to your mystery's bonus spells. You must have the domain class feature or mystery class feature.",
			"",
			"***Enduring Blessing (Su):*** Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of 10 minutes per level or longer upon one willing target, you can change that spell's duration to 24 hours. If the spell has other duration conditions, those still apply (for example, the duration of stoneskin changes to 24 hours or until discharged). A creature can't be subject to more than one spell affected by this ability at a time; if another is cast upon the creature, the first one ends. You can select this ability a second time at 6th tier or higher. The second time you select it, you can use it on spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer.",
			"",
			"***Flowers in Your Footsteps (Sp):*** As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to radiate an aura of plant growth. Vegetation within 60 feet of you grows rapidly, as though you had cast the overgrowth version of plant growth (caster level equal to your character level). This ability lasts for 1 minute per tier, and follows you wherever you move until the duration expires or you end the effect as a free action. You are immune to the effects of this overgrowth, as are any allies you designate upon using this ability, up to a maximum number of creatures equal to your tier.",
			"",
			"***Hand of Mercy (Su):*** If you have the channel energy ability, you can touch a creature and expend one use of channel energy to remove a condition afflicting that creature. Each time you use this ability, you can choose one of the following conditions: dazed, fatigued, shaken, sickened, or staggered. At 6th tier, you can also choose from among the cursed, exhausted, frightened, and nauseated conditions. At 9th tier, you can also choose from among the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions.",

			"***Hear the Word (Su):*** When you cast a spell such as augury that gives you information directly from a divine source, you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the casting time to a standard action and have the answer be audible in the unmistakable voice of your deity, granting you a bonus equal to your tier on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against those who hear the voice for a number of hours equal to your tier. If you expend one additional use of mythic power, the voice deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per tier to enemies within 60 feet of you who can hear it, and they are stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wis modifier) halves the damage and negates the stun effect.",
			"",
			"***Hurling Vengeance (Su):*** Whenever you are wielding your deity's favored weapon or your paladin bonded weapon, you can throw it as if it had the returning and throwing weapon special abilities. If using a paladin bonded weapon, it retains its bonded abilities when thrown this way. By expending one use of mythic power as part of a full attack, the weapon returns to you immediately after each time you throw it (instead of just before your next turn) allowing you to make your full number of attacks that round.",
			"",
			"***Life Current (Su):*** You are more attuned to the source of life or unlife and better able to access its power. When casting a cure or inflict spell or use a class feature that uses positive or negative energy (such as channel energy or lay on hands), treat any natural 1s on the dice rolled to heal or deal damage as 2s. You can select this ability up to four times. The second time you select it, treat natural 1s and 2s as 3s. The third time you select it, treat natural 1s, 2s, and 3s as 4s. The fourth time, treat natural 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s as 5s.",
			"",
			"***Mind to Mindlessness (Su) [Cenotaph]:*** You possess the ability to wipe the mind of an intelligent undead, leaving the creature intact but mindless as a result. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to target a single non-mythic intelligent undead creature within 60 feet with a blast of necromantic energy. Alternatively, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to target a mythic creature. The target can attempt a Will save against the effect (DC = 10 + half your tier + either your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher). If the target fails, its Intelligence score drops to -, leaving the creature mindless for a number of rounds equal to your tier. A target that fails its save receives a new saving throw each round to overcome the effect.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Treatment (Su):*** Whenever you use your touch treatment class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant the touched creature a new saving throw to resist a single harmful effect that initially allowed a Fortitude or Will save to resist. The touched creature gains a bonus on this saving throw equal to half your mythic tier. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends immediately. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Pilgrim of the Waves (Su):*** You can breathe water as easily as you breathe air. You can also walk on any body of water, as water walk, except this ability does not allow you to walk upon any bodies of liquid other than water. You can choose to sink to the bottom of any body of water you could walk upon, descending at a rate of 60 feet per round, and thereafter you can travel along the bottom of the water as though it were dry land. While at the bottom of a body of water, you can attack and act normally, as though under the effects of a freedom of movement spell, though this ability does not impart the other benefits of that spell.",
			"",
			"***Shape Channel (Ex):*** As a standard action, you can simultaneously expend one use of mythic power and one use of your channel energy ability to channel energy in a 60-foot cone, a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 20-foot radius, or a 120-foot line. In addition, whenever you channel energy to damage creatures (whether undead creatures with positive energy or living creatures with negative energy), you can choose to deal half damage (or one-quarter damage to creatures that succeed at their saving throws) and then push back all creatures damaged by the effect. You push each creature back 5 feet for every 1d6 points of channel energy damage you are capable of dealing. Creatures that succeed at their saving throws against your channeled energy are only pushed back half as far (minimum 5 feet). You must have the channel energy class feature to select this path ability."

Choose three 1st-level spells from the sorcerer/wizard spell list or three 1st-level spells from the bard spell list. You can add those spells to your list of spells that you can prepare each day. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time you select it, you choose three more spells from the same class's spell list (sorcerer/wizard or bard), and the highest spell level you can select from increases by 1 (up to 2nd level the second time and up to 3rd level the third time). You must be a cleric or druid to select this ability.",

			"***Conduit of Divine Will (Su):*** Your mythic nature is directly connected to the divine. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to use channel energy, use lay on hands, or cast any one spell from your domain spell lists (as long as you can normally prepare a spell of that level). Whenever you use this ability, you also gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your tier and a +4 sacred bonus (or profane bonus if you're evil) to your AC for a number of rounds equal to your tier.",
			"",
			"***Overcome Curse (Su):*** You are immune to curse effects. For example, bestow curse has no effect on you, and you can handle, carry, or discard a cursed magic item without harm. If a cursed item has useful functions and a cursed effect (such as armor of arrow attraction) or drawback (such as a mace of blood), you are immune to the cursed effect and drawback, and can still use its other abilities. If a cursed item works normally for a period of time before its curse triggers (such as gauntlets of fumbling), the item stops working for you when the curse would normally trigger. If you're an oracle, you can ignore the negative effects of your oracle's curse.",
			"",
			"***Pilgrim of the Sky (Su):*** You can walk on clouds as easily as flat land, and are never affected by altitude-based effects such as altitude sickness. If you are on a mountain or other geographically high location, you can simply step from the earth onto the clouds. Otherwise, you must find your own way to the clouds overhead if you wish to walk on them. This ability only works when there are clouds present; you cannot walk on clear skies. You can expend one use of mythic power to use air walk (caster level equal to your character level). You may expend one additional point of mythic power to grant the same ability to an ally touching you. There is no limit to the number of allies you can affect with this ability. At 9th tier, you can expend one use of mythic power to use overland flight.",

			"***Psychic Healing (Su):*** Whenever you use your touch treatment class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant the touched creature a new saving throw to resist a single harmful effect that initially allowed a Fortitude or Will save to resist. The touched creature gains a bonus on this saving throw equal to half your mythic tier. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends immediately. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Puppet Master (Su):*** As a standard action, you can temporarily raise a dead creature within 60 feet to serve as your puppet for up to a number of rounds equal to your tier or until you end this effect as a free action, whichever comes first. In order to use this ability, you must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the target's Hit Dice. The creature must have been slain within a number of rounds equal to your tier. You imbue the creature with enough positive or negative energy to allow its body to function without its spirit. This shell of a creature gains the mindless quality, and it acts like a puppet with you as the puppeteer. The creature is neither living nor dead, and positive and negative energy have no effect on the creature. It immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points, which becomes its new maximum hit point total for the duration of this effect. You can command the puppet as though it were under the effects of a dominate monster spell cast by you (no save), and it can use any of the abilities it normally had access to at the time of death (prepared spells, special abilities, and so on). The puppet must still have all the necessary components to activate special abilities and spells. Abilities that normally refresh periodically, like breath weapons, do not refresh. Once the puppet takes an amount of damage equal to its total number of hit points or the duration of this effect ends, the puppet is destroyed and becomes a corpse once again. The puppet can be affected as normal by {spell/resurrection} spells and effects during this time, which immediately end the effects of this ability. You can't affect the same creature with this ability more than once in 24 hours. You must have the channel energy class feature to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Servant of Balance (Su):*** Whenever a critical hit is confirmed against you, the attack deals normal damage instead of critical damage. Other effects that trigger on a successful critical hit (such as the Blinding Critical feat, the fire damage from a critical hit with a flaming burst weapon, or the effects of a vorpal weapon) all affect you normally.",
			"",
			"***Undying Healer (Su):*** Whenever you fall unconscious, a ghostly image of you manifests from out of your body. Even though you're unconscious, you control this image. On your turn each round, this image can fly up to 30 feet and use your ability to lay on hands to heal, channel energy to heal, or cast any conjuration (healing) spell that you could cast. This consumes these abilities as normal. Abilities used by the image can't benefit you. This image lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. This ability can be dispelled, using double your tier as the caster level. If you die or regain consciousness, the image immediately ends."

			"Some are destined not only to achieve personal greatness, but also to inspire armies, rally the fallen, and bring the most out of those who follow them. The marshal is such a leader, renowned for his vision, courage, and strategic acumen. Soldiers flock to a marshal's banner for a chance to serve under such a commander, confident that his skill will see them through even the most difficult challenges.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As a marshal, your abilities allow you to inspire mythic and non-mythic allies alike to greatness. In a group, you protect and push your allies to even greater acts of heroism. All the while, the powers of the marshal allow you to take the lead, help your companions, and take the fight to your enemies.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** Bards, cavaliers, clerics, inquisitors, and paladins will all find a host of useful abilities in the marshal path. In fact, almost any character who assists others, both during combat and afterward, will likewise find that the path of the marshal includes a number of valuable abilities that will help in her noble endeavors.",
			"",
			"***Bonus Hit Points:*** Whenever you gain a marshal tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.",
			"",
			"### Path Features",
			"",
			"As you gain tiers, you gain the following abilities.",
			"",
			"***Marshal's Order:*** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"*Advance (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire a tactical advance on the field of battle. This allows you and each of your allies within 30 feet to take either a single move action of the character's choice or a 5-foot step, as long as you or your ally has the ability to take such an action (for example, an unconscious character still can't take an action). The action granted by this ability doesn't count toward the number or type of actions a creature is allowed to take on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Decisive Strike (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to give one ally within 30 feet the ability to immediately make a single melee or ranged attack on your turn. Add your tier as a bonus on the attack roll. The damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. This attack doesn't count toward the ally's actions on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Rally (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rally your allies. This gives you and each of your allies within 30 feet the option to reroll any one d20 roll after the roll is made. The granted reroll must be used before the beginning of your next turn, and the creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the marshal path abilities lists or from the {rule/universal path abilities/ lists}. Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***Visionary Commander (Su):*** At 10th tier, whenever you or an ally within 30 feet rolls an initiative check, roll twice and take either result. If the first round of combat is a surprise round, you and all allies within 30 feet at the start of the combat can take a full round's worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action. Once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet scores a critical hit against a mythic creature, you regain one use of mythic power."

			"",
			"You can select these path abilities at any tier.",
			"",
			"***Additional Order (Ex):*** You learn an additional marshal's order ability. You can select this ability twice.",
			"",
			"***Assured Skill (Ex):*** In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you attempt a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.",
			"",
			"***Clarion Call (Ex):*** You bestow your wrath on your allies. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all allies within 30 feet the benefits of your active smite or challenge ability, directed at the same opponent you're targeting with that ability. Only the constant effects from the smite or challenge are conferred with this ability, not the ones you can use only once. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier or until either the combat ends or the subject of the smite or challenge is dead or unconscious.",
			"",
			"***Commanding Entrance (Ex):*** When you first enter an area or make your presence known to a group of strangers, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power and attempt a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the attitudes of everyone within 10 feet per tier, and an additional number of characters equal to your Charisma modifier who are outside that range but have line of sight to you. (For instance, you could affect everyone near the entrance of a throne room and key people on the dais at the far end.) Alternatively, when you reveal yourself during the first round of combat (not counting the surprise round), you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to use Intimidate to demoralize your targets.",
			"",
			"***Deadly Guidance (Ex):*** You are able to point out the weak points in an enemy's defenses, and your allies benefit from your tactical insight. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to designate a single opponent within 30 feet of you. All allies within 30 feet of that opponent gain the sneak attack ability when attacking it, and can thus deal +1d6 points of damage when flanking that opponent or when the opponent is otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This sneak attack damage stacks with sneak attack damage from other sources. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You can take this ability up to four times. Each time you take it, the sneak attack damage from this ability increases by 1d6.",
			"",
			"***Directed Assault (Ex):*** By finding a gap in your enemy's defenses, you allow your allies to take advantage of your discovery. When you confirm a critical hit with a melee or ranged weapon against an opponent, allies within 30 feet of that opponent add your tier to their critical confirmation rolls against that opponent. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. During this duration, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert an ally's successful attack into a critical threat. The ally must be within 30 feet, and can also gain the bonus to its confirmation roll. Only one opponent can be the focus of your directed assault at a time. If you confirm a critical hit against another creature, you may make it the new focus (immediately ending the previous focus) or maintain the current focus.",
			"",
			"***Distracting Assailant (Ex):*** You make a barrage of attacks and quick feints that are so distracting your opponent loses focus against all other assailants. Whenever you successfully strike a foe with a melee weapon or natural attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action. For 1 round, that opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to AC on all attacks against it other than yours. While this ability is in effect, any allies who flank that foe gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it, instead of the normal +2. While the opponent is affected by this ability, each time you hit it, the duration increases by 1 round. This effect automatically ends if your turn ends and the target is not within your melee reach.",
			"",
			"***Focus (Su):*** Your mighty and inspiring presence enhances the power of your companions' heroic surges. Whenever a mythic ally that is within 30 feet uses the surge ability, it rolls its bonus die twice and takes the higher result.",
			"",
			"***Granted Stride (Ex):*** Your mythic grace means that you and your allies easily pass through undergrowth at full speed. Allies within 30 feet of you gain the benefits of woodland stride (as the ranger class feature), as long as they can see and hear you. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow allies within 30 feet to ignore naturally occurring difficult terrain in any of your favored terrains for 1 minute per tier. You must have the woodland stride and favored terrain class features to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Greater Surge (Su):*** Your surge is more powerful than most. Treat your tier as if it were 3 higher for the purpose of determining your mythic surge die (maximum 10th tier). When you gain your 10th tier, your surge die becomes 2d8.",
			"",
			"***Helpful Rebuke (Ex):*** You are quick with stern yet helpful words of advice. Whenever an ally within line of sight fails a skill check with a skill you're trained in, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow that ally to reroll that skill check with a bonus equal to your tier. If the new roll is successful, your ally succeeds at that check instead of failing it. The ally who failed the skill check must be able to see and hear you to gain this reroll. You can use this ability with a skill you aren't trained in, but you must expend two uses of mythic power to do so, and the ally doesn't gain your tier as a bonus on the reroll.",
			"",
			"***Heroic Block (Ex):*** With surprising speed, you can leap to an ally's defense. When a opponent makes a melee attack against one of your allies, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to move up to double your speed or take a 5-foot step. You must end this movement adjacent to the attacking opponent. When you end this movement, you can immediately use the aid another action to grant a bonus to your ally's AC. This bonus is applied before the opponent's triggering attack. These actions don't count against your actions this turn.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Minions (Ex):*** When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"***Inspired Defense (Ex):*** Whenever you use bardic performance to inspire courage, the competence bonus against charm and fear effects instead applies to all saving throws. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a bardic performance to inspire courage, you add your tier to this bonus.",
			"",
			"***Inspiring Surge (Ex):*** Your surge inspires non-mythic allies to greater acts of martial daring. Each time you use your surge ability, each non-mythic ally within 30 feet gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for the next weapon attack it makes before the start of your next turn. An ally must be able to see and hear you to gain the bonus. You can take this ability up to three times. When you take it the second time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to half your tier. When you take it a third time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to your tier instead of half your tier.",
			"",
			"***Lend Power (Su):*** You are an invaluable asset to your comrades. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power or your Confidence ability (see [3rd-tier abilities](rule/marshal_2_3)) to grant the benefit of your surge ability to a mythic ally within 30 feet. The ally uses your surge die.",
			"",
			"***Lightning Performance (Ex):*** Your tongue is as quick as any blade. You can start a bardic performance as a swift action instead of a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can instead start a bardic performance as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Loyalty (Ex):*** You gain {feat/Leadership} as a bonus feat. If you already have the Leadership feat (or if you take it at a later level), add your tier to your Leadership score. Whenever you use your marshal's order ability and your cohort is within 100 feet, you can include your cohort as an additional ally affected by your order.",
			"",
			"***Menacing Presence (Su):*** Something about you puts others on edge. You can attempt an Intimidate check to influence a creature's attitude as full-round action instead of it taking 1 minute. In combat, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can attempt to use Intimidate to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a standard action, or as a move action if using the {feat/Dazzling Display} feat.",
			"",
			"***Mounted Marshal (Ex):*** Whenever you're riding on a bonded mount or animal companion, you and your mount are each treated as flanking any opponent you both threaten. Whenever you use your surge ability while mounted, your mount heals a number of hit points equal to your surge result plus your tier. You can expend one use of mythic power while charging with your mount to deal double damage to the target of your charge (or triple damage if you're wielding a lance).",
			"",
			"***Mythic Fascination (Su):*** When you use the fascinate or suggestion bardic performance ability, non-mythic creatures take a penalty on their saving throws against it equal to half your tier. If you expend one use of mythic power when you activate the performance, the penalty also applies to mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"***Painful Gambit (Ex):*** Facing off against you is never a safe option when your allies stand beside you. When you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow all of your allies to make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked you if it's within their melee reach.",
			"",
			"***Perfect Aid (Ex):*** Whenever you successfully use the aid another action, your ally also adds your tier to the aid another bonus. If you use your surge ability on the aid another roll, add the result of the surge die to this bonus as well.",
			"",
			"***Persuasive Countenance (Su):*** Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"***Potent Message (Ex):*** You can expend one use of mythic power to create a song, oration, poem, or joke that contains information that you want to spread. This can include points of fact or simple instructions. You only need to perform the work once (which takes 1d4 hours to complete); thereafter it will spread through the community by itself. For 1 day per tier, all non-mythic beings that hear this message (whether from you or someone else) are compelled to spread it to others by slipping it naturally into conversation or otherwise bringing it up. Anyone who has heard this message takes a -4 penalty on opposed Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against you when you request that they to carry out duties related to this message. This is a language-dependent effect. At 6th tier or higher, you can expend one additional use of mythic power to make this work universally understandable, regardless of any language barriers.",
			"",
			"***Press the Advantage (Ex):*** When an ally seriously harms a foe, you seize the moment. When an ally within 30 feet confirms a critical hit against a creature you threaten, the target of the critical hit provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you hit with your attack of opportunity, all of your allies gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that creature for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Redirect Attention (Ex):*** Where you point, others feel overwhelmingly compelled to look. You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose - and away from others; non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-footcone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"***Resurging Words (Su):*** Using the power of your mythic presence, you spur on allies even when all seems lost. Using this ability takes 10 uninterrupted minutes, during which time you give a stirring speech to all allies within 30 feet of you. If you expend one use of mythic power at the end of the speech, your allies gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your tier plus your Charisma modifier, and a bonus on saving throws against fear equal to half your tier (minimum 1). Any ally who currently has 1/4 of its full hit points or fewer gains twice as many temporary hit points from this ability. The temporary hit points and saving throw bonus last for 24 hours. Allies can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Rise Up (Su):*** Your allies draw strength from your courage and leadership. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all of your non-mythic allies within 30 feet one use of the surge ability, using your surge die. This surge must be used within a number of rounds equal to your tier. An ally can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Shout of Defiance (Su):*** You can channel holy energy into a righteous shout of defiance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and one use of either channel energy or lay on hands to create a 100-foot spread of healing energy. All allies within this spread heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 plus double your tier. If this brings an ally from negative hit points to 0 hit points or more, the ally can immediately stand up from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Smiting Aura (Su):*** Whenever you use your smite evil ability, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a 20-foot-radius aura centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. Any evil creature that starts its turn in or moves into this area takes a number of points of damage equal to your tier. This damage comes from holy power, and is not affected by damage reduction or energy resistance. You must have the smite evil class ability to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Spirit Influence (Su):*** When you complete a seance, you can choose a number of allies equal to half your mythic tier (minimum 1). The chosen allies also gain your spirit's spirit bonus.",
			"",
			"***Stand Tall (Su):*** Before you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect that also targets one or more allies within 30 feet, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow your allies to use your saving throw result or their own, whichever is higher.",
			"",
			"***Tactical Genius (Su):*** You gain {main/feats_<a bonus |teamwork/ feat}. You must meet all prerequisites for the feat. Any ally within 30 feet of you counts as having that teamwork feat for the purposes of you gaining bonuses from the feat (the ally doesn't gain the bonus unless it actually has the feat). At the start of each day, you can spend 10 minutes and expend one use of mythic power to replace this teamwork feat with any other teamwork feat you qualify for. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time, you gain an additional bonus teamwork feat. If you have selected this ability more than once, at the start of each day you can replace any number of teamwork feats this ability grants you, spending time and uses of mythic power for each feat you replace.",
			"",
			"***Unwavering Skill (Ex):*** You can always take 10 or 20 on checks using class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20."

			"***Aura of Perseverance (Ex):*** Your leadership keeps your allies going even when they're at death's door. Allies within 30 feet of you don't become unconscious or disabled when reduced to 0 hit points or fewer. As soon as you and an ally at 0 hit points or fewer are more than 30 feet apart, that ally becomes unconscious or disabled. You can expend one use of mythic power to stabilize all dying allies within 30 feet and let all allies within this range ignore the staggered condition for a number of rounds equal to your tier.",
			"",
			"***Caster's Friend (Ex):*** You bolster the concentration of spellcasting allies standing next to you. A spellcaster who is adjacent to you gains a bonus on concentration checks equal to your tier. Furthermore, if a spellcaster fails a concentration check while adjacent to you, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to allow that spellcaster to instead automatically succeed at that concentration check.",
			"",
			"***Commanding Presence (Ex):*** Your force of presence is so overwhelming that others know what you want and can comprehend what you are saying even if they don't understand the words you speak. You can use your body language and tone of voice alone to ask questions and make statements to those who don't know your language. When they answer or respond to your communications, you must succeed at a DC 20 Sense Motive check to get the general idea of what they are saying in return. Furthermore, when you use a spell or ability with the language-dependent descriptor, you can still affect creatures that cannot understand the language you are using, but they must be able to hear you and must have an Intelligence score of 1 or higher.",
			"",
			"***Concentrated Barrage (Ex):*** You can direct your allies to attack as a unified force. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to enable two allies within 30 feet of you to each make a single ranged or melee attack at a target you designate. Allies must be able to attack the target (either with a ranged weapon or by being close enough to use a melee weapon), and may choose not to. Each attack is resolved using the attacker's highest base attack bonus, and this attack doesn't count toward the ally's total number of actions on its turn. At 6th tier and higher, you can affect up to three allies with this ability. At 9th tier and higher, you can affect up to four allies with this ability.",
			"",
			"***Confidence (Su):*** You can draw upon a deep reserve of confidence in times of need. You can call on confidence three times per day to use the surge mythic ability without expending one use of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you gain three additional uses of confidence per day.",
			"",
			"***Corner of the Eyes (Su) [Mordant Spire]:*** By focusing, you sense and analyze magical auras through your peripheral vision. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of arcane sight, except your eyes don't glow. You can maintain this ability for up to 1 minute per tier, but while using it you're staggered from the focus required. The staggered condition can't be removed as long as you maintain the effect, but you can cease focusing as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Demagogue (Su):*** You have an unnatural ability to call and sway crowds with your commanding presence and flawless rhetoric. When in a small town or larger settlement, you can expend one use of mythic power to [gather a crowd](rule/city_streets). Doing so takes 4d10 minutes. Add your tier to your Charisma bonus and then multiply the sum by 5 to determine how many creatures are in the crowd (as long as the settlement has a sufficient population to provide a crowd of that size, as determined by the GM). For example, a 4th-tier marshal with a +6 bonus to Charisma could gather as many as 50 creatures. The crowd remains for 1 hour, and you gain a +10 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to direct the crowd. You can expend another use of mythic power to extend the effect for another hour. This is a language-dependent effect.",
			"",
			"***Dispel Fear (Su):*** You can rally your allies and relieve their fear. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to either end all fear effects affecting allies within 30 feet of you, or end all fear effects on one ally within line of sight who can clearly see you and hear you.",
			"",
			"***Don't Cross Me (Ex):*** Even when you're away from your thralls, they fear and obey you. When you successfully use Intimidate to make someone helpful, you can expend one use of mythic power to cause the creature to remain helpful to you even in your absence for up to a number of days equal to your tier. At the beginning of each day, the creature may attempt a Will save; if it succeeds, this effect ends prematurely (DC equal to the result of your original Intimidate check minus 2 for each day since the creature last had direct contact with you). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"***Flexible Confidence (Ex):*** Your resolve is more useful that others'. You can expend the uses of your confidence ability as uses of mythic power for the purposes of your marshal path abilities.",
			"",
			"***Glorious Charge (Ex):*** You call your allies to make a coordinated charge at the same time. As an immediate action when you start a charge, you can expend one use of mythic power and allow an ally to charge immediately after your charge is complete. You can expend additional uses, allowing one more ally to charge per use spent. An ally's charge doesn't count toward the number of actions it can take on its next turn.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Martyrdom (Ex):*** Your friends and allies are compelled to fulfill your requests, even at the risk of their own safety. When you attempt a Diplomacy check to make a request of someone who has an attitude of helpful toward you, the DC of your Diplomacy check doesn't increase when you request dangerous aid or request aid that could result in punishment for your target. You can expend one use of mythic power to use this ability when attempting Intimidate checks, effectively allowing you to coerce someone into performing obviously dangerous or harmful acts. (Such use of this ability is often an evil act.) You must have the *persuasive countenance* marshal path ability to take this ability.",
			"",
			"***Master of Mercy (Su):*** Your touch provides great relief. If you have the mercy class feature, when you lay on hands, you can expend one use of mythic power to apply all the mercies of your level or lower instead of just the mercies you've selected. If you don't have the mercy class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to remove a single condition from a creature you touch, using your tier as your paladin level to determine what mercies are available to you. You can select a different mercy each time you use this ability.",
			"",
			"***Master of Shadows (Ex):*** You are a master of moving unseen and unheard, and adept at guiding others in quiet and undetected movement. When you or any ally within 30 feet attempts Stealth checks, each of you rolls twice and takes the higher result. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to one ally's next Stealth check. The ally must be within 30 feet and the check must occur within the next minute.",
			"",
			"***Mob Ruler (Sp):*** You can move a crowd to tranquility or whip it into a frenzy. By expending one use of mythic power, you can affect a large group of non-mythic creatures - anyone within 20 feet per tier who can see or hear you - with either {spell/rage} or {spell/calm emotions} (caster level equal to your character level). If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can escalate an already riotous crowd into {spell/confusion} (as the spell) or direct their ire toward a target of your choosing (as {spell/mass suggestion}).",
			"",
			"***Mythic Bond (Ex):*** Your hunter's bond ability is more powerful than most. If your bond is with an animal, that animal gains half your favored enemy bonuses. If your hunter's bond is with your companions, you can activate the bond as a swift action, granting your allies your full favored enemy bonus instead of just half.",
			"",
			"***Shared Alertness (Ex):*** Your presence and guidance allow others to avoid traps and other dangers. Allies within 30 feet of you that can clearly see and hear you gain your trap sense ability. If you have evasion or improved evasion, you can expend one use of your mythic power as an immediate action to grant that ability to one ally within 30 feet until the beginning of your next turn.",
			"",
			"***Shatter Resilience (Ex):*** You can channel your mythic power through your strike to lower your target's damage reduction. When you hit a creature that has DR, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of the attack to lower the target's DR by an amount equal to your tier (to a minimum of 0) for 1 minute. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.",
			"",
			"***Unfettered Spirit (Su):*** As an immediate action when an ally within 30 feet fails a d20 roll that could be modified by your spirit bonus, you can spend 1 point of mythic power and allow your spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over you to add your spirit surge die to the check's result. If the ally is receiving your spirit bonus from the spirit influence ability, you can choose to either spend your mythic power or allow your spirit to gain additional influence instead. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Words of Hope (Su):*** As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius, granting each of them the ability to roll twice and take the higher result on one attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. An ally can use this ability once per round for a number of rounds equal to half your tier, and must choose whether to roll twice before rolling the die. This is a language-dependent emotion effect."

			"",
			"***Beacon of Hope (Su):*** You radiate a supernatural aura that fills your allies with hope and resolve. All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus against fear and emotion effects, and a +4 bonus on stabilization checks. Furthermore, each time one of these allies is subject to a healing spell or effect, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to your tier. Once per day as a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and end this aura to heal all allies within 30 feet of an amount of damage equal to 1d6 hit points per tier you possess. If dismissed, the aura automatically reactivates 24 hours later.",
			"",
			"***Castigate (Su):*** While your words can soothe and aid your friends, they are equally adept at assaulting your foes. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to unleash a scathing verbal assault that demoralizes all opponents within 30 feet for 1 minute, as if you had successfully used the Intimidate skill. These opponents must be able to clearly see and hear you, but this ability is not language dependent.",
			"",
			"***Fast Friends (Su):*** You have such a way with words that you can befriend entire groups of people with a single utterance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to improve the attitudes of all non-mythic creatures within 30 feet by one step. You can use this ability multiple times to improve these creatures' attitudes by multiple steps. Mythic creatures receive a Will save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to negate this effect. The improvement to attitude lasts a number of hours equal to your tier. This ability is generally ineffective in combat (except perhaps to sway the attitude of a crowd of bystanders or an unaffiliated neutral party) or against creatures that intend to harm you and your allies in the immediate future.",
			"",
			"***Fight On (Su):*** With an order or a determined look, you spur a wounded ally to keep fighting. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.",
			"",
			"***Free Your Mind (Su):*** You can reach into the mind of your allies and free them from unwanted influence. You can spend 1 point of mythic power as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting an ally within 30 feet. The effect immediately affects you instead, and you receive a saving throw to resist the effect as if you were the original target. If you succeed, the effect has no effect on you; otherwise, you are subject to it. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Inspiring Assault (Su):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.",
			"",
			"***Stones Will Weep (Su):*** Your art can awaken the spirits of beasts, plants, and even the elements. You can attempt Perform checks in place of Handle Animal checks. You can expend one use of mythic power to speak with animals (as speak with animals), plants (as speak with plants) and elements (as stone tell, except this effect targets fire, wind, and water as well as earth) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. While speaking with plants or the elements, you can also request their aid, effectively allowing you to use animate objects, animate plants, control water, control winds, and stone shape. You must expend one use of mythic power as well as one use of bardic performance for each round you want to use these spell-like abilities, and on each round you can simultaneously use a number of these abilities equal to half your tier. You must have the bardic performance ability to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Surge of Inspiration (Su):*** Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.",
			"",
			"***Unswerving Loyalty (Su):*** You are a bastion of strength and resolve, and you possess the ability to protect your mind from even the most powerful charms and compulsions. You gain immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, though you can choose to be affected by them if you wish. When subject to a mind-affecting effect from a mythic source, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain immunity to that effect.",
			"",
			"***Words of Valor (Su):*** With a mere speech, you empower your allies to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects of the spell heroism and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier. Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power."

Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding - but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** Members of any class that relies on skills would make good tricksters, as would those who heavily utilize ranged combat or magical methods of subterfuge. The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.",

			"*Deadly Throw (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to draw a thrown weapon or alchemical item and make a ranged attack with it. This attack doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. When making a deadly throw, roll twice for the attack, take the higher result, and add your tier to the roll. If the attack misses, the weapon or alchemical item lands adjacent to the target, regardless of the range.",
			"",
			"*Fleet Charge (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to move up to your speed. At any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"*Surprise Strike (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee attack or ranged attack against a target within 30 feet, in addition to any other attacks you make this round. When you make a surprise strike, the target is considered flat-footed regardless of any class features or abilities it might have, and you add your tier to the attack roll. Damage from this attack bypasses damage reduction.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the trickster path abilities lists or from the {rule/universal path abilities/ lists}. Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***Supreme Trickster (Su):*** At 10th tier, whenever you make an attack roll against a non-mythic foe, that foe is treated as flat-footed, even if it has abilities that prevent it from being flat-footed. Once per round when you roll a natural 20 on an opposed skill check against a mythic foe, you regain one use of mythic power."

			"***Aim for the Eye (Ex):*** You can home in on your targets with uncanny and supernatural accuracy. You can make ranged sneak attacks from up to 60 feet away (rather than 30 feet). When calculating range penalties for ranged attacks, you are always considered to be one range increment closer to the target than you actually are. Whenever you successfully score a critical hit against a flat-footed creature with a ranged attack, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to blind that creature for 1d4+1 rounds. A mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Dexterity modifier). Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are creatures with unusual anatomies (GM's discretion).",
			"",
			"***Assured Drinker (Ex):*** No one can stop you from imbibing, even in combat. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when drinking an elixir, extract, or potion. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve and drink an elixir, extract, or potion.",
			"",
			"***Assured Skill (Ex):*** In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you roll a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.",
			"",
			"***Astounding Disable (Ex):*** Whenever you use Disable Device to disarm a trap or open a lock, doing so is only a move action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Clown (Su):*** As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one creature laugh uncontrollably, as the hideous laughter spell. The saving throw against this effect is equal to 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. If you aren't in combat when you use this ability, it can affect any number of creatures in a burst with a radius of 10 feet per tier.",
			"",
			"***Combat Trickery (Ex):*** Through buffoonery and deceit, you can trick opponents into moving where you want them. You can make a single combat maneuver check using your Bluff check modifier in place of your CMB. Apply the result of this check to all adjacent opponents, and resolve it for each enemy independently as a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver. For example, if facing three opponents, you can roll one check and attempt to bull rush the first, drag the second, and reposition the third.",
			"",
			"***Compelling Feint (Ex):*** Your parries, attacks, and dodges are sporadic and difficult to predict by those who oppose you. Whenever you feint, you can choose to feint against all opponents within 10 feet, using the same Bluff check for each opponent. If you expend one use of mythic power while you're feinting, any target you successfully feint against is considered flat-footed against the first attack any creature makes against it before its next turn. You must use this ability after your Bluff check is rolled but before the results are revealed.",
			"",
			"***Control the Mindless (Su):*** You can gain control over mindless constructs and undead. Using this ability is a standard action, and requires you to make a Knowledge check against the target's CMD. Use a Knowledge (arcana) check against a mindless construct, or a Knowledge (religion) check against a mindless undead. If your check equals or exceeds the creature's CMD, you can give the creature an order that lasts up to 1 round. For every 5 by which you beat the DC, your control lasts 1 additional round. The creature's creator or controller can't regain control during this time unless it also uses this ability. If you expend one use of mythic power when attempting to use this ability, the duration of your control increases from rounds to an equal number of minutes.",
			"",
			"***Crime Spree (Su):*** As a standard action when not in combat, you can attempt two Sleight of Hand checks to take items from other creatures, but you take a -5 penalty on each check. As a standard action in combat, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against each creature within your reach that you choose, without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Deadly Dodge (Ex):*** As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. During this time, whenever a creature misses on a melee attack against you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can choose to either take this attack of opportunity or force that creature to reroll the attack and change the target to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the attacker's reach. This reroll uses the same modifiers as the initial attack roll.",
			"",
			"***Defensive Move (Ex):*** Once per round, you can designate one opponent. Unless you attempt to move through that opponent's space, your movement (including standing up from a prone position) doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that opponent. If you move through the opponent's space, you can still attempt an Acrobatics check to do so without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can take this ability more than once. Each additional time you select it, you can designate one additional opponent when you move.",
			"",
			"***Down Like Dominoes (Ex):*** When you successfully trip a foe, as a free action you can attempt an additional trip attack against a creature adjacent to the first foe tripped at a -4 penalty. The adjacent creature must be no more than one size category larger than the creature you just tripped. If this second trip is successful, you can continue to attempt to trip creatures as long as they are adjacent to the last one successfully tripped, taking a cumulative -4 penalty on each trip attempt after the first. In a round, you can trip a number of creatures equal to half your tier in this way, and only until your first failed trip attempt. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping additional foes with this ability, and if you fail a trip attempt after the first there's no chance of you tripping yourself.",
			"",
			"***Enhance Magic Items (Ex):*** Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.",
			"",
			"***Faster than the Eye (Ex):*** Few can trace your expert skills of legerdemain. You can use Sleight of Hand to lift or plant objects as a move action with no penalty. When you use Sleight of Hand to steal something, the target takes a penalty equal to your tier on its Perception check to notice the theft. You can use Sleight of Hand to plant a small object on someone else. When doing so, you use the same method and bonuses as you would for lifting the same item.",
			"",
			"***Ghostly Performance (Su):*** Whenever you use bardic performance, you don't need to spend an action to maintain the effect. This means you can maintain the performance if paralyzed or stunned, although it still ends if you are unconscious or dead. You must still expend rounds of bardic performance to continue the effect. Once you start a performance, its effect continues whether or not the subjects can perceive you or the performance. When the performance ends, its effects linger for a number of rounds equal to your tier. This extended duration stacks with any other abilities that extend the duration of your performance, such as Lingering Performance. This ability doesn't change how many active performances you can have at once.",
			"",
			"***Impeccable Balance (Ex):*** Even the smallest of handholds and outcroppings are more than sufficient for your purposes. You automatically succeed at all Acrobatics checks to walk along narrow ledges. Your Acrobatics checks never take a penalty because of obstructed, slippery, sloped, or unsteady surfaces, and you can move at full speed across such surfaces with no penalty. You also gain a +10 bonus to CMD against trip attacks.",
			"",
			"***Improbable Prestidigitation (Su):*** You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check to hide or retrieve objects in a personal extradimensional space, similar to a glove of storing. You can take 10 or 20 on this check, and the space can hold up to 1 cubic foot of material per tier. An item the size of a potion or dagger can be stored or retrieved with a successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check; the DC increases to 25 for an item roughly the size of a one-handed weapon. Storing an item is a swift action, and retrieving it is a move action. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve any number of items from your extradimensional space.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Minions (Ex):*** When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"***Knot Expert (Ex):*** You can tie knots in rope with a flick of your wrist, and can do so from the far end of the rope. You can tie a knot in any rope you hold, including turning it into a lasso, as a swift action. You can also use a whip, lasso, spiked chain, or similar weapon to constrict an opponent. In order to do so, you must make a successful attack with the rope-like weapon, after which you can, as a swift action, attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature, adding your tier to your combat maneuver check. If you are successful, the creature is considered to be grappled, though you are not, and you can deal {umr/constrict} damage to the creature equal to the amount of damage you could normally deal with the weapon used.",
			"",
			"***Master Dilettante (Ex):*** You are passingly familiar with almost every subject and have dabbled in numerous fields and activities. You gain a competence bonus equal to your tier on all untrained skill checks. You can attempt all skill checks untrained, even if the skill normally cannot be used untrained.",
			"",
			"***Master of Escape (Su):*** You can use the Escape Artist skill to break free from spells and magical effects that limit your movement or actions. While you're subject to a spell or effect that gives you the entangled, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned condition, once per round as a free action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check to end the condition. The DC for this check is equal to the save DC of the spell or effect that caused the condition. If you succeed, you end one such condition on yourself (your choice), though this doesn't make you immune to similar effects from the same source (such as moving through black tentacles or web). If the spell or effect doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't use this ability to overcome it.",
			"",
			"***Nimble Glide (Ex):*** Whenever you fall, you don't take any damage and you land on your feet. When using this ability, you fall at a rate of 150 feet per round, and can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall.",
			"",
			"***No One of Consequence (Ex):*** Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, you're under a permanent nondetection effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action.",
			"",
			"***Path Dabbling (Su):*** Select one path ability from another mythic path. You must meet any other requirements that path ability has, including a minimum tier restriction.",
			"",
			"***Persuasive Countenance (Su):*** Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Disable (Ex):*** As a standard action, you can use a thrown weapon or reach weapon to attempt a Disable Device check to disable a device. If you're using a thrown weapon, the range of this ability is 30 feet; otherwise, it's your reach with the reach weapon. You take a -5 penalty on the check and can't take 10 on the check, even if you have an ability that would normally allow you to do so. If you expend one use of mythic power, you ignore the -5 penalty and can attempt the check in place of an attack (such as if making a full attack or attack of opportunity).",
			"",
			"***Rebounding Stare (Su):*** You can cause your hypnotic stare to bounce between creatures. When you use your hypnotic stare, you can spend 1 point of mythic power to affect an additional creature within 30 feet of the original target with the stare for 1 round. You can affect additional creatures up to your mythic tier. You can maintain additional stares by spending 1 point of mythic power per additional stare each round.",
			"",
			"***Redirect Attention (Ex):*** You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose - and away from others. Non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-foot-cone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"***Ricochet (Ex):*** Whenever a creature has cover from your ranged attack, you can deflect the shot off a nearby surface, treating that surface as the origin point of the attack to determine whether the target receives a cover bonus to its AC. You can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from you if you know what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.",
			"",
			"***Shadow Stealth (Ex):*** Whenever you're in darkness, you can move at full speed within that area without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to teleport from one area of darkness to another within 100 feet as if using greater teleport. You must have line of effect to the destination.",
			"",
			"***Sniper's Riposte (Ex):*** You're an expert at defending yourself while aiming a ranged weapon. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity from making ranged attacks. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the Stealth check penalty for sniping for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Subtle Magic (Ex):*** Whenever you cast a spell or activate a spell trigger or spell completion magic item, you can attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by a Sense Motive check from anyone that can see you. Those who fail the opposed check don't know that you cast a spell or activated an item unless it has an obvious effect that emanates from you. In addition, the magical auras of magical effects on you and magic items you carry (except for artifacts) can't be detected.",
			"",
			"***Supreme Stealth (Ex):*** Choose one of the following senses: blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. A creature using the chosen sense can't automatically detect you, and must succeed at Perception checks as normal to do so. If you choose blindsight, this ability also affects blindsense. You can select this ability up to three times, each time choosing a different sense.",
			"",
			"***This Might Just Work (Ex):*** You're adept at combining optimistic resourcefulness with natural skill. You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a -5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it. The GM can disallow certain uses of this ability when the skill can't possibly be applied to the task.",

			"***Thwart Detection (Su):*** You can bypass magical constructs, spells, and traps that are meant to allow only certain creatures to move or act within their range. This includes constructs, spells, and traps that can be bypassed with a password as well as those that can be programmed to exclude specific creatures based on type or other physical characteristics (such as alarm, forbiddance, glyph of warding, and symbol of death). You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.",
			"",
			"***Titan's Bane (Ex):*** You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks it makes, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.",
			"",
			"***Transfer Magic (Su):*** Your mythic nature allows you to take magic from others as easily as you could take their gold. By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target. If the transferred magic can't affect you (for example, if it doesn't affect creatures of your type), it ends immediately as if dispelled. You can't use this ability to transfer continuous bonuses from magic items, such as an armor bonus from bracers of armor.",
			"",
			"***Trap Taker (Ex):*** You can use the Use Magic Device skill instead of Disable Device to disable magical traps. If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.",
			"",
			"***Treacherous Critical (Ex):*** When you score a critical threat, you can attempt a free combat maneuver check instead of dealing extra damage. If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result. If the result is equal to or greater than your opponent's CMD, the attack deals damage as normal and you can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against that opponent, using the confirmation roll as your combat maneuver check for the purpose of determining the effects of the maneuver.",
			"",
			"***Unintentional Feint (Ex):*** You make near misses look like expert feints, and your efforts are rarely wasted. If you make an attack roll that misses your original target, you can expend one use of mythic power to specify a second target, which must be adjacent to you (if a melee attack) or the original target (if a ranged attack). If the second target would be hit by what you rolled, you hit that target and deal damage as normal.",
			"",
			"***Unwavering Skill (Ex):*** You can always take 10 or 20 on class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20.",
			"",
			"***Wall Run (Ex):*** When you move, you can travel across vertical surfaces as if they were floors. If your movement doesn't end on a horizontal surface, you fall at the end of your move unless you are able to remain in place using another ability (such as using the Climb skill to cling to a handhold). The vertical surface must be capable of supporting your weight - for example, you couldn't move across a windowpane or curtain."

This attack doesn't deal any damage to the object. The condition can be removed by spending 1 minute undoing the sabotage, or instantaneously with mending or a similar spell.",

			"***Critical Skill (Su):*** Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a skill check, you perform that skill with exceptional proficiency. Typically, this means that the task takes half the normal amount of time to accomplish. If the skill would normally take a full-round action, it instead takes a standard action. If it would normally take a standard or move action, it instead takes a swift action. If it would normally take a swift or free action, it instead takes no time at all.

The trap's CR can't be higher than your tier, and the trap remains in the place you designate for a number of hours equal to your tier.

You leave no tracks (as pass without trace), and ignore adverse effects from nonmagical difficult terrain and ground hazards, including caltrops.

			"",
			"***Mirror Dodge (Su):*** When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the teleportation target square.",

			"***Perfect Lie (Ex):*** When telling a lie, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the lie indiscernible from the truth by both Sense Motive and magic. Obvious proof of your falsehood still reveals the lie for what it is, but in absence of proof, those who hear your lie believe it.",

This allows you to better mimic the individual, granting you a further +10 bonus on opposed Disguise skill checks. The target of your impersonation receives a Will saving throw (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to negate the detect thoughts aspect of this ability.",

			"***Bloody Streak (Ex):*** Whenever you successfully deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to heighten your bloodshed. Thereafter, every consecutive round that you deal sneak attack damage, add a cumulative +1d6 bonus on your sneak attack damage roll. The targets of these sneak attacks don't need to be the same. You can gain a maximum number of bonus d6s on your sneak attack damage in this way equal to your tier. As soon as you fail to deal sneak attack damage to a creature in a round, this effect ends and you no longer gain the bonus on sneak attack damage until you use this ability again. For example, a 10th-level rogue, 6th-tier trickster uses this ability after dealing 5d6 points of sneak attack damage to a foe. On the next round, she deals 6d6 points of sneak attack damage to a foe (5d6 from her rogue levels + 1d6 from this ability).

You replicate that ability and place it into an item you hold for 10 minutes per tier.

You can't copy an ability that has a limited number of uses per day (such as rage, smite evil, or spellcasting) or an ability that involves a companion (such as eidolon, hunter's bond, or nature bond).

You can have this ability in effect on only one elixir, extract, or potion at a time. Using it on a second one causes the duration of the first to revert to normal - and to end immediately if the normal duration would have expired. If you're at least 9th tier, you can select this ability a second time to have it work on extracts and potions with a duration of 1 minute or longer.",

The target must have at least one use of mythic power available. If the attack hits, attempt an opposed d20 roll against the target, adding your tier. If your total exceeds that of the target, the target loses one use of mythic power and you gain one use. You can use this ability on a given creature only once per day.",

Whenever you use a spell, bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, you can designate any one creature affected by this bonus. The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time.

Whenever you confirm a critical hit with a splash weapon, you can expend one use of mythic power to forgo the multiplied damage against your target and instead deal a direct hit to both the target and a creature adjacent to the target. Creatures adjacent to either of these two creatures take splash damage.",
			"",
			"***Touched by the Depths (Su) [Mordant Spire]:*** You gain the {umr/hold breath} ability. You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to gain a swim speed equal to your land speed, the ability to breathe water, and tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet that only functions while under water. The ability to breathe water does not hinder your ability to breathe air. These effects last for 10 minutes per mythic tier.",
			"",
			"***Voice of the Spire (Su) [Mordant Spire]:*** A voice only you can hear warns you of peril. If you're unaware at the start of a surprise round, you can expend one use of mythic power to act in that surprise round. When acting in a surprise round, you can expend two uses of mythic power to take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round action) in the surprise round. This ability doesn't prevent you from being flat-footed before you have acted."

			"",
			"***Beyond Morality (Ex):*** You have no alignment. You can become a member of any class, even one with an alignment requirement, and can never lose your membership because of a change in alignment. If you violate the code of ethics of any of your classes, you might still lose access to certain features of such classes, subject to GM discretion. Attempts to detect your alignment don't return any results. If a class restricts you from casting spells with an alignment descriptor, you can cast such spells without restrictions or repercussions. If you're the target of a spell or effect that is based on alignment, you're treated as the most favorable alignment when determining the spell's effect on you. Any effects that alter alignment have no effect on you. If you lose this effect, you revert to your previous alignment.",
			"",
			"***Binding Ritual (Su):*** You have learned the eldritch rituals required to draw creatures from the planes into your presence. If you are a spellcaster, you add the following spells to your list of spells known: {spell/binding}, {spell/dimensional anchor}, {spell/magic circle against chaos}, {spell/magic circle against evil}, {spell/magic circle against good}, {spell/magic circle against law}, {spell/planar binding}, {spell/planar binding (greater)}, and {spell/planar binding (lesser)}. If these spells are not normally on your class list, you add them to your list of spells known at the level they appear on the sorcerer/wizard spell list, though you do not gain spells whose level exceeds the level of spells your class can cast.",
			"",
			"Whether or not you are a spellcaster, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a magic circle (of any type) as part of a calling diagram; if you expend an additional use of your mythic power, this diagram is fortified with dimensional anchor. If you are at least 9th level, you may also spend two uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/lesser planar binding} as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 11th level and 6th tier, you can expend three uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/planar binding} as a spell-like ability. If you are at least 15th level and 9th tier, you can expend four uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/greater planar binding} as a spell-like ability. For all these effects, treat your mythic tier as your caster level, unless your own caster level is higher.",
			"",
			"***Defy Death (Su) [Cenotaph]:*** As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +5 bonus on a single saving throw made to resist energy drain, a death effect, or a negative level becoming permanent. You can select this path ability multiple times. If you take it a second time, you gain a +10 bonus on saving throws to resist the above effects. If you take it three times, you can instead expend one use of mythic power to automatically succeed at a saving throw made to resist the above effects.",
			"",
			"***Divine Source (Su):*** You can grant divine spells to those who follow your cause, allowing them to select you as their deity for the purposes of determining their spells and domains. Select two domains upon taking this ability. These domains must be alignment domains matching your alignment if possible, unless your alignment is neutral. You grant access to these domains as if you were a deity. Creatures that gain spells from you don't receive any spells per day of levels higher than your tier; they lose those spell slots. In addition, you can cast spells from domains you grant as long as their level is equal to or less than your tier. Each day as a spell-like ability, you can cast one spell of each level equal to or less than your tier (selecting from those available to you from your divine source domains). If you're a cleric or you venerate a deity, you may change your spell domains to those you grant others. At 6th tier and 9th tier, you can select this ability again, adding one domain and two subdomains to your list each time and adding their spells to the list of those that you can cast.",
			"",
			"***Enhanced Ability (Ex):*** You gain a permanent +2 bonus to one ability score of your choice. You can select this path ability up to six times. Each time you do, it must apply to a different ability score.",
			"",
			"***Fearless (Su):*** Few things in the world still inspire fear in you. You are immune to all fear effects from non-mythic sources. Fear effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Interplanar Prestige (Ex, Sp):*** Your mighty accomplishments have drawn the notice of creatures beyond your home plane. You gain a bonus equal to half your mythic tier on Diplomacy checks against outsiders with an alignment subtype that matches at least one portion of your alignment, and on Intimidate checks against outsiders with an alignment subtype that opposes at least one portion of your alignment. If you have the {feat/Leadership} feat, you add half your mythic tier to your Leadership score for the purpose of attracting an outsider cohort.",
			"",
			"In addition, if you are at least 7th level, you can expend two uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/lesser planar ally} as a spell-like ability, treating your mythic tier as your caster level. If you are at least 11th level and 6th tier, you can expend three uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/planar ally}. If you are at least 15th level and 9th tier, you can expend four uses of your mythic power to cast {spell/greater planar ally}. You must provide the required offering to bargain for your ally's service.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Contact (Su):*** You learn the true name of a particularly powerful and knowledgeable outsider with up to 20 Hit Dice. When using your outside contact class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power to conjure this particularly potent contact instead of one of your other contacts. If you do, the contact can provide much more detailed information, such as anything that can be learned with a {spell/legend lore} spell, and the contact can provide the information immediately. However, the cost is much higher: typically 1,000 gp, although in some cases the contact may instead accept services or an exchange of information. As with outside contact, you can attempt to bargain with the contact, using Diplomacy or Intimidate to try to halve the payment cost. Failure causes the cost to be doubled, and failure by 5 or more causes the mythic contact to depart without providing information of any kind. Typically, a mythic contact will not lower itself to delivering messages, but at the GM's discretion, it may be willing to perform other services for you in exchange for appropriate compensation. You must be at least 3rd tier and have the outside contact class feature to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Pure Body (Su):*** Your body is so pure that you're immune to all non-mythic diseases and poisons. Diseases and poisons from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Pure Destiny (Su):*** Your mythic destiny is guided by providence. You're immune to all non-mythic curses and compulsions. Curses and compulsions from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Pure Senses (Su):*** Your senses are extraordinarily keen. You're immune to blindness and deafness caused by non-mythic sources. Such effects from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Sleepless (Su):*** You no longer require sleep, don't become fatigued or exhausted from lack of sleep, and are immune to sleep effects. If you have abilities or class features that require rest before they can be regained, you can choose to regain them once per day by spending 1 hour in uninterrupted meditation.",
			"",
			"***Spellscarred (Su) [Mana Well]:*** When you're targeted by or inside the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, you can call upon your mythic power to gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your character level + your mythic tier against that effect alone. If the spell fails to bypass your spell resistance, one of your uses of mythic power is expended; otherwise, the ability has no cost. Using this ability doesn't require an action, but you must be aware of the effect, be able to take actions, have at least one use of mythic power remaining, and not be flat-footed to use this ability.",
			"",
			"***Telepathic Mindlink (Sp) [Doorway to the Red Star]:*** You can expend one use of mythic power to cast sending or telepathic bond with a caster level equal to double your tier. If you take this path ability twice, you gain a permanent telepathic bond with one other creature. You can change the creature with whom you share the bond in a special ritual that takes 1 hour.",
			"",
			"***Ultimate Versatility (Ex):*** Once per day, you can temporarily change one decision made for one of your class features. This change lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. During this time, you're treated as if you had always had the new class feature. For example, you could use this ability to change the decision made with the arcane bond class feature, causing your bonded item to disappear (along with all of its bonuses and restrictions) and a familiar to appear in its place. This doesn't affect any prepared spells or spells you have already cast. If the new ability is limited in its uses per day, you receive half the normal number of uses (minimum 1). When this ability ends, your previous choice returns with the same number of uses as before you used this ability. If you use this ability to change a class feature that grants access to spells (such as a bloodline, patron, domain, or school), you lose access to any spells from the old choice but don't gain the ability to cast new spells. When the effect ends, the previous spells return and can be cast again. You can use this ability to change a feat or skill if you receive it from a class feature, but any other abilities that rely on the missing feat or skill as a prerequisite don't function while this ability is in effect.",
			"",
			"***Unchanging (Su):*** Your form is so stable that you become immune to non-mythic polymorph and petrification effects. Polymorph and petrification from mythic sources count as mythic for the purposes of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Waters of Contemplation (Su) [Doorway to the Red Star]:*** You can meditate for 1 hour and expend one use of mythic power to transmute any magical potion into an alchemical [cognatogen](class/alchemist) that increases your mental faculties at the expense of your physical prowess usable only by you. Your effective alchemist level for this cognatogen is equal to your tier plus your alchemist level. If you are at least 6th tier, you can use this ability to create a greater cognatogen. If you are at least 9th tier, you can use this ability to create a grand cognatogen. If you expend one additional use of mythic power when brewing the waters of contemplation, you gain the benefit of tongues for as long as the cognatogen lasts."

			"",
			"***Mythic Presence (Su):*** Your power unnerves ordinary mortals. By expending one use of mythic power, you gain an effect similar to frightful presence, except that creatures are affected according to their tier (or rank, in the case of monsters) instead of their Hit Dice. Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves are panicked for 1 minute, and those that succeed are shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank equal to or less than your tier are unaffected if they succeed, and are shaken for 1 minute if they fail. Creatures with a mythic tier or rank higher than yours are unaffected by your mythic presence. The Will save against your mythic presence equals 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. This ability lasts for 1 minute and has a range of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Sight (Sp):*** When you take this ability, you gain blindsense out to a range of 30 feet. You can take this ability twice. The second time you take it, you can see illusions and magical deceptions for what they truly are, as if using true seeing. This ability doesn't apply to illusions and magical effects that were cast by other mythic creatures or that are affecting other mythic creatures. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Phantom Possession (Su):*** As a full-round action, by expending one use of mythic power, you can invite your phantom to control your body while you project your spirit incorporeally. While your spirit is outside of your body in this fashion, you become incorporeal and gain a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect), but your statistics remain otherwise unchanged. Your projected spirit has incorporeal versions of all of your equipment, although consumable equipment and equipment with limited numbers of charges or uses cannot be used while incorporeal. At the same time, your phantom takes control of your body, as the spell {spell/possession}. You can end the effect at any time by returning to your body, and it ends automatically after 1 minute per mythic tier unless you expend an additional use of mythic power to extend the duration. If your spiritual form is slain, your spirit returns to your body automatically and the effect ends. You must be at least 6th tier and have the phantom class feature to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Tongues (Sp):*** You can understand and speak any language, as the tongues spell. If this ability is dispelled, you can resume it as a free action."
