			"",
			"**Freeze and Thaw (Su)** At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Hyperboreal Patronage** A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the following class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice, 5th-icy prison, 7th-freezing sphere.",
			"",
			"**Ice Magic** When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp)** At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Unnatural Cold (Su)** At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining damage dealt.",
			"",
			"**Winter Witchcraft** Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when the winter witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.",

Though the future is uncertain for any orc amid the chaos and bloodshed of battle, it's even more treacherous for those who bear their tribes' banners and are marked with the ceremonial symbols of a warchief, for they must ever watch for challengers to their authority - both outside enemies and ambitious members of their own tribe."

			"Inside the shadowed, silent reaches of the Uskwood Forest in Nidal, albino druids watch for intruders and enforce the natural order as they see it. These \"pale ones,\" as those who live near the Uskwood all them, serve the majesty of the Midnight Lord, Zon-Kuthon. Sworn and bonded to the Uskwood's bleak power, they celebrate the inevitable pain and death inherent to the natural order. To live is to know suffering, and the druids of the Uskwood ensure that any intruders in their forest know the full measure of pain.",
			"",
			"Like many of the evil creatures of Nidal, the Uskwood druids come out after dusk, patrolling above and below the canopies. Because the forest is unnaturally dark, they often transform into animal forms that have darkvision so that they can watch over their home in the darkest hours of night. Under the fragile moonlight that manages to penetrate the Uskwood, the druids' white skin shines like a beacon. They have no need for stealth on their patrols - their confidence as masters of the wood is absolute. Travelers who want to pass through the Uskwood can take their chances during the day, but to survive the crossing, they must hide themselves carefully once the sun sets, remaining as silent and concealed as possible throughout the night.",
			"",
			"During the day, the druids meet secretly to share resources, initiate new members, and plan for the betterment of the forest. Though they all serve Zon-Kuthon and the Uskwood, the druids clash with each other regularly, especially when they catch sight of one another during their nightly patrols, becoming wild whenever one trespasses into another's territory. Zon-Kuthon is, after all, the god of envy, and they believe it pleases him when they battle to claim what they can from one another. The druids wild shape into albino animal forms for their primordial battles, screaming and roaring as they crash through the underbrush and spill one another's blood in unholy ritual combat. An Uskwood druid who wins such a battle captures and shackles the animal companion of his slain rival, keeping the creature alive for as long as possible but never freeing it or giving it any release from its suffering. By doing this, the victorious Uskwood druid can relive his triumph and savor over and over the defeat of his enemy, as the druids see that the connection between a slain druid and his orphaned animal companion is not entirely diminished when one dies; indeed, there remains a sliver of the bond between the two creatures' souls. Despite this belief, it is not uncommon for Uskwood druids to sacrifice their own animal companions in somber rituals to the Midnight Lord, so that their own souls may suffer the pain of their bonded animals.",
			"",
			"Umbrae-Tokens, grotesque effigies of hair, twigs, and clotted blood, symbolize Uskwood druids' connection to the forest and their faith in Zon-Kuthon. The druids accept only albinos into their ranks (of any race, but most frequently humans, elves, and half-elves). Whether a potential initiate is already a druid or wishes to become one, he must gather the raw materials for his Umbrae-Token from different areas of the Uskwood without using any spells to procure them. This is a long, arduous process, and the suffering the initiate undergoes is absolutely the most essential part of it. This metaphysical link grants the druid some powers over necromancy and undeath, and forbids him from making use of flames that might set the forest ablaze. Even the light that fire brings to the forest is blasphemy to an Uskwood druid, and kindling a campfire within its reaches invites certain death.",

			"",
			"This dire bat resembles most predators of the Uskwood: cruel, feral, and unnerving. There's no clear division between predator and prey in the forest. Even the smallest creatures, such as centipedes, insects, and arachnids, tend to be venomous, and the largest predators might be brought down by a group of other vicious beasts. Only the Uskwood druids and their magic can control these monsters.

These days she's something of a loner, but still keeps an eye out for promising young halflings similar to herself as a child, so that she might pass on her advice and training.

She is far more likely to ally with a party that contains other halflings, though those who rely too much on racial camaraderie may be surprised by how quickly her backslapping friendship disappears if they dare question her methods."
