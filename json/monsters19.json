Many pipefoxes are especially intrigued by spellcasters, and sometimes they offer to serve them as either familiars or confidants.",

Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most pixies) - the dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits - it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow. Save DCs are Charisma-based.",

Most pixies stand just over 2 feet tall - though they typically fly about the eye level of creatures they're conversing with in order to maintain eye contact - and weigh about 30 pounds. Pixies talk quickly and easily become overexcited.",
			"",
			"Strange beings both of and beyond the natural world, pixies have magic that occasionally favors them in strange ways. For example, one out of every 10 pixies exhibits an additional spell-like ability that it can use once per day (caster level 8th), usually baleful polymorph, beast shape II (Tiny creatures only), or even a powerful spell like irresistible dance. Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows - as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects. Confusion, fear, hideous laughter, and hypnotism are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers. You should take care when assigning alternate powers to a pixie, though, since doing so can create a threat that far exceeds what their physical statistics (and relatively low CR) can logically support."

			"The pixie circle is an aggressive invasive species that opportunistically drains energy from nearby plant and animal life to fuel its teleporting abilities. It uses these abilities to remove potential threats from its habitat, typically teleporting creatures away when it is threatened or hurt. These sturdy vines are resistant to heat, cold, and drought conditions, and an infestation is notoriously difficult to root out once it has taken hold. A mature pixie circle measures 20 feet in diameter and is always in flower regardless of the season.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"While it shares a passing resemblance to wisteria or honeysuckle, pixie circle behaves like mistletoe and parasitically attaches itself to larger plants and trees while it establishes itself. Smaller infestations do not flower and can be difficult to detect, as the pixie circle tends to blend in with its host foliage. Once the plant is mature enough to put out flowers, it is large enough to attack and teleport victims, and continues to grow at an astonishing rate.",
			"",
			"The flowers of a pixie circle resemble the multicolored wings of {monster/pixie/s} when seen from a distance, making them a clear signal for people aware of the plant to keep their distance. Its growths can easily dominate large trees and can cover small cottages in a single season. Left unchecked, the plant can overwhelm groves or entire sections of woodlands, burying everything living beneath the pretty green and purple vines and leaving wide patches of dead forest in its wake.",
			"",
			"The plant is opportunistic in nature and initially prefers to absorb energy from host trees before progressing to insects, small birds, and eventually the larger animal life that wanders into range. As a result, most humanoids encounter the vine only when it is large enough to be a threat. Because of its growth pattern, a pixie circle tends to form a ring around an open meadow, creating a natural lure for large herbivores and adventurers seeking a safe place to camp. Adventurers with sharp eyes and knowledge of the natural world can recognize these meadows by their odd circular pattern and the unnatural silence within them. The vines of well-established patches typically hide the bones of previous victims, animal and humanoid alike. The belongings of the deceased are often in excellent condition, as scavengers tend to avoid these remains.",
			"",
			"Pixie circles spread underground using offshoots strong enough to punch through clay and rocky soils. Solid rock or a brick wall can contain the runners within a garden, but such barriers must extend at least 6 feet belowground. Clippings and small pieces will take root within a week if left in contact with fertile soil. Pixie circles are also self-pollinating, and their seeds are light enough to carry on wind. This makes containment of the plant extremely difficult, as these seeds can cover several miles of distance with a slight breeze.",
			"",
			"Once a pixie circle reaches its full size, it secretes a unique toxin from all of its vines. This toxin dries out cells and causes a pixie circle's victims to grow weak, making it difficult for prey to escape. In addition to its predatory applications, this toxin is also laced with arcane energies. Once the toxin is flowing through a victim's veins, the pixie circle can attempt to harness the arcane energy to transport the creature to another pixie circle elsewhere.",
			"",
			"Scholars disagree as to the exact details of a pixie circle's teleportation abilities. Some believe that the pixie circle developed these abilities to keep its particular habitat clear of any predators or competition for food. Others claim that this ability allows them to propagate much more easily as a species, as it allows pixie circles to share prey with each other. This becomes especially useful for pixie circles attempting to establish footholds in new territories.",
			"",
			"Some adventurers risk intentionally provoking these plants to benefit from their teleportation abilities. Those who have studied pixie circles know that they are more intelligent than they let on. By speaking with a pixie circle, these insightful adventurers can convince it to teleport a target without the need for combat. The pixie circle will send willing targets to another pixie circle of their choice, though this process still requires exposure to a pixie circle's toxin. While painful, this is a somewhat reliable process, and bold druids and rangers make use of it.",
			"",
			"Given its rate of growth and tolerance of a wide range of environments, many believe that the pixie circle is not a naturally occurring plant; signs seem to point to an origin associated with fey. Whether it was created through magical experimentation or intentional breeding is unclear, and it remains an open question whether the first pixie circles escaped to the outside world of their own accord or through deliberate release.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pixie circles grow in nearly any environment, from snowy taiga to humid jungles, so long as there are suitable creatures in the area to serve as prey. The plant is rare in sandy deserts and other barren environments, and underwater and underground growths are unheard of. Regardless of its environment, a pixie circle adopts the appearance and coloration of local flora to better hide.",
			"",
			"Although pixie circles are highly invasive and difficult to clear, civilizations do their best to contain or remove these plants when they grow nearby. Several workers can clear a patch of young pixie circles within a few days, but even the smallest scrap of root or branch left behind can allow them to reestablish themselves, requiring repeated efforts to keep them under control.",
			"",
			"In rural Avistani communities, parents warn children to avoid pixie circles should they encounter them, lest the children be stolen away by the fey - a reasonable concern given the plants' ability to teleport victims. Alternatively, some tell stories of a stranger staggering out of the circle speaking a language none in the village recognize or wearing clothes that are hundreds of years out of style. A few lucky survivors return with stories of adventures in the First World or Nithveil."

While already possessing all the skills and abilities of his race, the newborn carries none of the memories of his progenitor. As a result, a newborn polevik knows nothing about the world beyond his immediate surroundings, and his paranoid nature gives him little desire to learn more.

Exile may have stripped them of an unending existence in the First World, but the stability of the material world gives them ample opportunity to cultivate and experiment with their beloved fungal companions. It is for these experiments that they are widely hunted by wizards seeking obscure spell components, and by alchemists who wish to learn the secrets of the polevik's miraculous ability to mix fungi into concoctions that seem impossible to create outside of a laboratory.",

They avoid coming into contact with the peasants working the land, except at night where they can invisibly and sorrowfully observe mortals enjoying the companionship that is denied to the poludnicas themselves. More commonly, poludnicas are driven to lure away farmhands and kidnap children who they believe will come to love them and consider them their new family.",

			"For all the suffering poludnicas cause, dwelling in a poludnica's territory is not without its benefits. Their crop-enriching powers provide abundant food, and many farming communities have come to see them as a kind of guardian spirit. Children often weave cornhusk dolls to placate a local poludnica, ask for her protection, or thank her for sparing their fathers or brothers. Some poludnicas are touched by these displays and stop, or at least reduce, their predations on those in the community."

Alternatively, the Herald can effectively shift the area in a 90-foot radius centered on itself into the Maelstrom, swapping a corresponding region of the Maelstrom onto its current plane and choosing whether to move creatures or leave them in place. Creatures can resist being transported by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the Herald's HD + the Herald's Charisma modifier).",

If the Herald exceeds the DC by 10 or more, it can choose to redirect any targeted effect to a new target of its choosing within 60 feet.",

To the wizards and sorcerers who summon them as familiars, the answer seems obvious - these tiny dwellers of Limbo have all the requisite racial traits of proteans, down to their serpentine shapes. Yet the established protean castes find such claims outright insulting, claiming instead that it is such acts of conjuration that call voidworms forth from the raw stuff of Limbo, giving them shape and life according to the spellcasters' expectations, and that these lesser beings are but pale reflections of their formidable kin. Voidworms themselves have little to say on the matter-creatures of the moment, and sparing little thought for the constantly mutable concept of \"reality,\" voidworms only barely grasp cause and effect, and the past has no more substance or significance for them than a dream. In order to gain a voidworm as a familiar, a spellcaster must be chaotic neutral, be caster level 7th, and have the Improved Familiar feat.",

These tiny, serpentine creatures are particularly valued by illusionists, evokers, and other magical practitioners who deal with distorting or molding reality, though the familiars' bizarre logic and miniscule attention spans sometimes make them more trouble than they're worth. Still, their confusing attack and remarkable hardiness have saved more than one wizard on the battlefield, and their strange thought processes can sometimes offer unique insights in the laboratory. When traveling in more mundane lands, wizards often order voidworm familiars to use their change shape ability to disguise themselves as ordinary pets or animal familiars, though these disguises tend to slip when the voidworm grows curious or playful.",

			"Calacas are unusual psychopomps in that their purview is not the dead, but the survivors who must carry on in the dead's absence. A calaca's purpose is to abate the sorrow of family members and loved ones of the recently departed. It accomplishes this by way of soothing wisdom and its celebration of the deceased's life through song. Although mortals who know calacas' true nature may think them simply magnanimous spirits, these psychopomps have a very pragmatic reason for soothing the aggrieved, which is to dissuade any with the know-how or desire from attempting to raise the dead using necromancy or other foul means.",
			"",
			"In order to mingle with mortals without alerting them to its nature, a calaca disguises itself from head to toe in local finery, wearing gloves and colorful masks to hide its true nature. Beneath its facade, a calaca resembles a large skeleton, its bones a somber gray. A typical calaca stands around 6 feet tall and weighs only 40 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many cultures speak of kindly strangers or masked wanderers who appear in the wake of a beloved's death to offer words of consolation and songs of catharsis, and calacas are often the root of these myths. A calaca typically arrives at the door of a widow, widower, or next of kin by mysterious means and always claims to be a distant friend or admirer of the dead. The calaca may show up during a wake or other funeral procession - as long as doing so would not be disruptive or insulting - bearing food and drink for the mourners. While they treat the bereaved to sustenance and music, calacas use their social charms to get to know the grieving and to learn more about the deceased so that they can tailor their consolations to each individual. Because they use no compulsion magic and cannot speak with the dead like some psychopomps, calacas must rely on their natural graces and aptitude for conversation while interacting with mortals.",
			"",
			"Far from mere charlatans, calacas do in actuality feel the sympathy they express so strongly to survivors of the dead. However, their grief stems not from the departure of the individual to the afterlife (in fact, most calacas never meet the spirits of the dead for whom they are sharing consolations), but from the pain of knowing that mortals will never fully understand the beauty or necessity of the transition from life to death. They are a forlorn race of psychopomps who express their sorrow in the form of joyful music and mirthful laughter.",
			"",
			"A calaca's role is not in combat, and most retreat if a fight seems inevitable, returning another day to give peaceful mediation another try. In spite of calacas' pacifistic nature, each bears on its person an antique weapon such as a pistol or an exotic sword, which is perhaps the creature's most mysterious detail. Even the calaca does not know the purpose of this weapon - whether it is a relic from the creature's past as a mortal or just part of its disguise. However, if asked, a calaca replies that its weapon is an item gifted directly by the gods, and its use will become obvious when the appropriate time has come. A calaca's second-most important belonging is its instrument (typically a guitar or fiddle), which is capable of unleashing powerful magic if destroyed as a last resort.",

			"",
			"A calaca's prime directive is to discreetly dissuade any survivors who might consider necromancy or other unnatural means of reviving the dead. Calacas accomplish this through tact and persuasion, not magic or trickery, and by instilling the belief that death is simply a second chapter in the story of one's life. If a calaca cannot sway a mortal from trying to revive the fallen, it calls upon other psychopomps more suited to handling the threat.",
			"",
			"Because death is common on Golarion but necromancy is not, calacas do not appear before just anyone who has lost a loved one. Their typical targets are the rich and powerful; after all, individuals with the resources to bring the living back from the dead often need more dissuasion than peasants without means, who simply resign themselves to their loss. For particularly difficult cases or in the instance of mass casualties and thus multitudes of mourners, a number of calacas may band together to combine their efforts, appearing as a troupe. Such troupes typically throw elaborate performative feasts, with each calaca taking up a different instrument or part in the act. As long as their disguise holds, calacas will perform for mortals for days if necessary. Other psychopomps like {monster/catrina/s} may also join them in larger groups, as their abilities complement the calacas-by calming distraught family members and angry mobs.",
			"",
			"When not performing their core duty consoling the aggrieved, calacas accompany other psychopomps on missions to the Material Plane, either as heralds or to provide support. A calaca typically reports its success or failures to a {monster/nosoi}, who scribbles details of the calaca's latest encounter with a mortal. When a {monster/morrigna} has been given a target for assassination, several calacas may be sent in advance to soften the morrigna's prey before the attack. Calacas can also be found in the backs of the ranks of {monster/vanth} forces, maintaining the pace of the psychopomps' march with their haunting battle dirges. Truly, wherever there are psychopomps, the somber songs of the calaca are never far behind."

They tread upon the land when a civilization that has reached the end of days and must be wiped away for new things to grow from its corpse. Their arrival heralds the end of cities, nations, and even entire species. They are simpleminded, loyal, and utterly devoid of the compassion that defines so many other psychopomps-terrible things created and directed with terrible purpose. Legends claim that Pharasma bore these creatures herself, rather than forging them from once-mortal souls, lending some clarity to the usher Atropos's title as the \"Last Sister.\"",
			"",
			"Clad in iron masks resembling rams and bulls, fulgatis serve as little more than beasts of burden. While most psychopomps are artisans in death, honing and crafting it with purpose and applying it only when needed, fulgatis are fonts. Death itself pumps through their veins and unravels creations where they step, leaving the ground fallow so immediate survivors of their attacks have no chance to rebuild. While intelligent enough to speak and read, they lack the intellect and forceful personalities of most powerful outsiders, instead serving as the penultimate enforcers of the Boneyard's will-second only to Pharasma herself.",
			"",
			"These titanic psychopomps are too aggressive to collect souls, and instead rend souls free and allow their lesser kin - always close at hand when fulgatis march - to shepherd their victims to the Boneyard. What fulgatis do collect is the motivating life force, or quintessence, of the creatures they slay, pooling it until they invest it into the rubble around them to animate earth and stone as minions to assist in their destruction. These animated soldiers sometimes remain active for decades or even centuries after the psychopomps' grim work is done, tearing down what ruins remain and ensuring no trace of a destroyed civilization can ever be reclaimed.",
			"",
			"Fearsome psychopomps of last resort, a dozen known fulgatis slumber in isolated sepulchres deep within the Spire, awaiting those rare occasions when Pharasma herself has no need for subtlety or patience. Many more guard Pharasma's Palace, likewise held in deep sleep until released and directed against the Boneyard's enemies. Many psychopomps note that the structures housing the fulgatis continue far down along the Spire's length, well beyond the reaches of where they are permitted to travel, and it is possible that more of these powerful reapers - or even more powerful manifestations of their kind - slumber at the Spire's base, waiting to tear it down at the end of the cosmos as Pharasma brushes away the last traces of the multiverse.",
			"",
			"The fulgatis' ability to cast plane shift means the willful among them can escape and even hide for centuries at a time, reaping not at the Lady of Graves' command, but at whim. Teams of psychopomps relentlessly hunt these wayward destroyers, but few among their number, save the legendary yamarajes, can stand to the reapers of realms. Some psychopomps compare these wild fulgatis and their lust for random destruction to the spawn of Rovagug, but others believe Pharasma fashioned her own killers in response to Rovagug's arrival in the multiverse, likely to reap his divine spawn. Other claim that the souls of Rovagug's offspring are too terrible to exist freely, and so the Gray Lady devours them and rebirths them as new monsters-ones she alone can control.",
			"",
			"Despite the fulgatis' incredible power, few outside the courts of the Boneyard are even aware they exist. The mortal need to turn away from death is so powerful that living minds often wipe clean any encounter with a fulgati, leaving survivors to rationalize the destruction and death left in their wake as terrible accidents and natural disasters. Because of this, mortal scholars are unsure how often - or even if - the fulgatis have ever been unleashed upon the Material Plane. The reapers may be unleashed upon the world every few centuries, or they may simply slumber and exist only in nightmares and legend.",

			"Fulgatis resemble massive, female forms bearing eight stout arms, four of which serve them in place of legs. Their unusual locomotion allows them to climb and burrow with ease, even springing forth from the earth in the midst of their targets. While they wear no clothing, their flesh resembles worked metal and stone carved into elaborate whorls and patterns, giving the illusion of magnificent armor. The horns they bear are perfectly functional and deadly in close combat.",

Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard.

Their stewardship derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose.

Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead - out of a loathing for such perverse creatures - their unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation.",

But, occasionally, overzealous keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not.",

			"For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath."

Olethroses are among the Boneyard's most powerful agents in the mortal world, and they work outside that plane's normal hierarchy, answering to only the psychopomp ushers and the enigmatic goddess of death herself. They move among mortals in disguise, watching the strands of fate interweave and acting to promote their view of fate and stymie those who fight against fate's flow. An olethros might appear in the guise of a wise midwife or a person's former mentor, offering words of wisdom or advice that open up new possibilities.",

Although inveterate meddlers themselves, olethroses can't abide lipika aeons, disapproving of their manipulation of the cycle of life for some alien sense of karma. Occasionally, a shadow war of manipulation breaks out between an olethros and a lipika that can span lives, families, and even dynasties. Among psychopomps, morrignas look upon olethroses with respect and adulation, while nosois sometimes consider them bossy. Yamarajes respect their independence but sometimes requisition one to serve as an expert witness or an advocate during a particularly difficult judgment. Olethroses never refuse such a requisition, but most chafe at being assigned such tasks more than once in a long while.",

Olethroses sometimes use their plane shift ability to hunt their traitorous kin on the Ethereal Plane. While none know for sure precisely why olethroses fixate on sahkils, legends say that one of the first sahkil tormentors to rise was an olethros who went rogue.",
			"",
			"Many psychopomps use manufactured weapons, such as scythes or staves, in their war against those who would endanger the flow of souls to the afterlife, but olethroses use strange weapons that function only for their kind. These are silkbows, ranged weapons built from diaphanous strands of cloth and silk that function as magical longbows.",
			"",
			"While most psychopomps are forged from mortal souls in Purgatory, olethroses are born from other olethroses via rarely occurring immaculate conception. Olethroses claim that new members of their kind are born when a new branch of fate forks off, and the newcomers are destined to study and nurture that branch and the lineages involved. Whatever the case, very few olethroses become pregnant in this way, but those who do grow enormously in power. Olethros mothers range in CR from 20 to 25. A few of the more powerful olethros mothers advance with levels in a spellcasting class (typically cleric), but most of them advance by gaining additional Hit Dice and unique powers over birth, fate, and death. Olethros mothers occasionally use weapons other than their usual bows, either because they have developed the ability to create a different sort of weapon or because they've acquired a particularly powerful weapon and augmented it with their own powers. Such olethros mothers trade away the silkbow and fateful arrows abilities for amazing abilities related to their new weapons.",
			"",
			"Olethros mothers are much more likely to have subsequent daughters than an ordinary olethros is to have a first daughter, so olethros mothers are far less common than other olethroses. Each one develops her own distinct specialty, and in that area of expertise, even yamarajes defer to her; in fact, the most powerful olethros mothers serve as advisors and near peers of even the psychopomp ushers themselves.",

Superstitions of the living call them by many names - the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men's souls - but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts. The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Purgatory, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners. Many also serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain Purgatory's neutrality, but any such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse. Though in theory each yamaraj answers to the gods of death, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom.",

As with other outsiders, they need not eat, drink, or sleep to survive, and the grave magistrates normally remain perched upon Purgatory's ruins for months at a time, overseeing the smooth organization of their realm. Hard work wears at their immortal drive, and like living lords, they eagerly indulge in exquisite banquets during their infrequent personal time. These bacchanals make for strange bedfellows among outsiders, as solars and pit fiends may hobnob alongside one another, vying for the attention of a yamaraj to help organize the release of judged souls and attempting to win future favors.",

As the highest order of psychopomps, they are simultaneously the most dedicated to their role as shepherds of the dead and the most prone to impressing their own opinions on their work in the form of overturning precedents, rambling speeches, and extensive opinions attached to rulings. Such flexibility is necessary when making immortal decisions based on the ever-changing actions of the living, but frustrates more absolute outsiders to no end.",
			"",
			"Unsurprisingly, yamarajes tend to vary greatly from one individual to the next. Most develop deep interests in various worldly subjects that determine the sorts of mortals they ultimately choose to watch over. A given yamaraj might go out of its way to seek out artisans, followers of specific deities, or thieves, depending on its studies or whatever has come to interest it during that eon. Yamarajes might seek to guard such pet souls, ensuring their safe travels through Purgatory, learning more from the souls as they journey together, and ultimately advocating that the death gods grant a more peaceful judgment. Others act in reverse, finding certain sorts of mortals truly disgusting, tormenting their souls through their procession to the goddess's throne, and even suggesting that the spirits should face particularly monstrous damnations. How a yamaraj reacts to an individual thus proves unpredictable, depending on its changeable tastes. Such idiosyncrasies vary between individual yamarajes, and might change over the course of centuries.",
			"",
			"Just as many yamarajes become fascinated with souls possessing specific experiences or from certain backgrounds, some of the psychopomps go out of their way to judge beings from specific worlds, collecting bits of information and insight with every creature that passes them by. Thus, some become experts on one or multiple worlds, having spent eternities ferreting out the histories and secrets of worlds from firsthand accounts over millennia of inquiries. Many yamarajes welcome the opportunity to share the details of their investigations, though they sometimes see inquiries into their worlds of expertise as opportunities to conscript new allies to aid the psychopomps' cause. Standing at the pinnacle of their race, yamarajes are well informed as to the challenges and goals of many subservient psychopomps, and might only negotiate with mortals who perform a service in aid of their underlings.",

In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near.

A pyrogeist is a mass of spectral fire that emits no heat and damages only living creatures. A large face floats upon its surface, resembling a twisted mockery of the person the pyrogeist was when alive. A pyrogeist haunts the area surrounding its remains and is consumed with a desire to immolate others. A pyrogeist most often haunts its victims with terrifying illusions before engulfing them and adding their souls to the creatures' perpetual torment.",

Although a pyrogeist rarely chooses to communicate with the living except when mocking or haunting them, when it chooses to speak, its voice sounds like roaring and crackling flames.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists are obsessed with sharing their torment with the living, but they are too clever and sadistic to simply immolate their foes. Pyrogeists prefer to first drive their victims into paranoia and insanity. When feasible, they first start with minor events that could be explained as accidents or unfortunate events, such as by using {spell/mage hand} to push flammable items near open flames or {spell/ghost sound} to emulate the crackling of a fire in another room. When the pyrogeist's victim starts to doubt its senses, the pyrogeist inflicts increasingly horrid nightmares that always involve fire. These nightmares usually culminate in people or places the victim loves being set ablaze, often by the victim's own hand. The pyrogeist then uses its {spell/major image} spell-like ability to bring these nightmares into the waking world, causing its victim to see charred corpses or dancing flames wherever it looks. Eventually, the pyrogeist moves in for the kill, destroying its victim with whirling spectral fire that annihilates flesh and bone but leaves clothing and other items intact. A pyrogeist can make its victim's torment endless by consuming the victim's soul, creating another face that flows across the pyrogeist's churning form. Pyrogeists are reluctant to release souls it has entrapped, usually doing so only as part of a bargain that ensures its ongoing existence or promises additional souls in exchange.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists draw pleasure from burning victims with their ghostly fire, but they are aware that this manner of death leaves distinctive clues for ghost hunters. As the pyrogeist's attacks deal negative energy damage, they cannot harm objects, clothing, or equipment. To cover its tracks, the most devious pyrogeists - especially those that have been destroyed and rejuvenated in the past - ignite normal fires to hide their tracks. Although a pyrogeist might knock over an oil lamp or shove a flaming fireplace log with its {spell/mage hand} spell-like ability, it prefers to have its victims set the blaze on its behalf, perhaps promising an end to their psychic torment in exchange for an act of arson. Identifying a pyrogeist's supernatural burn marks is much more difficult after a mundane fire has swept through a location.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists choose their victims based on their proclivities in life and the circumstances of their death. Some pyrogeists prefer to target victims of certain classes or occupations, or by targeting buildings of specific architectural styles or colors. Pyrogeists that formed from murderous psychopaths often continue gruesome trends in undeath, such as collecting trophies from their victims or leaving certain calling cards at crime scenes. Other pyrogeists spend their time forcing victims to recreate the circumstances of their own deaths.",
			"",
			"Putting a pyrogeist to rest permanently requires burial rites be performed with at least some piece of the pyrogeist's mortal remains. As those remains have usually been reduced to little more than ash and bone fragments, they often go unnoticed among the smoldering wreckage of a destroyed building. A pyrogeist senses when its mortal remains are disturbed and usually moves quickly to prevent anyone from disturbing them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists most often form in heavily populated cities, where structure fires are more common and the anonymity of crowded streets allow arsonists and pyromaniacs to blend in as they do their wicked work. These pyrogeists have no contact with their former families or friends, but they sometimes seek out their old acquaintances to become their first victims. Pyrogeists can also originate in remote villages or in the wilderness, usually during forest fires or other calamities triggered with malicious intent. Recent rumors place a vengeful pyrogeist along the Jalrune River in southern Taldor. There, a saboteur set fire to a laden merchant vessel belonging to a rival trade prince, only to be trapped within the burning ship. This pyrogeist now haunts passing ships, lairing in the blackened shipwreck that rests at the bottom of the river.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists are almost always solitary creatures, so consumed by their hunt for souls that they rarely interact with anything else, living or dead. On rare occasions, multiple arsonists die together and merge into a single pyrogeist, sharing a morbid coexistence. These pyrogeists are usually the most erratic, as different personalities vie for control.",
			"",
			"Powerful necromancers sometimes attempt to create or control a pyrogeist, in search of an incorporeal assassin that prevents its targets from being brought back to life. Pyrogeists resent these attempts, making them highly dangerous minions; if the necromancer's control slips enough to allow the pyrogeist any amount of freedom, the incorporeal horror would surely focus its murderous attention on the one that enslaved them."

The stone casing has hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the pyropiscis within remains unharmed.

Pyropiscises depend on this deadly environment of extreme temperatures and choking gases for their very lives. While they have a fishlike appearance, pyropiscises do not swim - their bodies are far too dense to float in water or similar liquids. Instead, pyropiscises rely on their powerful muscles and sharp scales to burrow through molten rock.",

A pyropiscis draws energy directly from the lava in which it dwells, using the intense heat to power its metabolic processes. While pyropiscises don't need to consume the flesh of other creatures to survive, they require nutrients from flesh to grow and to reproduce. A well-fed pyropiscis continues to grow throughout its lifetime and can reach an immense size.",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises typically lurk close to the surface of active volcanoes, and ride eruptions like flowing tides to find prey. They burst forth from rivers of lava to snatch fleeing creatures with their jaws, and consume the charred corpses of those who can't outrun the volcano's fury. Once they have finished feeding, they swim back against the current of lava and into the volcano. Those pyropiscises that linger to gorge themselves, and those too weak to fight the downhill flow, become stranded on land. They then enter hibernation, awaiting the next eruption. A pyropiscis can hibernate for centuries at a time. Eventually, however, a stranded pyropiscis begins to starve, and will break out of its hibernation in search of food.",

			"Pyropiscises are social creatures. They live in schools of a dozen or more individuals, typically hunting alone or in smaller packs. They reproduce infrequently, and only ever after a successful hunt. Pyropiscises are intensely protective of all the young in their school regardless of parentage, and take turns guarding them. When a new crop of young reaches maturity, they form a school of their own, venturing to a different part of the same volcano. Even if a pyropiscis's hunts take it to other planes, it always strives to return to the volcano of its birth to spawn. Pyropiscis schools readily adopt stranded wanderers, but while welcoming to their own kind, these fiery beasts are hostile to all other creatures.",
			"",
			"Some fire giants domesticate pyropiscises, overcoming their surly, willful nature through stubbornness. The giants' size and immunity to fire allow groups of them to handle an unruly pyropiscis throughout its training. Still, fire giants must continually placate their pets with charred flesh to prevent them from lashing out. This steady stream of food grows the pyropiscis to an enormous size, and some fire giants have been known to ride giant pyropiscises as mounts into battle. Pyropiscises also serve fire giants as fortress guardians, swimming in moats of magma at the entrances to their tunnels.",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises are a recurring bane to miners and excavators. The rumble and activity of mining efforts can stir hibernating pyropiscises from their slumber, and the newly wakened pyropiscises spare few lives in their search for food and safety. The most unfortunate miners may even break directly into a pyropiscis's cocoon, as a hibernating pyropiscis encased in solid rock is indistinguishable from the surrounding stone. Those with the skill or unfortunate experience to recognize a sleeping pyropiscis for what it is can make a decent profit selling the monster to individuals in search of a guardian or owners of particularly opulent menageries, provided they can chisel the cocoon free and transport it to market without rousing the creature inside."

			"When a particularly powerful good-aligned outsider gives its life defending a holy location on the Material Plane, remnants of its pure spirit can be weighted down with worldly matter. Most good-aligned outsiders never contribute to a radiant essence, as their holy energy is drawn back to the good Outer Planes in death, but the most righteous and powerful among them might leave behind a bit of their zealous spirit that hungers to continue its crusade against evil. When the remnants of several such outsiders pool and coalesce into a combination of spiritual residue and holy energy, an energetic, shimmering sludge called a radiant essence emerges. Unintelligent but driven to destroy evil, radiant essences are an enigmatic force for goodness. Some servants of benevolent deities actively collect radiant essences from the Material Plane, using their protomatter in the creation of powerful celestial champions; but others allow these oozes to stay on the Material Plane as protectors of sacred areas. Alchemist-priests have long sought formulae to recreate these oozes but cannot replicate the process of their creation; devout scholars posit that the will of the divine prevents mortal creation of such holy matter.",
			"",
			"Like many oozes, radiant essences are comprised primarily of caustic matter, but this substance is infused with holy energy that causes them to shine with a soft, glowing light. Radiant essences sense their environment by vibration and air pressure, supplemented by their instinctive knowledge of whether nearby creatures are fundamentally wicked.",
			"",
			"A radiant essence is normally 8 feet in diameter and between 8 and 12 inches thick. It weighs approximately 1-1/2 tons.",
			"",
			"Radiant essences are usually very similar in size, but each radiant essence's coloration is determined by the outsiders that perished to form it. Angels contribute a rich yellow, archons a shining silver, agathions a vibrant orange, and azatas a fiery red. Most radiant essences are formed from a multitude of types and are therefore a shimmering golden orange; however, radiant essences formed exclusively from one type of good outsider take on the corresponding color.",
			"",
			"Regardless of their color, all radiant essences contain small, malleable globules of shimmering matter that surround a shining core. These masses float within a radiant essence's fluid form and contain the purest celestial energy. The golden, protoplasmic fluid in which they float is acidic, able to swiftly corrode metal and dissolve organic material. Radiant essences don't need to continually secrete this acid; they can stiffen their outer membrane in order to move around or over objects without dissolving them, although they rarely do so. Since the holy energy inside of them sustains their simple biology, radiant essences rarely take time to consume material they break down. Instead, a radiant essence secretes acid primarily to bypass obstacles that stand between it and evil creatures, but that it can't overcome with brute force. Imbued with the creature's divine power, this fluid is particularly potent against evil foes, burning them with holy energy in addition to mundane acid.",
			"",
			"Radiant essences don't reproduce as other oozes do, and always maintain the same size and coloration as when they were formed. If slain, a radiant essence quickly deteriorates. The globules within a radiant essence are particularly useful to anoint a holy relic or sanctify a sacred site. Although few good-aligned individuals have the power or desire to sacrifice a radiant essence for this benefit, pious heroes who discover a recently slain radiant essence might recover the globules for this use. If not utilized within a few days of a radiant essence's death, the globules evaporate, their spiritual residue dissipating forever. Death by violence is the most common end of radiant essences, due to their tendency to hurl themselves at evil foes without any sense of self-preservation. Barring death in combat, radiant essences are exceptionally hardy and incredibly long-lived. After several hundred years, a radiant essence's inner core begins to dim as its body draws upon the last of the celestial energy that sustains it. The final state of an elderly radiant essence has yet to be observed; it may ultimately break down into inert slime, or disintegrate in a final burst of dying holy power.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because radiant essences are formed from the spiritual residue of good outsiders, they are a source of awe and fascination for many religious scholars. Many sages study the appearance and formation of radiant essences to better understand the complicated process of celestial destruction and rebirth. Lore about radiant essences is incomplete, as the creatures are so rare, spurring the most dedicated sages to seek out radiant essences to study firsthand, although the oozes are indifferent to this curiosity. Sometimes, a priest or scholar must interact with a radiant essence not out of inquisitiveness but out of obligation; for example, benevolent powers may direct a devotee to transplant a radiant essence to another site where its mindless crusade against evil can be of more use. For the fortunate, the radiant essence complies with its relocation, following the agent like a loyal pet. Sometimes, however, the radiant essence is unwilling to go, forcing the agent to plead with the ooze or pray for some means to transport the obstinate creature.",
			"",
			"Nearly all radiant essences inhabit a specific holy site and rarely stray far from it. Radiant essences are usually solitary, but a large sacred structure or angelic battlefield might host several. Radiant essences rarely create lairs for themselves, instead meandering around their specific holy sites, ever alert for evil creatures. Radiant essences are single-minded in their pursuit of any wicked creatures they find and might pursue such a creature far from their holy site. Lacking the intellect to retrace their steps but practically immortal, wandering radiant essences continue to seek out evil creatures indefinitely. If one of these radiant essences happens upon a different holy site in its travels, and there are no evil creatures within range to fight, it might instinctively adopt the site as its new home. To existing residents of that site, such as hermits or monks, the presence of a single-minded mass of luminous, acidic protoplasm is rarely a welcome one.",
			"",
			"Angels and other good outsiders treat radiant essences with a mix of caution, pity, and sympathy. Aware that the oozes contain the residue of celestial heroes but none of their personality, some angels see radiant essences as a cautionary example of what they might become if they fall in combat. More practically, good outsiders know that radiant essences are mindless and can be unpredictable, so even they keep their distance as a sensible precaution."

When the weather is calm, raijus are quiet, and assume the forms of Tiny or Small animals such as cats, raccoon dogs, monkeys, or weasels. As weather gets worse, however, so do their tempers. In their real form, raijus appear as lean, foxlike creatures with long, sharp claws and luminous eyes, shrouded by crackling electricity. These swift, even panicky, creatures are charged with the electricity of their native realm, and those who touch them risk receiving a deadly shock. In times of great distress, they transform entirely into living electricity, a force that few barriers can contain and even fewer creatures can survive the passage of.",

Only after a period of weeks or months do they gradually take on a favored form, that of a vaguely rodent- or caninelike beast, agile enough to twist and bound amid the endless storms and debris that soar through their home plane. Sometimes particularly powerful elemental storms, strange eddies of magic, or drifting portals bring raijus to the Material Plane. When this happens, invariably during a thunderstorm, the creature spends but a little time regaining its bearings; it then uses its innate shapechange power to blend in with the local fauna, taking on the shape of a local animal - typically a cat, raccoon dog, monkey, or weasel. While such raijus constantly seek to return to their home plane, they aren't terribly uncomfortable on the Material Plane. When the weather is calm, raijus are likewise quiet, and remain in their apparently harmless animal forms all the time. As weather gets worse, however, they become increasingly energetic, racing and soaring about in rampages that occasionally prove accidentally destructive. They typically resume their natural forms during such storms, reveling in their memories of their home plane. Some scholars believe that raijus can return to their native plane when lightning strikes them, thus explaining the creatures' eagerness and agitation during such weather.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",

			"Raijus are extraplanar creatures that have little organization on their home plane, roaming and romping as little more than wild animals in their dangerous planar wilderness. On the Material Plane, they gravitate toward areas where storms are frequent, or where the effects of lightning are apparent. This means they frequently occupy the windward sides of mountains and wet forests, eagerly making small dens in the trunks of lightning-blasted trees or scorched, rocky crevices.",
			"",
			"Raijus can live on the Material Plane indefinitely, though all seek ways they might return to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those separated from their native plane rarely manage to find their way home without the intervention of some other being. Although life on the Material Plane often means a raiju will never encounter others of its kind again, few seem to realize this fact, or, if they do, become despondent over it. Rather, many raijus adopt the habits and communities of the creatures they spend the most time imitating and live as such creatures - except, of course, during violent lightning storms.",
			"",
			"Many believe that despite their destructive natures, raijus are good luck. This belief comes from the creatures' propensity for finding warm spots to nestle into and rest in during the lazy times between storms. One story tells of a raiju that found a snug spot in the navel of a sleeping giant. The giant was exhausted after a day of tromping on a local town and stealing away an entire year's harvest of rice, so it didn't even notice the sleeping creature. When the giant finally awoke and felt the dozing creature's claws on its belly, it flew into a panicked rage. The sudden activity startled the sleeping raiju, and it immediately summoned a storm and called down lightning, which promptly electrocuted the giant-killing the villain on the spot. When the curious townsfolk saw the brief, explosive storm nearby, they stopped rebuilding their homes and came to investigate. What they found was a charred giant and a sleepy raiju, nestled amid their stolen rice. Raijus have been considered lucky spirits ever since, though many refuse to sleep face up during lighting storms lest their bellies seem like a comfortable place for a raiju to rest.",

A kaenju is very similar to its cousin, but its substance is made of fire instead of lightning.",

			"Hailing from the barren wastes of the Plane of Fire, the rast is as dangerous as it is bizarre. Its body is a single tumorous sack that bulges with hidden organs and veins and bears no sensory apparatus beyond two miniscule eyes almost lost in the folds and wattles of its flesh. Instead, its defining feature is a mouth of flesh-ripping teeth and a wriggling mass of tangled legs. The exact number of legs on a particular rast is seemingly a random trait. Strangely, these tangled limbs do not support the creature, but rather hang twitching and waving beneath it as the rast floats through the air with an easy grace, only reaching out to manipulate objects or - more often - to slash at its prey.",
			"",
			"Though rasts do not appear to have any spoken language, they display a degree of intelligence that places them above mere animals, and use this innate cunning to aid in their hunts. As prey is scarce in the barren, ashy deserts of the Plane of Fire where they make their home, rasts prefer to hunt in packs, swarming through the skies like schools of fish, their movements precise and coordinated despite their thrashing limbs. When they come across a likely target, they descend en masse, paralyzing those foes susceptible to their gaze and then abandoning them temporarily to focus on any opponents that remain mobile and dangerous, slashing with their claws and latching on with thick-lipped mouths to suck their victims' blood and viscera. Though each rast has roughly a dozen limbs, it can only control up to four at any given time, leaving the others to dangle uselessly.",
			"",
			"Rasts make their homes in small ashen burrows, no more than holes scooped out by the thrashing of their claws, and bear their squirming young live. An adult rast is the size of a human and weighs 200 pounds. Rasts tend to be red, yellow, or purple, with darker coloration on their legs and heads, the better to blend in with the fiery plains of their homeland. Though most other intelligent species on the Plane of Fire are powerful enough (or wise enough) to avoid direct conflict with a rast pack, a cluster that stumbles through a portal to the Material Plane (or perhaps more tragically, is summoned to the Material Plane by a foolish spellcaster) can prove disastrous for the local ecosystem, consuming everything in its path with seemingly no limit to its repulsive hunger."
