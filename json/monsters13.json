Worse, howlers have little interest in eating their prey - they need not feed to live, but rather enjoy the process of stalking, mauling, and killing living creatures. In a way, the act of inflicting intense pain and madness upon mortal life is what fills a howler's life instead of the desire to feed.",

When a howler sees prey, the tenor of its howls changes-howlers cannot speak, but they can use their howls to communicate quite a bit of information if required. They understand the Abyssal tongue, and when serving demons as guardians, their howls can not only alert their masters to the presence of intruders, but also to their number, appearance, and weaknesses.",

Instead, fresh food is hauled back to the grick's lair in a tight burrow or high on a cavern ledge, where it is consumed in small bites at the grick's leisure.",

On those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple specimens, groups of gricks do not appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks individual targets and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they were unable to damage the creature with their nonmagical weapons. Those that are familiar with gricks (especially dwarves, morlocks, and troglodytes) know the best strategy for dealing with them is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements.",
			"",
			"Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions when food is scarce in a given region, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but these sojourns are almost always out of necessity, and end as soon as the gricks find entrances to new subterranean lairs. They prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead, avoiding the open sky and going to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead.",

			"These surface-adapted varieties of the underground grick are shades of green and lurk in the undergrowth of jungles or climb low-hanging branches to drop on unsuspecting prey. Their racial bonus on Stealth checks applies in forested terrain instead of rocky terrain. Jungle gricks are heartier creatures than their underground-dwelling kin-all jungle gricks possess the advanced creature simple template and gain {feat/Toughness} as a bonus feat."

A griefgall must be implanted into a humanoid, and it quickly grows to full size, but can't survive more than a week without a humanoid host.

While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conflict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food-horse flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained griffon's stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts' hunting shrieks split the sky.",

It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a griffon's allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount.",

In order to be trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common.",

None are sure where this disdain stems from, but it is speculated that a squid is to an octopus for a grindylow what a dog is to a goblin dog for goblins. Incredibly fond of their similarly designed kin, grindylows believe octopuses to be the epitome of beauty, with squids being regarded as hideous freaks in comparison. There is no greater insult to a grindylow than being called a squid.",

The grogrisant has reappeared throughout history to test great Taldan heroes, and scholars disagree as to whether this is the same ageless mythic beast or a rare race of creatures. In either case, the mighty grogrisant has sired powerful offspring among the dire lions of the Whistling Plains north of the World's Edge Mountains. Their legendary heritage evident in their great size, lustrous hide, and rending claws, grisantian lions stalk the plains and mountains of northern Taldor. Haughty and powerful, grisantian lions seek easy meals but cannot resist an opportunity for a challenging fight, hurling themselves against large foes such as mammoths and giants to demonstrate their formidable attacks and supernatural resilience.",
			"",
			"A grisantian lion stands 14 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 8,000 pounds. Female grisantian lions are slightly larger than males.",
			"",
			"Descendants of an incredibly rare legendary beast, grisantian lions are themselves remarkably uncommon. Despite being few in number, grisantian lions are extremely hardy and long-lived. Their golden-hued hides, which retain some of their ancestor's legendary toughness, protect them from parasites as well as the rare attackers that dare to challenge them. A grisantian lion can easily live 2 centuries, and even longer in an area where regular prey is plentiful.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions are choosy regarding their mates, selecting only the largest and most powerful dire lions. Unlike regular lions, grisantian lions do not congregate in prides; they return to their solitary lives shortly after mating. Grisantian lion cubs grow quickly, becoming adults within a year of birth. A grisantian lion parent may teach its cub the rudiments of hunting and caring for itself, but grisantian lions are not nurturing by nature and rarely express affection for their offspring. A grisantian lion parent forces its cub away from its territory as soon as it can survive on its own, but before it becomes large enough to effectively challenge its parent for control of the area. A dire lion parent may attempt to incorporate its grisantian lion cub into its pride, but the creature's supernaturally resilient hide, savage cunning, and natural ferocity make it a danger to other dire lions, and the cub is quickly shunned. Adult grisantian lions therefore already have long experience in surviving on their own.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions are solitary hunters too large to stalk prey through tall grasses as effectively as their smaller cousins. Instead, grisantian lions bring their brute strength and intellect to bear, often targeting prey accompanied by their young; this forces the prey to either stand and protect their offspring, or flee and leave the lion an easy meal. Grisantian lions revel in challenging fights, and often attack larger animals just for the thrill of battle. Confident in their incredible hides, Grisantian lions have been known to attack mastodons, dinosaurs, hydras, and even dragons. Much like common lions, grisantian lions rarely attack humanoids when other food options are available. This reluctance is less out of a concern for self-preservation than because grisantian lions don't see humanoids as large enough to pose a worthwhile challenge. If a grisantian lion learns otherwise - such as if a well-placed arrow manages to overcome its resilient hide - it leaps eagerly into battle. Many hunters have attacked a grisantian lion, believing the creature to be disinterested or even skittish, only to have a lucky shot provoke the lion's assault.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although the grisantian lions' mythic progenitor inhabits the World's Edge Mountains, the lions have spread over much of Taldor and even into neighboring nations. Grisantian lions prefer warmer climates, but they can thrive in almost any environment. Their thick fur and dense flesh allow them to survive severely cold climates for short periods of time, generally long enough to hunt before returning to whatever warm cave or den they've made for themselves. Their fur becomes thicker in such climates within only a few weeks, helping to keep the creatures warm. In hot regions, grisantian lions tend to shed weight, becoming much lighter, and grow very fine coats, with the males losing their manes entirely.",
			"",
			"Aside from the urge to find a mate and produce offspring, which strikes only every few decades, grisantian lions are creatures of solitude. They deem mundane lions too weak and dimwitted to be worth their company for long, and they consider the irritation of sharing food and glory with another of their kind more bothersome than the difficulty of hunting alone. Grisantian lions rarely ally with larger, more powerful creatures, as their inclination is to fight such creatures to prove their prowess rather than work together.",
			"",
			"Hunters and trappers eagerly pursue rumors of grisantian lion activity, hoping to craft durable armor from its hide. Unfortunately for these hunters, the lion's skin nearly always loses its remarkable resilience after the beast is slain. Rumors of alchemical or magical treatments to preserve the hide are as pervasive (and, unfortunately, as frequently spurious) as rumors of the lions themselves.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions can't speak, although they understand languages spoken in nearby communities. Unwise Taldan nobles sometimes sponsor hunts to recover grisantian lion cubs, but the creatures grow so quickly that keeping them caged is often a difficulty. Even young grisantian lions resist domestication with a petulant ferocity. With their keen intellect and ability to understand their keepers' language, grisantian lions escape confinement frequently; at best, a would-be master loses only a few servants or some livestock as the creature escapes back into the wild; at worst, the noble finds herself at the claws of the creature she sought to keep captive.",
			"",
			"Bargaining with a grisantian lion is difficult but not impossible; the creatures like to receive tributes of meat and other delicacies and can be convinced to provide short-term services in exchange for the promise of future spoils. Orcs, in particular, find a particular kinship with grisantian lions and sometimes attempt to convince one to join a raid against a well-fortified settlement, although such alliances are often temporary."

Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born.

Gryphs normally survive on carrion and small animals, but take on larger game when driven by hunger or if they feel threatened. Most disturbing is their means of reproduction. Gryphs are hermaphroditic and mate frequently, such that their egg pouches are rarely empty. When they encounter a suitable host - a warm-blooded creature of size Small or larger, ideally alone - the gryphs swoop down, latch on to the target, and implant their eggs directly into its flesh. As long as the target is conscious, the flock continues its assault, though if the target flees the area, the gryphs return to their nest. The eggs quicken swiftly once implanted, and gryph chicks hatch forth mere minutes later in a bloody birth that is often fatal to the host.",
			"",
			"Gryphs have a strange affinity for vermin, often lairing in close proximity to one or more insect swarms or vermin of Medium size or smaller. The insects avoid the gryphs instinctively, feeding off the remains of the flock's meals and on creatures too small for the gryphs to bother with.",

When it attacks, it stiffens its edges, making them blade-sharp. It races past its target and draws its entire length across any exposed flesh, leaving a long, deep, and painful slash that bleeds badly afterward. This is not the scroll's only means of attack, however. It can also wrap itself around a Medium or smaller creature in the blink of an eye, constricting it.

Creatures adjacent to the exploding creature take half damage (which can be halved again with a successful DC 27 Reflex save). Gunpowder residue remains flammable for 24 hours, until it is ignited, or until it is scrubbed away (which requires soap, water, and at least 1 hour of bathing and washing).

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A mid-sized feline adorned with a halo of blinding orbs of light, the hallowed lynx is a creature widely thought to be mere myth or long extinct. Only a handful of hallowed lynxes exist, most held in stasis within long-buried Thassilonian ruins, though rumored sightings of the blindingly bright cats suggest that small populations may have survived to the present day. Created from keen hunters and imbued with potent light-based magic distilled from powerful outsiders, hallowed lynxes are deadly predators whose mere presence bolsters their allies. Aside from the brilliant orbs that surround them, a hallowed lynx resembles its mundane kin, having a short tail, large paws, spotted tawny fur, and distinctive tufts of fur extending from its ears. It is the same size as an ordinary lynx: just over 2 feet tall, around 3 feet long, and weighing about 35 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Hallowed lynxes are not natural creatures, though they are descended from the mundane lynxes still found across Varisia. Their origin can be traced to the height of the Thassilonian empire in the realm of Eurythnia, where the runelord Sorshen created the first hallowed lynxes to serve her as favored pets and guardians similar to the way in which animals served the gods.",
			"",
			"Creating the original hallowed lynxes involved powerful conjuration magic, wherein the terrible creatures known as [shining children](monster/shining_child) were summoned and bound into the physical form of a living lynx. The outsiders' intellect bolstered that of the host, and the host channeled the outsiders' magic and light for its own benefit. The shining children continue a half-existence after their integration, orbiting the hallowed lynx and shedding their light as a powerful aura. A hallowed lynx can utilize this energy in one of two ways: either hurling the orbs at a foe, or temporarily releasing shining children from within the orbs.",
			"",
			"While several other creatures were also magically \"hallowed\" in a similar manner during Sorshen's rule, the hallowed lynx was by far her favorite, eventually spreading beyond her court as demand for the creatures grew among Thassilonian nobility. These noble felines served as pets and guardians for the realm's elite, their owners benefitting from the same aura that made the creatures so effective against intruders and foes. The small size of hallowed lynxes made them ideal indoor pets but still large enough to present a significant threat to anyone or anything that crossed their path. As status symbols, hallowed lynxes typically led plush, pampered lives in which their stalking and hunting was conducted for their own amusement rather than sustenance. More intelligent than a common lynx, a hallowed lynx can - with sufficient exposure - understand the languages spoken around it, and it can perform far more complex tasks than its mundane kin; though, as with most felines, it can be challenging to convince a hallowed lynx that undertaking a given effort is worth its time.",
			"",
			"Scattered historical records, most of which were poorly kept to begin with, make it difficult to determine how many hallowed lynxes were created within the empire, but historians agree the number was exceptionally low, and likely only in the hundreds. Given their scarcity even at their peak, scholars conclude that hallowed lynxes met their end along with the empire that created them. Today, the creatures are known from only a handful of surviving mosaics, engravings, and other artwork, and occasional references in written documents that have connected the image with their name.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Much like other lynxes, the hallowed lynx is a solitary creature. Some form bonds with their keepers, with records suggesting that Sorshen had a particularly powerful hallowed lynx that followed her as dutifully as any of the runelord's sycophants. But even within the empire that created them, it was rare for hallowed lynxes to encounter one another due to their scarcity, and such encounters have become rarer still since the empire's fall.",
			"",
			"Being savvy and sturdy creatures, however, not all hallowed lynxes perished during Earthfall. A few were caught up in the Thassilonians' various efforts to survive the catastrophe, held in stasis or otherwise preserved within the homes and temples they once prowled. A few others escaped, fleeing the collapse of Thassilonian civilization and taking shelter deep in the forests of Varisia. The persistence of the hallowed lynx as a creature in rumors and folktales suggests that the creatures managed to survive and reproduce, yet they remain so rare and hide themselves so well that their existence remains unconfirmed. Whether the creatures simply seek to remain hidden for their own safety or whether they're guarding long-buried secrets of Thassilon has yet to be determined.",
			"",
			"Few predators-natural or otherwise-pose a serious threat to a hallowed lynx. Their small size and unambitious nature places them below the notice of tyrants and chromatic dragons, but they are tremendously powerful creatures in their own right, apex predators in those few habitats where they remain. If cornered, confronted, or challenged, a hallowed lynx first hurls its blinding orbs in an attempt to debilitate its foes, then pounces to attack its target's weak points. Against multiple foes, it releases the shining children bound to it and flanks foes, or else it employs its spell-like abilities to weaken, distract, and entrance enemies."

Using secrets stolen from Jistkan golem crafters, Osirion's own artificers designed hanshepsus to equalize the battlefield in their clashes against the Jistka Imperium as the two nations carved up northern Garund. Throughout the conflict, hanshepsus fought in dozens of battles, each time turning the tide in favor of Osirion's forces as they marched ahead of regular, human soldiers through the hot sands of what is now Thuvia. Hanshepsus stand as tall as an adult human. While they appear lean and muscular, their clay bodies give them additional heft, causing them to weigh in at around 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"The process of creating a hanshepsu requires the sacrifice of a willing humanoid to provide not only the life force needed to animate the construct's body, but also the creature's intelligence. This allows the hanshepsu to make calculated decisions on the battlefield, and some even commanded humanoid units during battles, implementing clever tactics amid the fray.",
			"",
			"Though a hanshepsu is intelligent, it lacks anything approaching a personality. Cold and stoic, hanshepsus don't hold conversations that involve anything more complicated than answering questions or issuing orders. Any attempt to engage a hanshepsu further results in utter silence and an inexpressive face. Some hanshepsus even shut down in the middle of their limited interactions with others, crossing their arms and changing to their solar disk head.",
			"",
			"Despite their lack of personality, some hanshepsus retain traces of their mortal memories, and shout out bizarre non sequiturs in the midst of battle. Crumbling texts from the First Age of Osirion contain reports that, after time, hanshepsus became unpredictable, sometimes turning on their commanders and the other soldiers. This suggested that the process of creating these near-impervious soldiers was flawed in some fashion.",
			"",
			"Few hanshepsus have been found in the current age, and they are rarely discovered in large numbers. The process of creating hanshepsus was expensive and required a willing sacrifice, so only the best and brightest warriors were transformed into these constructs. Because of this, modern scholars believe that fewer than 5,000 hanshepsus were created before the practice fell out of favor, and with the march of time, less than 10 percent of that estimation are believed to be still functional.",
			"",
			"Hanshepsus work best when assembled in a unit with other hanshepsus. They work in concert, taking physical cues from one another and rarely needing to verbally communicate. When not charged with leading or when fighting alongside a unit containing humanoids, hanshepsus barely regard other creatures. When at rest, they simply wait for new commands. In fighting units, hanshepsus were often at the front lines of a battle, and they used their increased strength and superior defenses to drive a wedge into enemy units and scatter their ranks, allowing the humanoid soldiers behind them to easily pick off the dispersed soldiers.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"To create a hanshepsu, the crafter must sculpt and shape the body from a single block of clay harvested from the banks of the Asp, the Crook, or the Sphinx. The creature's head must be fired in a specially prepared kiln stoked with 1,500 gp worth of rare desert wood. As a final step, a living humanoid must be sacrificed in order to animate a hanshepsu in a process that separates the victim's spirit from his body and infuses his essence (but not his personality) into the clay body.",

Heartrot trees typically lurk in the deepest depths of fouled forests; they are the manifestations of the very forces that poison the land.

			"",
			"Heartrot trees are typically 30 feet tall from the base of their trunks to the tips of their tendril-like branches. When the trees grow above a cave or another large underground space, their roots are horrifically similar to their branches and dangle just as far from the ceiling. Heartrot trees' trunks are typically 15 feet in circumference, and the plant's entire mass weighs around 15 tons.",
			"",
			"To most lovers of nature, the existence of heartrot trees is a tragedy, because these evil plants were not always so. Before transforming into grotesque harbingers of disease, heartrot trees were invariably ancient and majestic specimens growing in the depths of primeval forests. Heartrot trees were typically once maples, oaks, elms, or other types of locally common deciduous trees. They were often once among forests' largest or most venerated trees; perhaps they marked a remote druid's circle, or were a common meeting place for forest dwellers.",
			"",
			"However, once blight falls upon a wooded area, it particularly and irrevocably settles within the heartwood of these trees. Either due to proximity to the center of a blight, or because evil forces have perverted once-good magic that protected the plants, these trees become sentient, fungusdripping horrors. A malevolence awakens in them akin to the same powers that caused the surrounding blight. Newly formed heartrot trees crave violence and undergo drastic changes to their biology.",
			"",
			"The differences between a heartrot tree and its previous incarnation are manifold. In the most visually dramatic change, a heartrot tree withers and shrinks to a fraction of its former size. The water and nutrients that once circulated in its woody veins turn to a disease that rots it from the inside out - and the heartrot tree becomes a carrier of a plague that drives its victims mad before draining the life from their bodies. Heartrot trees' malevolence spreads throughout their systems of roots, trunks, and branches. As a result, they no longer feed on sunlight or water, and are instead sustained by the evil that animated them as well as the suffering they bring to good creatures that cross their paths.",
			"",
			"The most heinous change wrought to heartrot trees, though, might be the sheer determination of the evil that lurks within them. Unlike natural trees, heartrot trees can sense creatures that move near their trunks, and even near their roots underground, when they grow above a cavern or another such opening. Heartrot trees can attack victims aboveground or below, though they can't attack with both their branches and their roots at once. Even when it seems like heartrot trees are destroyed, they can regenerate in a matter of weeks. Heartrot trees attack and destroy any living creatures that wander into their demesnes, though they prefer to lurk in the heart of a blight and wait to destroy wandering creatures the blight hasn't yet warped.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although heartrot trees typically originate in the center of a blight, they are restless, wandering brutes. Therefore, they can eventually be found nearly anywhere in a blighted area, from the fringes of a warped wood to its very heart.",
			"",
			"Heartrot trees found at the edges of a blighted area are typically solitary creatures. They are invariably aggressive, as the abundance of lost wanderers and fleeing forest dwellers naturally provides them with victims. These heartrot trees are often easy for discerning adventurers to spot - a gnarled, rotting tree amid a heap of broken bodies or standing in a pool of blood is almost certainly a heartrot tree. Fortunately for potential prey, heartrot trees gorged on fresh kills are not exactly good at concealing the remnants of their prey or their presence. What's more, particularly active heartrot trees often leave the torn flesh or bloody garments of their victims hanging from their twisted branches in a grotesque display of just how much the plants crave carnage.",
			"",
			"Heartrot trees that dwell deeper in the depths of a blighted area are typically a little harder to spot. They naturally blend in with the rest of the blighted surroundings, and so GMs may wish to grant heartrot trees an additional +8 racial modifier on Stealth checks in such areas. Such heartrot trees are also more likely to lurk in pairs. In the most blighted areas, it's common for a heartrot tree to stand on one side of an ominous, deepforest path with another directly across the way. In this manner, the trees can simultaneously snatch multiple creatures that wander by, and they can ensure that their victims don't escape their grasping tendrils.",
			"",
			"### Heartrot Tree Groves",
			"",
			"In Golarion's most deeply warped natural areas, heartrot trees sometimes stand in horrifying groves made up of six to 12 individuals. In this case, the trees tend to arrange themselves circularly, like a twisted parody of a peaceful druid's grove. The sheer concentrated evil of these groves imbues the heartrot trees with a strange magical ability that can call victims directly to the slaughter. Three times per day, the grove can cast mass suggestion with a range of 220 feet (Will DC 24; CL 12th). The grove uses this spell-like ability to beckon to potential victims in the vicinity, whose broken bodies afterward typically litter the forest floor around the trees. The destruction of just one heartrot tree in a grove temporarily thwarts that grove's ability to draw creatures toward it. However, if defeated trees in a grove regenerate back to full power, the grove regains its powers of suggestion."

			"Samurai are renowned for their resolve, but sometimes a samurai becomes so obsessed with her purpose that her soul can't depart from the Material Plane upon her death. Unable to seek eternal rest, and unwilling to become undead in the pursuit of vengeance, the samurai's soul instead finds a suitable host in which to continue its existence. A heikegani is the effect of such a joining: a tragic, furious symbiosis of the soul of a dead samurai and the body of a crustacean. This usually occurs when the samurai dies near a crab habitat and her soul imprints upon a newly hatched crab zoea. Magic is always involved, either because the death happened in a high-magic environment or because the samurai was dealt a magical deathblow. A heikegani is especially vicious when young, and kills other crabs and marine creatures it encounters until it develops the ability to travel onto land. Each time the heikegani molts, its new shell comes to more closely resemble an angry demonic face. The soul of a heikegani has very few of its memories from life, but retains its single-minded sense of purpose and honor, and is quick to challenge those it meets to mortal combat. A heikegani believes it has been reincarnated, but in reality it never passed on to be judged. The unnatural genesis of a heikegani causes it great agony, and the dangerous crustacean scuttles along the shores, seeking foes that it can defeat in honorable combat so its soul can finally be put to rest."

			"The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for devils. Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be anyone's pet.",

A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and example to all those who would deal with their kind.",
			"",
			"Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes.",
			"",
			"The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones. Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The \"fires\" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat's entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted.",

Unlike their untainted kin, hellfire ignises see fire as merely a tool for destruction and revel in the raw power of its hungering flames.",
			"",
			"Unlike many fey creatures, hellfire ignises are surprisingly attracted to urban areas. The prevalence of wooden tenements, dense populations, and unpatrolled sewers through which they can travel unseen make towns tempting targets for the inveterate arsonists. There is a bounty on the heads of hellfire ignises in many cities and towns in Cheliax, with rewards reaching as much as 400 gp per specimen in some areas. Greedy hunters from Egorian and other cities have been known to travel far into the heart of the Barrowood and Whisperwood, hoping to carry a large collection of ignis heads back for a larger bounty in town.",
			"",
			"Despite their name and infernal origins, hellfire ignises have no allegiances to Hell or those who serve it. That said, many experienced pyromancersfind that the corrupted fey make excellent familiars. They tend to be more versatile than fire elementals and less sinister than imps, filling a specific niche between the two more commonly seen familiars. A spellcaster who takes a hellfire ignis as a familiar must be ever watchful that it keeps its arsonist spirit in check, however, as the mischievous fey have been known to set fire to their masters' workshops, libraries, and homes not out of spite or malice, but because they often contain so many combustible tools and decorations. A 7th-level spellcaster can gain a hellfire ignis as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat."

The ritual itself often focuses on the torture and slaughter of young, inexperienced priests while a captured leader is forced to watch. The pain and anguish experienced by the enemy high priest as his acolytes are forcibly converted in undeath serves as the ritual's catalyst. High priests driven mad or forced to lose their faith after witnessing such a ritual often rise again as huecuvas that then go on to gain levels as oracles of the ritual's profane deity.",

In some cases, a lone herecite may wander from the site of its creation, especially if it loses its creator, but once a group of herecites forms a cabal, its members remain bound to that area for months, years, or even centuries - if they leave the area, the cabal is broken, and a new ritual must be performed in order to reaffirm their blasphemous faith. They have very little interest in their new lives save for the constant offering of blasphemous prayers to their new deity; these prayers often consist of warped versions of sacred chants and songs devoted to their prior faith."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"For nearly a century, the Estrovian Forest has been haunted by stag-horned woodsfolk known as hernes. From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings. Some believe them to be the ghosts of hunters betrayed; others say they are fey spirits who guard the woods; and still other believe them to be fiends summoned by worshipers of the Old Faith. While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.",
			"",
			"Hernes superficially resemble the humans from whom they descend, save for the many-pointed antlers which project from their brows. Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.",
			"",
			"Hernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller-with their antlers adding another foot or so- and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.",
			"",
			"The race of hernes has existed for less than 90 years. The first of their kind was Herne Vilhaur, a crusader from Andoran. Wounded by a stag and left for dead by his erstwhile companions, Herne was taken by the druids of the Estrovian Forest. They promised to mend his mortal wounds with their ancient magic, and in a way they did. They hanged him from a mighty oak, and placed on his brow the antlers of the sacred stag that Herne had killed. Then they called down the \"curse of the winterthorn\" upon Herne, restoring his vitality but tying him forever to the spirits of the forest.",
			"",
			"The druids intended to use the transformed Herne as an instrument of vengeance against their enemies. Instead, he turned upon them. Stripped of his humanity, the reborn Herne thought only of vengeance against the allies who had abandoned him and the druids who had made him a monster. Unable or unwilling to leave the forest, he claimed it as his domain. He haunted it till the end of his days, hunting both animals and humanoids who dared to enter the woods. Herne did not kill all he chased; some he allowed to join his band. Recreating the ritual that transformed him, Herne called antlers from the heads of his new companions, thereby passing the curse of the winterthorn on to them.",
			"",
			"Even after the original Herne's passing, his progeny continued his legacy, even taking his name for their race. Hernes breed true, and most of those who now live were born with the curse rather than having it placed upon them. The hernes live off the bounty of the forest and protect it from those they deem unworthy of its gifts.",
			"",
			"Save for superficial details, the ritual by which a human can be turned into a herne appears to have been lost with the death of Herne himself. Yet whenever followers of the Old Faith or notorious bandits disappear, rumor quickly spreads that they have not died, but been brought into the fold of Herne's band.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Hernes are relatively few in number considering the vastness of the Estrovian Forest. Though quite capable of living alone for long stretches of time, hernes are not antisocial, and they meet regularly with others of their kind to pass along news and trade crafted goods. They stay together in groups only with a purpose, however, whether it's to raise a family or to hunt a great beast. The largest population of hernes can be found near the tree known as Herne's Oak: the tree from which Vilhaur was hanged, and under which his body is buried (along with, according to legend, a trove of funerary offerings).",
			"",
			"Like the druids before them, hernes are followers of the old ways, both in practical matters and in spirituality. As hunter-gatherers, hernes raise no crops, and have domesticated only animals useful for hunting-dogs, horses, and owls. Though they thrill at the chase, hernes never take more than they need. They build few structures. Most live in hidden caves that run beneath the Estrovian Forest. Hernes are most active at night; people living on the edge of the Estrovian Forest often attribute strange noises from the woods to the hernes' midnight hunts.",
			"",
			"The hernes practice an ancient form of druidism known as the Green Faith. This religion was once the dominant religion of the northern reaches of Avistan. Over the centuries, however, it has been replaced by the worship of the gods of the Inner Sea region. The arrival of the crusaders, many of whom worship their own regional deities, has only accelerated the decline of the old ways. The hernes thus consider themselves protectors not just of the forest, but also of the spirits which reside there.",
			"",
			"Hernes value self-sufficiency, and reject most useless hierarchies. They especially despise those who claim rulership by noble blood. This hatred is reinforced by tales of the druids' persecution by Mendevian rulers, and of the duplicity of the original Herne's so-called noble allies. While common folk may be allowed to hunt and gather from the edges of the forest, hernes are quick to turn the tables on the extravagant hunts hosted by the Mendevian elite and their crusader allies. In a few instances, hernes have even given advice and aid to brave outlaws in their fights against corrupt nobles.",
			"",
			"Hernes take full advantage of their supernatural reputation when interacting with other humanoids - they know threats are more menacing when issued from the mouth of a deathless servant of nature. Though hernes are not fey creatures and not deathless, most humanoids can't deny the creatures' supernatural nature. Though many hernes remain cold to other humanoids, some invite the dispossessed to join their bands. Those who accept the herne's offer cannot return to the life they once knew. To the superstitious folk of Mendev, swearing allegiance to a herne is tantamount to signing a deal with a devil; such folk are forever beyond the pale.",
			"",
			"As warriors have returned to their homelands from the Mendevian Crusades, they have brought with them many stories, including that of Herne Vilhaur and his accursed progeny. Reported sightings of hernes in forests far south of Mendev are easy to dismiss as the imaginings of those who have fallen for these fanciful tales, yet some who know of the hernes suspect they may be expanding their territory."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A hippocampus's scales vary in color from ivory to deep green to cerulean blue with shades of silver. Aquatic races such as merfolk and locathahs often train hippocampi as steeds or as draft animals used to pull cunningly designed underwater carriages. In the wild, hippocampi prefer to dwell in relatively shallow waters where their favorite food (seaweed and kelp) is more plentiful and larger predators are less common. These creatures often travel in large schools, analogous to free-roaming herds of wild horses on the surface world.",
			"",
			"The hippocampus is relatively easily trained - the amount of work and cost it requires is equivalent to what it takes to train a horse. As armor impacts the creature's swim speed, those who train hippocampi for war rarely bother to put barding on these creatures - when they do, they generally opt for the lightest armor, such as padded or leather barding. Mounted combat on a hippocampus is similar to fighting while riding a horse, although the hippocampus is a clumsy creature on land and cannot move at all out of the water if it has a rider weighing it down. Although a hippocampus has only two front legs, determine its carrying capacity as if it were a quadruped. Thus, a light load for a hippocampus is up to 228 pounds. Medium loads are up to 459 pounds, and heavy loads up to 690 pounds.",
			"",
			"A number of variant species of hippocampus exist, although the majority of these species differ from the creature presented here only in color and feat choice. Common feats other than Endurance for alternative hippocampus species are {feat/Great Fortitude}, {feat/Improved Initiative}, {feat/Iron Will}, {feat/Lightning Reflexes}, {feat/Skill Focus} (Swim), and {feat/Toughness}. A few species of hippocampus are heartier and tougher all around - these creatures are generally those found in colder waters and are known as polar hippocampi. A polar hippocampus has the advanced creature simple template. Most impressive of all are hippocampi that dwell in the deeper seas. These creatures, known as giant hippocampi, are much larger - to generate stats for a giant hippocampus, advance the standard hippocampus to Huge size and increase its Hit Dice to 10. A giant hippocampus is CR 8."

As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.",
			"",
			"A hippogriff's feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff's torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.",
			"",
			"Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature's wings - these saddles are always exotic saddles.",
			"",
			"Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young - as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff's egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load."

Despite their girth, hippopotamuses can run quite fast-up to 30 miles per hour in quick bursts - though they usually spend the bulk of their time lazing about in rivers and wallows, using the water to support their weight and regulate heat for their titanic bodies. Excellent swimmers, hippopotamuses can hold their breath for about 15 minutes and are quite stealthy when submerged. This trait makes them exceedingly dangerous to boats, for a submerged hippopotamus is likely to view any such craft as a challenge to its territory and is entirely capable of capsizing a boat and biting the boatmen in half. Hippopotamuses typically herd together in bloats, blocking waterways and creating natural blockades for river travelers. While lions and tigers often garner more public attention from foreigners, residents of areas frequented by hippopotamuses know that the \"water horses,\" as they're sometimes known, are far more likely to kill and maim humans that cross their path. Fortunately, forewarned travelers can generally avoid bloats, as hippopotamuses mark the banks of their territories with dung, spinning their tails while defecating to create aromatic \"water horses,\"",
			"",
			"Though hippopotamuses spend most of their lives in water, adults cannot swim and are not buoyant, instead propelling themselves by pushing off the bottom in great leaps. When submerged, they surface every 3 to 5 minutes to breathe and can even do so automatically while sleeping without waking. They have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air, alerting all nearby hippopotamuses whether submerged or on land."

Chaotic evil creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from striking the hiracapath while within the aura.",
			"",
			"**Nonlethal Mastery (Ex)** A hiracapath can deal nonlethal damage with any of its natural attacks without taking a penalty on the attack roll. When making nonlethal attacks, the hiracapath increases the critical threat range on all natural attacks to 19-20.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hiracapaths are inhabitants of Heaven - outsiders formed from the celestial plane - but they are not true angels or archons. They exist below the lowest tiers of Heaven's hierarchy and are commanders of celestial animals, holding no official place among Heaven's formal ranks or society. They dwell primarily at the base of the mountain that makes up the plane, wandering the idyllic realm alone or in great, golden herds. Despite their placid appearances, hiracapaths act as Heaven's watchdogs, running down any discovered interlopers and dragging them before more formal authorities for judgment. To hiracapaths, this arrangement is not lopsided; rather, it's preferable, as it allows them to indulge in their natural affinity for tracking intruders while remaining outside of the official celestial hierarchy, which they find too complex and unappealing, when they even consider the matter at all.",
			"",
			"In its natural form, a hiracapath is as an intangible cloud of soulstuff and celestial energy. Heaven itself provides each glorious creature with silver and steel armor to give it both form and purpose. Clad in gleaming plates, a hiracapath stands 9 feet tall and weighs almost 1,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sometimes called the \"bulls of Heaven,\" hiracapaths are born from Heaven itself, often forming from the souls of loyal mounts and animal companions of righteous heroes. Newly formed hiracapaths burst forth as jets of light and sound from the ground of Heaven's lowest tiers. Their armor eventually emerges from these same fonts hours later, beginning a long process that is equal parts birthing and unification of their disparate elements. The creatures remember nothing of their creation, and are driven only by an imbued sense of their place in the rigid hierarchy of Heaven's inhabitants.",
			"",
			"The same force that empowers its existence allows a hiracapath to expertly sap the life energies from enemies without mortally wounding them. In spite of the hiracapath's bulk and size, its powerful blows strike an enemy carefully, and rarely draw blood or open wounds. Born trusting humanoid masters more than their own judgment, hiracapaths dread the possibility of accidentally injuring or killing a creature that deserved a kinder fate, and under no circumstances do they wish to pass judgment on any creatures themselves. Against foes immune to nonlethal damage - such as constructs or undead - a hiracapath simply wields its curled horns and powerful hooves to devastating effect, trusting that a soulless creature cannot feel the pain it brings, and hoping only to stop, rather than totally destroy, its opponent.",
			"",
			"A hiracapath's intangible core grants it many benefits, including a shining light that burns evil and the disobedient, plus the ability to tread upon air as if its armor weighed nothing. This same holy light allows them to slip between the planes as they wish. Small populations wander Nirvana from time to time, or charge though the borders of Hell and the Maelstrom. As outsiders, they have no need to eat or sleep, but enjoy both-great herds roam Heaven, chewing thoughtfully at mouthfuls of plant matter, dirt, or stones, resembling contented herds of mortal cattle, sheep, or goats. If they spot an intruder, however, the hiracapaths do not hesitate to meet the threat head on, even if they don't wish to visit mortal harm upon it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"After their emergence at the base of Heaven's mountain, hiracapaths swiftly define their territory, or join other hiracapath herds without much fanfare. Instinctively knowing their role, hiracapaths serve as vigilant protectors, shepherding celestial animals and guarding against threats from other planes. They suspiciously stalk new petitioners and planar travelers alike, only satisfied when they see newcomers judged worthy by angels, archons, or other celestials. Obvious threats - such as the rare fiendish incursion - are dealt with swiftly but mercifully. A hiracapath carries incapacitated foes to the nearest authority figure, and ultimately loves nothing more than praise from its celestial superiors for a job well done.",
			"",
			"When the threat of invasion is not a concern, hiracapaths enjoy the rigid beauty of heaven. Though herd animals, they can wander off alone to spend extended periods of time in simple but careful introspection. Bold and stubborn, hiracapaths are ultimately gentle creatures who dread the thought of causing undue harm; they move with careful grace across the fields and pastures they patrol to avoid crushing smaller creatures beneath their bulk. Hiracapaths follow a simplified paladin's code, refusing to hurt helpless opponents and offering assistance to those in need. Thanks to their dull wits and prodigious strength, a hiracapath is often painfully straightforward. For instance, a hiracapath may help a lost traveler by carrying her in a straight line-through any and all obstacles-until the traveler spies familiar surroundings. Or a hiracapath may lead a wayward visitor around the mountains in a winding or circular path, waiting until it comes across a trusted angel or archon who can help direct its charge.",
			"",
			"While hiracapaths' dogged defense of Heaven seems at odds with their ability to plane shift, they do use their planar traveling ability to pursue enemies who escape justice. Angels joke that hiracapaths' ability to jump between worlds is a symptom of their stubbornness - even the walls of reality can't sway one of Heaven's bulls once it eyes a target. Because a hiracapath is unable to bring a target it pursues across cosmic borders, those beasts who leave their home often regretfully switch to deadly force, especially against infernal or other obviously evil prey.",
			"",
			"Other times, high-ranking angels or archons gift the services of hiracapaths to virtuous mortals. The hiracapaths proudly serve as paladin mounts when so called - many filled this same role in life and vaguely recall the sense of purpose it offered. Though rare, such alliances offer valuable training a hiracapath can bring back to its herd, and the majestic beasts themselves serve as proud warriors and surprisingly capable trackers.",
			"",
			"Though many angelic lords of Heaven view them as simple brutes and watchdogs, hiracapaths maintain a special relationship with the empyreal lord Ragathiel. The empyreal lord opens his territories to myriad herds of hiracapaths to serve as both protectors and symbols of strength, and respects the dogged and just nature of the hiracapaths, rewarding those who uproot nascent evils or track down escaped enemies. The General of Vengeance selects those hiracapaths who prove themselves worthy to wander the grounds within his own fortress, and dispatches them as mounts for his messengers and scouts in his wars against the infernal. These hiracapaths are clad in crimson-and-gold armor, and their interior nimbuses of golden light are replaced with righteous fire. Such champions of their kind have the advanced simple creature template, and often possess unique abjuration and conjuration spell-like abilities."

A creature capable of using electricity-based effects may even engage in a rudimentary conversation with a hive mind beetle swarm if it succeeds at a DC 25 Linguistics check, though most creatures don't have the same fine control the beetles possess, and their communication therefore remains broad and clumsy at best. The swarm responds by shaping itself into three-dimensional images.",
			"",
			"Hive mind beetle swarms' intellects focus primarily on food and weather. They can develop friendships with creatures who point them toward food sources, and may return to their new friends to inform them about approaching storms and other meteorological phenomena. Friendly swarms may even inform familiar creatures about other predators in the area, or assist in locating people or treasures (though the ravenous insects may just as readily eat the subject of their search). Hive mind beetle swarms are even capable of religious thought, considering thunderstorms to be messages from a divine being."

			"A hivemind consists of a swarm of smaller creatures whose individual minds have supernaturally bonded into one to become a single, collective intelligence. Hiveminds often occur in swarms that have existed for generations and that have dwelled in areas of potent magical influence, particularly areas of strong psychic magic. Over time, the swarm learns to work together in more intelligent ways to achieve its goals, and it eventually evolves a cohesive mind. Of course, this evolution can be hastened by direct intervention of potent magic (typically something on the level of a miracle or wish), or as an unintended side effect of esoteric rituals, the use or destruction of artifacts, or the deaths of powerful minds.",
			"",
			"A hivemind swarm learns from its surroundings, which in turn shape its choices in the languages it learns and the psychic spells it develops a penchant for casting. An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience.",
			"",
			"Eventually, the hivemind's mental network takes on more complex tasks as a collective mind. At this point, the hivemind creates a nexus, a single individual in the swarm through which the collective routes all thought. While the nexus is often fairly inconspicuous within the teeming mass of the swarm, it is possible for a highly perceptive observer to notice its decisive movements, spellcasting gestures, or intense gaze. The death of the nexus does not eliminate the shared intelligence of a hivemind, but it is disruptive, forcing the collective to focus inward to regroup and form a new nexus."

			"**Allergic Reaction (Ex)** A hobbe hound's saliva and skin produce highly irritating secretions that affect all creatures except those with the goblinoid subtype. A non-goblinoid creature that takes damage from a hobbe hound's bite, deals damage to a hobbe hound with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise comes into contact with a hobbe hound (including attempts to grapple or ride the creature) must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or break out in an itchy rash. A creature affected by this rash takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity and Charisma for 24 hours (multiple allergic reactions do not stack). Remove disease or any form of magical healing removes the rash instantly. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Flammable (Ex)** The greasy, alchemical musk that constantly coats a hobbe hound's body is highly flammable, and if ignited by an open flame or a spell that deals any amount of fire damage, it burns for 10 rounds. While burning, the hobbe hound deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with its natural attacks, and creatures striking it with natural weapons or unarmed strikes, or attempting to grapple the hobbe hound, take 1d6 points of fire damage. The hobbe hound takes 1d6 points of fire damage each round it remains on fire, but its energy resistance applies normally. Extinguishing a hobbe hound requires the beast to either succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw as a full-round action or complete immersion in water. ",
			"",
			"A hobbe hound that has been set on fire loses its allergic reaction special ability for 24 hours while its body replenishes the irritating oils that have been burned away.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Standing 3 feet tall and weighing nearly 150 pounds each, hobbe hounds are disposable war dogs of hobgoblin armies. Cowed only by shows of violence, they are loathsome and miserable creatures that return savagery in kind. The thick, waxy musk that constantly oozes from their pockmarked skin reeks of death and urine, and is highly irritating to non-goblinoids. Far worse, their fetid coating bursts into flame with the slightest spark, and while most armies would find flammable shock troops to be a hindrance, efficient and cruel hobgoblins find burning, baying, savage beasts of war ideal for breaking enemy ranks and sowing chaos before their own regiments close to melee.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds first appeared in Avistan during the Goblinblood Wars, when the beasts were unleashed against Andoren [Eagle Knights](rule/aff_vangard) along the war's southern front. The hobgoblins of the Chitterwood often intentionally set their own chargers ablaze, unleashing entire walls of flaming savagery upon the panicked soldiers. In the years since, surviving war beasts have formed feral packs in Isger, Molthune, and Cheliax, while hobgoblin tribes across the Inner Sea region have begun breeding their own stocks of the monsters.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds are the result of careful breeding and hobgoblin alchemical tinkering, and have little place in the natural world. Sharing many features with the more common goblin dogs-filthy, ratlike creatures that often dwell alongside goblins in their miserable villages-hobbe hounds boast much heavier frames and thicker hides at the expense of goblin dogs' already limited mental faculties. Generations of inbreeding have given them a dense musculature and incredible resistance to pain, while mutagens further develop their bulky bodies. This tinkering also exacerbates the species' overactive sebaceous glands, resulting in a secretion even fouler than the irritating dander of their leaner cousins. This alchemically infused body oil burns readily, producing billows of black, greasy smoke. Thanks to these same oils, hobbe hounds are somewhat resistant to fire, and a cruel training regimen destroys any fear of flame they might have once had, resulting in vicious beasts that rush into battle oblivious to the flames searing their own flesh. These glands often become infected due to heavy burn scars, and most hobbe hounds have repulsive patches of boils and blisters on their backs, necks, and heads.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds have great difficulty mating. Females go into heat irregularly and are picky about which males they allow close when they do. Their aggressive rejections leave scars or even maim potential suitors. On the rare occasion a pregnancy takes, the mother becomes listless and lazy, drained by the large and aggressive brood growing inside her. Hobgoblins feed these dazed mothers a steady diet of stimulants and mutagens to overcome this malaise; in the wild, other members of the pack become increasingly protective, given that they may see only one or two pregnancies in a year. After 3 months, the mother gives birth to a half-dozen stillborn pups and another five to 10 alert young. Born ready to eat meat, a hobbe hound pup generally makes its first meal of the littermates that didn't survive. Though the hobgoblins of Isger produced a number of variations (see Variations below), only one \"true\" breed has proven resilient enough to survive and flourish in new packs and environs without constant oversight and alchemical supplements.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Unsurprisingly, given their origins, hobbe hounds are aggressive in the extreme, with wild packs claiming large swathes of territory and attacking almost anything that enters, even predators many times their own size. A band of hounds hunts together out of a shared hatred for outsiders, but they lack the tactics or cooperation of most pack hunters. Once the prey is felled, individual hobbe hounds turn on one another in a fight to claim the choicest morsels.",
			"",
			"Those packs reared by hobgoblin tribes submit to goblinoid authority - partly from an inbred deference and partly from lifetimes of cruel beatings - and organize themselves at least marginally better than their feral kin. Tribes not actively campaigning sometimes use hobbe hounds as guards, but the willful beasts rarely stay in place unless chained to their posts. In active warfare, however, they shine, proving far more ferocious and resilient than mundane war beasts, and more obedient than worgs and similar allies of convenience.",
			"",
			"Riddled as they are with alchemical mutagens, hobbe hounds produce a number of potent byproducts. Their urine repels other canines and readily kills plant life, and their feces similarly destroy most fungi. Territories claimed by packs of hobbe hounds quickly become despoiled, marked by dead trees and chewed corpses that never fully decay. As food becomes scarce, packs turn to cannibalism to sate their hunger before finally moving on to fertile grounds.",
			"",
			"### Variations",
			"",
			"Born from mad experimentation and forced breeding, hobbe hounds are prone to mutations, and many variants have emerged. Because these variants are a result of alchemical tinkering, they almost always appear as domesticated animals, rather than in feral packs.",
			"",
			"Bug Hound: These leaner hobbe hounds are identifiable by their dark, dappled flesh. They retain a deference to goblinoids, but shun their own kind, instead slinking in the shadows and hunting by ambush, making them suitable companions for bugbear scouts. Bug hounds gain a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks.",
			"",
			"Hobbe Hulk: These tumor-riddled abominations are the result of overindulging hobbe hounds' species-wide addiction to mutagens, which causes them to grow to the size of a small horse. Hobbe hulks gain the giant creature simple template."

Hobgoblins admire goblin tenacity, yet their miniscule kindred's unpredictable nature and fondness for fire make them unwelcome additions to hobgoblin tribes or settlements. Nonetheless, most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, typically squatting in the most undesirable corners of the settlement.",

			"",

Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the otherwise oppressive darkness of the deep forest.

A hollow one can voluntarily end this rage at any point.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hollow ones are complex creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each hollow one is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.",
			"",
			"Unlike many constructs, however, the hollow one has a spark of intelligent life - the essence of its creator or the creator's victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original's true being, sometimes the hollow one can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most prone to madness (especially violent madness). Such a hollow one is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.",
			"",
			"When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.",
			"",
			"A hollow one is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.",
			"",
			"As constructs generally created by alchemists, hollow ones are uncanny replicas of humanoids made from shreds of skin infused with magic and rare chemicals. Hollow ones have an advantage over many constructs in that they have intellects gifted to them by their creators during their construction. Even those who know the humanoids on which hollow ones are modeled well may still be duped by the hollow ones, as they are fashioned by a process similar to that used to create simulacra and their true nature is difficult to discern.",
			"",
			"The fundamental intelligence of these creatures makes them dangerous, however. They are unstable beings, and 5% of hollow ones harbor a deep loathing and jealousy of their creator, to a point where they cannot abide continuing to serve them. These hollow ones turn on their owners, seeking to kill and sometimes replace them. Another 5% of hollow ones develop a greater intelligence and personality than the creatures on which they're modeled, becoming superior versions of the originals. Often seeking the immediate destruction of their would-be masters, these hollow ones have inflated views of their own importance and place in the world and proceed to try to convince others of it. These creatures gain a +4 bonus to both Intelligence and Wisdom and a +6 bonus to Charisma. Many of these hollow ones go on to take class levels, typically matching those of their creator (or the person being emulated).",
			"",
			"Hollow ones begin as blank slates in terms of development. The energizing force within each evolves differently, so that three hollow ones created at more or less the same time by the same master can result in three unique constructs depending on the context and situational factors in which they were created.",
			"",
			"Some scholars make the assumption that the first hollow ones were created by foul creatures that made use of fleshwarping, but little evidence for this has been found. Records retrieved from before Earthfall mention hollow ones, so the practice of making these bizarre constructs is more than 10,000 years old, though it has only recently come to light again in Avistan.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Many hollow ones take on specific aspects of their creators. Some arcane psychologists and philosophers have suggested that the inherited aspect is the creator's most overriding emotion or state of mind at the time. Thus, a happy creator fashions a jolly hollow one, while a psychotic person creates a deranged one, and so on. However, the hollow one nurtures this aspect into something larger as it develops. Misery becomes overwhelming sorrow or joy becomes completely unbearable. Each year after its creation, the construct must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or lapse into madness brought on by these emotions. The direction this madness takes varies, but is always dangerous in some way.",
			"",
			"Hollow ones develop their own mannerisms similar to - but not always identical to - their creators'. Those that escape into society often act as beacons for other constructs-paragons and leaders that use their constructed followers on crusades of their own twisted devising, taking on levels in various classes, and become tyrants, dictators, and saints in their own design.",
			"",
			"Several narcissistic cabals and cults use hollow ones as tools of vengeance and assassination, creating scores of copies of the cult leader to visit punishments upon dozens of enemies at the same time, creating the illusion of omnipotence. Such tactics have been employed by power-crazed tyrannical alchemists, who go on a frenzy of self-harm and create scores of hollow ones. Sadly, such personal killers often become so crazed that they turn on their creator en masse and exact suitable revenge, usually starting by flaying the creator alive.",
			"",
			"A tale circulating through Absalom speaks of a thieves' guild that once operated in that city and employed hollow ones as patsies and for blackmail. The guild leadership would capture someone, torture the captive by flaying her skin, and then healing her so there was no evidence of the stolen tissue. They would then send the hollow one to commit a visible crime in order to implicate their victim. To clear her name, the victim was forced to pay the guild's leadership a hefty price.",
			"",
			"### Other Hollow Ones",
			"",
			"The method for creating hollow ones don't restrict the form to be that of a humanoid. The form needs to be a creature that has skin, though. A catalog of constructs was recently unearthed from an old Azlanti ruin that described an aboleth hollow one that perplexed the ancient explorer who encountered the strange creature. Hollow ones made in the form of creatures with particularly durable skin could have a much higher natural armor bonus than the typical hollow one described here.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"The process used to fashion a hollow one requires the creator to collect a considerable quantity of the skin of the person being copied (referred to as the subject) using knives and an arcane ritual that ultimately deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the subject. The skin is alchemically treated and enhanced into a form not unlike the wrappings of a mummy. At the final moment of the ritual, the creator removes a piece of the subject's brain using a specially created brass and ebony hook with a tiny movable cutting blade attached. This hook is inserted into the subject's brain through the nose to remove a portion of living brain tissue, an act that deals an additional 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the subject. At this point, the creator must succeed at a DC 30 Heal check; otherwise the subject permanently loses 1d3 points of Intelligence.",

Pinpoints of unholy green light flare behind the intact eye lenses as the head starts to rise. The same glow behind those long-dead eyes illuminates a gaping mouth and bony fangs. Then a terrifying, painful hiss assaults your mind as the serpent slithers forward with a silent, unearthly grace.*",

			"",
			"**Life-Draining Coils (Su)** A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of draining the life force of creatures trapped within its coils.

Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.",

A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15th-level caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents."
