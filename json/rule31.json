			"Jockeying for position and favor is natural part of human social dynamics, as common in the armies of high-minded crusaders as in the courts of wicked nobles. The resulting web of allegiances lies at the heart of any intrigue-focused campaign, with individuals scheming to gain allies while undermining their enemies' support. To represent these machinations, this section introduces two influence systems: one for individual influence and one for organizational influence. The first system provides a dynamic framework for social encounters in which the PCs gain or lose the favor of key NPCs, as well as a mechanic for calling in debts. The second system models the way the PCs' actions affect their clout within allied organizations, and how far organizations at cross-purposes with the PCs will go to undermine them."

			"The most common model for social encounters involves a single exchange involving a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check. The following influence system serves as a more robust replacement for that basic system. It also encourages the entire party to participate in a social encounter, and can be used in encounters with multiple NPCs. In the individual influence system, participants try to change the targets' opinions or court favor by succeeding at a variety of checks unique to each individual target. Known as influence checks, these are usually skill checks, though other types of checks may suffice, as an NPC may be especially impressed by other qualities, such as drinking ability or martial prowess.",
			"",
			"In this system, a social encounter is divided into one or more phases. The length of a phase is flexible, and typically lasts 15 minutes to 1 hour-long enough for each PC to perform several minutes' worth of actions per phase that are unrelated to influence checks (such as investigating a murder scene or surreptitiously defeating an assassin) without forgoing their chances to participate in the social encounter. GMs should determine beforehand how many phases a social encounter will last, thus determining how many chances the PCs will have to influence or learn about their targets - generally two to six. The GM should also determine whether the PCs' actions can win them additional phases. For example, seducing a baroness or forestalling her carriage may both earn the PCs an extra phase in which to win her favor.",
			"",
			"At the beginning of a phase, each PC selects an NPC. During each phase, a PC can either try to directly influence the NPC via an influence check, or attempt to learn more about that NPC with a discovery check - a check to learn about an NPC that can help with future influence checks during the same social encounter. The kinds of checks required for an influence check or a discovery check, known as influence skills, are unique to each individual. The PCs can learn an NPC's influence skills through successful discovery checks (see [Discovery Checks](rule/discovery_check)); otherwise, they must guess.",
			"",
			"### Discovery and Influence Check DCs",
			"",
			"The appropriate DC for an influence check depends upon several factors. The table of standard influence DCs listed below provides a baseline for DCs for each average party level (APL). These DCs should be relatively easy for the PCs as a group (particularly those with access to aid another and the benefits from discovery), and they are generally appropriate for the skill that is most effective at influencing an NPC. To generate a typical influence check DC, add 5 to the base DC; add 10 to generate a difficult influence check DC. The DCs for skills in which many PCs have extremely high bonuses, such as Diplomacy and Perception, should be increased further to compensate. An NPC who is hard to influence might use the typical and difficult DCs for her influence skills, or possibly even higher DCs.",
			"",
			"If a major event takes place during the social encounter, consider whether any of the NPCs' influence DCs should change in response to the event. For example, if someone breaks into a sealed vault containing priceless treasures during the social encounter, law-abiding NPCs who suspect the PCs committed that crime become harder to influence.",

If any PC succeeds at this check for an NPC, then all PCs gain a +4 bonus on their discovery checks involving that NPC. Before attempting a discovery check, a PC chooses whether to try to learn the NPC's strengths, the NPC's weaknesses, or the skills that can be used to influence him. Each type of discovery check has its own requisite skill and DC. Sense Motive often works as a discovery skill, but it may not be the best choice because it's so general. When a PC chooses to attempt a discovery check, the GM should tell the player the possible types of skill checks for each kind of discovery check (though not the DCs), and let her pick which to attempt. If a discovery check relies on a Knowledge skill, it requires observation in the current moment, not static knowledge.",
			"",
			"A PC who succeeds at a discovery check learns one of the skills that can influence the NPC (starting with the skill with the lowest DC), one of his strengths, or one of his weaknesses. For every 5 by which the PC exceeds the DC, she learns an additional influence skill, strength, or weakness. Thus, a withdrawn but observant character can provide allies with a significant bonus (or help them avoid significant penalties) on future influence checks, making her as important to the group's success as PCs who prefer the spotlight."

Guidelines for setting influence check DCs appear [Discover and Influence Check DCs under Individual Influence](rule/individual_influence).",
			"",
			"The PCs usually must succeed at more than one influence check to sway an NPC. No matter how many PCs speak to the same NPC, only one check to influence that NPC can be attempted during that phase. Additional checks serve as aid another attempts tied to the principal check. Succeeding at an influence check by a substantial margin provides additional benefits. Succeeding at an influence check by 5 or more counts as succeeding at an influence check and a discovery check (the PC chooses whether to learn one of the skills that influences the NPC, one of the NPC's strengths, or one of the NPC's weaknesses after the check is rolled instead of before the check, but the check otherwise functions as a successful discovery check). Succeeding at an influence check by 10 or more allows the PC to choose between gaining the benefit of succeeding at two influence checks or the benefits of an influence check and a discovery check (as if she had succeeded by only 5 or more).",

If a PC fails an influence check by 5 or more, she cannot attempt to influence that NPC using the same skill for the remainder of that social encounter. A PC who fails an influence check by 10 or more cannot influence that NPC for the rest of the social encounter at all. For example, if the NPC's influence skills are Diplomacy and Knowledge (arcana), a PC who fails a Diplomacy check against that NPC by 5 or more can still attempt to influence the NPC with Knowledge (arcana). These restrictions also apply to aiding another - a PC who fails by 10 or more irritates the NPC to the point that the party can no longer take advantage of her assistance.",
			"",
			"A PC doesn't necessarily realize whether or not she has succeeded at an influence check unless she succeeds by at least 5, but a character always knows when she has achieved the maximum possible influence over an NPC.

			"",
			"The GM may wish to limit the number of PCs who can interact with a single NPC during a phase. After all, the NPC can hold a conversation with only so many people at once, and if six characters cluster around, the interaction may seem more ominous than intended. Limiting the number of PCs who can simultaneously interact with an NPC to two or three (with the other PCs attempting discovery checks or focusing on other NPCs), helps the encounter flow briskly and prevents a single PC from taking too much of the spotlight.",
			"",
			"Once the PCs succeed at a certain number of influence checks, they gain sway over that NPC, changing his opinion on an issue, earning a favor, or otherwise gaining some benefit or removing an obstacle."

			"PCs can also use magic to assist in gaining influence over key NPCs. In most cases, casting mind-affecting or other intrusive spells is socially unacceptable or even criminal, so PCs who wish to use such magic should use discretion. Whenever a PC (or NPC) casts a spell, NPCs with the Spellcraft skill attempt to identify that spell. Even NPCs unfamiliar with magic are likely to assume that spells are intended for mischief, unnatural control, or other selfish ends. The most common schools of magic used in social situations are divination, enchantment, and illusion.",
			"",

Spells and items far beyond the reasonable means of an NPC may indicate that NPC is hiding something, or is more than she seems. Alignment-detecting spells reveal whether someone has an unusually strong or unexpected aura. Other divination spells, such as {spell/detect thoughts}, pry directly into a target's mind, and can provide valuable clues at the GM's discretion, most commonly replicating a successful discovery check.",
			"",
			"Enchantment spells and effects are extremely effective tools for increasing influence, but their use is dangerous. When cast during a social encounter, spells such as {spell/charm person} grant a +5 circumstance bonus on influence checks in place of their normal spell effects, as long as the target fails the saving throw and remains unaware that she is under an enchantment effect. More powerful enchantments such as {spell/suggestion} are unhelpful for gaining influence, since they compel limited actions for a time and then stop. Spells such as [geas/quest](spell/geas_quest) or {spell/dominate person} might obviate the need to sway an NPC, but the magical influence is obvious to many people interacting with the NPC. People typically react poorly to realizing that enchantment magic has been used on them. The consequences of getting caught range from the offending PC being unable to attempt further influence checks against that NPC at that social event, to the whole party being unable to attempt further influence checks against that NPC during that event, up to the party being kicked out of the event entirely or charged with a crime.",
			"",
			"From innocuous glamers - such as magic that sustains illusory finery - to spells disguising an individual as a different person, illusion spells are versatile tools of deception. Many illusions that allow a saving throw require the viewers to study the illusion carefully or interact with it before they attempt a saving throw. In the context of the influence system, the first time a PC interacts with an NPC during a phase, the PC and the NPC each receive a saving throw against the other's relevant illusions, as they are assumed to be studying each other carefully at some point during the first exchange. After that, participants generally become more complacent in the way they examine each other, so they receive saving throws against only illusions dealing with particularly specific aspects of their interaction. For example, a glamer to make a dress look nicer would grant a saving throw during the first phase of interaction, but it usually wouldn't recur in later phases unless the topic of the dress came up in conversation."

Games developed around intrigue can produce unusual situations, though, and it is possible that the PCs may be split into groups working at cross-purposes, or, more likely, toward unrelated goals, where each purpose is separate but not in direct conflict. For example, Valeros and Seelah may want to influence the NPCs in the king's court to support a war against the necromancer queen of a neighboring land, while Kyra and Ezren want to influence those same NPCs to gain support for Kyra to marry the princess. In such cases, each groups' number of successful influence checks should be tracked separately; if their goals are unrelated rather than conflicting, one group's influence over an NPC doesn't take that NPC out of play for the others, as it would for an opposing group."

There may not be any skill checks that would allow the PCs to detect such a secret identity (in which case no checks are listed), but if the NPC is disguised or the PCs have met this NPC before under another name, the skill check necessary to uncover the truth is listed here.",

			"",
			"***Biases:*** Some NPCs have biases - subtle attitudes that influence an encounter. For example, an NPC may think favorably of half-orcs and be suspicious of elves. If the NPC's biases affect a PC, apply a +2 or -2 circumstance modifier on that PC's influence checks, depending on whether the bias is in the PC's favor or not. If an NPC is strongly biased for or against a PC, the modifier may be even greater, but such strong biases are readily apparent. PCs can detect a bias with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check.",

If the NPC is hiding something major from the PCs, Bluff and Disguise are also important.

For example, a person with little patience for flattery may think less favorably of someone who showers her with compliments. The skills and DCs required to discover these strengths are listed here. A PC who incorporates an NPC's strength into an influence check takes a -4 penalty on the check. Knowledge of an NPC's strengths can be a powerful tool for sabotaging someone else's attempt to gain influence over her - see the {rule/Countering Influence} section for more information.",
			"",
			"***Weaknesses:*** Most NPCs have at least one weakness. A weakness could be a deep-seated secret or insecurity, or a hobby that the NPC can talk about for days on end. The skills and DCs needed to discover these weaknesses are listed here. For each weakness a PC incorporates into her influence check, she gains a cumulative +2 bonus.",

			"***Influence Skills:*** The skills and DCs for each influence check are listed here. If a skill isn't listed, it normally doesn't work at all, but if a player presents a strong narrative reason why a skill should work, his GM can add it to the list. Diplomacy and Bluff are usually on the list of possible skills. If Diplomacy isn't on the list of skills, there should be a reason in the NPC's personality. For example, an NPC who intensely dislikes small talk and only wishes to converse only about arcane theory may not respond to Diplomacy. However, Diplomacy is rarely the best skill with which to influence someone; the DC of Diplomacy checks to influence an NPC is typically higher than the DC when using skills tailored to the NPC's personality or interests. GMs should keep the PCs' skills in mind when designing a social encounter so each PC has a way to contribute. Not every NPC can necessarily be influenced, in which case discovery checks reveal that the NPC is a lost cause.",

The hostess meets the PCs when they arrive late at night, sharing a drink with them before asking a servant to show them to their rooms in the nearby guest house (allow a single phase of influence or discovery checks against her during this time for the ostensible purpose of trade agreements). However, by the start of festivities the next morning, disaster strikes. A few minutes after the PCs and other guests begin arriving for breakfast, greeted by the hostess's second husband, the butler discovers the hostess's body. A brief argument ensues, with all the NPCs (and possibly the PCs as well) bickering about who should investigate and who might just be trying to hide evidence of the crime. Eventually, the NPCs agree that guards should accompany every person who leaves the drawing room, and the opportunity for influence begins.

If the PCs demonstrate their value to the organization, they can gain influence points, representing their growing ability to call in favors. If the PCs repeatedly fail or work against an organization, they lose influence points (see {rule/Gaining Influence Points} and {rule/Losing Influence Points}). The PCs' influence point total with an organization can be a negative number - the lower the total, the more resources the organization is willing to commit to actively oppose the PCs.",
			"",
			"The PCs' influence points help determine the number of resources an organization is willing to commit to help or hinder them, but it is not the only component of that calculation. If the PCs seek to build a positive relationship with an organization, they may find themselves limited in what benefits they can gain until they perform certain tasks. For example, most organizations limit the number of resources they commit to non-members, so PCs may need to officially join to gain access. On the other hand, an organization at odds with the PCs should not provide the same response to minor insults from the PCs as it does to the PCs crippling one of its major operations. The nine influence ranks presented below take into account tasks that the PCs may accomplish to pass to fundamentally alter their relationship with an organization (see [Table 3-1 under Favors](rule/favors) for examples). To reach a new influence rank, the PCs must accumulate (or lose) a certain number of influence points, as decided by the GM, and perform any required tasks that the GM sets.

Short story arcs generally require lower thresholds than long campaigns. Some groups of players would rather slowly earn influence within a difficult organization, while others would rather see how quickly their PCs can become powerful in multiple organizations. Finally, within a campaign, weaker organizations typically allow the PCs to gain influence ranks more quickly than prominent ones.",

Performing favors requested by an organization is the most effective way for the PCs to accrue influence points with that organization. A typical favor earns the PCs from 2 to 5 influence points, depending upon how difficult and dangerous the favor is to complete. See the {rule/Favors} section for more details. The PCs can also accrue influence points with an organization by taking actions that coincidentally further the organization's interests. Such actions typically earn the PCs 1 or 2 influence points. For example, if the PCs apprehend a notorious jewel thief who has been stealing from their own coffers (as well as those of local nobles), they may gain an influence point with the local nobility. The PCs can also gain influence points by building trust with a member of the organization. The personal influence system found at the beginning of this section is one good way to create an encounter based around improving this NPC's opinion of the PCs, while the [verbal dueling](rule/verbal_duels) system is another. The number of organizational influence points that the PCs can earn from gaining the approval of a single NPC within the organization typically ranges from 1 to 5. Backing a rank-and-file member of the organization is worth at most 1 influence point, while the backing of one of an organization's leaders is worth 5 influence points, and may be worth more in extraordinary circumstances, at the GM's discretion."

			"The PCs generally won't actively seek to lose influence points with an organization. However, the PCs' actions over the course of a campaign are likely to put them at odds with one or more organizations, and the PCs may inadvertently harm organizations that they do not wish to antagonize.

If the PCs horribly botch an attempt to perform a favor for an organization, they may similarly lose 1 or 2 influence points. If the PCs damage a prominent member's reputation or finances, they lose from 1 to 3 influence points, depending on the extent of the damage and the power that member wields within the organization. The PCs also lose influence points if they harm a prominent member of the organization. Killing members of any organization is a particularly effective way to lose influence. For most organizations, any time the PCs kill one or more members of an organization, they lose at least 5 influence points per incident.

In general, the higher the PCs' influence rank, the more evidence the organization requires before it considers any accusations of treachery credible. If an organization declares the PCs traitors, it is possible (though difficult) for them to redeem their reputation. In general, this process requires the PCs to track down and discredit the source of the slanderous evidence. Doing so restores the PCs' original influence point total, and likely earns them additional rewards from the organization for unmasking the true threat against it. If they only partially exonerate themselves, they may regain some but not all of their influence points."

			"The PCs' interactions with organizations are often only a piece of a larger political tapestry. Alliances and rivalries between organizations shape how each organization reacts to the PCs' actions. If two organizations are rivals, they typically require the PCs to choose a side. The PCs may automatically lose influence points with one for supporting the other. For example, if the PCs perform a favor for one faction during a war and gain influence points with that faction, they lose an equal number of influence points with that faction's rivals. In less extreme circumstances, the PCs may lose half as many influence points as they gain.",
			"",
			"While rivalries between organizations make holding split loyalties difficult, allegiances between multiple organizations can help the PCs accrue influence faster than they could otherwise, and provide the PCs with access to additional resources. If the PCs help or harm one of two allied organizations, treat them as coincidentally working for or against the second organization's interests for the purposes of the number of influence points the PCs gain or lose.",

			"An organization's prominence represents the political and social power of that organization in its home community or area of influence. The categories of prominence are weak, moderate, strong, and preeminent. In general, a weak organization can provide only simple assistance within its limited area of concern. Most weak organizations are eager to recruit new members to increase their prominence, though some appreciate the lack of attention they draw from outside forces. A gang of pickpockets is an example of a weak organization. In comparison, a moderate organization holds an established place in the power structure of its local area, and has some connections and contacts with other local organizations. A thieves' guild is likely to be a moderate organization. A strong organization, on the other hand, may be at the top of the power structure for its area of concern, or it may be one of several organizations that hold power on a regional or national scale. The cathedral of a major deity in a state with multiple religious traditions is likely to be a strong organization. Finally, a preeminent organization is the undisputed head of the power structure in its sizable area of concern - the ruling body of a nation is an example of a preeminent organization, as is a merchants' guild that effectively controls trade in a large region."

When the PCs perform a favor for an organization, they can either gain influence points, or they can earn a favor from the organization in return. The PCs can spend favors that they have earned to gain benefits from the organization. The PCs can slowly earn favors over time, after a certain number of sessions or amount of in-game time that is appropriate for the campaign.

			"The base organizational influence system assumes that the PCs act as a unified group and do not take extraordinary effort to conceal their identities and activities. In an intrigue-based campaign, these assumptions are not always accurate. The simplest type of clandestine operation to adjudicate is a single secret favor. If the PCs perform a favor for an organization and conceal their actions, do not decrease the PCs' influence points with that organization's enemies. The PCs can use secret identities to perform more complicated maneuvers, such as playing multiple sides of a conflict, or perhaps even infiltrating an organization as spies. As long as an organization knows that the PCs are infiltrating its rivals, that organization's members continue to believe that they have the PCs' loyalty; they typically overlook minor actions that the PCs take against the organization, so long as the PCs provide a plausible justification for their misdeeds.",
			"",
			"If the PCs use secret identities, track their influence under each set of identities separately as long as they maintain the ruse. Maintaining two distinct sets of identities over a long period of time should be challenging, but not impossible if the PCs are careful. Common features between the identities - anything from physical features or mannerisms to equipment, fighting style, or associates - present the threat of exposure. If the PCs rise to high influence ranks in two opposing organizations, their risk of being caught increases significantly. The {class/vigilante} class is particularly well suited to the challenge of maintaining multiple identities.",
			"",
			"If an organization figures out that the PCs are maintaining two separate identities, the PCs' influence point total for that organization may change drastically. If both sets of the PCs' identities are aligned with an organization, the PCs' influence point total may go as high as the sum of the points they earned under both identities. Conversely, if both sets of the PCs' identities are aligned against an organization, the PCs' influence point total may go as low as a negative number equal to the sum of the two. Adding the two values sometimes allows a single action to count twice - this reflects that the organization may either respect the PCs' dedication to their cause, or revile the PCs for their dedication to opposing it. In most cases, however, the resulting change in influence should be less extreme than a direct sum, even if the organization has a favorable opinion of both identities. If the PCs are working for two opposed organizations, see the last paragraph of [Losing Influence](rule/losing_influence_points) for details on how an organization responds to being betrayed."

			"In its raw form, magic is not an ordered force - it is the all-encompassing chaos of possibility. The same energies that can be shaped to create explosive fireballs, raise the dead, divine the future, heal the sick, and summon demons can do that and more without the direction of skilled spellcasters. Normally, this unfocused magical potential does not exist in reality; it lies beyond reality, where it waits to be tapped. Where exactly magic comes from remains a lively debate today, but when magic is unleashed without any attempt to focus it - when it leaks into the world in its raw form - the result is known as primal magic.",
			"",
			"In some realms, particularly in planes like the Maelstrom or the Abyss in the Great Beyond, magic is left to indulge in its raw chaos as it wishes - here, primal magic is often called \"wild magic.\" On the Material Plane, the world feels the touch of primal magic when the laws of reality themselves have been damaged. Here, magic flows in unpredictable tides and currents. At one moment, a region might function normally while at another, magic won't function at all. Usually, though, primal magic holds sway.",
			"",
			"Manifestations of primal magic tend to build up potential before they explode into existence. Just as a thunderstorm doesn't constantly lance the ground below with a constant beam of lightning, these bolts manifest periodically and almost randomly. And just as lightning can be called with lightning rods, primal magic can be purposefully or accidentally drawn out by utilizing magic in areas where such energies are building.",
			"",
			"When primal magic manifests, roll on the sample Primal Magic Events table to determine what occurs. As the primal magic exerts its power, consider crossing off the effect that occurs and designing replacement events and effects. If you want primal magic to play a big role in your campaign, you should try to ensure that no two effects are ever quite the same. One easy way to achieve this is to simply substitute random spell effects with unusual descriptions in place of normal ones, such as a black fireball that smells of roses and deals acid damage.",
			"",
			"Spontaneous primal magic effects can occur as often or as infrequently as you wish, but as a general rule, try to limit the effects to one per combat encounter at most. The majority of primal magic effects should instead occur when creatures activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, or cast spells in such an area (simply carrying a magic item or gaining the benefits of a constant-use item or spell effect isn't enough - it's the actual act of activation or casting that triggers primal magic). When a creature activates a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability in an area infused with primal magic, there's a 50% chance that the spell effect is replaced by a primal magic effect. A spellcaster casting a spell, using a spell-like ability, or activating a spell completion or spell trigger magic item can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect. Creatures activating other kinds of magic items do not have the option of making a spellcraft check to avoid triggering a primal magic effect.",
			"",
			"When a primal magic effect occurs naturally, it targets a random creature or location in the vicinity around the PCs or whatever region you wish to inflict the event upon. When the effect occurs, you need to determine the CR of the event. If the event is triggered by a spellcaster or a magic item, the event's CR is equal to the spellcaster's or item's caster level. When an event occurs naturally, you can roll 1d20 to determine the CR. Of course, you should strongly consider lowering primal magic event CRs to match or at least closely approximate the average party level of your PCs. Not all primal magic events are harmful, but it's neither fun nor fair for players to frequently be hit with an effect that's too far beyond their ability to deal with.",
			"",
			"Primal magic events often linger for minutes, hours, or even days. These effects can be dispelled via dispel magic and similar spells. Treat the event's CR as its caster level in this case.",
			"",
			"In the sample Primal Magic Events table, the abbreviation \"CR\" is used to indicate a mathematical value; use the primal magic's CR to set this number. For example, a CR 11 primal magic event that lasts for \"CR minutes and affects an area with a radius of CR &times; 5 feet\" lasts for 11 minutes and affects an area with a radius of 55 feet.",

			"Areas affected by primal magic are like scars upon the rugged flesh of the world, invisibly and intangibly overlaid on the fabric of reality. Generally, areas of primal magic form in places afflicted by forces beyond mortal control - areas scoured by godly wrath, breaches between the planes, sites where powerful artifacts were destroyed. In most of these instances, the primal magic subsides as reality repairs itself, though it might take a matter of weeks, years, or even centuries. In the cases of extreme abuse, an area's magical cohesiveness might never recover, resulting in areas of permanent primal magic. In general, the location of existing areas of primal magic and the creation of new areas is left up to the GM, but should always be the result of magic of extraordinary force or of an arcane catastrophe of epic proportions. Such should be encountered only rarely, allowing such sites to retain their sense of danger and calamitous history.",

			"| 55-62 | Strange, shifting curtains of color, akin to an aurora borealis, manifest in the sky but are visible only to those in an area equal to CR &times; 10 feet in radius. Every creature in this area must make a Will save (DC 10 + CR) or be dazed by the shifting colors for 1 round. The colors persist for 1 round per CR. Creatures must make a new save each round to avoid becoming dazed. This is a mind-affecting pattern effect. |",

			"| 69-74 | A storm of energy (with an equal chances of being acid, cold, electricity, or fire) sweeps through the area in a CR &times; 5-foot radius spread. Each round, the storm inflicts 2 hit points of damage per CR; a Reflex save (DC 10 + CR) halves the damage done. The storm persists for CR rounds. |",
			"| 75-78 | Strange telekinetic forces rip through the area, attempting to trip all creatures in a CR &times; 10 foot radius. The event makes a trip combat maneuver check against all available targets, using a CMB of 10 + CR. Any creature tripped by the event has its equipment reorganized and tangled by the mischievous telekinesis. Until a creature takes a minute to reorganize its belongings, retrieving a stowed item is a full-round action. |",
			"| 79-88 | Choose two random creatures in the area, then randomly pick one to be the \"wielder\" and one to be the \"target.\" Roll on the {magic-rod/rod of wonder} table to determine what sort of strange effect occurs between these two creatures. |",
			"| 89-94 | A teleportation storm occurs. All creatures in the area must make a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + CR). Those who fail are teleported, as if via dimension door, so that they randomly shift places. If this places a creature in an area too small to accept its space, it instead appears in the closest adjacent space that can contain it. If only one creature is affected, it teleports a number of feet equal to CR &times; 5 in a random direction. |",

If one creature fails this save but the other succeeds, the creature that fails the save is merely stunned for 1d4 rounds. If both creatures fail the save, their minds are switched into each other's bodies for a number of rounds equal to the event's CR. |",

The amount of knowledge points reduced on a successful Research check depends on the nature of the primary researcher and the type of library.

Polymaths are characters with the ability to attempt any Knowledge check untrained, such as bards, loremasters, and skalds. A polymath reduces a library's kp by 1d12 + the character's Intelligence modifier with a successful Research check. Scholars are academic characters, including Intelligence-based spellcasters, alchemists, investigators, lore shamans, and lore oracles. A scholar reduces a library's kp by 1d8 + the character's Intelligence modifier with a successful Research check. All other characters are considered novices, being either uneducated or untrained in scholarly research. A novice reduces a library's kp by 1d4 + the character's Intelligence modifier with a successful Research check.",
			"",
			"However, certain character classes might be better suited for research in specific libraries that have collections focusing on fields of study particularly relevant to those classes and their abilities. For example, a cleric or inquisitor researching in a religious library connected to her faith might be considered a scholar or even a polymath instead of a novice, or a cavalier or warpriest undertaking research at a famous war college might be considered a scholar while arcanists and wizards are treated as novices."

			"Although some sample libraries are presented at the end of this section, the research rules are most rewarding when used in conjunction with libraries specifically designed to interact with an adventure's story and characters. You can use the following guidelines to create libraries tailored to your campaign's needs.",
			"",
			"***Step 1-Determine the Nature of a Library's Collection:*** First, come up with a general idea of what sort of library you want to create and what sort of knowledge it contains. Is it a small village library, or a capital city's vast historical collection? The recently rediscovered archive of a forgotten monastic sect, or the collected notes of a famed author? Maybe it's an ancient repository of dark magic and disturbing rituals. What manner of information the PCs can learn from researching in this library depends on its contents - a library holding the rightful ancestry of a lost claimant to the throne is likely different from one offering cures to a necromancer's undead plague.",
			"",
			"***Step 2-Determine Research Check Skills:*** Assign Knowledge skills that can be used in Research checks. These skills should be relevant to the overall theme of the library. Libraries typically have three Knowledge skills that can be used for Research checks; however, smaller libraries might have only two assigned skills, while exceptionally extensive collections might have four assigned skills or more. If the library allows any of these skills to be used untrained, you should decide that as well.",
			"",
			"***Step 3-Determine Knowledge Bonus:*** Decide if the library grants a bonus on Knowledge checks used for Research checks in the library. Not every library grants a bonus, but a library focusing on a particular field of study almost always grants a Knowledge bonus to the associated Knowledge skill. A typical library grants a Knowledge bonus from +2 to +5, depending on the size of the library and the quality of its collections.",
			"",
			"***Step 4-Determine CR:*** Establish the library's CR according to the needs of a specific adventure or campaign, typically basing it on the Average Party Level (APL) of the player characters. The higher the CR, the more challenging it is for characters to complete their research. Refer to [Table 12-1](rule/designing_encounters) to determine the appropriate CR for your group, using the same difficulty guidelines as encounters (easy, average, challenging, hard, epic). For example, for a party of four 6th-level PCs, a CR 6 library is average difficulty, CR 5 is easy, CR 7 is challenging, CR 8 is hard, and CR 9 is an epic challenge. Keep in mind that increasing the CR of a library still doesn't stop successful research from eventually happening without either time pressure (see Step 7) or penalties for failure (see {rule/Additional Elements}). If you set an extremely high-CR library against a low-level party without either of those elements, determine the XP they receive accordingly (low or no experience), rather than as per a monster of that CR.",
			"",
			"***Step 5-Determine Complexity:*** A library's Complexity should be fairly challenging since the rules for research assume that the best researcher is the primary researcher, allow two checks to aid another, often add an additional bonus on the Research check, and offer a cumulative bonus on future Research checks. For simple libraries, see Table 3-3 for sample base DCs. For an average library, add 5 to the DC; for a difficult library, add 10. For extremely challenging libraries, you can increase the Complexity by even more, but be aware that research in such a library will be exceptionally difficult, so it might make more sense to increase the library's CR instead. Step 6-Calculate Knowledge Points: A library's knowledge point total is often equal to the library's CR &times; 3.",
			"",
			"### Table 3-3: Library Complexity by CR",
			"",
			"| CR | Base DC |",
			"| --- | --- |",
			"| 1 | 11 |",

			"| 17 | 34 |",
			"| 18 | 36 |",
			"| 19 | 38 |",
			"| 20 | 40 |",
			"",
			"***Step 7-Determine the Time Pressure:*** Thanks to the cumulative bonus on Research checks, eventually even a 1st-level character trained in one of the research skills will fully research a CR 20 library. If there is no sense of time pressure or penalty for failure (see {rule/Additional Elements}), the {rule/research/ system} becomes merely an unnecessary delay in the story's progress since the result isn't in question. For this reason, most research tasks should include a hard limit on how many days the PCs have to succeed. Since the PCs' ability to reduce a library's knowledge points does not scale up as quickly as the library's knowledge points, low-level libraries usually require only 1 or 2 successful Research checks to reach 0 kp; on the other hand, even the most scholarly character can only hope to reduce a CR 20 library to 0 kp in 6 successes (and a more modest lead researcher is likely to need at least 12 successes). Thus, low-CR libraries merit a time pressure of a week or less, whereas high-CR libraries need at least 2 weeks to a month to give most groups enough time to complete them. As always, know your group when designing the time pressure. If a high-level group doesn't have anyone with more than a few ranks in any of the associated skills, it will need more time to build up cumulative bonuses before it can crack the library.",
			"",
			"***Step 8-Determine Research Thresholds:*** The final step in designing a library is creating its research thresholds. In general, a library with 25 kp or fewer has one research threshold for every 5 kp, revealed at 5-kp intervals, while a library with 30 kp or more has one research threshold for every 10 kp, revealed at 10-kp intervals. However, this is just a guideline, and the exact number of research thresholds and their frequency should be determined by how much information the library contains or the plot requires. For example, a library with 30 kp could have research thresholds at 20 kp, 10 kp, and 0 kp, but it could instead reveal information at 25 kp, 20 kp, 10 kp, 8 kp, and 0 kp.",
			"",
			"Once you have determined the number and frequency of a library's research thresholds, decide the specific piece of information revealed at each research threshold. Every bit of knowledge gained at a research threshold should be unique, based on the story you want to tell or the topic the characters are researching. However, the new information might build on the old, narrowing it down with more specific details and useful facets."

			"Libraries can be further customized to make research more challenging, rewarding, or dangerous by incorporating the following elements.",
			"",
			"***Additional Languages:*** A library could consist entirely of volumes written in languages other than Common. To attempt a Research check in such a library, characters who don't speak the language must succeed at a Linguistics check or have access to magic such as {spell/comprehend languages}, and the magic must be active for the entire 8-hour research session. The DC of the Linguistics check depends on the language and the researcher. For modern human languages, such as ethnic or national languages, or non-human tongues that are included in a character's racial bonus languages (such as an elf attempting to research Sylvan writings), the DC is 20. For other non-human tongues that are not part of a character's racial bonus languages (such as a dwarf trying to do research in a gnoll library) or secret languages (such as Druidic), the DC is 25. For ancient, archaic, forgotten, otherworldly, or exceptionally rare languages, the DC is 30. A character using Linguistics to translate proceeds at 1/3 the normal rate (requiring three 8-hour sessions instead of one for each Research check and to gain the +1 cumulative bonus), and a character using Linguistics or magic takes a -2 penalty on Research checks due to the possibility of losing context that would have been more obvious in his native language.",
			"",
			"***Labyrinths and Secret Chambers:*** Some libraries are labyrinthine, either so disorganized as to become puzzles or purposely designed to hide their greatest secrets. Other libraries could be less mazelike, but their deeper secrets might lie behind hidden doors or within concealed chambers only the most determined can discover.",
			"",
			"In the case of labyrinths, each threshold of knowledge achieved takes the researcher deeper into the library's confusing twists and turns. Finding one's way out or finding the path to the next knowledge threshold requires either careful planning (a trail of objects, or using string to navigate the way back) or a successful Intelligence check to find the way. The Intelligence check can have a DC of 10, 15, or even 20, and should take an amount of time appropriate for the size of the library. Each attempt could be a manner of minutes, hours, or even days if the library is truly massive or extradimensional. Further research cannot be conducted while a researcher finds her way out.",
			"",
			"In the case of secret chambers, typically the doors to such locations must be found before a kp threshold can be breached, or such chambers can be more symbolic, such as the case of print written in invisible ink, hidden with {spell/secret page}, or requiring a [psychic duel](rule/psychic_duels) before the secrets are revealed and further research progress can be made.",
			"",
			"***Library Encounters:*** Books and scrolls aren't the only things found in libraries. A library can be turned into an adventure or dungeon all its own with separate chambers and rooms serving as different encounter locations. As PCs undertake their research in the library, they can fight monsters inhabiting the library, roleplay with NPCs engaged in their own research, or overcome hazards, traps, and other obstacles, such as collapsing ceilings and walls, {spell/explosive runes}, {spell/fire trap/s}, [glyphs of warding](spell/glyph_of_warding), {spell/secret page}, symbols, or simply rickety ladders and unstable shelves.",
			"",
			"In addition, researching in a given room of the library might allow characters to reduce the library's knowledge points only by a limited amount. In order to fully reduce the library's kp to 0, perhaps PCs must visit multiple collections in the library, encountering all of the dangers in those rooms before their research is complete. Certain libraries might generate guardians on a regular basis, thus forcing encounters every day or every week until the PCs manage to reduce the library's kp to 0.",
			"",
			"***Penalty for Failure:*** Some libraries are so convoluted and bewildering that failing a Research check can hamper a researcher's progress, or even thwart it entirely. This can be the result of excessively poor organization, such as in a senile old wizard's hodgepodge of books accumulated over decades, or due to deliberate obfuscation, as in the case of infernal contracts. In such libraries, various unusual penalties or consequences might occur after a particular number of Research checks or after a failed Research check. Such a library might not allow the cumulative bonus on further Research checks for each 8-hour period. Furthermore, failing two consecutive Research checks means the researcher has reached a dead end in her studies and is unable to further decrease the library's knowledge points. In this case, the library's knowledge points return to maximum and the researcher can't attempt to research in that particular library again until she gains a rank in at least one of the library's associated skills or recovers some key or clue to help decipher it.",
			"",
			"***Research Rewards:*** Characters can gain more than just knowledge in libraries; they might also find valuable treasures. You can place treasures in a library that are uncovered only when the library's kp are reduced to specific research thresholds. Such treasures often take the form of scrolls, spellbooks, and magic manuals and tomes, or \"intellectual\" items such as a [headband of vast intelligence](magic-wondrous/headband_of_vast_intelligence_2) or a {magic-wondrous/helm of comprehend languages and read magic}. Other objects such as rods, wands, figurines of wondrous power, or even crystal balls might be buried or hidden behind larger stacks of books, just waiting to be discovered by diligent researchers.",
			"",
			"***Specialized Skills:*** Instead of assigning specific Knowledge skills to a library's Research check, you can use Linguistics as the default Research check skill, and assign specialized skills that reflect the specific nature of the library's collections. To carry out research in such a library, a character must succeed at a Linguistics check or at one of the specialized skill checks listed in the library's stat block. The Linguistics check follows all of the normal rules for Research checks, but if a researcher uses the more specialized check to perform her research, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the check for using precisely the correct skill for that library, as opposed to the more general use of Linguistics. This element otherwise follows all of the other rules for Research checks. Any skill, not just Knowledge skills, can be a specialized skill. For example, a military library might have Profession (soldier) as a specialized skill, an archive of famous plays might use Perform (act), or a tome of arcane magic might allow Spellcraft as a specialized skill. The circumstance bonus from specialized skills replaces the general bonus to Knowledge checks a library would otherwise grant; thus if the library is particularly helpful, it might grant more than a +2 circumstance bonus."

Using this system means that if a class gets a spell at a lower level than another class does, that spell's effects are weaker for the former class. A bard's {spell/heroism} is not as good as a wizard's. However, classes with slower spell progressions (such as the bard, paladin, and ranger) have other abilities that keep them competitive when limited magic weakens the overall power of spells.",

			"Consider altering other rules to account for a landscape with lower average DCs. For instance, {feat/Great Fortitude}, {feat/Iron Will}, and {feat/Lightning Reflexes} might provide only a +1 bonus on saves, or the increases to spell DCs from {feat/Spell Focus} and {feat/Greater Spell Focus} could go up to 2.",
			"",
			"***With Esoteric Spell Components:*** This system works especially well with the [esoteric spell components system](rule/esoteric_material_components).

Withdrawal weakens the monster, and as its natural defenses fail, its behavior becomes irrational, particularly when it's around sources of what it is denied or has denied itself.",
			"",
			"A carnivorous or otherwise life-draining undead may safely go a number of days equal to its Hit Dice without a dose of its preferred meal before it starts to feel the effects of hunger. Each additional day after this grace period, the undead must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the undead creature's Hit Dice, + 1 for each previous check). If the undead creature fails its save, it enters withdrawal and begins to take penalties according to the [Withdrawal Penalties table](rule/withdrawal_effects). It must continue to save each day until it feeds again. Additional failed checks increase the penalties as shown on the table. Feats and abilities that affect mortal hunger (such as {feat/Endurance} or a {magic-ring/ring of sustenance}) do not apply to vampire hunger.",
			"",
			"An undead that is suffering from withdrawal grows increasingly drawn and gaunt (or diaphanous and tattered, for incorporeal undead). Any attempts by the creature to conceal its undead nature with the Disguise skill are penalized as noted on the table.",
			"",
			"An undead that suffers withdrawal is acutely aware of its unfulfilled addiction; if presented with the chance to feed, it might be compelled to do so, regardless of the consequences. Anytime it comes within 10 feet of a helpless creature that can sate its desire, it must make another hunger save at the current DC. Failure means it falls upon the helpless creature - whether friend or foe - and attempts to consume or drain it. Until the undead has fed, it can take no action other than to feed from this helpless creature or to enable itself to feed (such as a moroi grappling a creature so it can use its blood drain). During this feeding frenzy, the undead creature takes a -2 penalty to its AC."

			"An undead that hasn't fed recently suffers from withdrawal, depending on the number of hunger saves it has failed. As shown on the Withdrawal Penalties table, an undead creature suffering from withdrawal takes penalties to channel resistance, on Will saves, to Strength and Charisma scores, to damage reduction, to fast healing, and on Disguise checks. The withdrawal penalties apply only if the creature has the ability in question. For example, a hungry moroi's damage reduction decreases,",

			"What constitutes a feeding differs for each undead creature according to its own addiction. For creatures with a blood drain, level drain, or ability drain ability, each use of that ability counts as a feeding. Hungering creatures that lack a drain ability, such as zombies and ghouls, count consuming 1 pound of flesh as feeding (larger and smaller undead require proportionately more or less flesh). For these creatures, the flesh of a creature that has been dead for more than 1 hour staves off withdrawal but does not grant any other benefits, such as feeding bonuses (see below).",

			"",
			"The first benefit - deeply desirable even to barely sentient undead - is the euphoric rush of feeding, which fills the feeder with a sense of power, domination, and focus. The undead gains a +1 resistance bonus on Will saves for 1 hour.",

			"The undead gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saves against spells and effects from creatures that have the same alignment as the target of the feeding. It is because of this effect that vampires so often feed on the innocent and pure, since most of their would-be slayers are of a similarly noble and good disposition.",
			"",
			"The undead gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track creatures of the same type as the target of the feeding. This bonus increases to +8 when the undead is tracking the specific creature on which it fed. The target creature is considered \"very familiar\" for the purposes of divination spells and effects cast by the undead."
