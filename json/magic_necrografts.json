			"A ghoulgut consists of a ghoul's stomach, gallbladder, and liver implanted in the host's torso, resulting in a potent resistance to disease, but also a hunger for flesh. Once per day, the necrograft host can charge her second stomach by feeding on at least 1 pound of raw meat (doing so provides no nutritional value). This charge lasts for 24 hours. While charged, a ghoulgut grants the host a +4 enhancement bonus on saving throws against disease and poison. As a swift or immediate action, the host can expend her stomach's charge to reroll a failed Fortitude saving throw.",

When the command word (which is often kept secret by its creator) is spoken within 60 feet of the host, the gravespawn gland releases a surge of necromantic power, dealing 4d6 points of negative energy damage to the host. The host must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or be instantly slain. Creatures killed in this manner cannot be revived by {spell/breath of life} or {spell/raise dead}. A creature killed by a gravespawn gland rises 1 round later as a mindless zombie.",

Unlike with most necrografts, implanting this organ requires a successful DC 25 Heal check by the necrograft surgeon, not a successful Fortitude save by the recipient. Removing an implanted gravespawn gland requires a successful DC 25 Heal check; if this check is failed by more than 5, the gravespawn gland detonates inside the host.",
