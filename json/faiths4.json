She has a sweet, serious face, and always seems to be listening to something just on the edge of hearing. To combat those fiends who would pervert the visions she grants, Chucaro summons a sap formed of churning mists - anyone struck by the blackjack is overwhelmed by disorienting hallucinations.",

			"The Maiden of Haze and Whimsy brings comfort to those afflicted with mad delusions. She soothes their fevers and helps them make sense of the strange images that plague their minds. To her dedicated followers she brings bright, lucid dreams every night. She frowns on those who use harsh drugs to induce visions at the cost of their physical health; Chucaro's agents strive to bring such broken individuals back to health and teach them to draw phantasmagoria from within rather than through the use of external implements.",

Each has a distinct head and tail, but the two share a pair of arms, one holding a shortspear and the other holding a shield. These items represent the combative and protective aspects of the god. Cihua Couatl teach that conflict is an inevitability, and that one must be ready to defend those who cannot defend themselves. This can take the form of teaching kindness, to encourage helping those in need, or taking arms against those who would cause harm to innocents. They encourage quick and decisive action in combat, and their warrior priests are masters of strategy and tactics. This prowess allows Cihua Couatl's followers to efficiently bring an end to combat while limiting the number of injuries and fatalities on both sides of a conflict. Outside of combat, Cihua Couatl teach that to care for one's self and others only makes everyone stronger. They also serve as a patron god of midwives, encouraging their followers to learn how to care for children. The two couatls are of fluid gender and constantly shift between roles as attacker and defender, symbolizing Cihua Couatl's message that anyone can care for others and rise to defend them when needed. Their common servitors are healers, warriors, and all types of couatls."

From his darkened realm, he continued to grant power to his followers and influence both the First World and Material Plane."

			"When mortal life came into being, so did all of its associated sins, and as sinful souls passed into the afterlife, the Abyss transformed some of them into demons. Thanks to the fertility of mortals and their boundless potential for cruelty, the Abyss over time filled with legions of demons. The belligerent demons clashed with the qlippoth for control over the plane, and though they were relatively young, the demons had the advantage of numbers. They won skirmish after skirmish and, in doing so, increased their strength until some became demon lords to rival the most powerful of the qlippoth.",
			"",
			"The qlippoth lord Cyth-V'sug wanted no part in this endless war and so stayed within his realm. He slew those demons that attempted to invade his sanctuary, but the constant onslaught soon began to wear him down. After careful observation, he realized that his more potent foes were worshiped by self-destructive mortals. He sent tendrils of his consciousness onto the Material Plane and, when he found desperate creatures longing for someone (or something) to answer their prayers, he responded to these pleas. However, while this helped to increase his strength, Cyth-V'sug was still ultimately forced into the Abyss's deepest, most remote areas alongside the other qlippoth.",
			"",
			"As Cyth-V'sug lurked in these dark domains, he continued to hear the entreaties of his worshipers. They constantly wanted more - more divine gifts, and more responses from their deity. This greed had a strange effect on the qlippoth lord: he began to experience this mortal emotion of desire himself. He wanted his original home back. He wanted to taste more demon blood. He wanted vengeance for being driven out. In time, the other qlippoth lords - Oaur-Ooung in particular - noticed this change and were not pleased. They threatened Cyth-V'sug with destruction, and so he fled to the upper reaches of the Abyss.",
			"",
			"Cyth-V'sug soon realized that he had become like the very demons he hated, but this revelation did nothing to quell his expanding hunger. He continued to demand sacrifices from his followers, and as he did so, he slowly transformed into a full demon lord. Though he is now one of their kind, his hatred for demons burns no less hot. His ultimate goal is to consume every world of the Material Plane that contains mortal life, thereby cutting demons off from their source of souls and allowing the qlippoth to return from exile. That this plan may also result in his own destruction does not matter to Cyth-V'sug, as it means his appetite will finally be sated."

It was through the consumption of countless demons and once-mortal petitioners that Dagon gained sentience and in so doing infused his terrible form with the influence of mortal sin. He is aware of his origin as a nearly mindless qlippoth and does not seek to return to this state; on the contrary, reveling in the awareness he earned, the demon lord has spent eons building up his presence on countless Material Plane worlds.

He often broods during such times - right up until he undertakes a violent rampage. The church of Dahak is similar, especially on Golarion where it is currently engaged in a \"civil\" phase. Dahak's Golarion-based clergy will turn on others only when their enemies have sufficiently aggravated them, or Dahak's own divine messages shift fully toward destruction."

Damerrich understands that evil must sometimes be slain, but never lightly, never easily. Damerrich takes on the weight of all the necessary executions and just deaths in the world. Executioners look to this empyreal lord whenever they have qualms with their line of work, and Damerrich teaches them that while their duty is a sober and joy-free one, it is necessary to ensure peace and goodness.",

Once Damerrich commits to combat, he strikes heavily and without hesitation. Centuries of death wear on Damerrich's soul, but only because of the solemn responsibility, not because of guilt or reluctance - when the time comes for action, Damerrich's blow is sure. The Weighted Swing holds no room for regret.",

Those wrongly sentenced to death pray for intercession from Damerrich, and can hope to receive help in the form of one of his divine agents. Corrupt judges and careless executioners rouse the Weighted Swing's ire like nothing else. Similarly, if an accused deserving of death is set free, Damerrich's agents might appear both to perform the just execution and to chastise those who set the criminal free. The Weighted Swing does not take pleasure in his grim but necessary task, and those who take the matter of execution too lightly or who sadistically revel in the act may expect retribution from Damerrich's chosen elimination squad of shield archons, Those of the Heaving Hand.",

			"Desna is an impulsive and aloof goddess who delights in freedom, discovery, and mystery. Her aloofness stems not from arrogance, but from confidence in her own abilities and her desire to be unburdened by troubles. She is a collection of contrasts: an ancient goddess who dislikes predicting the future, a traveler who cares nothing for her destination, a carefree creature of instinct haunted by a past stretching back eons, and a peaceful deity forced to battle with old enemies, eternally young despite the weight of ages and stars upon her.",
			"",
			"Some believe Desna is flighty, frivolous, and easily distracted, but she has a cold side born of loss, tragedy, and battle. As a luck goddess, she always believes there is a chance for success, but knows that dreams can turn to nightmares and bright destinies can become dark fates; these opposites in her own nature define her and give her things to strive against. She challenges those who would corrupt her domain or who have wronged her friends or followers, striking at them with burning starlight, bad luck, and energies alien to Golarion.",
			"",
			"Desna usually appears to her followers as a beautiful but remote elven acolyte of her faith. In this guise, she aids people in need or suggests relevant excerpts from her holy writings, The Eight Scrolls, as a way to lead the faithful on the correct path. She is not above singing to lighten dour moods or dancing with those whose confidence is in need of reinvigoration. When Desna wishes to reveal her true nature, she transforms her common clothing into a billowing silken gown and grows brightly colored butterfly wings on her back, although in somber situations her wing colors are pale and moth-like."

However, when mortality was young, she was a roundly impassioned planetar angel serving as a general in {faith/Erastil/'s} celestial armies. Doloras was charged with holding the line against a decades-long incursion of demons rushing the outskirts of Erastil's realm in Heaven. But when several solar angels were dragged off as prisoners into the Abyss, including Doloras's three brothers, Doloras followed, alone, to hunt the demons she thought responsible. When she finally caught up to them in an upper pocket of the Abyss, she trapped and chained the demons, full of fury. For 66 days, she tortured them for information about her brothers' whereabouts.",

At first she was torn by the moral quandary that her deeds created, but she eventually became entirely inured to the demons' guttural screams of agony and cries for mercy. She even found herself enjoying the act of inflicting pain on helpless souls so much that even when it became clear that these demons weren't part of her brothers' kidnapping party, she continued.",
			"",
			"Later, Doloras discovered what came as no surprise: the gates of Heaven were closed to her. She had fallen from grace, but as she had now found salvation through an absence of emotion, she set herself about finding a home that suited her better. Embracing the title She Who Betrays Her Own, Doloras realized she no longer cared about her brothers. As for her angelic siblings, to this day they mourn her as dead, though they harbor deep suspicions about their sister's true fate.",

			"She was exploring Caina when {faith/Mephistopheles}, Lord of the Eighth, found her and offered her a deal. Doloras would have her choice of spire and all that she wished to outfit her new home, in exchange for viciously torturing specific souls whenever he asked. Without reservation, Doloras agreed, and ever since she has resided on the Spike of Our Lady's Pain. Unlike many fiends, the Sadistic Angel does not seek dominion; she wishes only to inflict her emotionless, bloodthirsty vision on those set before her. She was willing to ally with the other Queens of the Night when {faith/Eiseth} drew them all together, so long as Doloras was free to torment her choice of captives - a condition the other queens have happily granted. She regards the mortal-given title of Whore Queen with characteristic indifference, and those who try to hurl the epithet at her often find themselves upon her rack, thus providing Doloras as much joy as one such as her can feel."

Orcs typically claim Dretha is the mate of the male god their tribe holds in highest esteem.

			"When the Azlanti first formed larger groups and sought new lands and greater resources, they followed a god they called Elion, who taught them the ways of the earth and skies. They learned that if they could read the ever-changing signals of the natural world, they could travel through wild and dangerous places to find the best of what creation provides. Elion also taught the Azlanti that there were great lands beyond the seas that surrounded their island continent. His followers were among the first Azlanti to sail across the water to visit what is now western Avistan and Garund and eastern Arcadia. Eager to learn more about other people and places in Golarion, the faithful of Elion sought locations the Azlanti had never visited before, and they looked past the horizon to new, exciting adventures. It is believed that after Earthfall, Elion's priests were instrumental in leading survivors to other continents.",
			"",
			"The church counted thousands of forward priests among its ranks who sought out new places to explore and returned to the empire with new information. It is believed that a prominent priest of Elion first encouraged the empire to colonize the moon and other planets in the solar system. Some [Pathfinders](rule/aff_scholars) theorize that Elion or his faithful created the first ancient {magic-wondrous/wayfinder/s}.",
			"",
			"While there are still a few scattered pockets of those who worship Elion, he is mostly unknown on Golarion today. Some believe that Elion became distracted from Golarion after Earthfall and ventured off for the edges of the multiverse.",
			"",
			"Elion and {faith/Myr} have a passionate yet difficult relationship. They are wildly in love, but Elion's need to constantly explore often keeps him away from home, and their shared guilt at their daughter {faith/Sicva/'s} corruption of their areas of concern has strained their relationship."

			"Erastil, also known as Old Deadeye, is an ancient deity who first became known on Golarion when early humanoids began to domesticate and dominate their natural surroundings. Pastoral legends claim that Old Deadeye crafted the first bow as a gift to mortals so that they might learn to hunt and survive in the dangerous world. Though civilization has continued to advance beyond simple villages, Erastil remains popular in tradition and in the frontiers of the world, a transitional figure between the worship of the Green Faith and the religions of cities.",
			"",
			"Erastil is primarily a nature deity focusing on the plants and animals that farmers, hunters, and ranchers deal with in their challenging lives. He is also a god of close-knit communities and families, and has a protector aspect that only surfaces when such things are threatened. Erastil eschews crusades and brazen heroism, and he has no grand plans to eradicate chaos and evil from the world; he simply wants people to be able to live their lives in peace without the threat of being devoured by monsters, conscripted into an army, or destroyed by world-ending magic. He is a stern patriarch whose spirit is as hard as wood. He isn't afraid to face down a bully, nor is he too proud to calm a frightened child. He teaches how to read the turning of the seasons, how to know when to sow and reap, how to tell when livestock are sick or gravid, how to poultice a wound and set a broken leg, how to spot a straggling sheep or the signs that a dog has gone rabid. He believes that cooperation leads to friendship and safety, and that if mortals respect the gifts of nature, it will sustain them. He loves customs that encourage strong family bonds - no matter how quaint they are by modern standards - and enjoys hunting for sustenance but not for sport. Happy weddings and new babies make him smile. He is not one to spout philosophy, and instead gives practical advice and hands-on teaching.",
			"",
			"Erastil's avatar is an upright hunter with the head of an elk, clad in well-used leathers and carrying a simple bow. Old legends say that halflings and humans each see him as a member of their own race, even when members  of both races are looking at him at the same time. Some representations show him as fully human - usually of Ulfen or Kellid heritage - depicting how he sometimes appears to children, lost travelers, or those he simply doesn't wish to reveal his divine nature to. In most stories, Old Deadeye's arrows never miss, and a few communities still own a spent arrow supposedly once fired by Erastil, passed down through the generations and treasured for its connection to the god."

Specifically, Erecura, Queen of Dis, wields the right to exercise power in the city as she sees fit. Further, Dispater often calls on Erecura to arbitrate disputes between high-ranking devils and others under his purview. A planar traveler who has run afoul of one of Dispater's designated underlings, who needs a favor before visiting the Market of Breaths, or who has been duped or exploited in the city's bowels might appeal to Erecura for resolution. In particularly desperate cases, an adventurer might appeal to Erecura to overturn a decision that one of Dispater's underlings or the First King himself has handed down.",

She is a contemporary of {faith/Erastil}, and while he has moved on and embraced towns and other small aspects of civilization, she is content with tribal settlements and adhering to the old ways, including great sacrifices, mass bloodlettings, butchering large quantities of livestock, and so on. In times of suffering she grows even more demanding, and her people can only appease her by offering up a sacrifice of one of their own kind. She is usually shown as a bald, female stone giant wearing a crown of leaves, a dress of red mammoth fur, and typically holding a haunch of meat in one hand and a stone tablet in the other. When depicted in her vengeful aspect, she wears a necklace of knives or arrowheads, whereas her fertility aspect shows her either pregnant or holding an infant in each hand."

Her most famous and only confirmed son is {faith/Ragathiel}, the product of Feronia's short-lived marriage to the archdevil {faith/Dispater}; while their son was still a babe, Feronia amicably left Hell, taking Ragathiel with her, and nurtured him until he became an empyreal lord. The number of other nascent divinities Feronia currently protects remains unknown, but she is said to have thwarted several divine plots to retrieve or slay her charges. Similarly, suitors - even those of a divine nature - who try to insinuate themselves into the Cradle of Flames are invariably rebuffed, as Feronia insists on meeting and courting potential love interests on her own terms.",

His face is dominated by a fanged mouth from which clouds of smoke, thick rivulets of magma, and tongues of fire emerge.

He can also command the viscosity of lava, causing it to run like water, thicken into a mud-like consistency, or harden instantly into rock. He uses the latter ability not only to trap foes immersed in lava, but also to swiftly shape weapons of volcanic glass that burn with fire. Yet it is Flauros's command over volcanoes that is most devastating; legends tell of the demon lord causing new volcanoes to emerge from the ground to raze entire regions that have slighted him.",

The Mistress of Fire, a jealous and vindictive elemental lord named {faith/Ymeri}, has long waged war against Flauros for the salamanders' worship, but Flauros has traditionally emerged the victor. The demon lord has even been known to work portals into the hearts of volcanoes in his domain, burning through reality to connect to the equally violent volcanoes that line the borders between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire - all for the sole purpose of tormenting Ymeri by leading armies of demons on periodic assaults against her domains."

When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the {umr/swallow whole/ universal monster ability}. Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free. Activating three-headed serpent is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",

Instead, Ghlaunder revels in the world's sickness, and his followers infest communities as surely as any parasite, often in the guise of devout priests of other religions, while working to cultivate filth and fever. His cultists are indiscriminate in their targets - young, old, fit, or frail, it matters not - so long as they pass their affliction on to the next, then they to another, and like the candle held too close to the curtain, the world alights in infection and death.",

The mothers of dying infants or the infirm often appeal to Ghlaunder, and the god sometimes grants respite from sickness.

This is the legendary song of the swamp, and few that listen to it are left unchanged, their thoughts increasingly obsessed with tracking down the source of the song to offer themselves to Gogunta as meals - or as something more unspeakable. When confronted by those she simply wishes to kill rather than feed upon or mate with, Gogunta can attack with her multiple acid-dripping tongues, her many fanged maws, and her sharp talons.

Though not actually a collective consciousness like {faith/Shyka}, Madgh's faces appear to represent different aspects of her personality, though not always the same one; a supplicant who notices the red-haired face radiating maternal affection in one interaction might attempt to curry favor with it the next time, only to find it personifying rage or humor. When necessary, Magdh has even been known to split into three separate women in order to accomplish some task, yet the Eldest often seems reserved or less lucid for a time following such separations."

When dwarves fall short of this state of readiness, Magrim seeks to reshape them through whatever means are necessary to allow them to fulfill their roles.

Each rune has its own power related to a specific concept and, on rare occasions, Magrim loans such runes out to his most faithful followers to aid them in accomplishing specific tasks. However, most runes in the possession of his church are holy runeplates, infused with the power of runes as taught to his followers, but not the true runes Magrim carries for his own use.",

Generations, entire millennia, and whole worlds of spirits passed through her court en route to their afterlives. Mortals called Mahathallah the Maiden of Mists, whose gaze pierced any veil and whose whisper parted any fog. She never sought praise, but she came to be worshiped nonetheless as one of the mysterious leaders of her kind: a psychopomp usher. Though her mistress, {faith/Pharasma}, the Lady of Graves, never said as much, she was pleased. Mahathallah, however, could never entirely accept the prayers offered in her name. Her faithful claimed she knew every beginning, every act, and every end, but that wasn't true. Mahathallah knew of every mortal's demise and could predict the dooms of far greater beings - but to her own end she was utterly blind.",

Her appearance endlessly shifts between that of a youthful, though cadaverous, angel wearing a dusk-hued burial gown and that of a rotting crone trailing tatters and shattered wings. This cycle of decay and regeneration advances erratically, sometimes taking as long as a day or as little as a moment. Although typically cold and dispassionate, Mahathallah's state of mind seems to affect her appearance, youth being the mask of her anger and age that of her nihilistic wisdom. Ever-changing, Mahathallah is impossible to depict accurately. Artists often represent her as a vaguely feminine figure cloaked in somber mists, or they portray her by her symbol alone - a glaring eye surrounded by an assortment of occult sigils."

Yet as the infernal lords departed, a voice from within the tomb stopped them. Somehow, the magical trove he floated upon for ages, the fury of the Maelstrom, and the power of Hell combined to remake Mammon as an animating spirit. Mammon collected the gems and riches of his burial treasures, creating from them a gleaming and infinitely changeable new form to serve as his body. Intrigued by this strange resurrection, Asmodeus supplied Mammon with vast wealth from the depths of Nessus and remade Mammon's crypt into a new realm, the Hellish vault of Erebus.",

The vaults of Erebus have grown vast: every type of treasure imaginable fills the realm and contributes to his body. At the heart of Erebus hangs the Argent Prince, a fiendishly beautiful, silvery representation of Mammon's former angelic form. When attending councils with his peers, Mammon instructs a contingent of servants to carry an ark filled with specially chosen riches to Nessus, allowing the archdevil to assume exceptionally majestic forms before his peers."

Her people cried out to her for protection, and the Mother of Hearth and Wall spurred her fellow empyreal lords to cooperate despite their philosophical differences, saving untold millions. With the signing of the Celestial Concordance, Mazludeh found herself in the role of the newly formed nation's matron goddess.",

			"Mazludeh acts as a guardian of knowledge, protector of settlements, and guiding hand for those who strengthen their community, either literally by creating strong walls, dwellings, and monuments, or figuratively as parents, guards, and especially educators. Her clergy serve not just as spiritual guides, but often as city planners, architects, archivists, engineers, and farmers, all the while striving to maintain a careful balance between the needs of individuals and the needs of the entire community. Her worshipers depict her most frequently as an enormous serpent whose shaggy mane is heavy with figs or eggs, or as a medusa-like woman with serpents for hair, leading many scholars to speculate her divine agency predates humanity, and that she may have once been worshipped by serpentfolk or lizardfolk in a bygone age."

In addition, your nails become razor sharp, granting you two natural claw attacks that deal damage appropriate to your size (1d4 for a Medium creature). If you already had claw attacks, those attacks deal damage as though you were one size larger instead. You become female (if you weren't already) and physically attractive; depending on how drastic the changes are, you may or may not still be recognizable as your former self. Hags do not become physically attractive in this way.",
			">3. **Maiming Strike (Su)** With a single ripping claw, you destroy a creature's virility and wreck its physical and magical potency. Three times per day, you can make a single claw attack as a standard action. In addition to taking normal claw damage, the creature struck must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher) or become permanently mutilated in a physical and spiritual way. The victim takes a -6 penalty to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (chosen by you) and on caster level checks, {rule/concentration} checks, and spell penetration checks. The victim can no longer sire or birth children. This is a curse effect.",

			"Mestama prefers to use stealth, subtlety, and unexpected violence in combat, striking from hiding to inflict horrific, bleeding mutilations before vanishing once more. Her mere presence complicates cooperation and antagonizes those already in pain, so that wounds are difficult to heal, and often those who seek to provide aid and comfort to those in agony find themselves in greater peril when their own magic or aid turns back on them in horrific ways. Despite Mestama's brutal skill and cackling glee in combat, she much prefers to deal with her enemies via subtler methods. Deception is her preference, working from within a group to turn its members against each other and manipulating events and relationships so that support structures collapse and good intentions inevitably result in atrocities that are disturbingly easy to accept as deliberate treacheries."

			"The ancient entity known as Mhar first attempted to enter Golarion eons ago, using the planet's crust as a womb. The attempt to manifest failed for unknown reasons; perhaps the alignment of the planets was not right, or perhaps other entities acted to still the birth before it came to term. Yet Mhar's cult believes not that their god failed to be born, but rather that its gestation is merely one measured in eons. The cult further believes that the time for Mhar's birth draws near, and that when the Great Old One &mdash; said to dwell deep under the tallest mountain in the Inner Sea region, a peak in the Kodar Mountains known as Mhar Massif &mdash; finally wakens, it will transform much of northern Avistan into a new realm of fire and ash that will spread across world. The time of this birth, the cult believes, can be predicted by a sudden increase in the number of violent, fatal earthquakes and sudden instances of volcanism throughout the world, and some of Mhar's more powerful worshipers seek to hasten that birth by triggering their own tectonic disasters in key places.",
			"",
			"Mhar's true shape is unknown, for the deity technically has yet to enter existence. In images created by its cult, the Great Old One is generally depicted as a volcano-shaped leviathan, its caldera surrounded by huge fangs of molten lava and its slopes bearing forests of terrifying, razor sharp crystal limbs."

			">Spend time meditating among roses you have planted yourself, so you can inhale their sacred scent while offering prayers to Milani. If no such roses are available, you can instead brew tea from herbs and rose petals and share the tea with close friends or neighbors. Preferred topics for conversation during this teatime include hopes for the future and preparations for times of need, but the act of sharing is itself enough. During times of war or conflict, though, you must instead spend time sparring, preferably with friends or neighbors whom you plan to fight alongside during the conflicts to come. If you are imprisoned and unable to spar, you can instead sing any song of hope or resistance in unison with one or more fellow prisoners.

Three times per day as a swift action, you can inspire such a creature to throw off the influence, granting that creature a new saving throw to immediately end the effect.

Fortunately, the goddess teaches that the truly devout who are martyred saving other people from death or tyranny will rise again in some way - perhaps even immediately, though being reborn in the faith is much more likely.",
			">- Some priests claim to be the incarnations of past followers of the goddess, able to access memories of past lives with the proper magic and meditation. A follower born after Milani ascended to godhood (about a century ago) can attempt to search for his past lives' memories by casting legend lore, which Milani grants only for this purpose to clerics, inquisitors, and warpriests as a 4th-level divine spell. The first time a caster attempts this use of the spell, he rolls 1d4-1 to determine the number of specific followers of Milani whose memories he accesses; each time he uses the spell, it reveals only information known to those individuals. If the result of the roll is 0, the caster can access no memories, either because he is not a reincarnated follower of Milani or because the goddess has not made his past lives' memories available.",
			"",
			"### Description",
			"",
			"Milani is relatively a new god, having ascended to full divinity only in the last century. Born a half-elf in a community of Forlorn elves over 2 millennia ago, Milani was raised to believe that the elves would one day return to restore true civilization to Golarion. When the demon {faith/Treerazer} attacked Kyonin and the elves did not return to stop him, she embraced her human heritage and used her skills as a ranger to strike at Treerazer's minions. For this, the living god {faith/Aroden} blessed her and tasked her with protecting isolated human settlements. As Aroden's champion, she famously defended the common folk against monsters, barbarians, oppressive lords, and diabolists for nearly a century. In reward for her service, Aroden sainted her and restored her youth. She spent the subsequent centuries crafting visions to inspire mortals to greatness. Upon Aroden's death, bearing a tiny portion of the Last Azlanti's power and maintaining part of his realm allowed her to gain a foothold on divinity.",
			"",
			"Also known as the Everbloom, Milani is an outgoing goddess who still clearly remembers mortal life. Her religion is young and small enough for her to take a personal interest in the lives of her followers. Milani's ability to directly intervene in the mortal world is constrained, but she offers advice flavored with familiarity and jokes whenever she is able. She sees every object as a tool for fighting oppression, from a common {eq-weapon/scythe} that can cut through binding ropes to a printing press than can subvert a tyrant's reputation. She also teaches that a common purpose makes the whole greater than the sum of the individual parts - whether that purpose is to start a revolution, drive out an unscrupulous lender, or just get through a rough spot in a marriage. A person must recognize and take advantage of her strengths, acknowledge and compensate for her faults, and push past despair to victory.",
			"",
			"Milani manifests as a half-elven woman in the prime of life with stark white hair and white swan's wings. She is usually dressed as a ranger, clad in homemade light armor made of leather and wood, and she carries a morningstar and shield. In art, she is usually shown breaking chains, slaying fiends, and leading peasants to overwhelm evil-looking knights."
