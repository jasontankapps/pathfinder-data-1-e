			"Gozreh is timeless. Born when the first breeze caressed the ocean, she is ever changing, tempestuous, and unpredictable, yet also prone to periods of constancy, stillness, and routine. He is the storm cloud chased by clear skies, the spring warmth that follows winter, and the fair winds that carry seagoing ships. She is the great wave that capsizes those ships, the gentle current that deposits sailors on safe shores, and the rising and falling tides. Those who ply the waters or rely upon the rains know this better than most, and are sure to placate Gozreh and honor him when the wind and waves are favorable.",
			"",
			"Gozreh has two aspects, equally depicted in art and sculpture. When at sea or over water, Gozreh is a woman with wild, flowing green hair, whose body transforms into endless waves. In the sky and over land, Gozreh appears as an aged man with a long white beard, emerging from a mighty storm cloud. Gozreh is moody and brooding, able to spend weeks in a glowering quiet only to explode in a fury of water, wind, and lightning. He is an elemental force, not fettered by the work of mortals; he may turn aside his wrath when appeased with gifts and flattering words, or he may ignore mortal cries entirely. Many cargo ships throw a crate or two overboard in the deep ocean to satisfy her, so that she does not take more by force. He is the amoral side of nature, that which brings life and takes it unexpectedly. Gozreh represents both female and male facets of life, unconstrained by civilization's notions of masculinity and femininity. Grandmother, grandfather, brother, sister, eternal and ever changing, the Wind and the Waves echo and shape the countless living things on Golarion.",
			"",
			"Gozreh refers to himself or herself as \"I\" or \"We\" interchangeably. He loves to race the wind, tearing clouds in two with his passing, or sculpting them into islands and palaces for his pleasure. She hides under the waves and plummets to the crushing depths of the ocean, chasing whales and building grottoes visible only by the light of the glowing creatures that live there. He hates those who defile the sky with smoke, taint the waters with mortal filth, or abuse the bounties of land and sea. Her official church is small, but her lay worshipers are countless. He particularly likes seabirds, flying fish, and frogs, both as living specimens and as sacrificial offerings. He is known to watch the world through the eyes of beasts, whether on the wing or under the sea, f litting from the body of a solitary bear to the countless beating hearts of a flock of starlings. He senses the day and night through green plants and pale fungi, drinking deeply through the roots of the mighty oak or clinging to a stone as the tiniest moss or lichen.",
			"",
			"Gozreh is usually depicted as a colossal humanoid whose lower half trails away into a mass of roiling elemental matter. In male form, he appears as a storm cloud and always remains flying - according to one old legend, he can stretch from one horizon to the other, darkening the entire sky with his fury. In female form, Gozreh's body is usually shown blending with the water of a lake or sea. She has been known to rise from a waterspout, but sometimes gathers all the nearby water into a great wave, emerging from the top as a nymph-like shape, a crone, or a vaguely humanoid construct of pure water.",

Eventually, she wove her own freedom and left behind divine control.

She encourages pranks to teach valuable life lessons and loves laying the mighty low, though cruelty and predation draw her outrage.",

			"The Green Faith is a multifaceted set of beliefs centered on the natural world which grew out of an ancient conflict between {class/druid/s} that worshiped different elemental aspects of the world. As a druidic belief system, it is shamanistic, but also has elements of the ecclesiastical in its strong hierarchy and an underlying current of worship of {faith/Gozreh}. It teaches that all things are connected and that the natural changes of the weather, the world, and individuals over time are to be respected and celebrated rather than feared. Even death is just another change. The Green Faith is most prominent in Andoran, Nirmathas, Taldor, and Sevenarches in the River Kingdoms, but was once strongest in Sarkoris before that nation fell to the Worldwound. Though Sarkoris is believed by many to be the birthplace of the Green Faith, much of the Sarkorian druid's knowledge now lies hidden in the Worldwound or in isolated troves across the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"Members of the Green Faith typically recognize and accept that all things change in time, show impartiality among people, and try to protect the natural world from exploitation by humanoids as well as from defilement by the presence of undead, aberrations, and other unnatural forces. In addition to druids, barbarians and rangers are common followers of the Green Faith."

			"Groetus presides over the end times - the demise of the world, or perhaps the destruction of the multiverse itself. Having silently witnessed billions of souls from countless worlds filter through the Boneyard, he is unconcerned with the fates of individual heroes, villages, or even civilizations. Despite his chaotic alignment, he is an agent of inevitable fate, ensuring that all things pass. He chose this role for himself, the dispassionate observer in balance against the dispassionate judge.",
			"",
			"Groetus's role is to close the book on this reality when the final page of its story is told. He knows only how the story ends, and uses that knowledge to piece together what is yet to come - a conflict occurs, this entity survives until the end of the story, this other entity does not, and so on - and what to do next once the tale is finished. His attention is on the final goal and the cosmic dynamics that may enable or delay that goal: the subtle movement of planes against each other, the brooding thoughts of rising gods, and the births and deaths of stars in the remote expanse of space.",
			"",
			"Groetus rarely appears in human form, but a few records from ancient Azlant describe him as a tall, slender man wearing a gray, cowled robe that hangs heavily to the floor. He is slightly bent at the neck, as if bearing a great weight on his head, with ashen skin, hollow eyes, and long, smooth hands. His voice is the dry whisper of old paper, his laughter low and breathy, and his inflection archaic or foreign. His feet are bare and covered in soot, as if he had walked through an extinguished fire.",
			"",
			"Most of Groetus's priests bear some kind of {rule/in|sanity>_and_madness} (e.g. amnesia, mania, and paranoia). They can still function in society, but their broken minds hear whispers of the god's will, and they hold beliefs that no sane being would embrace. Note that Groetus's priests are insane even though none of their mental ability scores have been reduced to 0. Also, followers of the god do not see this insanity as an affliction; rather, they see this connection to Groetus as a gift worth celebrating. A priest's insanity can be cured, but unless she immediately rejects Groetus as a patron deity, she relapses in a matter of hours or days.",

The Keeper teaches that those who fail to achieve transcendence in this life will have another opportunity in the next, and sometimes the greatest mercy is to hasten the cycle by a turn.",

The mandala represents all the collected wisdom of the gods recorded in the *Azvadeva Pujila.* Gruhasthans do not attempt to artistically depict their god in the form of the text itself, for any such depiction would be incomplete and therefore imperfect, and no greater insult to the Keeper exists than to associate him with imperfect understanding."

After crossing a powerful rival - {monster/Baba Yaga} or {faith/Magdh}, by most accounts - the immortal dilettante was punished with deformities and cast into the mortal realm. Other stories describe her as a trio of bickering sisters who befell the same fate, and were so mutilated that they were forced to lean on one another to even stand, eventually growing together into one loathsome, hateful whole. In the wake of such exile, kindness and civility are, to her, dribbles of poisoned honey, and Gyronna would burn all the world to ash to eradicate such mockery and deception.",
			"",
			"Gyronna's complete figure is rarely depicted; she is more often represented as the same bloodshot eye her followers use as their unholy symbol. Her rare manifestations are chaotic, shifting form mid-conversation - sometimes decrepit, other times vibrantly young, beautiful, withered and dead, jubilant, weeping, or raging. According to ancient tales, the Angry Hag has no true form beyond the singular bulging eye through which she sees the shadows cast by even the brightest lights. Only her gender remains constant - though she presents vastly differing images of womanhood - as do the ragged vestments in which she wraps herself."

			"Many believe that Haagenti, known in some circles as the Whispers Within (a conceit some inventors and alchemists liken to a form of external but mysterious muse that manifests as soft voices in the back of the mind) is among the least destructive and most reasonable of the demon lords. Of course, this impression is largely smoke and mirrors, for Haagenti is as cruel and sadistic as any demon lord. He simply masks his evil through alchemical creations and wondrous inventions that, while seeming beneficial, subtly influence the development of a society toward destruction. Transmuting lead to gold may seem like a financial miracle, but applied too often, it can destroy a nation's or even a world's economy. The power to bring back the dead may seem like the ultimate mercy, but most beings restored to life via Haagenti's gifts end up as sadists or demon-worshiping villains. The greatest secret he has revealed to mortals is the method of transmuting lead into gold using a {magic-artifact/philosopher's stone} (a revelation he granted the wizardly rulers of ancient Thassilon - that these rulers went on to become cruel and sadistic tyrants can be no mere coincidence), but he is the author of other secrets as well, such as the method of creating {monster/retriever/s} and the principles underlying drow fleshwarping. Scholars believe Haagenti has been responsible for guiding many of humanity's greatest minds to discover new methods of inflicting destruction and pain on each other.",

He often appears as an especially attractive member of whatever race he interacts with, particularly in a shape that others will find seductive or pleasing to be around. Regardless of his form, he maintains a dark sense of humor and irony, incorporating some unsettling feature to reflect his demonic nature and mock the form he took. This could be obvious: horns, a hoofed foot, or demonic wings; it could instead be something more subtle, such as eyelids that blink sideways, fingernails on the undersides of his fingers, or a navel in the small of his back. In such cases, he might take pains to hide his \"defect,\" only to reveal the truth after a victim has profited from the nefarious secrets Haagenti revealed.",

You must have enough water to form the weapon, an amount equal to the weapon's normal weight. Once formed, the weapon behaves as a weapon of its type with an enhancement bonus of +1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 additional Hit Dice you have beyond 5 (up to a maximum of +4 at 20 Hit Dice). This weapon deals double the normal amount of damage to creatures with the fire subtype. The weapon dissolves into ordinary water after a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or as soon as it leaves your hand, whichever happens first.",

At 20th level, if you fall below 0 hit points and your body is fully submerged in a river, you automatically stabilize.",

More likely, however, these vendettas serve only to consolidate the antipaladins' personal power or serve their own agendas. Their code is one of persecution under the guise of protection.

			"Clerics of Hanspur, who are indoctrinated in the deeper mysteries of his faith, know that their god was not merely murdered by a traveling companion. The companion was a priest of the daemonic harbinger {faith/Corosbel}, and the murder was a sacrificial ritual intended to consign Hanspur's soul to the Horseman of Death, {faith/Charon}, with whom Corosbel wished to gain favor. However, the ritual sacrifice did not proceed as planned. Though the details of what went awry are unclear, Hanspur's clerics believe {faith/Gozreh} subtly interceded, preventing Corosbel from claiming the entirety of Hanspur's soul for Abaddon. The remainder was bound within Hanspur's dire rat companion, Ashkaelae. Hanspur returned from death a week after the attempted sacrifice, rising from the Sellen River as a demigod with his latent mortal soul fractured. This transformation left him callous and cold. It is unclear whether Gozreh intended for Hanspur to emerge from the waters as a divine being or merely as a divine servitor; the inscrutable nature deity's lukewarm support of Hanspur suggests either that she did not intend for the Water Rat to ascend or that she is not entirely pleased with Hanspur's subsequent actions and attitudes.",
			"",
			"Hanspur's mortal identity is a matter of contention among his priests, with different sects of his faithful claiming he was born to their people. Most notably, among Hanspur's Kellid followers, he is depicted as a legendary and ancient Kellid king whose death and attempted sacrifice signaled the fall of the Kellid people and the coming encroachment of southerners. Such followers of Hanspur believe that he ruled the region of the world now known as the River Kingdoms, and that by conquering the rivers in his name, they can reclaim their lost lands for themselves.",
			"",
			"Whatever his true origin, Hanspur and his faithful haunt the Sellen River as vengeful guardians, hunting down followers of Corosbel and protecting river travelers from hazards of the waterways."

The one exception is that Hei Feng can be moved to tears by flower arrangements, particularly if they incorporate white lotuses or mirrors. These remind him of his much-adored wife, Lady Jingxi, the Poet of Dawn and Dusk, who left him centuries ago. Hei Feng misses his wife greatly and often weeps over her when deep in his cups, but in truth he was a neglectful husband, and his drunken protestations of love are directed more toward an idealized image than the real lady.",

			"Horus is the god of the sky, the celestial falcon whose eyes are the sun and moon, whose speckled feathers are the stars, and whose wings are the sky. He is also a sun god, and in the form of Horakhty, or \"Horus of the Two Horizons,\" he is a deity of both the rising and setting suns. The posthumous son of {faith/Osiris} and {faith/Isis}, Horus faced off against the usurper {faith/Set}, and with his victory over the Lord of the Dark Desert, Horus became the rightful heir of Osiris. Horus took his father's place as king and ruled Osirion with his consort {faith/Hathor} during the Age of Anguish, becoming also a god of kings and pharaonic rule.",
			"",
			"Horus appears as a man with the head of a falcon wearing the traditional double crown of pharaohs called the pschent. He is also sometimes represented as a great celestial falcon. His symbol, the eye of Horus, is used to ward off evil, and the symbol commonly appears on protective amulets and trinkets. As a sun deity and god of kings, Horus lends his support to {faith/Ra}, and aids him in his continuous battles against {faith/Apep}. An ally of Osiris and Isis, Horus is a steadfast enemy of Set, and the two have fought countless battles over the ages.",
			"",
			"Horus is worshiped by kings and pharaohs, as well as by hunters, paladins, rangers, and warriors. He is sometimes venerated as part of a triad with Osiris and Isis, or as one-half of a royal couple with his consort Hathor, but there are temples dedicated solely to Horus as well. Though rare in this age, Horus' clergy gets along well with the faithful of {faith/Abadar}, as both churches value leadership and law. Temples to Horus are still found in the larger cities of Osirion."

			"Many of the first myth-speaking prophecies demanded daring acts of beast slaying, pitting would-be hero-gods against the likes of hydras, minotaurs, and wyverns. As these godlings increasingly sought out Iblydan monsters, the harpy Ekriathae sought some means of defending her inhuman kin. Using her songs, she wooed a trio of cyclopes from their acropolis and coaxed them into granting her a prophecy of her own. Upon fulfilling its terms and attaining mythic power, she became a force of vengeance, tracking and slaying those who purposefully hunted monsters. She perished of old age in -422 AR, surrounded by followers from dozens of species whom she entreated to consume her body that she might be reborn again in a time of need.",
			"",
			"Since then, the mysterious cult of Ekrian Revival has revered Ekriathae's deceased spirit, always watching for signs of her return. Six different monsters over the ages have received the cult's endorsement as her reincarnated successors, each born with mythic potential far exceeding their mortal form. The monsters of Iblydos rejoiced in 4702 when the bestial infant Iapholi received the cult's blessing.",
			"",
			"Raised almost entirely in Dhuraxilis, the young Iapholi (female half-fiend human oracle 4/hierophant 9) has embraced a philosophy of exalting and empowering monstrous creatures that matches the city-state's cosmopolitan ideals. As a result, the archipelago boasts a growing number of piously pensive and proud magical beasts less eager to provoke their humanoid neighbors. However, a strong contingent of traditionalist monsters chafes under the outwardly pacifist doctrine and urges Iapholi to drown the Iblydan city-states, which they see as invaders, in a wave of bloodshed once and for all. Numerous factions have sent assassins to snuff out Iapholi, hoping to either prevent a monstrous demigod from unifying the many beasts or use her death to rally a terrifying army.",

Whether these statues are in fact the Eldest's bodies or simply monuments in which their consciousness resides remains an enigma, as does the question of whether the Twins are siblings sharing some sort of hive mind or a single creature split into two bodies. Regardless, for as long as the Twins have stood, they have never been seen to move or change expression. To most observers, the only signs of their sentience are the booming telepathic commands capable of shattering minds or elevating them, as well as the strange, addictive dreams that leak out into the area around the statues, sometimes taking on physical substance. Though Imbrex has remained silent on the subject, many First World residents - including other Eldest - believe that when the Statue Lords finally deign to walk, it will be to bring about the end of both the First World and the Material Plane, unmaking them both in order to usher in the next phase of creation.",
			"",
			"Despite the teeming city of Anophaeus at the statues' feet, Imbrex appears to care little for their worshipers, often rewarding or punishing seemingly random actions with equally mysterious magical effects. On those occasions when invaders or revolutionaries have sought to take the city, the statues have alternated between doing nothing and savaging the attackers with reality-altering dreams or bursts of psychic energy. Many seek or claim to interpret the dreams of the Twins, yet even those few adherents consistently granted magical boons are rarely given tasks outright, and Imbrex seems content to let their disciples pursue their own ends. Of the other Eldest, Imbrex confers most frequently with {faith/Ragadahn} and {faith/Magdh}, as their attention to prophecy and lost cultures ties in well with the Statue Lords' only apparent interest: the endings of things both great and small. If there's any truth to the rumor that Imbrex once wore a different shape and was trapped in its current motionless form by another Eldest or an outside god, the Twins either do not seek vengeance, or else already took it long ago."

			"While most commonly associated with mass deaths, Imot was born from mortal guilt and the desire for hindsight in the wake of tragedy. Rather than cause loss of life directly, their machinations precede large disasters, though as the penultimate usher of order, they also arrange for disasters when mortal cultures are too slow in dying. A compulsion buried deep within Imot compels them to hide clues to every disaster in the natural world before the event transpires, wrapped in confounding symbolism and boggling equations. These vague hints and hidden meanings inspire anxiety in most mortal minds. To those unaware of the true nature of these premonitions, this takes the form of subconscious unease; to those aware of the usher's omens, these clues provide a means of averting disaster that is often found far too late. Because of this, Imot is also the usher of dread, paranoia, self-blame for unavoidable disasters, and the omnipresent fear of personal failing.",
			"",
			"Imot's nature makes them the natural patron of mathematicians - especially those who press the boundaries of mortal understanding - and the bearer of souls that perished due to seemingly inevitable ends or that died en masse. People plagued with uneasy premonitions, be they true glimpses of impending tragedy or simply figments of the mind, are sometimes drawn toward the worship of Imot. Prophets who seek accurate omens in an age of lost prophecy are drawn to Imot's complex and hidden portents, seeking to painstakingly unravel the usher's hidden clues to look into the future. The Symbol of Doom's own predictions aren't divine in nature, however, and are simply the result of their own infinitely complex calculations.",
			"",
			"Imot manifests as a golden, four-sided pyramid with a wing sprouting from each of their facets. They have great difficulty expressing themselves verbally and instead conjure images and symbols to communicate. Those who serve the Symbol of Doom for many years eventually learn this unique language, but mortal parishioners and young psychopomps find this unique communication frustrating. Because even fellow ushers find Imot challenging, Imot rarely leaves their domain in the Tetravia, a mass of crossroads and towers situated between the Eight Courts, from which the Symbol of Doom observes the mortal world and Outer Planes, ever in search of new patterns and secrets."

			"At just over 900 years old, Iomedae is the youngest of the major deities of Golarion, and has only begun to reach her full potential as an independent deity in the last century. She is a righteous knight, fearless in fighting for her beliefs, and a missionary and crusader on behalf of the benign sovereignty of good and merciful justice for evil. She would rather convince evildoers to lay down their arms in honorable surrender than cut them down, but she will wield her mighty sword against those who persist in serving evil. She loathes incorrigible evil, fiend-spawn, traitors, and those who abuse good in the name of \"greater\" good. Now out from under the shadow of her patron, the slain human culture deity {faith/Aroden}, she has proven she needs no mentor to guide her - she is valor, glory, honor, justice, and strength, and is unafraid to point her sword at the greatest evils facing the world.",
			"",
			"Despite her youth and comparative late start, she has been instrumental in fighting evil in the world, even during her mortal lifetime as a paladin of {monster/Arazni} (and, after that demigod's death, Aroden himself). Born a mortal in Cheliax, she led the Knights of Ozem in a series of victories over the Whispering Tyrant, and participated in his imprisonment. Success in the Test of the Starstone a short time later granted the valiant swordswoman a spark of divinity and brought her to the attention of Aroden, who elevated her to the position of his herald, vacated by the fallen Arazni. When the Last Azlanti died, Iomedae inherited most of his remaining followers. Though born in Cheliax, she is worshiped by many people outside that land, and most recently has taken up patronage of the Mendevian Crusades. Once the crusaders have succeeded in ending the expanding threat of the Worldwound, she plans to inspire them to wipe her homeland free of its diabolical taint.",

			"Iomedae's avatar appears as a fierce Chelish swordswoman, resplendent in gleaming battle armor with heraldic markings, and brandishing a longsword and shield. When she is roused to battle, her white cloak turns red and her white-and-gold armor turns the silver-gray of {eq-material/adamantine}. The light from her shield blinds all evil, the force of her aura causing the corrupt to weaken and collapse.",

At your discretion, each card can absorb a single damage die from either a {ability/sneak attack} or a critical hit that would normally hit you. For example, if you would be hit by a sneak attack dealing an extra 3d6 points of damage and you had two cards remaining, you could reduce the sneak attack damage to 1d6 (these dice are removed before being rolled). Once a card absorbs a damage die, it disappears. Unused cards disappear at the end of each day.",

			"Irori was once a mortal man whose intense discipline allowed him to attain enlightenment and divinity through physical, mental, and spiritual perfection. He teaches that mastery of the self allows one to master the world, but paradoxically also purges one of desire to master the world. Countless others seek to follow his path, and he encourages them to challenge their minds, bodies, and souls in order to transcend their self-imposed limits. He is also a god of knowledge; his followers are keen students of history, for experience is key to understanding and there is much to be learned from the experiences of others.",
			"",
			"Irori knows that there's no single technique that works for everyone, and that every student must experiment and practice to find the best method for her. He is patient, forgiving, and serene, welcoming all who seek perfection as brothers and sisters. He is a teacher who leads by example rather than issuing reprimands and corrections. Meanwhile, he constantly tests his own limits as a deity, expanding his awareness and control without impinging upon the interests of others. Originating from distant Vudra, Irori has gained a diverse following across the Inner Sea region as those who seek discipline and self-perfection look to him for inspiration.",
			"",
			"Irori's followers rarely depict him in art because they believe that no icon can hope to live up to his perfect image. They describe him in poetry and prose as a flawless man, clothed in simple robes and wooden sandals, hairless save for a long braid. Beyond the Inner Sea region, his race often changes to reflect that of the artist; artists of the Inner Sea tend to depict him in ways that emphasize his exoticism. Irori sees no need to cloak himself in mystery or augment himself with divine power, so on the rare occasions when he manifests to mortals, he appears as a physically fit man matching his followers' descriptions, often sitting, kneeling patiently, or resting in a meditative pose. He's also been known to project a portion of his awareness into a statue, animating its face and speaking through it.",

			"Jaidi is an ancient god, even for Azlant. At the height of the empire, Azlanti archaeologists uncovered ancient shrines filled with crude carvings of the sun and crook dating back thousands of years. Jaidi taught the Azlanti to develop farming and agriculture sufficient to sustain millions of citizens. Jaidi represents the satisfaction one feels when providing for a community. Those who dedicate themselves to the faith of Jaidi enjoy hard work and find pleasure in contributing their sweat and toil to help others in their communities. People in ancient Azlant prayed to Jaidi for strength and endurance. Traders and residents of agricultural settlements made up a large proportion of Jaidi's faithful. Cooks throughout the Azlanti empire often maintained small shrines to Jaidi in their kitchens.",
			"",
			"It is said that some of the survivors of Earthfall who spread into the world brought techniques they learned from their faith to try to help restore the land. Due to the aftereffects of Earthfall, they saw only limited success, but their dedication to hard work on behalf of the community gave the survivors the strength they needed to survive in the early years of the Age of Darkness. Some dedicated to agriculture for the sake of serving a community still worship Jaidi to this day, though most such are found in small, isolated communities scattered on other continents in Golarion.",
			"",
			"Jaidi didn't get along with {faith/Lissala} and felt that she placed too much emphasis on the negative aspects of hard work. Jaidi taught that people should be proud of their work rather than treat it as toil born of obligation or greed."
