You become mostly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid, granting you a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.

When you do so, the creature struck must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 2 points of Charisma drain. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma in this way is permanently transformed into a hideously deformed aquatic version of itself; it gains the mutant template, the aquatic subtype, and the amphibious quality, and its alignment becomes chaotic evil. When this transformation occurs, all Charisma damage the creature has suffered is instantly cured. Such mutants are initially friendly toward you. This transformation is a curse effect.",

In your hybrid form, you are immune to damage from water pressure, gain the ability to breathe water, and gain a swim speed equal to twice your base speed. Your head becomes that of a viperfish, granting you a bite attack that deals damage as for a creature two size categories larger than you (2d6 for a Medium creature). In addition, a single long tentacle sprouts from your body, granting you a tentacle secondary natural attack that deals damage as for a creature of your size category (1d4 for a Medium creature). This tentacle has the grab and constrict abilities; the constrict damage is equal to your tentacle damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. While grappling a creature with your tentacle, you are not considered grappled and do not take any of the penalties associated with that condition.

Once per day as a standard action, you can create an effect similar to overwhelming presence as though you were a cleric with an effective caster level equal to half your Hit Dice. Creatures that fail their saving throws are staggered instead of helpless for the duration of the spell, and suffer no further effects upon a successful subsequent save.

Anytime you have created an image via mirror image, as a swift action you can direct one of your images to move to a flanking position against an enemy within 15 feet of you. The image allows you or an ally to flank your target for the purpose of a single attack. A redirected image dissipates when you or an ally uses the image to make a flanking attack, or otherwise remains in place for 1 round before dissipating.",

Once per day as a standard action, you can gain the benefits of a mislead spell as though cast by a wizard of a level equal to your Hit Dice (maximum 20th level), with the following modifications. At the time of using this ability, you can establish a number of rounds before it will expire, or declare that it will expire when your illusory duplicate is touched.

You gain a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage for Medium creatures or 1d4 points of piercing damage for Small creatures, with a critical multiplier of &times;3. Every time you hit with your bite attack, you deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (choose from acid, cold, electricity, or fire).",

You have made an art of using Doloras's unholy power to inure creatures against the weaknesses emotions cause. Once per day, you can cast {spell/sequester} as a spell-like ability.",
			">3. **Leave This Petty Existence (Sp)** Like Our Lady in Pain, you know that the emotions and love of others, especially family members, are foolish distractions that only make you vulnerable to your enemies. Thus, you have become adept at transcending your pathetic feelings and can briefly enter new states of existence along with anyone smart enough to ally with you.

Once per day, when one or more creatures within 60 feet of you is under an emotion or mind-affecting effect, as a standard action you can speak a profane prayer to Our Lady in Pain. When you do, the creature or creatures must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be paralyzed for 1 round and then staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. A successful saving throw negates this effect. When this ability targets multiple creatures, you can choose to exclude one or more of them. Once a creature has been targeted by this ability (whether or not it succeeded at its saving throw), that creature cannot again be the target of power over passion for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.",
			">3. **Emotionless Void (Sp)** Adherence to the ways of Our Lady in Pain has taught you how to siphon desires, dreams, fears, and hopes out of your enemies, until the void of dispassion steals the very breath from their lungs. Once per day, you can cast {spell/mass suffocation} as a spell-like ability.",

Three times per day, you can cast {spell/harm} as a spell-like ability.",
			">3. **Hell's Sadistic Angel (Sp)** Doloras is well versed in ways to cause unholy pain to even the strongest and most resourceful souls, and you have painstakingly studied her torturer's techniques. Once per day as a standard action, you can call down your evil goddess's dispassionate, unholy might upon all enemies in a 30-foot radius centered anywhere within 100 feet of you. When you do, otherworldly chains forged in the infernal morass of Hell itself latch on to your enemies' feet, rooting them in place for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Affected creatures cannot damage the hellish chains nor magically escape them; if they attempt to use teleportation magic or a similar ability to circumvent the chains, the spell or ability fails and is wasted. While they are rooted, affected creatures take 2d6 points of piercing damage and 4d6 points of fire damage per round as blazing, hellish needles stab into the exposed portions of their bodies (affected creatures begin taking damage as soon as they are under this ability's effects). A creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw is only held in place for half the number of rounds and takes the listed damage only once."

If a worshiper of Erastil fires one of these greater slaying arrows and misses, the arrow vanishes and a slaying arrow of the same type appears in the gifted character's quiver.

The double acts and thinks like your animal companion in every way, and obeys your commands just as the original would. Your original animal companion and its double understand and trust each other perfectly. The double remains for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess, and then vanishes.

Such commands will not only earn refusal and scorn from the hound archons, but could cause them to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.",

Once per day, you can use {spell/heroes' feast} as a spell-like ability. Creatures that eat from this communal table, a process that takes 1 hour, gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and Will saving throws instead of the usual +1 morale bonus. Whenever you cast this spell, choose one teamwork feat; you may select a new feat every time you cast this spell, but once it's cast, your selection can't be changed. Anyone who eats from the communal table gains the benefits of the chosen teamwork feat. The benefits of the heroes' feast, including the bonus teamwork feat, last for 12 hours.

This bonus improves the normal armor bonus granted by the armor; in other words, it stacks with the suit's normal armor bonus. You also mystically subsume some of the qualities of the animal that gave its life for the armor. Gain the scent ability with a range of 30 feet while wearing armor made from leather or animal hide.",
			">3. **Farmer's Bond (Su)** Your time spent cultivating crops has given you a bond with plants. You can cast speak with plants 3 times per day. If you spend at least 1 hour during the day in direct sunlight, you don't need to eat that day.

This increases your base speed by 30 feet. Additionally, you can use your coils to form a cage for your enemies. When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the [swallow whole universal monster ability](umr/swallow_whole). Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free. Activating three-headed serpent is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",

As a standard action, you can cause runes to appear on an adjacent, unattended corpse, which you can read to attempt to gain insight into the deceased or its soul. If the creature has been dead for a year or less, you can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check with a DC equal to the DC for a monster lore check about the creature when it was alive. If successful, you learn information as if you had used the appropriate Knowledge skill to learn about the creature when it was living. If the creature has been dead for more than a year, you have a 75% chance of learning what plane its soul was sent to by Pharasma and a 25% chance of learning nothing. If the soul has not yet been judged, has somehow escaped judgment, or has been reincarnated, you receive nothing (which is indistinguishable from the 25% of the time this ability fails). The results of multiple attempts to learn about the same corpse within a year are always the same.",

This functions as if you had used the {feat/Turn Undead} feat (though you do not need to have the channel energy ability or expend uses of channel energy to do this), and the save DC is 10 + half your character level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).",

The target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [whichever is highest]). If it fails its save, you show it a mental image of its destined plane in the afterlife, depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its ethos, if it succeeds at finishing its mortal business. If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is evil-aligned, it is staggered for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.",

This works like the witch's forced reincarnation hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with reincarnate, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a wish or miracle spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect.

Fortunately, the goddess teaches that the truly devout who are martyred saving other people from death or tyranny will rise again in some way - perhaps even immediately, though being reborn in the faith is much more likely.",
			">- Some priests claim to be the incarnations of past followers of the goddess, able to access memories of past lives with the proper magic and meditation. A follower born after Milani ascended to godhood (about a century ago) can attempt to search for his past lives' memories by casting legend lore, which Milani grants only for this purpose to clerics, inquisitors, and warpriests as a 4th-level divine spell. The first time a caster attempts this use of the spell, he rolls 1d4-1 to determine the number of specific followers of Milani whose memories he accesses; each time he uses the spell, it reveals only information known to those individuals. If the result of the roll is 0, the caster can access no memories, either because he is not a reincarnated follower of Milani or because the goddess has not made his past lives' memories available."

For a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, Malebolge's flames aid you and up to four allies within 30 feet of you. The flames encase affected creature's bodies, providing a +4 profane bonus to AC and immunity to fire. Anyone who strikes you or an affected ally with a melee attack takes 2d6 points of fire damage on each hit. Additionally, affected allies' melee, ranged, and natural weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage while this ability is in effect.

Twice per day as a standard action, you can invoke the names of the Lord of the Sixth. All enemies that can hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, the affected creatures are merely shaken, but they also take a -4 penalty to their AC for the duration.
