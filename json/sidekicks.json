			"A drake can be a powerful ally to one who understands how to deal with its surly and obstinate attitude. Such a character is called the drake's \"charge\" as drakes refuse to refer to another being as their master. While drake companions enjoy accumulating hoards of shiny treasure, they adamantly refuse to wear barding, armor, or clothing items of any kind (belts, boots, and so on); they can wear magical jewelry such as amulets or rings but will agree to wear only one such item. Drake companions are not animal companions and don't count as animal companions for any purpose, including Handle Animal checks and tricks. Additionally, they are fairly lazy, and successful Diplomacy or Intimidate checks are needed to convince them to fatigue themselves or take major risks to their lives. Without the mount drake power, a drake companion actively refuses to suffer a rider and fights a rider it has not agreed to every step of the way, even if that rider is its charge. Drake companions are extreme oddities among drakes and irreplaceable to their charges, as it takes years to win a drake's trust. As such, should a drake companion die, her charge doesn't gain a replacement drake companion and must restore the companion from the dead. At the GM's discretion, a charge who lost his drake might be able to bond with a new drake after going on a quest to find another special drake and spending several years bonding with the new drake.",

Such communication is limited by the Intelligence of the conversing creatures.",

This communication is a free action that can be performed even when it isn't the spiritualist's turn, but the spiritualist and the phantom must both be conscious to communicate in this way. This allows the spiritualist to give orders to her phantom at any time. Magic items interfere with a spiritualist's connection to her phantom; as a result, the spiritualist and her phantom share magic item slots. For example, if the spiritualist is wearing a magic ring, her phantom can wear only one magic ring. In the case of a conflict, the items worn by the spiritualist remain active, and those worn by the phantom become dormant. The phantom must possess the appropriate appendages to utilize a magic item.",

			">*Share Spells (Su):* The spiritualist can cast a spell with a target of \"you\" on her phantom (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A spiritualist can cast spells from the spiritualist spell list on her phantom even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the phantom's type (outsider). This ability does not allow the phantom to share abilities that aren't spells, even if they function like spells.",
			">",
			">*Deliver Touch Spells (Su):* The phantom can deliver touch spells for the spiritualist when fully manifested in incorporeal or ectoplasmic form. The spiritualist and the phantom need not be in contact to accomplish this, but the phantom must be within 30 feet and the spiritualist must be able to see the phantom. If the spiritualist is 12th level or higher, the phantom can deliver touch spells within 50 feet of the spiritualist. The spiritualist can cast the spell, and then the phantom can deliver the touch as an immediate action. If the touch spell deals damage, the phantom must make the attack roll. The phantom can't hold the charge of a touch spell cast by the spiritualist using this ability. If the spell is delivered to the phantom, it must touch a target or the spell is lost. If the spell allows you to touch up to six willing targets, the phantom can accomplish this with an immediate action, but all of the willing targets must be within the phantom's melee reach at the time.",
			">",
			">*Magic Attacks (Su):* When the phantom manifests in ectoplasmic form, it treats its slam attacks as if they were magic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If the spiritualist is 10th level or higher, all of the phantom's weapons are treated as the alignment of the phantom for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",

			"",
			"### Phantom Skills",
			"",
			"The following skills are class skills for the phantom: Bluff (Cha), Craft (Int), Fly (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (planes) (Int), Perception (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Stealth (Dex). In addition, at 1st level, the spiritualist can choose one additional skill as a class skill for her phantom. The phantom also gains two class skills based on its *emotional focus*. The phantom automatically gains bonus ranks in these two skills as the spiritualist increases in level-its number of ranks in these skills is always equal to its number of Hit Dice.",
			"",
			"### Full Manifestation Forms",
			"",
			"Each time she fully manifests her phantom, the spiritualist must choose whether to manifest the phantom in either ectoplasmic or incorporeal form. The phantom gains the statistics presented above, modified by the phantom's emotional focus and by the type of manifestation the spiritualist chooses.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic:** When the spiritualist manifests her phantom in ectoplasmic form, the phantom gains the following abilities.",
			"",
			">*Damage Reduction:* A phantom manifested in ectoplasmic form has DR 5/slashing. When the spiritualist reaches 5th level, the phantom gains DR 5/magic. At 10th level, the damage resistance increases to 10/magic. At 15th level, it increases to 15/magic, and at 20th level, the damage reduction becomes DR 15/-.",
			">",
			">*Phase Lurch (Su):* A phantom in ectoplasmic form has the ability to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, it must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. An ectoplasmic phantom can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Incorporeal:** When the spiritualist chooses to manifest the phantom in incorporeal form, the phantom appears within 30 feet of the spiritualist as a ghostly apparition. It gains the incorporeal subtype, including a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier. Since it isn't an undead creature, it takes no damage from holy water or positive energy. Unlike other incorporeal creatures, an incorporeal phantom can't attack corporeal creatures, except to deliver touch-attack spells using the *deliver touch spell* ability. An incorporeal manifested phantom can make slam attacks against other incorporeal creatures as if it were in ectoplasmic form."
