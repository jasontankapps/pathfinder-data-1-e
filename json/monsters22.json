A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's historical record are more often than not sightings of the same creature."

This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Detect Alignment (Sp)** At will, a sin seeker can use detect chaos, detect evil, detect good, or detect law. Only one of these can be active at any given time.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Believed to have been bred centuries ago by zealous priests and inquisitors, sin seekers are living creatures with a supernatural ability to detect the scent of varying degrees of morality. Originally small forest swine known for their acute senses of smell, these unfortunate creatures were subjected to a magical mutation similar in practice to fleshwarping. The priests' goal was to use these new creations to sniff out the supporters of rival faiths, identifying them by their hidden sins.",
			"",
			"In the centuries following their initial creation, various sects throughout Golarion maintained small sin seeker breeding programs. Many of these were aimed at culling impious members from the ranks of the clergy, though many evil sects used sin seekers as torture and interrogation aids. Today, small populations of sin seekers still survive in monasteries throughout Golarion, and adventurers of all alignments continue to keep them as familiars. Sin seekers are usually about 12 to 18 inches long, with a 2-foot wingspan. They weigh between 3 and 5 pounds.",
			"",
			"Centuries of selective breeding have improved the sin seekers' magical abilities, granting them the ability to sense other creatures' motives and alignments. They are capable of instantly sensing whether a creature is good or evil, and they also have a knack for tracking creatures by their auras. Once in close contact with a creature, sin seekers have a host of tools for discerning whether that creature is lying or manipulating information. In addition to the aura of honesty that surrounds them, each seeker has a small arsenal of spell-like abilities that help it glean the truth from weak-willed creatures.",
			"",
			"Though graced with an above-average intelligence, sin seekers are poor at handling logistics and practicalities. They make excellent judges of character, and easily pick up on subtle social cues that could indicate dishonesty. While sin seekers are able to draw distinctions between various motives, they have no inherent alignment, and don't place moral judgments on the information they gather. Like bloodhounds sniffing for a trail, sin seekers happily delve for information without regard for what it means. This moral ambivalence makes them equally useful for benevolent or malicious purposes.",
			"",
			"Sin seekers lack any natural instincts and rely entirely on reciprocal relationships with larger creatures for protection and sustenance. Sin seekers are omnivores who can survive on almost any kind of food, though they are healthiest when fed a vegetable-heavy diet. They can eat anything, but they're poor at regulating their own nutrition - if left to their own devices, sin seekers gorge themselves to the point of nausea, especially when offered rich, fatty foods. While they acclimate quickly to new cultures and eating habits, they are susceptible to unfamiliar diseases and poisons.",
			"",
			"Though sin seekers can be found throughout Golarion, they are best suited for the moderate climates of the Inner Sea region, northern Casmaron, and coastal Tian Xia. While their small frames are well padded by a layer of fat, they are mostly hairless and lack sufficient body mass to survive frigid temperatures for long. They fare no better in extreme heat, as they easily become dehydrated and are vulnerable to sunburn. Luckily, their susceptibility to the elements is counterbalanced by their suitability for indoor living. Despite their porcine aspect, they live cleanly, and can easily be trained to use lavatories. They have an inherent respect for personal space and are happiest when provided with a small nesting area to call their own. Sin seekers are quiet living companions, except during mating season, during which time they utter grotesque, mewling cries. In all, sin seekers are finicky creatures who require more upkeep than most animals, though their unique skill set makes them worth the extra effort.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sin seekers are wholly domestic creatures incapable of surviving long in the wild. Like any domestic animal, sin seekers are acclimated to humanoid contact, and integrate well into humanoid cultures. Though slightly repulsive in appearance, they are affectionate creatures with good social skills. Unfortunately, their inability to properly defend themselves and inability to regulate their eating make them high-maintenance travel companions, especially when contrasted with self-sufficient familiars like cats, monkeys, and rodents. Sin seekers are easy prey, and their sightlessness makes them especially vulnerable to quick predators such as hawks, wolves, and foxes. Sin seeker familiars require constant guardianship and physical protection.",
			"",
			"The difficulty of keeping such delicate creatures alive and healthy has often proven worth the trouble for religious sects throughout Golarion. While each sect breeds its sin seekers with different magical abilities, they all use the creatures as lie detectors and moral litmus tests. Clergy from good-aligned sects, like those that worship Iomedae or Sarenrae, often use sin seekers as penitential aids. These sects see sin seekers as living reminders of the priests' shortcomings and often use them to witness ritual oaths. Evil sects, like those that worship Norgorber or Asmodeus, often use sin seekers as interrogation and inquisitional instruments. Such sects combine the use of sin seekers with traditional torture techniques to persecute nonbelievers or to weed out seditious forces within their ranks.",
			"",
			"Once trained, sin seekers make excellent familiars, and form strong bonds with their keepers. They are both affectionate and loyal, and quickly adopt their keepers' personalities. Their high intelligence and lie-detecting abilities make them favored familiars of detectives, interrogators, and negotiators. Sin seekers' ability to track creatures by following their auras make them popular among rangers, paladins, and inquisitors who specialize in tracking evil creatures. Unfortunately, while sin seekers are incredibly useful, their auras of honesty and repulsive appearances can sometimes be a hindrance to adventuring parties. Charismatic rogues and bards find the creatures both off-putting and inconvenient. Any character of 5th level or higher with the Improved Familiar feat may take a sin seeker as a familiar.",
			"",
			"### Variant Sin Seekers",
			"",
			"While the description above represents the most common variant of sin seekers, some sects breed the creatures with abilities that more closely align with their religious aims. Sin seekers from good-aligned temples often have the ability to cast protection from evil instead of confess. Congregations that revile the undead sometimes breed their seekers to cast detect undead instead of zone of truth, or speak with dead instead of comprehend languages. Evil sects, meanwhile, sometimes breed into their sin seekers the ability to cast interrogation instead of seek thoughts, or touch of idiocy instead of comprehend languages."

			"**Greedspawn (+2 Dex, -2 Wis):** Towering over 7 feet in height, greedspawn have gold-tinged veins and often become rogues.",
			"",
			"**Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis):** With perfectly formed bodies sitting in grotesque counterpoint to their monstrous faces and claws, lustspawn often become sorcerers.",
			"",
			"**Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha):** Unique among sinspawn for their long manes of hair, pridespawn are near-skeletal in their gauntness. They often become wizards.",

			"",
			"{SOURCE Pathfinder #134: It Came from Hollow Mountain/246}  ",
			"Each runelord experimented with sinspawn, imbuing the sinspawn with the runelord's signature sin and developing other variants. Particularly cunning sinspawn often practice martial talents, advancing as {class/barbarian/s}, {class/fighter/s}, or {class/rogue/s}. As adaptable as humanoids, sinspawn with the proper training or tutelage (perhaps originating from ancient Thassilonian texts or meditation upon the arcane energies of a runewell) might advance in any class, although sinspawn {class/bard/s}, {class/druid/s}, and {class/hunter/s} are practically unheard of. The following list incorporates and expands upon the variant sinspawn above.",
			"",
			"**Aerial Sinspawn (+4 Dex, +2 Con, fly 60 ft. [good], CR +1):** Xanderghul, Runelord of Pride, believed his mighty sinspawn should soar above the heads of his enemies, though Earthfall cut short his experiments. Aerial pridespawn are therefore rare, lurking in the mountaintop ruins of Cyrusian, but are still far more common than aerial variants of other types of sinspawn.",
			"",
			"**Aquatic Sinspawn (swim 30 ft., aquatic subtype):** Not to be outdone on any battlefield, Runelord Alaznist developed wrathspawn with gills and webbed hands and feet to serve as marines. Belimarius and Sorshen followed suit, breeding aquatic envyspawn and lustspawn respectively to guard their domains' watery borders. Other types of aquatic sinspawn are rare.",
			"",
			"**Envyspawn (+2 Str, -2 Cha):** Short and slight, envyspawn are compelled to hunt and spy upon their enemies. They obsess over comparing their enemies' possessions and prowess to their own. Envyspawn often become {class/ranger/s} or {class/slayer/s}.",
			"",
			"**Fleshdregs:** Products of malfunctioning runewells, botched rituals, and the like, {monster/fleshdreg/s} are squat, half-formed sinspawn, little more than a mouth on legs. Nevertheless, their sinful bites can mangle the bodies and minds of their enemies, and sinspawn treat fleshdregs as guard animals or pets. Faulty runewells may even spit out wads of hungry flesh known as [fleshdreg swarms](monster/fleshdreg_swarm).",
			"",
			"**Gluttonspawn (+2 Con, -2 Dex):** Hardy despite their obesity, gluttonspawn often become {class/fighter/s}. A few rare individuals become {class/alchemist/s}, gorging themselves on the mutagens they concoct.",
			"",
			"**Greedspawn (+2 Dex -2 Wis): Standing 7 feet high with glittering, gold-tinted veins, greedspawn usually become {class/rogue/s}, but some focus their avarice into objects they hoard and become {class/occultist/s}.",
			"",
			"**Lustspawn (+4 Cha, -2 Con, -2 Wis):** These sinspawn sport perfectly formed male and female bodies that stand in odd contrast to their horrific faces, claws, and legs. Unlike their pallid kin, lustspawn often have brightly colored hides. Capable of intercourse but not procreation, lustspawn indulge themselves at every opportunity. Many lustspawn become {class/sorcerer/s} or {class/mesmerist/s}, though sinspawn [enchanters](class/wizard) and [witches](class/witch) are not unknown.",
			"",
			"**Pridespawn (+4 Int, -2 Wis, -2 Cha):** The near-skeletal pridespawn are proud of their thick manes of hair, which they alone of any sinspawn can grow. They often become [Wizards](class/wizard), although pridespawn [magi](class/magus) and {class/psychic/s} are not unknown.",
			"",
			"**Slothspawn (+2 Wis, -2 Dex):** Slothspawn appear weighed down by cloaks of excess skin, yet they scuttle about on shrunken legs with alarming speed. They often become {class/cleric/s} or {class/warpriest/s}, venerating {faith/Lamashtu}, {faith/Rovagug}, or whichever locally popular demon lord demands the least effort. Slothspawn [conjurers](class/wizard) and [Summoners](class/wizard) prefer to let their summoned creatures labor on their behalf.",
			"",
			"**Wrathspawn:** The original creations of Alaznist, the bloodthirsty wrathspawn are the most common variety of sinspawn. Many become {class/barbarian/s}, {class/brawler/s}, or {class/fighter/s}. Exceptional wrathspawn tap into the essence of sin inside them and become {class/bloodrager/s} instead."

			"",

			"Formed from the fabric of the Ethereal Plane, sishkansets are incorporeal reflections of mortal psyches. Born of the disorientation and despair of souls whose mortal vessels died isolated and buffeted by wilderness winds, sishkansets haunt sparsely settled frontiers. They wield the same winds that tormented their progenitors in their final moments; a sishkanset's presence disrupts the atmosphere for miles around, and though the natural winds they stoke are not inherently dangerous, they are maddeningly constant.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets sift through mortal thoughts in the hope of reassembling their own fragmented personalities, but their fundamentally incomplete nature makes this an unattainable goal. When a sishkanset's suffering becomes overwhelming, it visits its condition on others, slowly driving its victims insane through unending wind and discordant whispers.",
			"",

			"",
			"A sishkanset is about 8 feet tall and unnaturally thin.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets' progenitors are those who perish in the wilderness, lost and utterly alone with only endless, mocking winds to usher their spirits from their bodies. Such souls carry enough despair that their passage through the Ethereal Plane leaves a psychic impression. Powerful negative emotions whip the plane's mutable substance into a roiling frenzy that eventually coalesces into a sishkanset. The creature maintains only a fraction of the mortal being's personality, culled from its last moments of disorientation, isolation, and desperate search for comfort and safety. The creature finds itself inexorably drawn to the Material Plane, where it seeks what its progenitor could not find in life.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets most often dwell in sparsely populated frontier areas, border towns, and isolated homesteads. They are drawn toward landmarks that could have guided their progenitors to safety, twining their unnaturally tall frames around flagpoles, steeples, weather vanes, and other high places that allow an unfettered view of their surroundings. From such heights, they reach along the unnatural air currents they produce to sieve the minds of passersby.",
			"",
			"A sishkanset clutches the emotions it pulls from these studied thoughts, hoping to fill the gaps in its persona, but its fundamentally fragmented nature means it will never achieve this goal. Over time, these tantalizing glimpses of mortal life drive the creature to frustrated despair. It relieves this torment by visiting its condition on others, wrapping its victims in winds that carry its anguished ramblings. Driving an individual to insanity soothes the sishkanset for a time, but its sense of fulfillment eventually fades.",
			"",
			"Sishkansets fly against their assailants when aggressively confronted, wreathing themselves in restless currents and disrupting their opponents' minds with mental assaults and disorienting blasts of icy wind. Sishkansets that are banished rather than physically destroyed develop a focused hatred of their banishers. Sishkansets lack any inherent means of traversing planar boundaries, but they wait, howling their wrath into the void, until an unwitting extradimensional traveler creates a means by which the sishkansets can return to the Material Plane and pursue their targets.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sishkansets are an infrequent menace and are often mistaken for incorporeal undead. They enter a keening frenzy in response to attempts to banish them with positive energy or similar means - such displays of faith are a reminder of mortal experiences forever lost.",
			"",
			"Though their minds are fractured and their trains of thought mercurial, sishkansets are reasonably intelligent. Their fruitless attempts to fulfill themselves with the thoughts of others means they know much about the communities they haunt. Sishkansets relieved by recently driving a victim insane can sometimes even be engaged in conversation. Their erratic desires often include requests for mortals to describe their lives and feelings. Individuals who are able to parse these demands from a sishkanset's ceaseless, whispering stream of consciousness and indulge the creature can sometimes ask for information in return, though they are wise to leave before the sishkanset fixates on them.",
			"",
			"Objects bearing strong emotional impressions intrigue sishkansets. They hover over the psychically charged items, rambling about the memento's past like an academy's lecturer. Eventually, however, the creatures' inability to interact with objects or incorporate the emotions they store rekindles their existential anguish."

Most evil siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the world's oceans.",
			"",
			"Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and flooded cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the creatures share about these areas - it is not lucky, say siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures have drowned.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Because of their mighty horns, cloven hooves, and aggressively territorial behavior, skaprauns are often mistaken for hellspawn or other minions of evil. Although these fey actually have a deep sense of honor, even those who know them for what they are generally view them with suspicion - their stubbornness and isolationist traditions leave little room for alliances or friendships with other creatures. Skaprauns stand 3-1/2 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Much like the animals that they resemble, skaprauns have beards, short tails, and long, curved horns. Their fur has a fine, woolly layer and a longer layer of hollow guard hairs, offering protection against wind and cold temperatures. Their feet have inner pads and sharp dewclaws to prevent slipping, and their cloven hooves can spread apart to ensure a better grip on uneven surfaces.",
			"",
			"Skaprauns are mainly herbivorous, but they supplement their diet with meat from animals they hunt and with clay to obtain minerals. They eat animals primarily for ritualistic purposes rather than out of necessity. Their main purposes for hunting are to maintain balanced animal populations within their territory, to obtain raw materials such as bone and sinew for building tools and weapons, and to hone their combat tactics.",
			"",
			"Although skaprauns have mortal lifespans averaging 18 years, they are in a sense immortal. The death of a skapraun triggers a form of reincarnation that occurs inside the body of the dead skapraun. The new skapraun leeches proteins and other nutrients from its precursor's body to build its own. When the newborn skapraun crawls out - a process that takes roughly 4 weeks - only a withered, fragile husk remains of the precursor's body. The horns of the precursor remain fully intact, however.",
			"",
			"A newborn skapraun is hairless, hornless, and nearly helpless, but it learns to walk within 5 minutes of its birth. The skapraun remembers nothing of its former life, but it instinctively knows to collect the horns of its precursor and protect them at all costs so it can later build a bow from them. A skapraun usually reaches full maturity within 2 months of its birth, but it may take longer if the precursor's body was badly damaged.",
			"",
			"A skapraun is not identical to the one from which it was born, but its psyche and physique are always shaped in some way by the decisions its precursor made - and particularly by how the precursor met its end.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Skaprauns make their homes in rocky, mountainous areas where their physique gives them a distinct advantage over less agile beings. They live almost exclusively above the treeline, where their enemies have less of a chance to find shelter from their arrows. However, the territory of a skapraun tribe extends far below the treeline; the creatures hunt and gather plants and other resources in these lower regions.",
			"",
			"To skaprauns, the concept of holding the higher ground is a central cultural aspect and a matter of great pride, and it also makes them fiercely territorial. They often do not allow any other intelligent beings to inhabit a higher location on the same mountain and do not tolerate intruders near their homes, even travelers who just passing through. However, skaprauns do not usually resort to violence unless stern warnings fail to remove the threat.",
			"",
			"While the inhospitable terrain skaprauns live in is enough to keep most intruders away, they take great care to fortify the slopes of their mountain homes against attacks. They build traps in natural choke points and prepare many defensive fighting positions from which they can shower any attacker with a rain of arrows. The defensive positions have rocks piled as low walls, camouflaged to look like naturally occurring piles of rubble. These are usually difficult to reach from below, but if the enemies are particularly mobile, the skapraun sentries retreat into another defensive position farther up the mountain rather than risking a melee that may go against them.",
			"",
			"When a tribe of skaprauns ends up in a prolonged conflict, the fey also employ offensive tactics that mostly involve quick hit-and-run attacks or feigned retreats in order to lead the enemy into an ambush. They also study weather patterns and use the treacherous mists of the mountains to their advantage, advancing when the mists rise and retreating when they recede.",
			"",
			"Skapraun chieftains are born from the deaths of heroic individuals. The chieftains often have unusual physical traits that marks their births, such as very large horns, snow-white fur, or a greater stature. Skapraun leaders often take class levels in barbarian, druid, hunter, oracle, ranger, or shaman.",
			"",
			"The birth of twins is considered a very auspicious sign in skapraun society. It is the only way in which a skapraun tribe can grow, and the twins are often uniquely gifted with oracular powers. Each inherits one of the precursor's horns and builds a spear instead of the usual recurve bow. These twin-oracles often speak in unison and seem to share a single mind. Any later generations born of the twin-oracles are usually normal skaprauns, however.",
			"",
			"On the bottom rung of skapraun society are arkas-outcasts who are allowed to perform only the most menial tasks within a tribe. A skapraun becomes an arka if it loses and cannot recover its weapon. Similarly, a skapraun who for some reason cannot extract its precursor's horns or make a weapon out of them is marked an arka. Rather than facing the shame of not being considered a warrior, it is common for an arka to go on a self-imposed exile. Over time, these lone skaprauns lose their supernatural connection to nature, including their ability to reincarnate. They may find themselves in the company of humanoid creatures, getting along best with dwarves, perhaps because of dwarves' similarly dour dispositions and love of mountains.",

			"For a long time, many experts believed the creature now known as the skeltercat existed only in the folklore of the Shoanti tribes or in the far-fetched tales of a few wild-eyed travelers. Only with the recent reopening of the Bloodsworn Vale have rumors of the skeltercat's existence been taken seriously. As traffic through the vale increases, reports of attacks by strange, shapeshifting cats are growing startlingly commonplace. Such tales are told most frequently in the fortress city of Skelt, a common stopover for merchants traveling through the Bloodsworn Vale. The stories out of Skelt gave these creatures their name.",
			"",
			"The skeltercat resembles a heavily muscled cougar or mountain lion, having a tawny coat, powerful paws with retractable claws, and strong hind legs that allow it to jump great distances. It primarily walks about on all fours, adopting an oddly hunched posture that distinguishes it from normal cats. When faced with a threat, a skeltercat rises onto its hind legs, walking upright in a disturbingly human fashion. An adult skeltercat stands just shy of 8 feet tall when fully upright, and weighs up to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many generations ago, a small band of Shoanti warriors lived high in the Mindspin Mountains near the headwaters of the Yondabakari River. This band, whose name is now long lost, were the first to feel the bite of Chelish steel as the southerners began their push into Varisia. These Shoanti fought back against the invaders as best they could, but they had no shaman in their group, and soon found they were no match for Chelish magic. Though they begged the clans of the lowlands to train them in such arts, they were repeatedly refused. No clan wanted to share its secrets with the notorious raiders of the mountain tribe, and none yet realized the threat the Chelish invasion would soon pose.",
			"",
			"As a desperate ploy, members of the mountain tribe stole down into the lowlands to spy on the druids and shamans of the other tribes, hoping to steal the secrets of the magic they had been denied. These spies observed a druid from the lowlands wildshaping herself into a mountain lion, and having listened carefully to the magic incantations she used, they returned to tell the tribe what they had found. Whether by chance or fate, the incantations worked, and soon the whole tribe had become fearsome cougars, just as the druid had. Only too late did they realize their spies had not learned how to reverse the transformation. Try as they might, they were able to become only partly human. Trapped somewhere between human and cat forms, the members of this reclusive mountain tribe were cursed to become the first skeltercats.",
			"",
			"Though created by a magical accident, skeltercats breed true, and a skeltercat that mates with a normal cougar invariably produces skeltercat offspring. Much like mountain lions, skeltercats are carnivores, though unlike mundane cats, they display a distinct preference for humanoid prey. Though skeltercats will attack any humanoid, they appear to prefer Chelish flesh to any other, perhaps due to some ancestral memory of the original skeltercats' conflicts with Chelish invaders. Skeltercats live slightly longer than normal cougars, having an average lifespan of 30 to 40 years.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although skeltercats live throughout the Mindspin Mountains, they are especially concentrated in the Bloodsworn Vale. Outside of the vale, skeltercats are most often found in and around hill giant camps. The brutish giants admire the skeltercats' savage ferocity, and often share their food with the cats to encourage them to remain in the area. For their part, the cats keep the area surrounding the giants' camp free from lesser predators and pick off any creatures attempting to escape the giants' clutches. Skeltercats may also serve as guards for the giants as they sleep through the night, and the last thing a group of adventurers may hear when attempting to ambush a band of giants is the yowl of a pouncing skeltercat.",
			"",
			"The Shoanti have a complicated relationship with skeltercats. Though many Shoanti tribespeople have lost their lives to the shapeshifters' claws, the Shoanti nonetheless insist that skeltercats act as guardians for their people. An obscure Shoanti myth holds that the first skeltercat was once a Shoanti warrior who wished to defend her tribe from a demon that inflicted terrible madness upon its foes. Seeking a way to protect herself from the demon's insanity-inducing gaze, the warrior donned a magical cougar mask created by the shaman of her tribe. The mask worked, and the warrior was able to drive the demon away. However, she discovered too late that she could not remove the mask, and she was cursed to forever roam the land in the form of a fearsome mountain lion.",
			"",
			"Though this myth is just a mangled retelling of the skeltercat's true origins, there may be some truth to it. Skeltercats are inherently immune to madness and confusion effects, and some claim that those who wear the hide of a skeltercat can gain some measure of this immunity for themselves."

Furthermore, the host suffers from mild headaches, slightly blurred vision, a nagging feeling of being watched, and other minor but discomforting distractions that impart a -1 penalty on all Will saving throws and Wisdom-based skill checks.

Instead, they view their dishonorable behaviors as the most expedient method of survival.

			"",
			"Skulks travel in small groups, rarely forming tribes of more than 16, for in larger groups bickering quickly leads to violent infighting. Murder between skulks is not uncommon, but they understand safety in numbers, and most frown upon treason within a group that is already relatively small, punishing traitors with a quick death. When possible, they set up camps in discreet spots near other settlements, commonly inhabiting sewers, caves, or forests - though their unsavory, murderous tactics often force them to relocate before local law enforcement, quickly alerted to their presence once the remains of a family of victims are discovered, finds them.",
			"",
			"Skulks are roughly the same size as a human, averaging 6 feet tall, though they are significantly more gangly and nimble, and commonly weigh only 140 pounds. Skinny arms and legs help them sneak around obstacles and squeeze into narrow spaces. Skulks can live up to 50 years, though most die from violence long before that. Although skulks have racial Hit Dice, they generally advance in power by taking class levels. Rogue is a favorite choice among skulks, for their natural abilities at stealth and sneak attacks fit well with this choice, but they also excel in the roles of clerics, fighters and rangers who specialize in ranged weapons, and rarely as wizards (particularly illusionists)."

Skum have even lost their own name-only the most erudite and wise of their kind remember that they were once known as the ulat-kini. Today, most identify themselves with the racial epithet applied to them by surface-dwellers-\"skum.\"",
			"",
			"Skum do not age, and barring death by violence or disease, they can live forever. Unfortunately, this near immortality is crippled by the fact that skum are incapable of reproducing among themselves, for all skum are male. The aboleths did not want their slave race to prosper without their permission. Yet terribly, this does not mean that skum cannot breed. Originally created from human stock, skum can impregnate humans, and the children issued from such unholy unions are invariably deformed. Those who are not born skum undergo gradual transformations throughout their lives, and when they would normally die of old age, such hybrids instead go through \"the change,\" shedding their wrinkled flesh and transforming into one of the ulat-kini. While most skum tribes lack the drive to perpetuate their race and would prefer to languish in their hideous sunken ruins, tribes settling offshore of remotely populated coastlines seem to be on the rise. Some such communities raid villages for breeding stock, but a few more insidious tribes form alliances with these desperate folk, providing protection and bounty from the sea in return for wives."

			"A combination of hare and grouse, skvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered.",
			"",
			"A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds.",
			"",
			"Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in hillier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance. They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed.",
			"",
			"Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skvaders move on to nearby farms and continue feeding.",
			"",
			"If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to that target.",
			"",
			"Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one, undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skvaders often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size, particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack.",
			"",
			"In skvader families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows, patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to new feeding grounds.",
			"",
			"### Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars",
			"",
			"While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat."

			"Slime molds are revolting oozes that wallow in rot and decay. A perfect example of symbiosis, each slime mold is covered in a thick garden of fungi, mildew, and toadstools, which helps it blend in with the surroundings. As ambush hunters, they can lie silently in wait for days at a time, surging into frenzied movement as soon as prey comes within reach. Most commonly encountered in deep forests, variations have adapted to life in caverns and sewers as well. They lack any ability to digest food, and rely entirely on their symbiotic fungal gardens to break down any organic matter they find into easily absorbed compost and decay. The molds and mushrooms that coat the ooze in turn receive ample food supplies, and over countless generations, many have developed into deadly variations of the forest or cave fungi from which they evolved. This fungal breakdown is in many ways akin to a disease-known as fungal rot, it can kill if allowed to progress for long. Those who succumb to fungal rot become tired and listless. Eventually, paralysis sets in and the victim's flesh begins to blacken and decay, running from the body in liquid streams that the slime mold can easily absorb. In a somewhat nauseating turnabout, certain creatures find the unusual fungus that grows upon a slime mold to be quite tasty, and these creatures actively hunt slime molds to devour their gardens - although they take care to avoid actual contact with the mold itself unless they happen to be immune to disease.",
			"",
			"Slime molds are ovoid in shape, growing up to 12 feet in length and weighing more than 600 pounds. Their substance is normally a sickly greenish-brown, with the coloration varying depending on their environment and how recently they've fed. They instinctually keep their coating of fungus and other vegetable detritus exposed above them, granting the slime mold a distinctive, undulating gait rather than the fluid movement of most oozes.",
			"",
			"To reproduce, slime molds split off small patches of their bodies whenever they encounter thick beds of fungi or mold. Over several months, these tiny blobs acclimate to the rot and absorb each another, until a single slime mold (with the young creature simple template) sprouts its own garden and begins hunting live prey."

			"**Breach Sense (Su)** A slithering pit can detect the presence and location of extradimensional spaces within the range of its blindsense, including those created by magic items like bags of holding, handy haversacks, and portable holes, as well as spell effects such as mage's magnificent mansion and rope trick. This ability also allows slithering pits to detect others of their kind.",
			"",
			"**Breach Vulnerability (Su)** If a slithering pit consumes an extradimensional space, such as one created by a bag of holding, a handy haversack, or a portable hole, the competing energies cause violent spasms that deal 2d6 points of damage to the slithering pit each round it contains the item. If killed in this way, the slithering pit explodes; anything trapped within the ooze takes 2d6 points of damage and is ejected to a random empty space within 30 feet of the slithering pit.",
			"",
			"**Pit (Su)** As a standard action, a slithering pit can cause its surface to open into an extradimensional space in order to capture and digest food. A slithering pit can use this ability only while on a solid horizontal surface of sufficient size to support it. The extradimensional space created by this ability is 10 feet deep, and any Medium or smaller creatures stepping into its space must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall into the pit, taking 1d6 points of damage from the fall. A slithering pit can also actively try to trap creatures by moving into their space. A target of this attack can make an attack of opportunity, but immediately falls into the extradimensional space following the attack. If the target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save to avoid falling into the extradimensional space as if it had wandered into the slithering pit's space. At any one time, a slithering pit can contain up to one Medium creature, two Small creatures, or four Tiny creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based. The interior surface of the pit is as hard as rough stone. While the pit is open, a creature inside can climb out with a successful DC 15 Climb check. A slithering pit can close its extradimensional space as a move action, trapping a creature inside. A trapped creature takes 1 point of acid damage each round it remains in the extradimensional space. A creature thus trapped can attack the walls of the space to damage the slithering pit. The walls have an AC of 10 and hardness 8. A slithering pit can forcibly eject the contents of its extradimensional space as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures inside. Ejected creatures end up in a random square adjacent to the slithering pit. If a slithering pit is killed, its extradimensional space collapses and ejects its contents immediately.",
			"",
			"**Transparent (Ex)** A slithering pit is difficult to discern from its surroundings in most environments. The slithering pit gains a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks and can move at full speed without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. A creature that fails to notice a slithering pit and walks into it risks falling into its pit (if its pit is open) or taking damage as if struck by the slithering pit's tentacle attack.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bizarre oozes born from magical mishaps, slithering pits use their naturally occurring extradimensional spaces to attack and trap prey. An extradimensional breach coats the top surface of these oozes, and the creatures prowl lazily, hunting for well-traveled routes and then quietly lying down for hours - or even days - until tasty morsels literally fall into their waiting grasps. Like most oozes, slithering pits lack true mouths and any digestive organs. While they can trap creatures within their extradimensional wells, they must wait for their prey to dissolve in digestive acids before they can absorb any nutrition. Luckily, slithering pits can survive for weeks between feedings, and in lean times they can even hibernate for months, appearing to be nothing but a slick spot in an alleyway or a shallow puddle.",
			"",
			"Slithering pits frequent ruins and neglected urban areas, where their transparency allows them to blend in with the shadows of darkened alleys and crumbling corridors. No thicker than a few inches at the center, slithering pits are difficult to distinguish from natural features when immobile. Their slimy exteriors pick up debris and rubble as they stalk, further helping them blend into city streets and ruined floors. Beyond their mobility and slight thickness, slithering pits' only revealing feature is their shiny mucus, which leaves a glistening trail wherever the creatures travel - but even this dries up and flakes away in a few hours once the ooze settles in at a favored ambush site. While slithering pits are camouflaged on top, their undersides reveal their true appearance: moist and decorated in scintillating patterns of red, green, and blue. Slithering pits are 5 feet in diameter and weigh less than 20 pounds.",
			"",
			"As ambush predators, slithering pits are most successful when inactive. Because of their transparent appearances, most slithering pits are hardly noticed or are mistaken for shallow puddles by locals. When periods between feedings grow too long, the oozes become more aggressive. Despite their usually patient tactics, slithering pits become vicious when hungry or threatened, lashing out with a thin pseudopod from their perimeter. When desperate, they dispense with stealth and attempt to drag prey into their maws or throw themselves beneath stumbling feet. The fall into the pit is often enough to kill their prey; those who survive the fall instead die from being slowly digested if they can't quickly clamber back out. These creatures even show rudimentary strategy, sometimes trapping a child or small animal, whose cries for help eventually draw larger victims.",
			"",
			"A slithering pit's inner well functions much like a bag of holding, allowing it to carry more prey than its small body could normally contain and potentially feeding it for months after a good hunting season. Anyone or anything inside moves along with the ooze wherever it travels without any sense of outside momentum.",
			"",
			"A slithering pit can sometimes come into existence when an intelligent ooze - in most cases, a slithering tracker - consumes a bag of holding or another magic item that makes use of extradimensional spaces. The residual magical energies are infused within the ooze, and when it dies, the ooze's remaining material is reborn as a slithering pit.",
			"",
			"Slithering pits become dangerous urban blights as they prowl congested cities and cramped slums. They especially flourish in decaying or neglected areas, where potholes filled with water are overlooked. In areas plagued by crime, slithering pits are sometimes used to dispose of bodies. Some clever and opportunistic creatures' especially those immune to the pit's digestive acids-sometimes use slithering pits as roaming lairs, dragging their own kills into the oozes' cave-like interiors to share leftovers, and scavenging the freely available prey that the oozes trap. Some spellcasters consider the mucus of a slithering pit to be an ideal component for magic concerned with interdimensional travel and storage.",
			"",
			"Those researching these oozes claim that there are different varieties of slithering pits. Scattered reports exist of slithering pits that are much larger, sometimes stretching across an entire narrow street or setting up an ambush in the opening of a wide alley. Some lurk within the darkened expanses of warehouses or beneath boardwalks in dockside settlements. Scholars are unclear whether these larger oozes are simply regular slithering pits that have fed and lived long enough to grow, or if they form when larger oozes consume more powerful magic items.",
			"",
			"### Slithering Rift",
			"",
			"The most dangerous variant slithering pit is the slithering rift, an ooze that not only traps its prey in an extradimensional space, but also has the ability to serve as a wandering portal that can transport its prey across great distances-maybe even across the barriers of the planes themselves. Slithering rifts are much more powerful than the typical slithering pit - they are Huge, have 16 Hit Dice, and can manifest four tentacles per round to attack foes. A slithering rift's interaction with reality creates a significant warping of space, granting it a +20 deflection bonus to its AC. These powerful and dangerous oozes are CR 14 terrors."

			"",

A slithering tracker can drain a human-sized creature of its blood with shocking swiftness, leaving only a desiccated carcass behind. A slithering tracker can go some time between meals, but never turns down easy prey. The larger a slithering tracker grows, the more voracious its appetite becomes, until, after a particularly large feeding, the creature splits into two smaller slithering trackers that eventually go their separate ways in search of feeding territory.",
			"",
			"Slithering trackers are not harmed by bright light, but still prefer to avoid areas of intense illumination or natural sunlight, and so only venture aboveground at night. They prefer the cool, damp environment of their native caves and tunnels.",
			"",
			"Although intelligent and cunning, slithering trackers are entirely alien creatures. They do not possess any language of their own, although they can usually understand the dominant language of the region they dwell in - usually Undercommon. Some underworld inhabitants do manage to forge alliances with slithering trackers, or at least exist with them in symbiosis by providing the creatures with easy and regular prey, but as one can never truly know a slithering tracker's desires or motivations, such alliances are dangerous to rely upon."

At the same time, the liquid excreted by glands on a slurk's stomach is incredible slippery, allowing the slurk to keep from being immobilized by its own back slime and also making it extremely hard to grapple or maneuver without its consent. Combined with slurks' natural ability to climb walls and hang from ceilings with ease, these abilities make the foul-smelling creatures extremely desirable to kobolds, who domesticate and train the frog-beasts as powerful mounts and guardians."

This control lasts until another intelligent creature holds the tether for an hour or more, whereupon that creature gains control of the construct. If its controller dies or otherwise ceases to command the smoke sentinel, the construct continues carrying out its most recent command. Should its last command be a finite task, the smoke sentinel reverts to the role of guardian when finished, keeping potential threats away from the site of its tether.

Unless directly threatened or certain that the target of its investigation poses a threat to its master or other sworn charge, the smoke sentinel employs illusions and fear to confuse and frighten the interloper away.

			"",
			"Smoke sentinels do not age, though as they grow accustomed to their land and as they see creatures and people they were meant to protect slowly die off, they are prone to becoming overprotective. Each smoke sentinel is created along with an Azlanti artifact that anchors it to a specific spot. If it moves more than a mile from this tether, it loses control of its physical form, and if kept beyond this range for too long, it might disperse completely. As such, smoke sentinels are careful about the range of their patrols.",
			"",
			"Despite their gaseous nature, smoke sentinels are capable of coalescing the smoke that makes up their bodies into clawlike tendrils to protect themselves. A smoke sentinel often reveals its presence with whirring, almost mechanical noises that permeate the air as it approaches.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Smoke sentinels are most often depicted in ancient Azlanti texts as benign creatures that warded off invaders and helped their culture flourish in times of great struggle. While many in the modern day consider smoke sentinels to be extremely dangerous, the creatures do not murder without cause. If someone takes a relic from its creator, desecrates a corpse, or steps onto ground its programming denotes as hallowed, a smoke sentinel seeks only to right that wrong.",
			"",
			"At the peak of the Azlanti civilization, smoke sentinels took the forms of Azlanti warriors and patrolled the borders of towns and cities to ward off invaders. They were considered great protectors, and they were occasionally used in Azlanti armies as a way to induce terror in enemy ranks.",
			"",
			"There are few examples of rogue smoke sentinels in history, but in late Azlant just prior to Earthfall, some priests with delusions of grandeur or revenge fresh on their minds created smoke sentinels not as protectors, but as tools for assassination and sabotage. However, once such a smoke sentinel completed its mission - and it would inevitably complete its mission - the construct would return to its tether not to regenerate but to destroy the artifact in a form of construct suicide. This raised an ethical concern among the Azlanti: Are smoke sentinels truly just constructs, built only to serve a singular purpose? Or do they have consciousness, a soul? This ethical dilemma eventually led to the practice of using smoke sentinels falling out of favor, and even being banned completely in some regions. As a result, by the time Azlant sank into the sea, very few smoke sentinels remained, and fewer still survive to this day.",
			"",
			"### Construction",

			"While many secrets of Azlanti technology have been recovered from the depths of time, expert golemcrafters have yet to reverse engineer the means of building a smoke sentinel and tether. Current theories postulate that unique [ioun stones](magic-wondrous/ioun_stone) must be utilized in the creation process, though what shape or color these ioun stones need to take remains a mystery."

The snallygaster's serpentine neck terminates at a small, birdlike head with a single eye set in the center of the forehead.

Once its foe lies dead or unconscious, the snallygaster uses its tonguelike tentacles to slurp up the victim's blood. The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is alcohol, and it spends much of each autumn scouring its territory for fermenting fruit, on which it gorges itself until thoroughly inebriated. Intoxicated snallygasters are extremely aggressive.",
			"",

Some unusual step between avians and bats, snarks come in a variety of shapes and sizes - from insect-sized to large and dangerous predators - but the smaller lyre snarks are the most common. Snarks live in forests, canyons, and towns of the First World. They mark their territory with loud songs, but keep themselves well hidden - so much so that many outsiders believe they can turn invisible at will. Their wings feature dexterous little hands to pick at fruit, nuts, and the occasional shiny object. They are adept at picking parasites from larger creatures, and are one of the few smaller creatures the Tane - including the voracious {monster/bandersnatch} - generally permit in close proximity.",
			"",
			"All varieties of snarks share the ability to glow softly when happy or excited - much to their detriment, as this light attracts predators. In some parts of the First World, snarks share territory with birds, and are generally strong fliers but less adapted to running along the ground or through trees. Lyre snarks rarely weigh more than a pound. For larger and more aggressive snarks - such as the flesh-eating boojum - use the statistics for an eagle, an owl, or a vulture.",
			"",
			"Smaller snarks, like the one presented here, make affectionate pets, but are known for stealing small objects and treats from their owners to line a variety of nests and secret stashes they maintain. An arcane caster who selects a snark as a familiar gains a +3 bonus on Stealth checks, though snark familiars are vanishingly rare beyond the First World."

			"Solifugids are sometimes called \"camel spiders,\" \"wind scorpions,\" or \"sun spiders,\" despite the fact that they are neither spiders nor scorpions but rather their own unique species. They have large pedipalps near their heads, used to grab and hold prey while they feed with their twin sets of vertically aligned mandibles. When hunting in groups, they prefer to attack targets already grappled by other solifugids. The various species of enormous solifugids generally have eight legs, although the front two appendages are large enough that they can easily be mistaken for an additional pair of legs. Some species, like the albino cave solifugid, have fewer legs, but all solifugids are aggressive vermin.",

In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the surface of its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either dies or escapes. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a tendency that serves both to preserve the creature's energy and to avoid needless conflict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions.",

They dig tunnels and burrows, shoring up the sides of the passages with sticky saliva that hardens into a temporary cement. Since they constantly toil in their warrens, their tawny fur collects fine dust and sand particles. As an instinctive means of defense, soricos shake themselves violently, which loosens the sand and creates a distracting cloud of dust that allows them to escape from predators. Soricos measure 3 feet long, stand 2 feet tall, and weigh 100 pounds. Those who hunt soricos find their meat delicious, comparable to that of a farm-raised rabbit."

Even as a spirit, the soulpierced's still-beating heart is gruesomely visible, as is the blade stabbed through it. Although a soulpierced resembles a ghostly version of its living form, its features are so twisted by rage and grief that it is difficult to recognize. Prevented from moving on and receiving Pharasma's judgment but also unable to be returned to life, these tormented creatures grow increasingly bitter and angry, magically inflicting its frustration and rage onto nearby creatures.",
			"",
			"Even those who destroy a soulpierced find their work incomplete, as the blade through the creature's heart causes it to rejuvenate in the same location within days. Only by removing the soulpiercing blade can anyone free the creature and permanently eliminate it as a threat. But the attempt itself poses grave danger, as close proximity to the soulpierced exposes the opponent to the creature's wrathful attack and the blade itself can harm those who remove it.",
			"",
			"No soulpierced is created by accident, nor could they be. The wicked spellcasters willing to perform the elaborate and expensive magical ritual to transform a victim into a soulpierced must do so deliberately and with the utmost care. The ritual is a closely guarded secret but incorporates powerful spells such as {spell/create greater undead} and {spell/soul bind}. It destroys the victim's body, leaving only her heart, and places her under a permanent {spell/nondetection} spell that prevents allies or next of kin from locating her. The ritual to create a soulpierced is usually performed in some location where the perpetrator is confident the spirit won't be discovered, such as an isolated crypt, remote woods, or an abandoned ruin. Because of the complexity and expense of the ritual, the spellcaster must be extraordinarily invested, and thus nearly every soulpierced was once a person with powerful enemies, such as a monarch with influential contenders for the throne, a military leader capable of turning the tide of a war, or a government advisor with significant authority.",
			"",
			"The blade used in the ritual must have a personal connection to the victim, but need not be a conventional weapon; while one soulpierced's blade might be an heirloom dagger, another's might be a shard of mirror. The ritual can anchor any creature that has a soul, although non-humanoid victims are rare.",
			"",
			"The torment of the binding ritual, coupled with years - or even centuries - of loneliness and spite, erodes the remains of what personality the soulpierced had in life. Each soulpierced is unaware of the link between the blade in its heart and its perpetual torment. Although it's not impossible to convince a soulpierced that its blade must be removed, it is very difficult to overcome a soulpierced's agony and suspicion. Even if successfully convinced of the link between her suffering and her blade, the soulpierced is unable to remove the blade from her own heart and highly unlikely to trust another creature to do so.",
			"",
			"Removing a soulpierced's blade is no simple matter. If the creature attempting to remove the blade isn't familiar with powerful counter-curses and prayers of unbinding, the blade remains firmly lodged in the soulpierced's heart. Even if successfully removed, the blade rots the life force of any creature that removes it, while crumbling the blade itself to powder.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Each soulpierced haunts a lonely location and is likely to spend many years without seeing another sentient creature. Multiple soulpierced might share a location, especially if the spellcaster who created them did so in great number or returned to a favorite spot to perform the ritual on successive victims. In a case where the family or friends of a victim have orchestrated a deliberate and coordinated search, a bounty hunter or tracker might encounter a soulpierced, but the spirit's wrath makes it unlikely a scout returns to report on what he has found. A powerful spellcaster might take advantage of a soulpierced's endless rage to create an intractable guard, permanently anchored to the murder site and unwilling to let creatures pass without experiencing the soulpierced's fury."

Yet what sets them apart from lesser undead are their retained caginess and knowledge of tactics, allowing them to function with deadly efficiency in troops of their brethren. Sometimes called the \"sown men,\" spartoi hold a fundamental connection to the near-mythical magical items known as a spartoi seeds, teeth that when planted in the earth summon forth these undead, fully armed and ready for command. Although ancient versions of these items prove especially rare, the well-known nature of their myth has led to dozens of modern versions being created and, with them, a rise in the appearance of spartoi.",

Most simply, a create undead spell cast by a magic-user of caster level 16 or greater can infuse a dead body with a heroic spirit, resurrecting it as a spartolos. Alternatively, one might seek out rare items known as spartoi seeds. Although relatively rare, the oldest seeds might summon forth the corpses of legendary heroes rather than typical spartoi. These slain champions, while possessing the same statistics as normal spartoi in death, possess the ability to speak and often bear great insight into the ways of battle or memories from their lives."

If this check fails, the spell is lost and the spellcaster must make a successful DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1 round by magical feedback generated by the field (this is a mind-affecting effect). Spellgorgers are immune to the effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

The spellgorger must supply any components for casting the spell in question - if the spell requires the use of focus or material components, the spellgorger can use any components carried by the engulfed spellcaster as if it had those components.

			"Spellgorgers are among the more terrifying threats that face an adventuring spellcaster-shapeless entities that feed on magic. Rarely encountered in large numbers, spellgorgers are most common in remote reaches of the Darklands, where they often prey upon the numerous spellcasting races that dwell below, such as the drow, duergar, derro, and svirfneblin. A spellgorger prefers the \"taste\" of arcane magic, but can feed on divine and psychic magic as well.",
			"",
			"A spellgorger resembles a floating sphere of violet sludge that exudes a slithery forest of fine tendrils and sparks of magical energy. A typical specimen is 10 feet in diameter and weighs 1,000 pounds, but spellgorgers' supernatural ability to fly and swift reflexes belie their massive bulk and weight.",
			"",
			"The original spellgorgers, like so many of the stranger magical predators of the world, arose from failed magical experiments. The most pervasive theory of their source is an attempt by drow wizards to solidify raw magic and give it life in a fleshforge-making a magical spell into a free-willed, living creature.",
			"",
			"Spellgorgers feed on magic, but the method by which they do so is not only unusual, but also highly disturbing and unsettling to spellcasters. In order to feed, a spellgorger first engulfs a spellcasting creature. It then pulls prepared magical potential from its engulfed victim, effectively stealing spells and casting them to serve its own agenda (often using these stolen spells to defend itself from the engulfed victim's allies). When a spellgorger casts spells in this parasitic manner, it is able to absorb the magical \"runoff\" from the spell as sustenance. This act is performed without deliberate malice, despite how humiliating it is for spellcasters who have been parasitized in this way. Indeed, a spellgorger does not benefit from the death of an engulfed spellcaster, and these creatures often go to great lengths to keep their victims alive. Once a spellgorger has expended all of its victim's spells, it generally expels the spellcaster, likely unharmed save for being entirely drained of magic, and moves on to seek other prey. A spellgorger is capable of using many magical items as well, but curiously, it cannot feed from magic within a scroll, wand, or other device-something about the mixing of organic life and the act of spellcasting combines in just the right way to nourish these curious creatures.",
			"",
			"When they grow too large, spellgorgers reproduce through spontaneous fission.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Spellgorgers are remarkably intelligent and have an uncannily strong sense of self and personality. Scholars suspect that much of this is a side effect of the nature of their feeding-that when spellgorgers consume magic from an engulfed creature, they retain a slight trace of that creature's intellect and charisma. Then, as the spellgorgers reproduce, this store of mental acuity is handed down through the generations rather than lost upon death. If true, at some point in the future, spellgorgers may count themselves as some of the most intelligent forms of life on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"Yet despite their intellect, most spellgorgers are content to waste their minds in private philosophical debates. While they may engage in long, complicated discussions with their prey, when two spellgorgers meet, they often form strong bonds and eagerly discuss all matters magical. Curiously, spellgorgers directly related by fission do not get along well at all, and are prone to violent arguments; for this reason, when a spellgorger splits, its two \"young\" generally seek new homes far from one another."

			"**Aura of Charming (Su)** The spirit's aura sways the feelings of creatures within 30 feet that have an attitude of unfriendly or worse. Such creatures must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by charm monster for 1 day. Creatures that attack the spirit must save against the aura, regardless of their attitude. A creature that makes its save is immune to the spirit's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Knowledge (Ex)** The spirit adds half her Hit Dice (+9) on all Knowledge checks and may make all Knowledge checks untrained.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Magic (Ex, Su)** Each day, the spirit can cast any three bards spells of any level and in any combination. Her caster level for these bard spells is 18th. She may select any spells from the bard spell list when using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Performance (Su)** The spirit has the bardic performance class ability. She can use bardic performance for 11 rounds per day, and has access to the following abilities: countersong, distraction, fascinate, and inspire courage (+5).",
			"",
			"**Inspiration (Su)** The spirit can choose an intelligent creature to inspire and serve as a muse for by giving that creature some token of her power (typically a lock of her hair or a piece of her garment). As long as the spirit retains her favor for this creature and the creature carries the spirit's token, the creature gains a +4 insight bonus on all Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. A bard who has the spirit for a muse in this way can use his bardic performance for an additional number of rounds per day equal to the spirit's Charisma bonus. The spirit retains a link to her token and its carrier as if she had cast a status spell on the carrier. The spirit can end this effect at any time as a free action, even if she is not on the same plane as the carrier. The spirit may inspire a number of creatures at a time equal to her Charisma bonus.",
			"",
			"**Stunning Bolt (Su)** The spirit's stunning bolt is a ray of brilliant divine energy. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Any creature that it strikes takes 1d8 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be stunned for 1d6 rounds. If the target succeeds at this save, it is merely dazzled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Unearthly Grace (Su)** The spirit adds her Charisma modifier as a racial bonus on all her saving throws, and as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The Spirit of Adoration is among Shelyn's greatest servants, an intelligent personification of true love, whose power lifts the heaviest heart and overcomes all obstacles. She rarely comes to the mortal world, and it is even rarer for her to enter battle, but when that time comes, it is said that there is nothing she cannot bend or break in pursuit of her goal.",
			"",
			"The spirit's true form is that of a 10-foot-tall, angel-winged woman - usually a human but sometimes an elf - dressed in flowing clothes and bearing a shining steel glaive. When interacting with easily frightened mortals (especially children), she uses her shapechanging powers to look like a human or elf of normal height, attractive according to the standards of the local people, but she never makes herself so beautiful as to cause jealousy or inspire inappropriate comments or attention.",
			"",
			"When not carrying out Shelyn's will, the spirit enjoys dancing in clouds, across lakes, and on mountaintops, whether on Golarion or Nirvana, ignoring the occasional bolt of lightning that strikes her.",
			"",
			"Although she does not need to eat, the spirit loves the occasional taste of food or wine, especially wedding cake and champagne toasts. While she does not need to sleep, she loves to dream, deciding the framework of her dreams before she sleeps and enjoying the mystery of how they play out. Sleeping is the only time she is still, as she loves motion, frequently dancing with joy or gesturing with her hands while speaking. Her primary role is as a messenger of love and beauty, encouraging mortals to pursue love and create art, and for much of her work she is present but invisible, speaking just the right words to accomplish her mission and vanishing thereafter.",
			"",
			"The spirit only kills when she absolutely has to, such as when confronted by mindless creatures or irredeemable undead, and even then only if sparing them would create a threat to others. She prefers to let her aura of charming change hostile creatures into temporary allies, giving her time to move aggressive opponents away from innocents and speak words of diplomacy under more amiable conditions. She uses her stunning bolts against creatures she believes can be talked into surrender or peace, reserving her glaive and attack spells for recalcitrant foes and alien or mindless things that absolutely cannot understand love or beauty.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The spirit is a creature of love and is open with her emotions to all mortals. She treasures the presence of every infant, child, adult, and animal, and can appreciate the beauty of any landscape, no matter how stark, blasted, or strange. She is generous, compassionate, and tolerant, and those who meet her under pleasant circumstances can't help but agree that she is one of the nicest creatures they've ever met. However, most of her interactions on the mortal world occur when some great love or beautiful work of art is threatened. At these times she grows quiet, her eyes burn with the fire of true love threatened, and her face becomes the stern mask of an artist lost in the moment of finishing her masterpiece. When inspired by this cause, her hands wield glaive, spell, and ray in a beautiful and enthralling dance, as though they move to the very music of creation.",
			"",
			"The spirit has an excellent memory for names and faces, and enjoys tracing the family trees of Shelyn's agathion servitors, often recognizing a distant mortal relation 10 generations later. She is friends with all of the goddess's minions, and shares this affection with their mortal relatives. Though she is not a gossip, she listens to her fellow celestials and is aware of who they've helped in the mortal world; she keeps tabs on those who have benefited from the goddess's favor in the past and, if necessary, might be willing to repay a past favor.",
			"",
			"The minions of Zon-Kuthon fill her with pity. Whenever she encounters them, she tries to steal them away to a temple of her creator and have the priests try to cleanse the mental stains of that dark god. She tries this with his divine servants as well, with much more limited success."

Once their prey has been wounded, a pack follows like vultures, waiting for their anticoagulant saliva to bleed a creature dry before moving in to feast. Many spiroskeks target slaver parties, taking advantage of the meat that arrives bound or hobbled; duergar especially hate the beasts.",

Stymphalidies breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour.",
			"",
			"Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalidies are made of steel-like material similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. Smaller varieties of stymphalidies exist, including a variant with a penchant for swarming, but the towering creature presented here is by far the most commonly encountered of its kind. This stymphalidies stands 13 feet tall, with a wingspan of 25 feet and a weight of 250 pounds."

A helpless su's whelps can be easily killed or removed from the su (removing them from the su also immediately kills them).

These young su cling to their parents' backs, feeding on parasites and scraps. Born at the apex of their psychic abilities, baby su slowly change shape and lose their powers over their first year-by the time they reach their full predatory form, all psychic magic has vanished. These furious new adults then leave to become providers for their own whelps. A grown su is 5 feet long and 90 pounds."
