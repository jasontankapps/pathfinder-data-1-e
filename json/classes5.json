			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A brawler is proficient with all simple weapons plus the handaxe, short sword, and weapons from the close fighter weapon group. She is proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).",
			"",
			"**Brawler's Cunning (Ex):** If the brawler's Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.",
			"",
			"**Martial Flexibility (Ex):** A brawler can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat she doesn't possess. This effect lasts for 1 minute. The brawler must meet all the feat's prerequisites. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + 1/2 her brawler level (minimum 1).",

At 6th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of two combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a swift action or two feats as a move action. She may use one of these feats to meet a prerequisite of the second feat; doing so means that she cannot replace a feat currently fulfilling another's prerequisite without also replacing those feats that require it. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.",
			"",
			"At 10th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of three combat feats at the same time. She may select one feat as a free action, two feats as a swift action, or three feats as a move action. She may use one of the feats to meet a prerequisite of the second and third feats, and use the second feat to meet a prerequisite of the third feat. Each individual feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.",

			"",
			"At 20th level, a brawler can use this ability to gain the benefit of any number of combat feats as a swift action. Each feat selected counts toward her daily uses of this ability.",
			"",
			"**Martial Training (Ex):** At 1st level, a brawler counts her total brawler levels as both fighter levels and monk levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats. She also counts as both a fighter and a monk for feats and magic items that have different effects based on whether the character has levels in those classes (such as {feat/Stunning Fist} and a {magic-wondrous/monk's robe}). This ability does not automatically grant feats normally granted to fighters and monks based on class level, namely {feat/Stunning Fist}.",
			"",
			"**Unarmed Strike:** At 1st level, a brawler gains {feat/Improved Unarmed Strike} as a bonus feat. A brawler may attack with fists, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a brawler may make unarmed strikes with her hands full. A brawler applies her full Strength modifier (not half) on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.",
			"",
			"Usually, a brawler's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.",

			"**Bonus Combat Feats:** At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler gains a bonus combat feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus combat feat.",
			"",
			"Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus combat feat in place of a bonus combat feat she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus combat feat in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus combat feat for the level.",
			"",
			"**Brawler's Flurry (Ex):** Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler's flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the {feat/Two-Weapon Fighting} feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close fighter weapon group, or weapons with the \"monk\" special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.",
			"",
			"A brawler applies her full Strength modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler's flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute disarm, sunder, and trip combat maneuvers for unarmed attacks as part of brawler's flurry. A brawler with natural weapons can't use such weapons as part of brawler's flurry, nor can she make natural weapon attacks in addition to her brawler's flurry attacks.",
			"",
			"At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the {feat/Improved Two-Weapon Fighting} feat when using brawler's flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the {feat/Greater Two-Weapon Fighting} feat when using brawler's flurry.",
			"",
			"**Maneuver Training (Ex):** At 3rd level, a brawler can select one combat maneuver to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks when performing that combat maneuver and a +1 bonus to her CMD when defending against that maneuver.",
			"",
			"At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another combat maneuver, gaining the above +1 bonus combat maneuver checks and to CMD. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous maneuver training increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses grapple at 3rd level and sunder at 7th level, her bonuses to grapple are +2 and bonuses to sunder are +1. If she then chooses bull rush upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to grapple are +3, to sunder are +2, and to bull rush are +1.)",
			"",
			"**AC Bonus (Ex):** At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no armor, she gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and CMD. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.",
			"",
			"These bonuses to AC apply against touch attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or helpless, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load.",
			"",
			"**Knockout (Ex):** At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target unconscious. She must announce this intent before making her attack roll. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler's level + the higher of the brawler's Strength or Dexterity modifier) or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the unconscious target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures immune to critical hits or nonlethal damage are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.",
			"",
			"**Brawler's Strike (Ex):** At 5th level, a brawler's unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 12th level, she chooses one alignment component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. (This alignment component cannot be the opposite of the brawler's actual alignment, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.",
			"",
			"**Close Weapon Mastery (Ex):** At 5th level, a brawler's damage with [close weapons](ability/weapon_groups) increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the unarmed strike damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching dagger deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon's normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon's base damage instead of her adjusted unarmed strike damage - this must be declared before the attack roll is made.",
			"",
			"**Awesome Blow (Ex):** At 16th level, the brawler can as a standard action perform an awesome blow combat maneuver against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an unarmed strike, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler's choice, and it falls prone. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can't move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent's move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the {feat/Awesome Blow} monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)",
			"",
			"**Improved Awesome Blow (Ex):** At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a standard action. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another combat maneuver check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.",

			"### Alternate Capstones",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Chronicle of Legends/28}  ",
			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.",

			"| Old Dog, New Tricks (Ex) | At 20th level, the character shows that a true warrior always has one more surprise the enemy hasn't seen. The character gains four [combat feats](main/feats_combat). This capstone is available to characters of any class that gains at least four bonus combat feats. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Perfect Warrior (Ex) | At 20th level, the brawler has reached the highest levels of her art. The brawler's maneuver training increases by 2 and her dodge bonus to AC improves by 2. This replaces the 20th-level improvement to martial flexibility. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 28](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| The Boss (Ex) | At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero - she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 30](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| With This Sword (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Won't Stay Dead (Ex) | At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

			"While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes.",
			"",
			"**Role:** Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge.

The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier's level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level.",

			"",
			"The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's order.",
			"",
			"**Mount (Ex):** A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a [druid's animal companion](class/druid), using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. This mount may come from the following list:",

			"A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level.",
			"",
			"**Order (Ex):** At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific [order](ability/orders). The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.",
			"",
			"A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.",
			"",
			"**Tactician (Ex):** At 1st level, a cavalier receives a [teamwork feat](main/feats_teamwork) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.",
			"",
			"**Cavalier's Charge (Ex):** At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted.",
			"",
			"**Expert Trainer (Ex):** At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses Handle Animal on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.",
			"",
			"**Banner (Ex):** At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function.",
			"",
			"Some knights inspire and direct their allies with specialized tactics. A cavalier can select [a different battle standard](ability/banners) upon gaining the banner class feature, and its benefits replace the normal benefits of the banner and greater banner class features.",

			"",
			"**Greater Tactician (Ex):** At 9th level, the cavalier receives an additional [teamwork feat](main/feats_teamwork) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Mighty Charge (Ex):** At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Demanding Challenge (Ex):** At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a -2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.",
			"",
			"**Greater Banner (Ex):** At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day.",
			"",
			"**Master Tactician (Ex):** At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional [teamwork feat](main/feats_teamwork) as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.",
			"",
			"**Supreme Charge (Ex):** At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus.",

			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.",

This capstone is available to any class with an animal companion. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Tactical Genius (Ex) | At 20th level, the cavalier is a maestro of the battlefield, commanding and moving troops like so many game pieces. The cavalier gains a bonus [teamwork feat](main/feats_teamwork), can grant up to three bonus feats with tactician, and increases the range of tactician by 90 feet. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 28](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| The Boss (Ex) | At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero - she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 30](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| With This Sword (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Won't Stay Dead (Ex) | At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

			"In faith and the miracles of the divine, many find a greater purpose. Called to serve powers beyond most mortal understanding, all priests preach wonders and provide for the spiritual needs of their people. Clerics are more than mere priests, though; these emissaries of the divine work the will of their deities through strength of arms and the magic of their gods. Devoted to the tenets of the religions and philosophies that inspire them, these ecclesiastics quest to spread the knowledge and influence of their faith. Yet while they might share similar abilities, clerics prove as different from one another as the divinities they serve, with some offering healing and redemption, others judging law and truth, and still others spreading conflict and corruption. The ways of the cleric are varied, yet all who tread these paths walk with the mightiest of allies and bear the arms of the gods themselves.",
			"",
			"**Role:** More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies' prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need.",
			"",
			"As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion - such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge - free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** A cleric's alignment must be within one step of her deity's, along either the law/chaos axis or the good/evil axis.  ",

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields). Clerics are also proficient with the favored weapon of their deity.",
			"",
			"**Aura (Ex):** A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity's alignment (see {spell/detect evil}).",
			"",
			"**Spells:** A cleric casts divine spells which are drawn from the [cleric spell list](main/spells_cleric) presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment, however, may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see chaotic, evil, good, and lawful spells. A cleric must choose and prepare her spells in advance.",
			"",
			"To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric's spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric's Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, she receives [bonus spells per day](rule/determine_bonuses) if she has a high Wisdom score.",
			"",
			"Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.",
			"",
			"**Channel Energy (Su):** Regardless of alignment, any cleric can release a wave of energy by channeling the power of her faith through her holy (or unholy) symbol. This energy can be used to cause or heal damage, depending on the type of energy channeled and the creatures targeted.",
			"",
			"A good cleric (or one who worships a good deity) channels positive energy and can choose to deal damage to undead creatures or to heal living creatures. An evil cleric (or one who worships an evil deity) channels negative energy and can choose to deal damage to living creatures or to heal undead creatures. A neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity (or one who is not devoted to a particular deity) must choose whether she channels positive or negative energy. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric casts spontaneous cure or inflict spells.",
			"",
			"Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's Charisma modifier. Creatures healed by channeled energy cannot exceed their maximum hit point total - all excess healing is lost. A cleric may channel energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. This is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A cleric can choose whether or not to include herself in this effect. A cleric must be able to present her holy symbol to use this ability.",
			"",
			"Some deities may endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. You may choose one of these [variant channeling abilities](ability/variant_channeling) instead.",
			"",
			"**Domains:** A cleric's deity influences her alignment, what magic she can perform, her values, and how others see her. A cleric chooses two [domains](ability/domains) from among those belonging to her deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if her alignment matches that domain. If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, she still selects two domains to represent her spiritual inclinations and abilities (subject to GM approval). The restriction on alignment domains still applies.",
			"",
			"Each domain grants a number of domain powers, dependent upon the level of the cleric, as well as a number of bonus spells. A cleric gains one domain spell slot for each level of cleric spell she can cast, from 1st on up. Each day, a cleric can prepare one of the spells from her two domains in that slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in her domain spell slot. Domain spells cannot be used to cast spells spontaneously.",
			"",
			"In addition, a cleric gains the listed powers from both of her domains, if she is of a high enough level. Unless otherwise noted, using a domain power is a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Orisons:** Clerics can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Casting:** A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that she did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can \"lose\" any prepared spell that is not an orison or domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with \"cure\" in its name).",
			"",

			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.",
			"",
			"| Capstone | Benefit |",
			"| --- | --- |",
			"| Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Proxy (Su) | At 20th level, the cleric forges a direct, personal connection to her deity. She knows instinctively whether her deity would approve or disapprove of a given course of action or idea (though deities rarely bother to form opinions about overly mundane or trivial events). In addition, she can select an additional domain from the list offered by her deity. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 28](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Soul Channel (Su) | At 20th level, the character can channel energy six additional times per day, and her channel energy dice increase by one step. This capstone is available to characters with the channel energy class feature. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| The Boss (Ex) | At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero - she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 30](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| With This Sword (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Won't Stay Dead (Ex) | At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

			"Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature's wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.",
			"",
			"**Role:** While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.  ",

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape.",
			"",
			"Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the *ironwood* spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only those crafted from wood.",
			"",
			"A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.",
			"",
			"**Spells:** A druid casts divine spells which are drawn from the [druid spell list](main/spells_druid) presented in Spell Lists. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.",
			"",
			"To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid's spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid's Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, she receives [bonus spells per day](rule/determine_bonuses) if she has a high Wisdom score.",
			"",
			"A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Casting:** A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can \"lose\" a prepared spell in order to cast any *summon nature's ally* spell of the same level or lower.",
			"",
			"**Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells:** A druid can't cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity's (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.",
			"",
			"**Orisons:** Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Languages:** A druid's bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.",
			"",
			"A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn't take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to non-druids.",
			"",
			"Druidic has its own alphabet.",
			"",
			"**Nature Bond (Ex):** At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of three forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains: {domain/Air}, {domain/Animal}, {domain/Earth}, {domain/Fire}, {domain/Plant}, {domain/Water}, or {domain/Weather}. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid's effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. Alternately, the druid can choose a [druid-specific domain](ability/druid_domains). She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.",
			"",
			"The second option is to form a close bond with an animal companion. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in [Animal Choices](ability/druid_companions). This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.",
			"",
			"Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion's Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.",
			"",
			"Instead of granting access to a domain or an animal companion, a druid's bond with nature can take a third form: druidic herbalism. A druid who chooses this can use combinations of nuts, berries, dried herbs, and other natural ingredients along with appropriate containers to create herbal concoctions or magic consumables that function like potions. This acts like the {feat/Brew Potion} feat, but only for spells on the druid spell list. Herbal concoctions are typically thick and sludgy, and their creation time, caster level, spell duplication capabilities, and all other variables and properties are identical to those of potions created using Brew Potion. Herbal concoctions created with herbs that cause special effects when ingested retain those effects as well as the appropriate spell effect.",
			"",
			"A druid can create a number of free herbal concoctions per day equal to her Wisdom modifier. Additional concoctions cost the same as creating an equivalent potion using Brew Potion. Druids can sell their herbal concoctions just as if they were potions (though NPCs unfamiliar with druidic herbalism may need some convincing before purchasing these wares).",
			"",
			"At 4th level, a druid's increasing skill with herbalism means that she can disguise the effects of her herbal concoctions. When a creature attempts a Perception or Spellcraft check to identify one of the druid's concoctions, the concoction appears to be a different herbal concoction of the druid's choice unless the creature exceeds the identification DC by 5 or more. The druid must designate this false result when creating the concoction. If a creature exceeds the identification DC by 5 or more, it correctly identifies the concoction, though not that the druid tried to fool it.",
			"",
			"Additionally, at 4th level, when the druid creates additional concoctions, she need pay only half the normal cost to create them. It takes her only half the normal time to create her concoctions, and she can create concoctions of spells from any spell list, as long as she can cast the spell. At 7th level, when the druid creates concoctions with potential false identification results, a creature attempting to identify the concoction must exceed the identification DC by 10 or more to determine the concoction's true identity.",
			"",
			"Additionally, at 7th level, a druid can create any herbal concoction in 1 minute. She can also create a special concoction of any spell higher than 3rd level that she can cast, but to do so, she must expend a spell slot of the same level. These special concoctions do not cost her anything to create and function like extracts created by an {class/alchemist} with the infusion discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nature Sense (Ex):** A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.",
			"",
			"**Wild Empathy (Ex):** A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a {skill/Diplomacy} check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.",
			"",
			"To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.",
			"",
			"A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.",
			"",
			"**Woodland Stride (Ex):** Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.",
			"",
			"**Trackless Step (Ex):** Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.",
			"",
			"**Resist Nature's Lure (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that utilize or target plants, such as *blight*, *entangle*, *spike growth*, and *warp wood*.",
			"",
			"**Wild Shape (Su):** At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the *beast shape I* spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal with which the druid is familiar.",
			"",
			"A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)",
			"",
			"A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals, elementals, and plants. Each form expends one daily use of this ability, regardless of the form taken.",
			"",
			"At 6th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large or Tiny animal or a Small elemental. When taking the form of an animal, a druid's wild shape now functions as *beast shape II*. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape functions as *elemental body I*.",
			"",
			"At 8th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge or Diminutive animal, a Medium elemental, or a Small or Medium plant creature. When taking the form of animals, a druid's wild shape now functions as *beast shape III*. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as *elemental body II*. When taking the form of a plant creature, the druid's wild shape functions as *plant shape I*.",
			"",
			"At 10th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Large elemental or a Large plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as *elemental body III*. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as *plant shape II*.",
			"",
			"At 12th level, a druid can also use wild shape to change into a Huge elemental or a Huge plant creature. When taking the form of an elemental, the druid's wild shape now functions as *elemental body IV*. When taking the form of a plant, the druid's wild shape now functions as *plant shape III*.",
			"",
			"**Venom Immunity (Ex):** At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.",
			"",
			"**A Thousand Faces (Su):** At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the *alter self* spell, but only while in her normal form.",
			"",
			"**Timeless Body (Ex):** After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.",
			"",
			"### Ex-Druids",
			"",
			"A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a non-druid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she [atones](spell/atonement).",
			"",
			"### Alternate Capstones",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Chronicle of Legends/28}  ",
			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.",

This capstone is available to any class with an animal companion. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Home Ground (Su) | At 20th level, the druid knows every tree, every deer, every blade of grass, and every scuttling beetle of her home. The druid selects a specific area relevant to the campaign, such as a prominent forest, mountain, or even a patch of sea. The druid is constantly under the effect of {spell/commune with nature} with regards to that area and can change the facts she gleans from the spell when she prepares her spells each day. In addition, while on her home ground, the druid gains a +4 bonus to her caster level. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 28](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| The Boss (Ex) | At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero - she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 30](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| With This Sword (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Won't Stay Dead (Ex) | At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.",

This condition replaces stunning the target for 1 round, and a successful saving throw still negates the effect. At 4th level, he can choose to make the target fatigued. At 8th level, he can make the target sickened for 1 minute. At 12th level, he can make the target staggered for 1d6+1 rounds. At 16th level, he can permanently blind or deafen the target. At 20th level, he can paralyze the target for 1d6+1 rounds. The monk must choose which condition will apply before the attack roll is made.

			"**Evasion (Ex):** At 2nd level or higher, a monk can avoid damage from many area-effect attacks. If a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.",
			"",
			"**Fast Movement (Ex):** At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to his land speed. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.",

			"",

			"**Ki Pool (Su):** At 4th level, a monk gains a pool of *ki* points, supernatural energy he can use to accomplish amazing feats. The number of points in a monk's *ki* pool is equal to 1/2 his monk level + his Wisdom modifier. As long as he has at least 1 point in his *ki* pool, he can make a *ki* strike. At 4th level, *ki* strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. *Ki* strike improves with the character's monk level. At 7th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as cold iron and silver weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.",
			"",
			"By spending 1 point from his *ki* pool, a monk can make one additional attack at his highest attack bonus when making a flurry of blows attack. In addition, he can spend 1 point to increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round. Finally, a monk can spend 1 point from his *ki* pool to give himself a +4 dodge bonus to AC for 1 round. Each of these powers is activated as a swift action. A monk gains additional powers that consume points from his *ki* pool as he gains levels.",
			"",
			"The *ki* pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"**Slow Fall (Ex):** At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent. When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk's ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.",
			"",
			"**High Jump (Ex):** At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all Acrobatics checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using Acrobatics. By spending 1 point from his *ki* pool as a swift action, a monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks made to jump for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Purity of Body (Ex):** At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.",
			"",
			"**Wholeness of Body (Su):** At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a standard action. He can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his ki pool.",
			"",
			"**Improved Evasion (Ex):** At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.",
			"",
			"**Diamond Body (Su):** At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.",
			"",
			"**Abundant Step (Su):** At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell {spell/dimension door}. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 2 points from his *ki* pool. His caster level for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.",

			"**Diamond Soul (Ex):** At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.",
			"",
			"**Quivering Palm (Su):** Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.",

			"**Timeless Body (Ex):** At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.",

			"",
			"**Empty Body (Su):** At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell *etherealness*. Using this ability is a move action that consumes 3 points from his *ki* pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Self:** At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/chaotic, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if he were a member of his previous creature type.",

			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype. Clerics and wizards can receive a capstone at 20th level, despite not having one to begin with.",
			"",
			"| Capstone | Benefit |",
			"| --- | --- |",
			"| Ki Sage (Su) | At 20th level, the character is fully attuned to his own body and the ki that flows within. The character gains two {ability/ki powers} from those available to the unchained monk, treating his character level as his monk level for the purpose of any requirements. In addition, his ki pool increases by four. This capstone is available to any class with a ki pool. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Old Dog, New Tricks (Ex) | At 20th level, the character shows that a true warrior always has one more surprise the enemy hasn't seen. The character gains four [combat feats](main/feats_combat). This capstone is available to characters of any class that gains at least four bonus combat feats. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Old Master (Ex) | At 20th level, the monk has reached the highest levels of his martial arts school. The monk gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when using flurry of blows, and his dodge bonus to AC increases by 2. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 29](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Perfect Body, Flawless Mind (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's endless training and study has resulted in an unmatched mastery of the self. The character increases her ability scores by a collective total of 8. For example, she can increase one score by 8, or one score by 5 and another by 3, or four scores by 2, and so on. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| The Boss (Ex) | At 20th level, the character has become more than just a lone hero - she has become one of the senior figures of her field, with powers and responsibilities to match. The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 30](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| With This Sword (Ex) | At 20th level, the character's blade has become as well-known as the character herself. The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",
			"| Won't Stay Dead (Ex) | At 20th level, the character becomes a paragon of resilience. Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

			"Experts at charm and deceit, mesmerists compel others to heed their words and bend to their will. Psychic powers, primarily those of enchantment and illusion, give mesmerists the tools they need to manipulate others - usually for their own personal gain. The very gaze of a mesmerist can hypnotize someone into following his whims. Mesmerists frequently form cults of personality around themselves, and they develop skills and contingency plans in case their ploys are discovered. They draw their magic from the Astral Plane, and many consider their minds to be conduits to enigmatic spaces others can't comprehend.",
			"",
			"**Role:** Mesmerists wield power over lesser minds, suppressing foes' wills to weaken them. Priding themselves on their trickery and inventiveness, they also support their allies - and often themselves - with magical tricks, most of which offer protection. Their limited healing ability primarily provides temporary hit points, so mesmerists aren't the strongest primary healers, but they can easily remove conditions that typically affect the mind.  ",

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A mesmerist is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, sap, sword cane, and whip. He is proficient with light armor, but not with shields.",
			"",
			"**Spells:** A mesmerist casts psychic spells drawn from the [mesmerist spell list](main/spells_mesmerist). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a mesmerist must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell's level. The saving throw DC against a mesmerist's spell is 10 + the spell's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"Like other spellcasters, a mesmerist can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. In addition, he receives [bonus spells per day](rule/determine_bonuses) if he has a high Charisma score.",
			"",
			"The mesmerist's selection of spells is limited. A mesmerist begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of the mesmerist's choice. At each new mesmerist level, he learns one or more new spells. Unlike a mesmerist's spells per day, the number of spells a mesmerist knows isn't affected by his Charisma score.",
			"",
			"At 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a mesmerist can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the mesmerist loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least 1 level lower than the highest-level mesmerist spell the mesmerist can cast. A mesmerist can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.",
			"",
			"A mesmerist need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any mesmerist spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Consummate Liar:** A mesmerist adds 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks. In addition, the mesmerist qualifies for the {feat/Improved Feint} and {feat/Greater Feint} feats, even if he doesn't have {feat/Combat Expertise} or an Intelligence score of at least 13. He can also ignore Combat Expertise and an Intelligence score of 13 as prerequisites for other feats that require Improved Feint or Greater Feint.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Stare (Su):** A mesmerist can focus his stare on one creature within 30 feet as a swift action. That creature takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. This penalty changes to -3 at 8th level. A mesmerist can maintain his stare against only one opponent at a time; it remains in effect until the mesmerist stares at a new target, the opponent dies, the opponent moves farther than 30 feet away, or the mesmerist falls unconscious or dies. The mesmerist can remove the memory of his stare from the target's mind; the creature doesn't remember that it was affected (nor does it realize that it is currently being affected) unless the mesmerist allows it. The hypnotic stare is a psychic effect, and relies more on the mesmerist's focus than the target's perception of his stare. It can't be avoided in the same ways a gaze attack can. The mesmerist can use this ability even while blinded, but must succeed at a DC 20 concentration check to do so. Staring at a creature requires the mesmerist's focus, so if he uses a gaze attack or similar ability, he must target the subject of his hypnotic stare or voluntarily end the stare. The penalties from multiple mesmerists' stares don't stack, nor do they stack with penalties from witches' evil eye hexes. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Knacks:** Mesmerists learn a number of knacks, or 0-level spells. These spells are cast like any other spells, but they do not consume any slots and can be used again. Knacks cast using other spell slots, due to metamagic feats, for example, consume spell slots as normal.",
			"",
			"**Mesmerist Tricks (Su):** A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).",
			"",
			"To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it - but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.",
			"",
			"Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.",
			"",
			"The full list of mesmerist tricks is available [here](ability/tricks).",
			"",
			"**Painful Stare (Su):** When an attack that deals damage hits the target of a mesmerist's hypnotic stare, the mesmerist can cause the target to take an amount of additional damage equal to 1/2 the mesmerist's class level (minimum 1). The mesmerist can use this ability as a free action, and can use it even if it isn't his turn. If the mesmerist uses this ability to increase his own damage, the additional damage increases by 1d6 points for every 3 class levels the mesmerist possesses. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. A mesmerist can trigger this ability only once per round, but a single creature can take damage from multiple mesmerists' painful stares in a round.",
			"",
			"**Towering Ego (Su):** At 2nd level, a mesmerist gains a bonus equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum 0) on Will saving throws. If the mesmerist is under any effect that would prevent him from providing the emotional component of psychic spells, he loses this bonus on saving throws.",
			"",
			"**Bold Stare (Su):** At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, a mesmerist's hypnotic stare imposes a further effect upon its target. The mesmerist chooses one option each time he gains a new bold stare improvement, and the choice can't be changed later. The mesmerist can't choose the same bold stare improvement more than once unless otherwise noted. All of the mesmerist's bold stare improvements affect the target as long as it is affected by the mesmerist's hypnotic stare.",
			"",
			"The full list of mesmerist stares is available [here](ability/stares).",
			"",
			"**Touch Treatment (Su):** At 3rd level, the mesmerist can help allies shake off harmful conditions - especially those that affect their minds - by channeling psychic energy through his healing hands. He can use touch treatment a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Using the ability is a standard action (or a swift action if the mesmerist uses it on himself), and the mesmerist must be able to touch his target. He can remove one condition from one target each time he uses this ability. At 3rd level, he can remove any condition on the minor conditions list. At 6th level, he can remove any condition on the minor or moderate conditions list, and at 10th level, he can remove any condition on the minor, moderate, or greater conditions list.",
			"",
			"*Minor Conditions*: Fascinated, shaken.",
			"",
			"*Moderate Conditions*: Confused, dazed, frightened, sickened.",
			"",
			"*Greater Conditions*: Cowering, nauseated, panicked, stunned.",
			"",
			"A 14th level, the mesmerist can instead expend one use of touch treatment to replicate the effects of break enchantment. This targets only one creature the mesmerist is touching and follows all other restrictions of touch treatment.",
			"",
			"**Manifold Tricks (Su):** At 5th level, the mesmerist can have two tricks implanted at a time. The number of concurrent tricks increases by one for every 4 mesmerist levels he possesses beyond 5th. Each creature can still be the subject of only one trick at a time. If the mesmerist implants a new trick while he already has his maximum number of concurrent tricks implanted, he must choose one implanted trick to dismiss without triggering (the dismissed trick still expends a daily use of the mesmerist's tricks).",
			"",
			"**Mental Potency (Ex):** At 5th level, the mesmerist can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal with his mental effects. Both the HD limit and the total number of HD affected with each enchantment or illusion spell he casts increase by 1. For enchantment and illusion spells he casts that target a number of creatures greater than one, the number of creatures affected also increases by one (so a spell that targets one creature per level would be affected, but a spell that targets only one creature would not be). For example, a 5th-level mesmerist could affect 5 HD worth of creatures with *sleep*, affect 2d4+1 HD worth of creatures with *hypnotism*, and change the categories for *color spray* to \"3 HD or fewer,\" \"4 or 5 HD,\" and \"6 or more HD.\" The number of additional HD or creatures increases by an additional 1 for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum increase of 4 at 20th level.",
			"",
			"**Glib Lie (Su):** At 11th level, a mesmerist can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the mesmerist must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the mesmerist's class level to succeed (as if the mesmerist were under the effect of a *glibness* spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the mesmerist's lies or force him to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the mesmerist the *glibness* spell's bonus on Bluff checks.",
			"",
			"**Masterful Tricks (Su):** At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.",
			"",
			"The full list of masterful tricks is available [here](ability/masterful_tricks).",
			"",
			"**Rule Minds (Su):** At 20th level, a mesmerist can permanently mentally enslave a creature. When the mesmerist successfully affects the target of his hypnotic stare with an enchantment spell that requires a saving throw, he can force that creature to attempt a second Will saving throw with a DC equal to the spell's DC. The DC is reduced by 5 if the monster isn't a humanoid. If the creature fails, it becomes a permanent thrall to the mesmerist (as *dominate monster*) until the mesmerist dies. If it succeeds, it can't be affected by rule minds again for 24 hours. A mesmerist can have only one creature enthralled at a time. If he enthralls a new creature, the previous one is set free but is unaware that it was enthralled by the mesmerist.",

			"When a character reaches the 20th level of a class, she gains a powerful class feature or ability, sometimes referred to as a capstone. The following section provides new capstones for characters to select at 20th level. A character can select one of the following capstones in place of the capstone provided by her class. Some capstones are for specific classes, while others are for a range of classes that qualify for them. In some cases, a capstone specifies what ability it replaces. A character can't select a new capstone if she has previously traded away her class capstone via an archetype.

The character becomes one of the leading figures in some manner of group or organization, as appropriate to the campaign and the setting. A wizard might become the dean of an arcane university or mages' guild, a fighter could command a mercenary army or a city guard, a cleric might lead a major temple or her own sect, and so forth. The player and the GM should work together to determine the specifics. The character gains the {feat/Leadership} feat if she does not already have it, and the number of followers that the feat grants is multiplied by 10 (although depending on the campaign and setting, the position may grant other powers as well). If multiple characters in a party select this capstone, the GM may consider pooling them to grant the players a particularly large and powerful organization, such as a small kingdom.

The character selects one item she has - preferably something iconic and significant, such as a weapon or arcane bond. The item becomes a minor artifact and gains 100,000 gp worth of new powers. The player and the GM should work together to select the new powers, with an eye towards making something memorable yet campaign-appropriate. Characters of any class can select this ability. *([Chronicle of Legends pg. 31](source/chronicle_of_legends))* |",

Once per week, if the character is killed, petrified, or otherwise removed from play, the character manages to survive by some dint of skill or luck and returns at the end of the combat or the scene (GM's discretion). The player and the GM should work together to ensure that the method of the character's survival is at least vaguely plausible, if unlikely.
