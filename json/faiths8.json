The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait.

A creature transformed into a clockwork doll becomes mindless, with an Intelligence score of 0. It can't use any supernatural or spell-like abilities it had prior to transforming, nor can it cast spells. It also loses all feats and skill ranks.

This transformation can be reversed only by {spell/break enchantment}, {spell/miracle}, {spell/polymorph any object}, or {spell/wish}. If the clockwork doll is slain, the creature can be brought back to life via {spell/true resurrection}. You can only have one clockwork doll under your command at a time. If you create a second clockwork doll, the first one must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it succeeds, it reverts to its previous form with no memories of the time spent as your clockwork doll, but if it fails this save, the clockwork doll crumbles to rubble and is destroyed.

A creature that remains trapped in Shivaska's chains too long eventually succumbs to their power and is transported, across planes if necessary, to a small cell deep inside Shivaska's clockwork lair in the Abyss. These chains are said to be Shivaska's true form, and the choker body from which they grow is merely the latest of her favored \"shells.\""

Tsukiyo was deeply affected by his death and revival, however, and returned as a god of madness as well as the moon. Shizuru found herself unable to fully understand her lover's transformation, and struggling to easily accept the changes in his personality and perspective. Today, she harbors fears that Tsukiyo might resent her actions, guilt that she might have acted against his interests, and grief that she cannot fully comprehend the person he has become.

			"Sicva finds worshipers in heavy-handed people who delight in controlling others through brute force or mental or social subjugation. Priests of Sicva wear authoritative clothing in various shades of black, gray, and white; these outfits resemble military uniforms more than the cassocks and silk robes worn by clergy of other faiths.",
			"",
			"Worship of Sicva was popular among Azlant's political tyrants and rural despots alike, but the vast majority of her worshipers were ordinary people from all walks of life who were swept up in the pageantry of her services and the constant promise that fortune comes to those who go out and take it. These days, very few people are aware of Sicva and her faith, but tyrants and despots would certainly find her worship to be to their liking. In the modern age, only a few small cults of Sicva remain, scattered across Golarion."

			">3. **Mass Suicide (Sp)** Your influence can drive entire groups of people to acts of self-destruction. You can cast {spell/weird} once per day as a spell-like ability. Rather than assaulting the victims with images of fear, this ability assaults the targets with images and sensations of crippling sadness and despair. Those who succumb to the spell and die do so at their own hands. If no method of suicide is available for one who falls prey to this effect, the victim simply dies outright of sadness.

You can cast {spell/phantasmal killer} three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life.

Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts.

Sobek's temples are almost always situated on riverbanks, and are rarely found more than a few miles from a river. The crocodiles living in the neighboring rivers are exalted by the priesthood and the faithful as the direct offspring of the god, or are even seen as living incarnations of Sobek himself. Most of his temples contain pools holding crocodiles sacred to Sobek, and their regular feeding is incorporated into worship.

Certainly very few can (or are willing to) say who the previous Horseman of War was, though it is widely told that Szuriel slew him at the summit of the Cinder Furnace, elevating her to her current status and granting her a reputation that discourages any rivals within her ranks.",

With ivory skin, flowing golden hair, a flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of immaculate silk, and the wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high - an awe-inspiring goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel's eyes bleed constantly, with rivulets of blood running down her cheeks and falling to the ground, leaving behind the twin trails of crimson. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth full of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more fitting for a shark or dragon than anything humanoid."

Yet the Green Mother is not merely a creature of lust. Rather, she is the seduction of nature incarnate, the caution to the unwary. She is the rolling landscape that calls to the wanderer, the primal need that leads salmon to spawn and die, the mantis gnawing on the corpse of her mate. She is both the flower's bloom and the inevitable death that follows. To attempt to define her via mortal concepts of morality is to miss the point entirely.",

Yet as the Pale Horse grew fat off mortal suffering, he also grew discontent. The pressures of freedom, the burden of leadership, and the weight of every choice shackled his heart and soured his meals. In a moment of weakness, he faltered in his daemonic nature and sought service. Pharasma offered the Pale Horse respite until he saved half again as many souls as he had damned. The Pale Horse prostrated himself before the Lady of Graves and wept in joy, freed now from his burden of choice.",

			"The Pale Horse has since become Pharasma's avenging angel, hunting those who steal from the River of Souls as he once did. He luxuriates in his duties and obeys the tenants set forth by Pharasma, and his soldiers likewise obey without question. He represents both the pain and the bounty in servitude, guiding both those who die in service and those who die unattended and alone thanks to their own miserable choices. His wrath is legendary, especially in regard to {family/daemon/s}, and Abaddon long ago struck the Lash and the Plough's true name from its monuments and libraries. Despite his apparent loyalty, some among the psychopomps worry the Pale Horse remains a daemon at his core, and that upon completion of his sentence he will visit an equally terrible vengeance upon the Boneyard.",

			"The Pale Horse appears as a powerful white stallion, missing its head save for a disembodied skull and a floating crown of flames, though he sometimes appears as a silent rider on a white horse. His home, Abatory, is a desolate stretch of the Graveyard of Souls that resembles the perpetual gloom of Abaddon, save that silent vanths that lurk above the walls and hills."

			"Torag is an ancient god, and his dwarven followers credit him with the creation of the world at his great forge, striking his new work again and again with his hammer to get the shape he desired. As the rocks tumbled and the sparks flew, the dwarves were born - beings made of stone and with bellies full of fire. Even with setbacks over the millennia, under his stern eye the dwarves found prosperity. Torag is a hard and proud patriarch, a distant but loving father. Though every dwarf who falls in battle pains his heart, he keeps his eye on the future and the countless dwarven lives extending forward into eternity, like golden links in a mighty coat of mail. He is often thought of as a purely dwarven god, yet continues to gain traction among humans.",
			"",
			"Torag loves the dwarven race, and has come to love his non-dwarven worshipers, but withholds most direct aid and affection from both, for he sees life as a hard journey, and if he sheltered his children from all hardship, they would not know the value of their own hard work or the satisfaction of their achievements. He created the dwarves to be tough, stubborn, wise, and creative - traits they would need to persevere and overcome all obstacles - and expects all his worshipers of all races and walks of life to seek to embody those traits. He opposes those who act without thinking, rebel, or place their community at risk.",
			"",
			"As god of the forge, the Father of Creation concerns himself with the art of creating and shaping metal. He believes that shoddy workmanship insults not only the crafter and the wielder of a tool or weapon, but the item itself, and pushes his followers to continually refine and improve their craft.",
			"",
			"When Torag appears to his worshipers, he's an older but hearty dwarf clad in heavy plate armor, with eyes glowing like molten gold. His hair and beard may be any common dwarven hair color, often with streaks of gray, and his hands are worn and scarred from centuries of hard work. He exudes a palpable aura of power, wisdom, and safety. In art, he's always depicted in intricate armor, and typically shown busy at his forge hammering out a weapon or shield. Some images depict him as a mighty guardian, shielding dwarven children with his body as he clears away orcs and trolls with mighty sweeps of his warhammer *Kaglemros.*"

In a fit of rage, Fumeiyoshi murdered Tsukiyo, cutting a wound so deep that it left the moon forever scarred. Unwilling to accept her lover's death, Shizuru convinced {faith/Qi Zhong} to ply his greatest medicines undo death itself, and three nights later, life returned to the fallen god. For Fumeiyoshi's crime of fratricide and deicide, the other gods condemned him to live within his brother's grave, from which he would always envy his betters.",

His personality changes gradually over time, ranging from coolly judgmental to brimming with quiet compassion. Despite occasional outbursts of passion, Tsukiyo is reclusive and even shy. This predilection shapes his divine undertakings; he rarely participates in monumental affairs, but he doesn't hesitate to connect with individual mortals to offer silent support in times of need. Despite his reserved demeanor, he is an unshakable advocate for the frightened, the lost, and the misunderstood - particularly those maligned by society for thinking or perceiving the world differently from their neighbors. Though this often takes him away from the light of mainstream civilization and the sun, his lover Shizuru seems to understand and provide him space, so that both can combat injustice in their own ways.",

			"Tsukiyo appears in art far less frequently than Shizuru, but when he does, it is as a Tian-Min man with long silver hair and a peaceful, understanding smile. His age often changes in symbolic reflection of the moon's phases. His green robes seem woven from flexible jade, and he wields a spear crafted from spun moonlight."

			"Urgathoa is an utterly amoral, hedonistic goddess, concerned only with satiating her own desires regardless of the consequences others suffer. Like {faith/Desna}, she strives for experience and a full appreciation of the world - but her appreciation is utterly selfish. She was once a mortal woman with a tremendous appetite for life, one who rebelled against the notion of being judged by {faith/Pharasma} and losing the joys of living. Somehow in death she found the strength to tear herself from Pharasma's endless line of souls and return to Golarion, becoming a divine being and the world's first undead creature. Her existence is a corruption of the natural order; some say her first divine footprints upon the soil of the Material Plane birthed plague and infection, and that the first {monster/shadow/s} and {monster/wraith/s} were born of her breath.",
			"",
			"The goddess's half-rotted form limits the sensations she can experience, so she makes up for this lack with gluttonous depravity - she's tasted the brains of human infants to savor their innocence, torn the heart from the last living member of a race just to feel the sensation of its hot blood on her hands, and inflicted boils and leprosy upon handsome princes just to see the unique patterns they form on royal flesh. To her, the dull existence of a dead soul is pointless and tedious compared to the vibrant intensity of mortal or undead sensation, and creatures should cram as much sensation into existence as possible. Asceticism is repugnant to her, and she particularly loathes those who follow the strict taboos of {eq-misc/the Prophecies of Kalistrade}.",
			"",
			"Urgathoa is usually depicted as a beautiful, raven-haired woman from the waist up - much like her mortal self, though she's as pale as a hungry vampire. Her lower half is rotted and withered, decaying farther down until only blood-covered bones remain at her feet. When she walks, she leaves bloody, skeletal footprints. Although she sometimes manifests nude in the faithful's visions, she usually appears wearing a sheer red or black gown. From neck to toe, the gown is stained with hideous patches of black, brown, and red. On rare occasions, she assumes a monstrous shape similar to those of the hideous undead creatures known as {monster/daughter[s] of Urgathoa}, with one huge arm covered in fanged mouths and a tail made of multiple fused spinal columns.",
