			"In folklore, a major part of any magic item's mystique is the tale of its creation. With the dynamic magic item creation system, the crafting of magic items becomes a quick but interesting story in which the whole party can participate. Items created in this way have unusual properties that lend them character and remind the PCs of the choices they made during item creation.",
			"",
			"Along with adding flavor to the crafting of magic items, this system changes the average cost of magic item creation to be variable - generally more expensive for a single creator, and possibly less expensive for a group that works together. The standard system for the creation of magic items presented in the Core Rulebook leads to automatic successes during crafting, and given enough days of downtime, it can lead to a wild power imbalance between PCs who opt into the crafting system and all other characters. The system presented here encourages characters to work together to play out the story of the item's creation while also adding unique touches to the resulting item.",

The owner must concentrate on receiving this information instead of her own visual or auditory information as a standard action to gain this benefit, and the effect becomes inert while she isn't concentrating. Determine randomly upon the item's creation whether the item relays visual or auditory information.",

			"A handful of hard-to-find, naturally occurring substances contain magical potency and can be used as special material components. Some spellcasters are trained to use these esoteric material components in their enhanced practice of the magical arts. The four more common types - entropic resin, geodes, prismatic sand, and verdant salts - link to two schools of magic each. A fifth type, yliaster, is extremely potent, but far more rare; it is universally useful, and can be substituted for any other material component.",
			"",

			"***Component Cost:*** The value of esoteric material components that must be spent on a spell is equal to 1 gp &times; caster level &times; spell level, as shown on Table 4-7: Esoteric Material Component Costs. This value must be spent if esoteric components are mandatory in the campaign, or can be spent to replace normal material components if esoteric material components are optional.",
			"",
			"***Expending Components:*** Each component works effectively for only two schools of magic. A caster can expend an esoteric component type that doesn't match his spell's school, but he must expend twice as much of the substitute component to fake the effects of the appropriate component. The esoteric components used in a spell need not all be of the same type. For example, a 3rd-level wizard casting {spell/bear's endurance} could expend 6 gp worth of geodes, or 12 gp total worth of entropic resin and verdant salts, or 4 gp worth of geodes plus 4 gp worth of verdant salts, and so on.",
			"",
			"***Greater Component Effects:*** Expending twice the amount of components indicated on Table 4-7 activates a greater component effect, which varies by esoteric component type. These benefits are listed under the component descriptions at the end of the section, and depend on the component expended. To obtain the greater component benefit, the caster must use a single component type; using a type that doesn't match the spell's school still costs twice as much. The wizard in the above example could gain the geodes' greater component benefit by expending an extra 6 gp worth of geodes, or gain the verdant salts' greater component benefit by expending an extra 12 gp worth of verdant salts. A single casting of a spell can normally benefit from only one greater component effect, but the caster can expend additional components and attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + double the spell's level to add more. The caster must pay the cost in esoteric components even if the Spellcraft check fails. For each greater component effect beyond the second, the DC increases by 5 + the spell's level. If the caster fails this check by 5 or more, the spell fails and its slot is lost. You can't apply the greater component effect of a single type of component more than once on a single casting of a spell.",

			"Over the course of an adventuring day, a spellcaster can scrounge for esoteric components in her environment. At the end of each day, she can collect 1d6 gp worth of each common esoteric component. (Rare components can never be found by scrounging.) This requires her to explore a decent-sized area. Spending several days in one town or repeatedly going through the same few rooms in a dungeon doesn't yield more than 1 day's worth of components. Depending on the likelihood of finding a type of component in an area, the GM can adjust the die size up or down by one. For instance, while exploring caverns, a scrounger might find 1d8 gp worth of geodes, but only 1d4 gp worth of verdant salts. A scrounger can hunt exclusively for a specific type of common esoteric component. Because esoteric components are naturally occurring, she must succeed at a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) check or come up empty-handed. If she succeeds, she gains 2d6 gp worth of the component she was searching for and none of the others."

A GM can change the descriptions of these components to different substances that better fit her game if she so chooses. The rare component could be a catch-all for a number of equally potent magical substances. The blood of a god, a sliver of stone from deep in the earth, or a piece of ethereal substance made solid could each be used as the rare component, even within the same campaign.",
			"",
			"Each entry includes the associated schools, a description of the esoteric component type, the greater component effect, and the limited magic effect. The limited magic effect entry applies only if the campaign is also using the {rule/limited magic/ system}.",

			"### Entropic Resin",
			"",
			"***Associated Schools*** evocation, necromancy",
			"",
			"This slightly viscous, pearlescent gray-black substance is most commonly stored in small vials, jars, and bottles. It's most frequently found at sites of carnage and places where undead creatures dwell. Locations where multiple creatures died from flames, acid, or lightning are excellent potential sources of entropic resin. It seems to be organic in nature, or at least formed of trace substances from the bodies of organic life forms, though there is some debate on the issue among necromantic scholars.",
			"",
			"Unrefined entropic resin is potent, but can still be distilled and refined. The more it's refined, the darker and more solid it becomes. The most potent entropic resin is pitch black and snaps if bent.",
			"",
			"***Greater Component Effect:*** Treat your caster level as though it were 1 higher for determining the number of damage dice used by this spell. This also increases the maximum number of damage dice a spell can have by 1, if applicable. For example, a 10th-level wizard casting {spell/fireball} could expend 60 gp worth of entropic resin to deal 11d6 points of fire damage.",
			"",

			"",
			"### Geodes",
			"",
			"***Associated Schools*** abjuration, transmutation",
			"",
			"Geodes are loose, spheroid, rocklike structures found within flows of lava rock, areas of upheaval, and places associated with earth and fire elementals. Often mistaken for simple rocks due to their nondescript coating, geodes are hollow with various crystal formations hidden within. Formed from molten rock and exotic trapped gases that turn into crystals, geodes can have innate properties that help extend perceptions and pierce barriers, both astral and physical.",
			"",
			"Small or crudely worked geode fragments or nodes are more than potent enough to be used with low-level spells, but for more complex spells, it's more efficient for the geodes to be cleansed, cut, and worked into a more refined state.",
			"",
			"***Greater Component Effect:*** Treat your caster level as though it were 2 higher for determining the duration of this spell.",
			"",
			"***Limited Magic Effect:*** Use your full caster level instead of the minimum for determining the duration of the spell.",
			"",
			"### Prismatic Sand",
			"",
			"***Associated Schools*** conjuration, illusion",
			"",
			"Made of incredibly tiny polyhedrons, prismatic sand reflects a rainbow of colors. Most commonly found by sifting sand from warm beaches, this substance appears to be normal glass cut into very specific multifaceted shapes. Due to the substance's apparent mundanity, spellcasters frequently try to manufacture it, but so far no attempt has been successful. When gathered in enough quantity, typically 2 ounces or so, prismatic sand takes on a rainbow sheen across its surface.",
			"",
			"To make prismatic sand more effective, it must be carefully separated from the normal sand it's typically mixed with - it functions much better when pure. Prismatic sand also works better when treated with cleansing chemicals, polished, and shined with a variety of specialized cloths and materials. Individual grains come in all variety of prismatic shapes, and the more sides a grain has, the better its mirrored surface captures light. The most intricate grains bend, manipulate, and split light into a dazzling spectrum.",
			"",
			"***Greater Component Effect:*** You can either treat your caster level as though it were 4 higher for determining the range of the spell, or increase or decrease the spell's area of effect by 5 feet if it's a burst, emanation, line, or spread with a radius or length of at least 20 feet.",

			"### Verdant Salts",
			"",
			"***Associated Schools*** divination, enchantment",
			"",
			"Verdant salts are found upon the dried, post-flowering pods of a common plant used in making textiles. The salt gathers on the plant only on dewy mornings following a full moon. Consuming verdant salts alters perceptions, and is said to improve the eater's health. Grazing animals drawn to the salty taste frequently eat the crystals, so following deer or livestock that exhibit erratic behavior can lead a spellcaster to fields where verdant salts can be found.",
			"",
			"Raw verdant salts can be dissolved, refined, and processed into more complex salt crystals or solid rods of compressed salt. Such refinements take time, and require special training in order for a wizard, alchemist, or craftsperson to produce properly.",

			"***Greater Component Effect:*** Increase the DC of any saving throw, skill check, or ability check an enemy must attempt due to this spell by 1.",
			"",
			"***Limited Magic Effect:*** The saving throw DC of the spell equals the base DC + 3, or 10 + the spell's level + your spellcasting ability modifier, whichever is lower.",
			"",
			"### Yliaster (Rare Component)",
			"",
			"***Associated Schools*** All",
			"",
			"The rare substance yliaster is the universal esoteric component, and has the same effect and price no matter the school of the spell it's used on. It can even be substituted for an equivalent value of an expensive material component - 5,000 gp worth of yliaster could be used to cast {spell/raise dead} without a diamond worth 5,000 gp, for example. Yliaster is a claylike material found in small clods typically no bigger than a berry or thimble. It's remarkably light, seems to be composed of many colors, and does not crumble or compress in the same fashion as normal clay or soil.",
			"",
			"A spell cast using yliaster can't also benefit from common esoteric components.",
			"",
			"***Greater Component Effect:*** Increase the DC of any saving throw, skill check, or ability check an enemy must attempt due to this spell by 1. In addition, treat your caster level as though it were 2 higher for this spell. This increase can also raise the maximum damage dice of the spell beyond its limit. For example, a 10th-level wizard casting {spell/fireball} could expend 600 gp worth of yliaster to cast it at CL 12th and deal 12d6 points of fire damage. This bonus also applies on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance and on {rule/concentration} checks while casting the spell.",
			"",
			"***Price:*** Unlike with other esoteric components, the required amount of yliaster doesn't vary with caster level. The cost of using yliaster is always 200 gp per spell level. Yliaster is even lighter than common components, weighing 1 pound per 2,000 gp of value. Few people, even experienced spellcasters, are able to find yliaster easily. Treat it as though it were a major magic item for the purposes of [determining its availability](rule/purchasing_magic_items). It's typically sold in pieces worth 1,000 gp (five castings of a 1st-level spell), or multiples of 1,000 gp for larger pieces."

For a staff or wand, the creator must make the same decision for all castings of a particular spell and pay the full price for each. He can't make a wand with 30 charges of {spell/cure light wounds} and 20 charges of {spell/cure light wounds} with the greater component effect, but can spend an additional 100 gp to give all the charges the greater component effect (for a CL 1st wand). In a game that uses mandatory components, magic item crafting becomes much more expensive since each casting of the spell requires spending components. A {spell/wand of |burning hands} would cost a minimum of 800 gp (750 gp + 1 gp per charge)."

Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",

To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a {magic-wondrous/bag of holding>_type_1}, for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",

For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",

			"***Fading Glory:*** When the PCs discover a relic, the power of the item has faded significantly since it has gone many years without being used for its cause. In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there. This can vary by item and is ultimately determined by the GM, but a good benchmark is one triumph entry lost per 1d4 years."

Prepare these spells each day as you normally would; you still gain bonus spells per day for those levels if you have a high enough ability score.
