A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs).

When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor - the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty.",
			"",
			"Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs."

If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean skeleton and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the target's outward features, which contribute to the ooze's primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.",

			"This small, carnivorous stinging nettle commonly grows in mires. It preys mostly on amphibians, fish, and small mammals, though they have been known to attack and kill much larger prey, especially when hunting in groups. Mire nettles are infamous for their hollow, needlelike thorns, which contain a natural toxin that causes extreme pain. While not lethal in and of itself, the pain caused by the toxins is intensely overwhelming.",
			"",
			"Those who are actively on the lookout can attempt a DC 12 Knowledge (nature) check to identify them by their triangular, jagged-edged leaves.",
			"",
			"While most consider mire nettles a nuisance, certain humanoids make use of them. Some cultivate the plants to mark territorial boundaries, while others repurpose the toxic thorns to make blowgun darts or use them in snares or traps. A few tribes incorporate them for rituals in which young members of the tribe must endure hours of pain from the nettle's toxin as a rite of passage into adulthood. A creature can harvest 1d4 doses of mire nettle toxin from a freshly slain plant with a successful DC 20 Survival check. Mire nettle toxin retains its potency for 6 hours after the plant's death, but certain alchemical processes (requiring a successful DC 20 Craft [alchemy] check, 30 minutes of work, and the expenditure of 50 gp of reagents per dose) can extend the potency of the toxin to 1 week."

			"",
			"**Scrying Focus (Su)** Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.",

			"",
			"At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults - usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.",
			"",
			"While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their lookingglass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however: any caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga - a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.",
			"",
			"There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents are large snakelike beasts that soar as easily through air as they do water. Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to guard their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, mirror serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, mirror serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn't resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving mirror serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to guard. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. Mirror serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Mirror serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.",
			"",
			"A mirror serpent's body stretches out to a length of 15 feet and weighs 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike most other creatures, mirror serpents don't permanently die unless their remains are purposefully destroyed to prevent rebirth. Each mirror serpent carries within its body an egg that holds the seed of its next life and matures along with its natural aging. If a mirror serpent dies prematurely, the egg within it simply decays along with the rest of the creature's internal organs. When a mirror serpent dies of natural causes, however, its soft tissue is absorbed into the egg as a final act of fertilization, leaving the egg amid the hollow husk of the serpent's reflective skin. Water is the most ideal location for the egg's 13-month incubation to take place, and thus when dying, most mirror serpents head for the nearest large body of water. The egg has an exceptionally hard, crystalline shell that protects it from predatory fauna and other dangers while it incubates. Additionally, shortly after an egg is fertilized, it becomes naturally invisible as a defense mechanism. If the egg remains intact, it eventually hatches, releasing a young mirror serpent into its predecessor's territory. While the newborn mirror serpent has its own personality, some echoes remain of the previous incarnation, such as intuitions on safe and dangerous areas nearby and an instinctual gravitation toward its old lair.",
			"",
			"While mirror serpents resemble snakes in many regards, their snouts are elongated and toothy, like the face of a gharial, and pair of crystalline horns crowns their brows. The reflective sheen of a mirror serpent's scales can be quite dazzling in bright sunlight as it dives into or leaps out of water, chasing birds and fish with equal prowess. The structure of a mirror serpent's scales resembles that of actual glazed mirrors, making the creatures vulnerable to sonic attacks. Mirror serpent flesh is hardy and resembles cloudy glass, and they bleed slightly luminescent blue liquid when they're wounded.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents' primary diet consists of amphibian and avian animals that live in or near their territories, though they are typically not opposed to eating those humanoids foolish enough to blunder into their domains, especially if the mirror serpent guards treasure of particular power, secrecy, or value. These serpents rarely fight to the death unless they feel there's no other choice. One function of their hunting is to keep major predators away from their territory so that when the mirror serpent dies, its egg has a better chance of surviving its incubation period. Mirror serpents use their natural invisibility when investigating whether creatures are food or a threat. When they choose to fight, mirror serpents make sudden attacks and retreats, turning invisible in order to hide their movements and strike from a new vantage point. They use their savage bites to separate their foes and attempt to fling them into water, where the serpents can take advantage of their superior mobility.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most mirror serpents lair near or within ancient Azlanti ruins so they can seek out and collect treasures and trinkets that lie forgotten among Earthfall's devastation. Each lair is usually located near a body of water, and its opening is most likely overlooking or hiding below the water's surface. A common place for a den is on the side of a natural cliff or a part of a ruined tower that has no other access points. Even when the entrance is below the surface, the actual living area is situated above water level. When in their lairs, mirror serpents lie curled in the center, while their treasure is spread against the surrounding walls. Not all of the treasure - or even most of it - is of actual monetary value, since items need only to gleam and be beautiful to catch the attention of the serpents. Mirrored scales, or even a complete husk, are often found among the piled treasure as the newest incarnation has dragged the glittering remains of the previous mirror serpent into the lair.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents hate creatures that defile nature or deface structures within their domain, causing them to become violent from the outset. It's possible to communicate with mirror serpents by speaking Azlanti; the knowledge of that language was imbued in the creatures during the ritual of their creation and remains with them through each rebirth. Once a person has entered the territory of a mirror serpent, there's a small window of opportunity to speak up in order to keep it from attacking and driving the intruder away. An offering of treasure or ornate trinkets goes a long way toward appeasing a mirror serpent to allow swift safe passage through its domain. If the territories of two mirror serpents are adjacent to each other, minor clashes may arise between the two beasts. Such fights rarely lead to death, as one them eventually yields to the more powerful rival, accepting defeat over endangering even its greatest enemy's cycle of rebirth.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpent scales are a valued material for those who craft magical armor. With proper techniques, it's possible to forge a suit of scale mail that retains a portion of the spell-reflecting ability that mirror serpents have. If a person comes upon a mirror serpent egg, she can attempt to train the newly hatched serpent and turn it into a guardian or a companion. However, the echoes of lifetimes it has spent free in the wild make this a challenge."

The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or \"mockingdells,\" inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage.

This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey!",
			"",
			"Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle - if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar.",

			"",

Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life's work of slaughter and murder as best they can.",
			"",
			"Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society's dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg's attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg's control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.",

			"{SOURCE Undead Revisited/31}  ",
			"A mohrg is as much a product of the method of its execution as it is an undead manifestation of one who, in life, was a murderous criminal or warmonger. At times, unusual methods of execution can trigger equally unusual mohrgs. The extreme nature of these executions are such that these variant mohrgs are only rarely created by accident; more often, they are deliberate creations by officials who themselves dabble in necromancy and may in fact be as vile as those they put to death.",
			"",
			"**Desert Mohrg (+0 CR):** A desert mohrg rises from a violent criminal who has been executed via torturous means in arid, hot environments, typically methods designed to kill through exposure and draw out the criminal's expiration. Being affixed to a rock, tree, or other object and being buried up to the neck and left to bake in the sun are both methods that can result in the creation of desert mohrgs. A desert mohrg looks leathery and dry, not moist, but has the same statistics as a typical mohrg. Spawn created by a desert mohrg rise as {template/burning |skeleton/s} rather than fast zombies.",
			"",
			"**Fleshwalker Mohrg (+0 CR):** When a criminal is executed through methods that leave no physical mark upon the body (such as by poison or a death effect), and then the corpse is preserved via a {spell/gentle repose} spell, a fleshwalker mohrg is the result. While these mohrgs function as normal mohrgs, their flesh does not decay; further castings of gentle repose are unnecessary. Only upon close inspection (whereupon one might notice a faint underlying charnel stench, or might note the lack of breathing with a DC 30 Perception check) or in combat (when the creature's hideous tongue extrudes from its mouth) is the truth apparent.",
			"",
			"**Frost Mohrg (+1 CR):** Distinctive for the icy sheen over the blue flesh of its innards and tendrils, a frost mohrg's genesis is similar to that of a desert mohrg - a violent criminal that is executed via lingering exposure to the elements, only in this case, in a cold environment. Frost mohrgs look partially frozen and retain much of their flesh, albeit flesh blackened by frostbite. A frost mohrg has the {template/advanced} creature simple template, and its attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit.",
			"",
			"**Mohrg-mother (+1 CR):** Perhaps among the most perverse category of mohrg arises when the executed murderer is also pregnant with child. The unborn, undead infants of these nightmarish monsters cling to the exposed entrails of the mohrg, but do not grant any additional powers. All mohrg-mothers always have the {template/advanced} creature simple template. Once per day, a mohrg-mother can choose to animate a recently slain victim as another mohrg instead of as a fast zombie."

			"A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing, aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind.",

			"### Slugspawn (CR 5)",
			"",
			"Bloated alien worms the length of a man's forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub-Niggurath. These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them.",
			"",
			"Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation.",
			"",
			"Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host - but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host.",
			"",
			"After a slugspawn has reached a host's brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn's host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body - a near-instantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured - though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren."

All raths defend themselves with powerful kicks and spurs on their hind legs that are coated with burning venom.",

A healthy mome rath is up to 6 feet long including its muscular tail, and weighs around 100 pounds."

			"**Cockroach Cloud (Su)** As a swift action, a morgodea can open its layered hide and expel a brood of cockroaches into all adjacent squares. This cloud moves with the morgodea. Creatures other than morgodeas and cockroaches within the cloud at the beginning of their turns take 1d6 points of damage. Any creature damaged by the cockroach cloud must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be exposed to a dose of morgod jelly. Area-effect attacks that deal 10 or more points of damage to the morgodea destroy its cockroach cloud for 3 rounds, after which a new brood matures and the morgodea can unleash its cloud again. When a morgodea dies, its brood disperses.",
			"",
			"**Cockroach Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on cockroaches. A morgodea gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+6 for most morgodeas). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts a modicum of implanted intelligence in them, allowing the morgodea to train cockroaches and giant cockroaches and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats). Cockroaches and giant cockroaches never attack a morgodea unless magically compelled to do so.",
			"",
			"**Morgod Jelly (Ex)** Morgodeas produce a pale, clear jelly from their bodies that acts as a powerful and addictive hallucinogenic (see below). Creatures unwillingly exposed to morgod jelly can resist its effects with a successful DC 15 Fortitude save. The save DC for a morgodea's jelly is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Sickening Impulse (Su)** A morgodea can stir the morgod jelly in an addict's system. As a standard action, it can place an impulse into the mind of a single creature suffering from morgod jelly addiction within 60 feet. This functions as per the command spell, but the morgodea and its target do not need to hear or understand one another. Alternatively, the morgodea can inspire visions of insects crawling under the target's skin, sickening the target for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 15 Will save negates either effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Morgodeas are sinister syntheses of fey and vermin who lurk in the filthy underworlds of cities. Compelled to corrupt and debase, these disgusting creatures deal in a pleasure that can plunge their victims into the depths addiction and madness. Morgodeas appear as human or elven vagrants covered in dirty rags. These \"rags\" are actually layered flaps of hide the morgodea can open to reveal a brood of cockroaches crawling amid its waxy, yellow flesh. Large pores in its body constantly weep a pale, thick jelly that sustains its nest of vermin and inspires euphoric visions in humanoids.",
			"",
			"In combat, a morgodea's cockroach brood erupts into a flesh-eating cloud to defend their master. The fey itself can extend a hidden chitinous pincer from its abdomen, and needlelike stings from the palm of each hand. It uses its massive claw to restrain victims while it injects them with its addictive venom again and again. A victim caught in this way is overwhelmed by the morgodea's druglike poison, and the prey's consequent hallucinations render its attacker indistinguishable in the teeming mass of hissing, gel-smeared insects, even as the morgodea holds it in place. A morgodea stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas originated in the First World, where they once cleaned the filth and refuse from the Eldests' glittering cities. Some ancestral crime corrupted their entire bloodline, and saw their people banished to the Material Plane, where their bodies twisted and warped to mirror their foul, covetous hearts. They can eat any sort of rotting organic matter, but prefer the flesh of humanoid creatures rendered comatose by their addictive jelly. These awful monsters keep such victims alive as long as possible, carefully consuming only those parts of their victims' bodies that will not necessarily kill the prey. The addict's brain is the foremost delicacy, and saved for a final feast.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas reproduce by inserting a single egg into a comatose addict. Within days, the egg develops into a larva, which burrows its way into the brain and consumes it, and then begins to merge with the brainless body. Throughout this time, the parent keeps its young hidden away in a foul place, while the body emits a pheromone to attract cockroaches from the surrounding area to inhabit the corpse-laying eggs and multiplying by the hundreds-while feeding from the jelly produced by the growing larva. After 4 weeks, the body reawakens as an adult morgodea, already host to a large swarm of the insects and covered in porous, waxy flesh that weeps its own supply of morgod jelly.",
			"",
			"Despite this transmutation, the victim's face remains recognizable, resulting in mistaken sightings of missing people. Occasionally, individuals searching for down-and-out friends and family members instead find themselves the monsters' latest victims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Morgodeas are strongly attracted to sprawling urban areas, where they nestle against the dark underbelly of civilization. Such settlements must be large enough to provide a level of anonymity to their inhabitants. Morgodeas' secret infestation of cities is like a foul disease creeping through the bloodstream to infect the vital organs of society. An infestation begins with a lone morgodea claiming a lair - often an abandoned building or sewer - and clearing the surrounding area of other predators before it begins selling the dubious pleasures of its jelly to the desperate and demented. Soon thereafter, the monster's growing number of thralls secure its place in the underworld and bring it rotting meats and fruits, strong alcohols, and sugary sweets in payment. Eventually, those overwhelmed by addiction slip into a nightmare-filled coma before becoming a meal or a newborn morgodea.",
			"",
			"A morgodea's nest slowly grows alongside its influence and stock of customers. A full infestation of morgodeas rarely contains more than five or six of the creatures, and even then, only the largest of cities and metropolises that can sustain such numbers without rapid detection of the nest. Morgodeas in excess of this number leave the nest to seek out new settlements to infest, or else are devoured by their own families long before they gestate from their larval states.",

Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these ancestors as their gods.

The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully mothered to prevent attrition - it usually takes that long for the morlock young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60 - although the majority of their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.",

As they don't venerate deities, these morlocks do not have access to cleric domains and most often take levels in oracle and shaman, with witches filling in as arcane servants of their tribes' ancestors in rare cases. Because morlocks have severe racial penalties to Charisma, many of their spiritual leaders are actually ancestor-touched morlocks, possessing a preternatural presence that makes them effective divine spellcasters.",
			"",

Believing themselves to be mouthpieces for their ancestors, such morlocks are actually the reincarnated souls of the very ancestors they worship. These ancestor-touched morlocks gain a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and can cast cure light wounds or inflict light wounds (select one) three times per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the morlock's HD).

Angheuvore mortics, or \"half-ghouls,\" are lanky, pallid creatures with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They have the long ears and featureless, dark eyes characteristic of elves but have a larger jaw filled with sharp teeth. Born from elven parents afflicted with {disease/ghoul fever} or otherwise subjected to necromantic energies, angheuvores are often shunned as children due to their appetites. They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these \"larders\" live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.",

Unlike elves, angheuvores aren't particularly patient and don't take any particular care to live in harmony with their surroundings.",

			"Angheuvores and ghouls get along reasonably well, and they often share hunting territory or even coexist in the same isolated communities. Angheuvores enjoy the elven immunity to the ghouls' paralyzing toxin, but angheuvores are as susceptible to ghoul fever as any other humanoid, and can become infected via infighting or even by sharing food. An angheuvore who dies from ghoul fever always putrefies and rises as a ghast. These ghasts retain their memories and any class levels acquired by the angheuvore; the transition from living to undead is not as jarring a step for an angheuvore.",

The struggle to maintain themselves can be overwhelming, and those who don't succumb to mania are often aggressive and irritable instead.

This ethereal state silences the mania bubbling from within and allows the crushing bleachling depression to flow over them, providing painful respite from their energetic lives.

Even those who take up residence in permanent structures find their magic and unwanted followers transforming any dwelling into an overgrown ruin within weeks.

If the gurgist ends her movement adjacent to an enemy, that enemy is flat-footed against the gurgist until the beginning of the gurgist's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Obsession Skill (Ex)** Every gurgist has some hobby or activity or skill she uses to keep the hunger away, and which she swiftly masters.

That skill is a class skill for the gurgist. She gains {feat/Skill Focus} and {feat/Signature Skill} as bonus feats for this chosen skill, and she can reroll a failed check with her obsession skill once per day. This gurgist has chosen Craft (leatherworking) as her obsession skill.",
			"",
			"**Rotting Flesh (Su)** Gurgists are forever slowly rotting, their flesh growing soft and discolored and eventually sloughing off in rancid slabs. The only way a gurgist can arrest this decay is to consume raw meat. A gurgist begins to rot if she goes more than 1 week without eating roughly 10% of her body weight in raw meat. After 1 week, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage and 1 point of Charisma damage each day until she can feed. This damage cannot be healed until the gurgist has fed. A {spell/gentle repose} spell extends the amount of time a gurgist can go without feeding for the duration of the spell.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A gurgist {subtype/mortic} is a keen mind trapped within a rotting, hungering body. Gurgists can feel the decay of their flesh, just as they can feel the urgings of their gullet to rend and consume meat until they bloat with it. But unlike zombies and other carnivorous undead, mortics still have their wits about them and use their minds to find solutions to their nature. They hunt and herd to keep the rot at bay, they obsess over crafts or skills to distract from the hunger, and they wear extravagant masks and colorful garments to hide their hideousness.",
			"",
			"Gurgists are the same size as humans, averaging 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall, and weighing about 160 pounds.",
			"",
			"Gurgists are among the more common mortics, created whenever a human being is afflicted with a little too much negative energy. A {template/zombie/'s} bite will do the trick, but so too will a {monster/mummy/'s} curse or a necromancer's enchantment, giving rise to a metaphysical anomaly that causes the gurgist's body to think itself dead and free to rot. The body first grows pale, and then develops purple-red splotches on its skin as the blood stills and stagnates. If the gurgist isn't careful, her flesh then grows gray or waxy and begins to rot, with hideous sores opening. A gurgist who allows this to persist will eventually see large parts of her body liquefy, which usually proves fatal to the gurgist in question.",
			"",
			"The only way for a gurgist to stop the process is to eat raw meat - the more, the better. Through some occult means, the gurgist's half-dead biology then repairs itself and can even reverse smaller changes. A recently fed gurgist can mostly pass for a human, albeit a pale and sickly one, and gurgists who deal with the living are scrupulous in maintaining a daily feeding schedule.",
			"",
			"As part of their cursed biology, gurgists suffer from a powerful hunger for meat, preferably fresh raw meat or offal. This hunger is a constant, gnawing sensation at the back of a gurgist's mind, and while it doesn't drive her to madness, it certainly drives her to distraction. Luckily for all involved, gurgists have at best a very mild preference for human flesh, and so most subsist on enormous quantities of raw beef, pork, or wild game.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Mortic}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Few gurgists can pass for long in mortal society. Their unceasing rot marks them, and their dietary needs limit them. Instead, most live in small villages out on the outskirts of civilization, in wild lands where law breaks down and a community of masked half-dead can live, if not unnoticed, then at least unmolested.",
			"",
			"Gurgist villages devote great effort to dealing with the twin problems of rot and hunger. Gurgists ensure there is always plenty of meat around, and so they often become herders and hunters. Many extend their animal-tending skills to other beasts as well. Gurgists are infinitely creative when it comes to taming the local wildlife, and their half-dead hardiness means they can risk dealing with creatures that other people would avoid, such as {monster/ankheg/s}, {monster/chimera/s}, {monster/griffon/s}, and {monster/mammoth/s}. Gurgists also think of weaker undead as just one more type of beast to train, though no gurgist willingly deals with zombies of any stripe: the similarities are simply too close for comfort.",
			"",
			"Dealing with the hunger is harder. Most gurgist communities use distraction to keep themselves sane. Gurgists find a hobby or activity and focus all their will and drive on that one thing, until it becomes greater in their minds than their hunger. Gurgists might become master animal trainers or leatherworkers, painters, carvers, poets, or anything else that keeps the edge of hunger at bay. In some gurgist villages, all residents choose the same mania, elevating it to something akin to a religion. More often, they each pursue their own private obsessions, placing their skills in the service of their communities.",
			"",
			"Masks and clothing are vital parts of gurgist culture. While there are exceptions, most gurgists find their slow rot no more pleasing to the eye than outsiders do. They instead make beautiful and colorful garb, with particular emphasis placed on unique and eye-catching masks. Gurgists wear their masks constantly, tying them with leather bands or in extreme cases even sewing them to their half-rotted flesh, and many gurgists consider their masks to be their true faces. Gurgist masks also often say something about the gurgists' roles in their community. Hunters or warriors have small, elegant masks, while artisans have more extravagant masks adorned with symbols of their trade.",
			"",
			"Gurgist communities tend to be standoffish but not actively hostile to others in the area. In wilder areas, such as in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse or near the Crown of the World, gurgists are sometimes even accepted as neighbors by local human communities-not necessarily comfortable or friendly, but as allies against more dangerous forces."

On a critical hit, this damage is instead 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity damage. This ability damage has no effect against a creature without a skeleton.

			"Jitterbone mortics are halfling-like creatures with abnormally loose skeletons. With sufficient exertion of muscle control, jitterbones can control their skeletal structure, allowing them to shrug off crushing blows and slip through narrow spaces. They enjoy the taste of marrow - humanoid marrow in particular - and are adept at cracking and pulling their victim's bones. Jitterbones can be identified by their abnormally large heads. Their distinctive appearance and unusual appetites make jitterbones unwelcome in most halfling communities, so they form societies of their own in remote fields or forests. Among these communities of jitterbones, the most respected members are those that can contort themselves into the smallest or most awkward shapes; competitions to display this prowess and move up or down in the community's hierarchy are common. A traveler coming across one of these \"bone churning contests\" is likely to be plagued for years to come by the gruesome images of halflings twisting themselves into knots or shoving themselves through small pipes.",
			"",
			"Jitterbones in human communities live as many halflings do: they carefully keep themselves out of the public eye but try to make themselves valuable to larger races.

However, when the lifeleecher mortic falls below 0 hit points, it does not lose any hit points per round and it is not staggered. A lifeleecher mortic still dies when it reaches a negative number of hit points equal to its Constitution score. Lifeleecher mortics fighting in this state are driven by instinct and default to attacking with their natural weapons, bolstered by their leech life and death knell abilities. Using manufactured weapons or using any other tactics or abilities requires the lifeleecher mortic to succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw to suppress its instincts.",

Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. When staggered due to such an effect, a lifeleecher mortic cannot use its leech life special ability and its mortic ferocity ability is suppressed. If the lifeleecher mortic is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while affected by a raise dead effect, it immediately gains the staggered condition and loses 1 hit point per round.",
			"",

			"Much like some of their orc kin, lifeleecher mortics often cover themselves in ritual scarring, brands, and auspicious tattoos. However, a lifeleecher mortic's skin is an ashen gray color, signaling their flirtation with death. Of all their markings, lifeleecher mortics most celebrate their death scar: the site of a mortal wound that would have felled creatures far more resilient than an orc, yet that failed to slay the lifeleecher mortic, instead unleashing their mortic heritage.",

			"Lifeleecher mortics are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds.",
			"",
			"A lifeleecher mortic's elongated nails resemble a raptor's talons, with razor tusks jutting upward from their lower lip, ending just below their lifeless eyes. Lifeleecher mortics are not born with their mortic abilities; rather, these powers manifest upon a mortic's initial brush with death. As the lifeleecher mortic receives what should be a fatal blow, their orc ferocity triggers something deep within that releases their mortic powers.",
			"",
			"Upon receiving any killing blow, the lifeleecher's mortic ferocity activates. The mortic enters a feral, furious state that drives them on, allowing them to continue fighting where other humanoids, even orcs, would fall. As they enters this trance, they forgo weapons and other tools, instead ravaging their opponents with natural attacks, especially their savage, life-leeching maw. The fact that lifeleechers consume their foes' life energy with their maws leads many of them to gravitate toward cannibalism in general, and even those who do not partake of cannibalism tend to prefer their meat fresh and raw.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Mortic}",

			"",
			"Lifeleecher mortics enjoy an almost celebrity status in orc settlements, both feared and revered for their strange ability to shrug off death blows. In a society where might makes right, death-defying lifeleecher mortics quickly climb their tribal hierarchies as their ability to defeat their orc cousins proves their strength and worthiness to rule. In other cases, powerful mortics find themselves quickly sold off to large gladiatorial stables in Belkzen and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the savage, tusk-lined fighting pits within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Many managers enjoy having a lifeleecher mortic champion in these blood-soaked arenas, as the mortics' prolonged fights and supernatural displays both wow and terrify crowds in a gruesome spectacle often talked about for several seasons after the bout itself.",
			"",
			"Unfortunately, lifeleechers' penchant for animating those they defeat into wights, even temporarily, stirs many orc superstitions regarding death and magic. Tribes whisper insults depicting the lifeleechers as undead creatures themselves or suggest that they are possessed by fiends. Of course, most orcs would never say such things to a lifeleecher mortic's face; they are far more likely to grovel at the lifeleecher's feet to garner favor from their much stronger kin.",
			"",
			"Many soothsayers, shamans, oracles, and witches believe lifeleecher mortics hold the spirits of fallen orc heroes killed before they fulfilled their destiny, and it is this power that drives these nigh-indestructible warriors. When a lifeleecher mortic takes a mate, it prefers others of its kind; however, due to their orc heritage, these mortics can also breed with orcs and humans, and their often-high status gives them plenty of opportunity to do so. A mortic's offspring, whether orc or half-orc, all have potential to manifest as lifeleecher mortics when their racial ferocity triggers. Unfortunately, tribes all too often attempt to hasten this phenomenon, risking the lives of young orcs to spark this heritage, and it is more likely for a young orc with a lifeleecher mortic parent to die than for the child's mortic abilities to be unleashed.",
			"",
			"Lifeleecher mortics who live apart from orc settlements fare far worse than their half-orc cousins in similar communities. Something about their mannerisms, especially their dead eyes, is off-putting to non-orcs. Add to that their proclivity for cannibalism, and lifeleecher mortics find they do not assimilate well outside of gladiatorial pens or spectacle sideshows, and the public quickly drives them out into the wild when they discover the lifeleecher mortic's questionable heritage and unsavory diet. This suits most lifeleecher mortics just fine, as outside of orc lands they gravitate towards loner lifestyles as explorers, big-game hunters, and practitioners of guerrilla warfare."

The curse mutates, and its host mutates in turn to become the half-dead creature known as a relictner. The two grow together in a kind of twisted symbiosis, until it becomes hard to tell where the relictner ends and its curse begins. Removing a relictner's curse (possible only with {spell/wish} or {spell/miracle}) kills it instantly, as the curse has long since taken over the host's vital biological functions.",
			"",
			"Soon after its curse manifests, a relictner feels an urge to claim some kind of structure or building as its own. A relictner considers its home a vital part of its being, much like a hermit crab's shell, and few relictners willingly leave their chosen lairs. A relictner forced to leave its home experiences bouts of twitchy, agoraphobic mania interspersed with melancholic lethargy. This is not to say that relictners don't sometimes grit their teeth and travel - a relictner is an intelligent creature, after all - but it takes quite a lot of motivation.",
			"",
			"A relictner's curse encompasses its chosen home, weakening it, desecrating it, and turning even the greatest example of dwarven architecture into a barely standing ruin within a matter of months. Relictners' ruins are places where terrible accidents can happen with little warning, and where lives can be lost in sudden structural collapses. Relictners themselves are almost never in any danger, however. The mortic's curse may not be alive in any conventional sense, but it does have some tiny spark of awareness, enough to make a point of never harming its host.",
			"",
			"Whenever someone dies inside the cursed ruins of a relictner, the mortic feels a sudden rush of energy and confidence as its curse fulfills its true purpose. The more painful, agonizing, and despair-ridden the death, the greater the subsequent high. The same ability also makes it easy for relictners to stalk prey within their domiciles, as they can usually find survivors nearby.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Mortic}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A few relictners try to hide in larger dwarven society, though their destructive aura makes it difficult: people tend to notice when fine dwarven workmanship falls to pieces in a matter of weeks. And to dwarves, relictners are nothing less than abominations, horrific blasphemies that by their very nature destroy everything that dwarves strive to create. Those relictners who manage to hide do so by pretending to be older than they are and by living in slums or shantytowns, places where one more ruined building won't be remarked upon. More often, though, relictners are exiled or forced out. These bitter outcasts seek existing ruins, where they either live alone as hermits or in small, orderly clans, and from which they plan their revenge on the living.",
			"",
			"Relictner ruins tend to be terrifying places to visit. Relictners generally seek out the most impressive ruins they can find, ideally those with curses or undead residents of their own; relictners are immune to other jinxes, and they get along very well with [liches](template/lich) or mummies, offering service in exchange for residence. They are expert trapmakers and delight in devising creative ways to violently mutilate and kill their victims.",
			"",
			"Of course, creating traps that never get triggered is boring, so relictners routinely lure visitors to their ruinous homes. Particularly duplicitous relictners have even been known to hire adventuring parties as unwitting meat for their grinders, finding these capable targets a satisfying test for their skills."

			"**Deadwood Curse (Su)** When a mosslord confirms a critical hit with one of its claws, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or a horrid curse transforms one of its limbs into an immobile wooden branch. Roll 1d4 to determine which limb is affected (1-right arm, 2-left arm, 3-right leg, 4-left leg; adjust the die as necessary for creatures with fewer or more limbs). The cursed limb hardens and becomes entirely immobile until the curse is lifted. If an arm is affected, the victim's Strength is reduced by 2 and it cannot wield weapons in that hand or use the hand in any way. If a victim's leg is affected, the victim's Dexterity is reduced by 2 and its base speed is reduced by 15 feet. Each time a creature is affected by this curse, a new limb is affected, and the effects stack. If a cursed limb is amputated and regrown via magic, the new limb regrows as deadwood as long as the curse persists. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Perennial (Su)** When a mosslord dies, its body decomposes normally but regrows in 60 days. A dead mosslord cannot regrow during winter months or when there is frost or snow on the ground where it was slain; in such a condition, its regrowth is delayed until the thaw. If the region where the mosslord was slain is affected by a lasting winter (either via magic or as a result of natural conditions), its regrowth can be delayed indefinitely. Even completely destroying a mosslord's body won't stop its eventual regrowth. A blight or diminish plants spell applied to a mosslord's remains can ensure its permanent death if the caster succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check. A mosslord slain on any plane other than the Material Plane remains dead permanently. Obscure rituals can also aid in the permanent death of a mosslord, at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"**Sheets of Moss (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, a mosslord can cover a 20-foot-square area in a thick blanket of toxic moss at a range of up to 90 feet. Living creatures in the area are automatically entangled and sickened and must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round until the moss dissipates or is destroyed. The moss has 25 hit points per 5-foot square, but can only be damaged by cold or effects that specifically target plants (such as blight) or deal additional damage to plants (such as horrid wilting). Otherwise, the sheets of moss wither away automatically after 1d4+4 rounds. The sickened effect and Constitution damage are poison effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Mold Blast (Su)** As a standard action, a mosslord can swiftly extrude a puffball and hurl it up to 60 feet. Upon impact, the puffball bursts into an unusually thick and potent cloud of [yellow mold](rule/slimes_molds_and_fungi) spores. This cloud of spores fills a 10-foot-radius area, obscuring vision as if it were a fog cloud and affecting all creatures within the area with yellow mold, except the Fortitude save to resist the mold's poisonous effects is DC 30. A creature that takes Constitution damage from these thick spores is also nauseated for 1 round. The cloud of spores persists for 1d4 rounds, after which it automatically dissipates. Creatures with greensight can see through these clouds of spores with ease. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Tales of the wretched mosslord have existed for as long as humanity has dared dwell amid the forests of the world. It appears in grotesque pictographs of long dead civilizations, covering the walls of lost cities on sunken continents or hidden in overgrown jungles. So ancient is the creature that its true origin remains unknown. In the cultures whose lore and legend tell of the mosslord, it is described as the living incarnation of the forest's vengeance against the encroachment of civilization, a fury given mind and focus toward the destruction of humanity. To date, no one has ever reported spotting more than a single mosslord at a time, prompting speculation as to whether more than a single mosslord exists, or if it is a singular entity that simply regrows itself each time it is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Most tales of the mosslord's intentions hold true, although the legends of there being but one mosslord are a false hope - in truth, multiple mosslords exist, and wherever one surfaces, ruin inevitably follows. Yet mosslords are hardly the simple, violent juggernauts that old legends purport. Instead, these wickedly intelligent creatures mastermind elaborate campaigns against civilization. Capable of commanding hordes of plant creatures, they typically spend months or even years seeding a target before launching an incursion - even if their attacks seem sudden and unprovoked to the victims. They are clever combatants, shielding themselves from direct attacks and avoiding melee if at all possible, in order to command and maneuver allies. Still, the creature is an able warrior in addition to having a potent arsenal of spells, and it doesn't shy from engaging opponents in melee when directly faced with an immediate opponent. Among all humanoid forms of life, they despise humans and halflings in particular.",
			"",
			"A mosslord has no known or ties to the fey world or to those worlds or planes beyond the material realm. Though the mosslord is no deity, it is a wholly supernatural being and the apocalyptic texts of over a dozen different religions depict its wrath. These texts often revile the mosslord and condemn those who would worship it or pay it reverence. Despite ominous warnings, history reports a handful of occasions when doom cults praised, venerated, and pledged fealty to mosslords. Some even credit or blame such cults for the creation of the first mosslords, for it seems odd that plant creatures would naturally form upon the wooden frames that hold its fungal flesh in the form of a bipedal humanoid. Regardless, such efforts tend to be short lived; as soon as the cultists capture the mosslord's attention, they find they have only attracted its relentless and utter destruction.",
			"",
			"The mosslord's body consists of a large skeletal frame that towers over 15 feet tall, fashioned from rough-cut pieces of wood. A thick layer of moss encompasses this frame, creating the appearance of flesh. While a mosslord's body appears constructed, the creature is fully sentient and highly intelligent. Despite their similar hateful and destructive views of civilization, mosslords do not cooperate with blights or whisperers, and they often compete with these strange entities for control over their woodland territories."

Even more valuable, to many debased alchemists, are the strange secretions and spores they emit, for these rare materials can be brewed into the strangest of drugs and elixirs."

In certain ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been refined through centuries of ceremony and countless deaths, giving rise to mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of great rank and exceeding malevolence, he might undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from his tomb as a fearful mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his resurrection, a mummy lord retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate both the living and dead.",

These juju zombies don't provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the nachzehrer's control, and act on its turn.

Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.",

			"The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence's origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.",
			"",
			"Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although rare no matter the location, nachzehrers are most likely to be found in blighted forests or in woodlands that have recently suffered sweeping bouts of disease. Many nachzehrers were once fey creatures whose bodies managed to resist a polluting blight - such as the Abyssal Darkblight that infects the deepest Fangwood in Nirmathas - that might have warped their bodies and minds (see the {template/blighted fey/ template}). However, these fey nonetheless contract debilitating, wasting diseases that visit terrible suffering upon them until they finally succumb. The most unlucky of these fey find themselves returned to unlife as nachzehrers. In fact, dying from such diseases is the hallmark of all nachzehrers' rebirth.",
			"",
			"When nachzehrers arise, they do so in a weakened state - typically, nachzehrers begin unlife with only 1 hit point. Since most find themselves risen in graves that contain other fey creatures who also succumbed to disease, nachzehrers feed off the stagnant blood in those bodies, gaining vigor even as they drain the corpses of those who once loved them. In the rare case that a nachzehrer arises near no easily obtainable source of blood, the wicked creature typically slinks back to its ancestral enclave, waiting to pick off young and weak members of its former clan to drain the blood it needs to gain strength.",
			"",
			"Although they remember little about their lives before undeath, nachzehrers retain terrible memories of the pain and suffering they experienced during the infections that killed them. Worse, they can transmit these horrifying experiences to their enemies - and they count all living creatures as such, regarding them with equal parts hate and jealousy. Most nachzehrers wish to destroy life simply for the sake of doing so, but the oldest and most heinous of their number want to see as many creatures as possible suffer the same agony they did so long ago. Thus, because they don't need blood to survive, some nachzehrers capture victims and continually torture them with horrifying visions, without ever granting them the release of death.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because they suffered so deeply before rising as undead, nachzehrers particularly hate their ancestral fey clans, whom they blame for not finding a way to cure their disease or at least mitigate their agony. As a result, most nachzehrers stalk their former comrades, terrorizing them and waiting for opportune moments to steal lone victims. In the case of nachzehrers whose clans are gone - either wiped out by disease or otherwise fled from the area - the creatures roam about the woods, looking for other groups of living creatures to torment.",
			"",
			"Wandering nachzehrers are often drawn to places of great suffering in the hope that they might drown out some of the agonizing memories they continually relive. In fact, the most common place to find an unmoored nachzehrer is the site of a destroyed fey village in a blighted area or at the crossroads of woodland paths. Here, nachzehrers absorb the area's latent suffering while waiting for new victims to stumble upon their new lairs. Although their behavior is practically feral, nachzehrers are fiercely intelligent creatures. They are at least nominally aware that they're undead abominations, and that the hateful actions they commit are intensely evil. Thus, nachzehrers assume that nearby fey or benevolent humanoids will eventually seek to destroy them, and they fear nothing more than the arrival of planar allies such as angels to send them to oblivion.",
			"",
			"Nachzehrers hate and are uncommonly terrified of creatures that bear coins, which they assume are payment for a coming planar ally. Though nachzehrers can fight against coin-bearing individuals freely, placing a coin in a nachzehrer's mouth paralyzes it as much as a stake in the heart incapacitates a true vampire. Savvy adventurers can fully destroy a nachzehrer incapacitated in this way by going through the same grisly ritual they'd use to kill a child of the night. Those clever enough to lure a nachzehrer into helplessness find that this is the easiest way to dispatch the creatures. Tragically, though, all but the most discerning adventurers and scholars tend to mistake nachzehrers for their more common vampiric kin, and attempt to destroy them as they would true vampires, without using coins-always to disastrous results."

			"**Curative Skin (Su)** A nehushtan's bronze scales repel disease and poison. A nehushtan can treat diseases and poisons (as per the Heal skill) without attempting Heal checks merely by remaining in continuous physical contact with the creature to be treated for 10 minutes. Additionally, a creature that takes a nehushtan as a familiar gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease or poison so long as the nehushtan remains within 1 mile of its master. A creature with at least 1 rank in Heal can use skin shed by a nehushtan to craft a draught that, when consumed, functions as either a potion of remove disease or a potion of neutralize poison, as chosen by the crafter. A nehushtan sheds enough skin to craft a single draught every 3 months, and crafting this draught takes 10 minutes.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Injury-bite; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 fire damage; cure 1 save.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In many of Golarion's cultures, serpents symbolize wisdom, medicine, and the healing arts. This association may have its roots in nehushtans, a rare breed of bronze-colored serpents prized and venerated for their miraculous curative powers. Nehushtans' lustrous scales contain potent curative properties, making the snakes' shed skin extremely valuable to healers and apothecaries. In regions where nehushtans live, desperately sick or poor people sometimes turn to scavenging the hills, hoping to find the discarded, metallic skins in order to either use them or sell them.",
			"",
			"Were it not for their peculiarly metallic scales, nehushtans would be virtually indistinguishable from vipers of comparable size. A nehushtan's body is 4 to 5 feet long, and it weighs 5 to 7 pounds.",
			"",
			"According to folklore, Sarenrae created the first nehushtan to answer the prayers of a priestess whose tribe was plagued by venomous serpents. The Dawnflower commanded her priestess to craft a bronze serpent and carry it among her people atop a large wooden pole. The visage of this \"nehushtan\" repelled mundane serpents, and those faithful who laid their hands upon the bronze idol found themselves miraculously cured of the vipers' venom. Once its holy work was done, Sarenrae rewarded the bronze idol for its service by imbuing it with the divine spark of life.",
			"",
			"True or not, this story explains the nehushtans' antagonistic attitude toward other snakes. The creatures take great pleasure in hunting and killing venomous serpents, particularly when such creatures encroach on inhabited areas or endanger humanoid populations. Though a nehushtan usually consumes the snakes it kills, it attacks even serpents too large for it to swallow. Nehushtans' innate immunity to poison makes them extremely effective at hunting venomous creatures, and these make up a large part of their diet. Nehushtans are otherwise opportunistic carnivores, and feed on whatever small prey they can catch and swallow.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans are venomous, and possess a potent venom that combusts when exposed to living flesh. Nehushtans use this toxin to painfully cook their prey from the inside out, and generally prefer to consume cooked or burnt flesh rather than raw meat. Nehushtans generally reserve this venom for their prey, and though they may bite to defend themselves or their young, they don't usually inject venom unless the target is particularly aggressive or persistent.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans shed their skins two to four times a year, with younger nehushtans molting slightly more often. They shed throughout their lives, which are comparable in length to a human's, and their skin grows increasingly powerful with each desquamation. Rare nehushtans live for hundreds of years, growing to incredible sizes and have skins that can cure any ailment. A nehushtan's discarded skin grows rigid after it is shed, resembling a mangled bronze leaf.",
			"",
			"Popular folklore claims that nehushtans shed during certain times of the year, such as the month of Sarenith, but this is not true. Nehushtans can shed during any part of the year, with different individuals shedding at different times. Nonetheless, many hunters intensify their search efforts during the weeks preceding and following Sarenrae's holy days, hoping to gain favor from the goddess in the form of nehushtan skin.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The temperaments of nehushtans vary. Some congregate in large extended families, while others associate with other nehushtans only long enough to breed and raise young. A nehushtan mother lays a clutch of two to four eggs, and both parents remain close to the nest until the young hatch. Unlike most serpents, nehushtans continue to care for their young after hatching, and stay with their children during the 2 to 3 months required for the young to fully mature into adults. During this time, the ordinarily peaceful creatures become fiercely protective, and most nehushtan bites are the result of unwary travelers stumbling too close to a nehushtan's nest when its young are present. Nehushtans prefer to dwell underground, taking over animal burrows or crawling into disused basements. They usually hunt in rocky environments.",
			"",
			"Given the miraculous healing powers of their scales, many humanoids have tried to domesticate nehushtans. These attempts invariably meet with failure. Nehushtans languish if confined for more than a few days, and cannot survive more than a month in captivity no matter how comfortable their accommodations are. After this time, the miserable captives undergo a strange transformation - their scales grow dull and tarnished, and eventually the nehushtans loses their luster and turns into aggressive but otherwise mundane vipers. Some see this as a sign of Sarenrae's displeasure at mortals who would exploit her sacred gifts. Others suspect nehushtans require some unknown dietary or environmental factor that their captors can't provide.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who willingly choose to live among humanity suffer no ill effects. Entire families of the serpents sometimes establish colonies in human settlements, and thrive just as well as their wild counterparts, provided they are allowed to come and go as they please and generally left to themselves. These colonies enjoy residing in hospitals, temples dedicated to healing, and other places where the sick and infirm dwell.",
			"",
			"The presence of a nehushtan greatly enhances a patient's recovery and survival, and so mortals who operate infirmaries welcome these mystical serpents. Some healers even venerate nehushtans, and give offerings of milk and burnt meat to placate and honor the bronze serpents. In earlier days, hospitals that hosted nehushtans advertised this fact by incorporating bronze serpent motifs into their decorations. These symbols have long since become iconic for all houses of healing in the warm, dry regions from which nehushtans hail.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who choose to serve spellcasters as familiars likewise suffer no ill effects. They favor Sarenrae worshipers as masters, though any particularly devout or compassionate spellcaster can entice a nehushtan into service. Nehushtans adapt well to the adventurer's life, and particularly relish the opportunity to reduce the suffering of others by doing good works. Nehushtans are quick to abandon masters who grow cruel or merciless, and may even attack masters who radically shift in alignment. A good-aligned spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a nehushtan as a familiar."

In such a guise, the creature can infiltrate the home and begin working all kinds of mischief, using its innate magical abilities to terrorize the home's residents, often while enjoying all the comforts that home provides. Ultimately, the nekomata's goal is to ruin the health and reputation of the head of the house before killing every member of the family. Once its vile work is done, the creature moves on to find another home to destroy. In its true form, a nekomata appears as a two-tailed house cat about 7 feet long and weighing 200 pounds."

			"**Bound Spirits (Su)** A nemhain is surrounded by a whirling cloud of spirits that are bound to her - often the spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life. As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a harm or slay living effect. Using these spirits to deliver one of these spell-like abilities is a swift action; the nemhain does not need to take a standard action to cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1 mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: {spell/dispel evil}, {spell/raise dead}, or {spell/resurrection}.

The blasphemous rituals used to create nemhains are often believed to have been lost.",

In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.",
			"",
			"Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. The change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords' ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying - even maddening - to behold.",
			"",
			"An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature's head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid's intellect. The new neothelid overlord's enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. The creatures' tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. The functions of overlords' tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. They reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship - the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.",
			"",
			"In The Dream Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes. The text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari's dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed."

If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25).

The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks, perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since outsiders don't normally need to eat, the neshmaals' ravenous hunger for the energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the life force from living creatures, though it's assumed they also derive some nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in particular.",

			"Neshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.",
			"",
			"Neshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful otherworldly beings from the Dark Tapestry. Some scholars believe these creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.",

			"Humanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond, though doing so places the conjurer's sanity in terrible jeopardy. The process is maddening, and the conjurer's safety is not diminished once the neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal's goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those they serve. A neshmaal's most common request is a never-ending chain of humanoids for them to drain of their life force.",
			"",
			"It's unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so, they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace. The book Secrets of the Dreaming Dark (which is thankfully rare) provides the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically referred to as the \"Black Alluvion Dream.\" Even occult scholars, astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea Region."
