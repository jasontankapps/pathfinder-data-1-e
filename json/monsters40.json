Often, a vegepygmy uses such bones to craft a crude spear or some other weapon.",

Everyone in the area must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or the spores quickly take root in their victims, inflicting 2 points of Constitution damage per round. A new Fortitude save can be attempted each round to halt the growth. Although immunity to disease won't protect against russet mold spores, the growth can be halted by {spell/remove disease} and similar effects. Exposure to sunlight also halts the spores' growth. Plants are immune to russet mold spores.",

As the spores are not a disease effect, protection like a paladin's divine health is ineffective, but the growth of the spores can be halted with a remove disease spell or similar effect. The best tool to overcome the spores of a russet mold patch is exposure to sunlight, which kills both the spores and the mold itself.",

Creatures that come within 15 feet of argent mold must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or be infected by the mold's spores. Twenty-four hours after initial infection, the mold takes root and begins dealing 2 points of Constitution damage per round; success at a new Fortitude save halts the effect. All vegepygmies spawned from a character slain by this infection possess the {template/advanced/ creature simple template}.",

At rest, their flat bodies stand roughly 5 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter, their surfaces blossoming into what look like thick tangles of mossy roots and gnarled vegetation as they lie still. Known to emit invisible but dangerous chemicals, these masses of slinking muck cause nearby plants to writhe and coil as if alive, while shocking animals into a temporary but deathly torpor. As such, they rarely must hunt to find food, instead sensing passing creatures and preying upon them after they succumb to the oozes' sleep aura. Always ravenous, the powerful acids that comprise these oozes quickly dissolve the flesh of their meals.",
			"",
			"A verdurous ooze typically weighs 300 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 5-foot-square area. While moving, such crawling muck rises only a few inches tall, though its structure might grow and boil up to a height of 2 or 3 feet if let undisturbed for a matter of days. Spontaneously grown structures collapse and melt back into the ooze's body as soon as it begins moving again.",

			"Greater verdurous oozes are formed when several green oozes merge together as part of their reproductive process. They are similar in form but much larger, and while still green, exhibit white and red lines that resemble veins running through them. They are even more voracious and dangerous than standard green oozes, as they eat and eat to gain enough mass to reproduce. A greater verdurous ooze typically weighs 2,400 pounds and can easily spread to fill a 10-foot-square area."

They are particularly drawn toward rulers and commanders, and might insinuate themselves into the confidence of leaders with their clever tongues and deft rumor-mongering. They are deceivers and heralds of woe, seeking to lure the rulers of mortal kingdoms into jealous feuds and fruitless wars with one another. To do this, they often cultivate reputations as master duelists, brilliant mercenary leaders, or unjustly banished nobility from distant lands. Regardless of their guises, vilderavns' advice usually seems wise and perceptive, steeped in an expansive knowledge of history, political rivalries, and cultural clashes, along with insights into the ways of war. Yet while their counsel might lead to early victories, their ultimate purpose is to bring doom to all sides. At the height of the battle, when victory seems nigh, a vilderavn often instigates a wave of betrayal, crippling erstwhile allies and bringing devastation.

The vilderavns watched from the shadows and learned the ways of mortals, the better to use their own weapons and strategies against them. In torment and blood, they peeled away the secrets of mortals, laying the last truths of their hearts bare before bestowing the gift of death on them. Even in death, however, a vilderavn's victims languish, stretched across the threshold of the afterlife yet tethered to the fey spirit's merciless heart. Their minds are open books for this fey to unravel and use in cruel and hurtful ways.",

A vilderavn typically claims to be cursed into its animal form, insisting that only innocent blood will release it. If its mark is foolish enough to accept its bargain, the vilderavn often returns wearing the innocent's flesh to torment its supposed ally and drive her to insanity. A vilderavn might even offer an irony-laced limited wish to sweeten its bargains and truly test a mortal's resolve."

			"**Bestial Possession (Su)** A vilkacis is a spirit of savagery and can take control of other beings, afflicting them with its savage nature. Once per round, the vilkacis can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except it does not require a receptacle and lasts for up to 3 hours (or a number of hours equal to the vilkacis's Charisma modifier, whichever is greater). To use this ability, the vilkacis must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 18 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vilkacis's bestial possession for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"Upon being possessed by a vilkacis, the target takes on a number of bestial features, most notably growing claws and vicious fangs, and flies into a savage rage. The victim gains two claws and a bite natural attack appropriate to its size (1d4 and 1d6 for Medium creatures; see [Table 3-1](umr/natural_attacks)), and gains a {class/barbarian}'s greater rage class ability. This rage lasts for as long as the victim is being possessed by the vilkacis. After the possession ends, the victim is fatigued for a period of time equal to double the duration of the possession. The victim also gains low-light vision and scent. The possessed creature loses all of these natural attacks and abilities immediately when the vilkacis leaves its body.",

			"**Curse of Lycanthropy (Su)** Any humanoid who is bitten by a creature possessed by a vilkacis must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with lycanthropy as if bitten by a werewolf. If the victim's size is not within one size category of the possessed creature's, this ability has no effect. The save DC uses the vilkacis's ability scores and is Charisma-based.",
			"",

			"**Rejuvenation (Su)** A vilkacis that is destroyed in combat restores itself after 2d4 days. The only way to permanently do away with a vilkacis is to locate its canopic stone, the occult artifact that binds it to the Material Plane, and then destroy the artifact in the presence of the vilkacis's mortal remains. Once the canopic stone is destroyed, the vilkacis can no longer rejuvenate and can be destroyed as normal.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerability to Silver (Su)** Vilkacis are particularly susceptible to silver. A vilkacis struck with a silver weapon takes an additional 2d6 points of damage. If a creature under the effects of a vilkacis's bestial possession is damaged by a silver weapon, it also takes this extra damage and receives another saving throw to resist the bestial possession. If successful, the possession ends, and the vilkacis is driven into an adjacent square and cannot use its bestial possession ability again until the following day.",

Some see these beings as malign manifestations of the lycanthropic curse - the spirits of the infamous affliction itself - while others know them as the deathly continuance of lives consumed by lycanthropy. In either case, these ravenous spirit-beasts seek only to garb themselves in the skins of deadly hunters and revel in bloodshed once more.",

To do this, a spellcaster must prepare a canopic stone, a talisman that typically takes the form of a ceramic totem or amulet bound in silver. Upon creating this object, the bearer can summon a vilkacis once per day. The stone grants no control over the vilkacis, but the creature will not attack or attempt to possess the stone's bearer. Upon being summoned, the vilkacis turns its attention to the nearest creature other than the summoner, attempting to possess the creature's body and go on a murderous rampage. Using a canopic stone to summon a vilkacis is considered an evil act.",

While stories speaking of the plant's ability to lure prey into its clutches by virtue of its swaying motion persist, this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.",
			"",
			"Since viper vines gain nourishment through the consumption of creatures rather than through moisture and soil, they have developed rudimentary locomotion and are able to drag themselves along the ground with their tentacle-like root system. They even possess a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing them to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous looking. The area around the hunting grounds of these predators is often strewn with the remains of victims, and it is not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in their immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind by the plant's victims."

			"Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive territories, but these territories often make little geographical sense to others - a single vishap might claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley lines, however, the vishaps' territorial borders are clear. Each vishap claims one or more networks of ley lines, which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without ever touching. A vishap's first priority is the integrity of its ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the attention of the vishap that cares for it.",
			"",
			"Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography. In these places, vishaps make psychic contact with intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create standing stones called vishapakars. A vishap can't place a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar on a ley line allows the vishap a great deal of control over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones. Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the ley lines that they once marked drift and change course, so a vishap must return to each vishapakar periodically, entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars on the ley lines' new locations. At particularly ancient locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars.",
			"",
			"Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for control of converging ley lines meet each other in elaborate psychic duels. These duels can last for years, and often spill over into the Material Plane, with each vishap subtly manipulating the creatures and locations along the converging ley lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent.",
			"",
			"Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of psychic energy along their favorite ley lines. A vishap's hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of planes, though to the vishap each cache is only minutes away from the others. A vishap favors items of psychic significance, so one is as likely to find a mundane wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful occultist or the skull of a famous psychic in a vishap's hoard as a magical sword or mountains of gold.",
			"",
			"Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any biological imperative. When a vishap is finally ready to mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network, drifting listlessly along the psychic currents. Inevitably, it meets with some other drifting vishap, and the two consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of psychic force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for millennia before hatching a young, ethereal vishap that awakens to full consciousness upon hatching.",

Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conflict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward.

Though vorvoraks descended from crocodiles native to the region, magical contamination has both accelerated the species' development and granted its members uncanny abilities. At the height of the Taldan Empire, magic was used both to beautify canals and to control and protect the water within them. Sages speculate that when remote canals were later abandoned, decaying magic leached into the water, where it was absorbed by the vorvoraks' predecessors. After many generations of exposure, the theory goes, vorvoraks developed magical powers - and the intelligence to control them.",

			"A vorvorak has many superficial features of a crocodile, but also has a thick serpentine neck and elongated limbs that end in prehensile claws. Two fins extend from its back; though easily mistaken for wings at a distance, these are in fact enlarged scutes (akin to the bony upper scales of crocodiles). The purpose of these fins is unclear, but they may have evolved as armor or to regulate heat. The vorvorak's dull brown coloring allows the creature to better hide in its preferred habitat and ambush prey. Patches of green sometimes add to its disguise. Each vorvorak's unique pattern helps differentiate individuals.",

Vorvoraks use their magic to attract prey, conceal their lairs, and deter trespassers in their territory. Though these shadowy illusions have a chance of damaging opponents in combat, they more often serve as distractions that allow vorvoraks to position themselves for full attacks.",

			"Vorvoraks are solitary hunters, most active at dawn and dusk. Though generally associated with Taldor's disused canal system, a few make their lairs in natural gullies. A natural or burrowed niche provides the beasts a place to sleep and store treasure. Often the entrances to vorvoraks' lairs are partially submerged; otherwise, a vorvorak hides the entrance with an illusion when it leaves to hunt. Vorvoraks feed mostly on creatures that live in or near canals, as well as the occasional domestic animal that wanders into their range. Its few sentient victims tend to be unlucky lost travelers who attempt to follow the old canals back to civilization.",
			"",
			"Like dragons, vorvoraks line their lairs with treasures. In addition to coins and jewels taken from humanoid victims, vorvorak hoards are likely to contain common artifacts of imperial Taldor. These treasures may come from nearby ruins of abandoned estates, but just as often the beasts find them buried in the sediment at the bottom of a canal. Vorvoraks keep even broken or tarnished treasures, using illusions to make these items appear new.",
			"",
			"When vorvoraks meet, it's usually to fight over territory. The only time the creatures seek each other out is when driven to mate, which occurs only once or twice per decade, usually after a particularly heavy rain. The pair stays together only long enough to conceive, after which the female lays her eggs in the deepest water in her territory. Young vorvoraks that survive their first 2 or 3 years are \"encouraged\" to find their own territory as soon as their mother's hunger or jealousy overcomes her maternal instincts.",
			"",
			"Though they avoid active waterways, vorvoraks occasionally clash with humanoids. This usually occurs when a young vorvorak seeking territory moves too close to a civilized area or when enterprising Taldans attempt to reclaim lands around abandoned canals. In the centuries since the Dragon Plague, few Taldans have seen a true dragon, and they could easily mistake a vorvorak for one. Would-be dragon slayers, seeking to emulate the heroes of old, hunt vorvoraks for glory and treasure. A common (and likely apocryphal) story tells of simple villagers who mistook a vorvorak for a spawn of the Tarrasque-until a traveling priest subdued the monster and led it into the town square. Ashamed of their terrible judgment and cowardice, the villagers soon converted to the priest's religion (which varies according to the story's teller)."

It shuns the company of its own kind, preferring evil fey (particularly water-dwelling ones such as nixies) for intelligent conversation and mundane snakes for companionship. A vouivre is 12 feet long from head to head, weighs 500 pounds, and can live 200 years.",
			"",
			"Vouivres make their homes in small caves near calm waters. They like to decorate their lairs with shiny coins, jewelry, and bright silks. One might place some of its treasure in the water outside to lure in curious humanoids, and bathe in these waters as a further enticement, hiding its reptilian half until prey is within striking distance. Because a vouivre can breathe water or air (from either head), it often grabs a creature, then retreats underwater to wait for the opponent to drown. It prefers humanoid flesh, but will feed on any available warm-blooded prey. Vouivres have an affinity for music, and their magic is often accompanied by singing or subtle musical vibrations from their scales.",
			"",
			"When a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a 2-foot-diameter glassy egg. After around 6 weeks, the egg hatches into one or two vouivres, which take 7 years to reach maturity. These offspring resemble humanoids the mother has eaten, so it prefers to feast on attractive and strong victims. The young also adapt to the appearance of nearby reptilian creatures."

			"**Water Bomb (Su)** As a standard action, a wakandagi can spit a ball of water at a target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. If successful, the attack is resolved as a bull rush using the wakandagi's CMB. This bull rush doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the ball of water successfully hits, it remains in the square of the target struck. If the ball of water misses, it continues in a straight line and lands at the extent of its range. This ball is 2 feet across and weighs 50 pounds. One round after the wakandagi spits the ball of water, it explodes, dealing 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures within a 20-foot radius (Reflex DC 25 half).

When destructive creatures poison the rivers or humanoids draw too many fish from their waters, wakandagis are roused to confront the despoilers, either to force them to flee or to end their destruction by any means necessary.",
			"",
			"While a wakandagi's anger is fierce, it is not easily roused. Simple fishing expeditions and the occasional traveler are left in peace; only those doing extreme and malicious damage to the rivers in a wakandagi's territory provoke it, and the creature attacks only after great deliberation. While these majestic beasts are rarely encountered by humans, tales around the fires of fish camps and within the relative safety of riverside taverns claim that, when riled, a wakandagi will come screaming out from within a veil of clinging mist, scattering foes, capsizing boats, and spitting its water bombs, which can render a foe unconscious. Any creature straying too close to the beast falls victim to its branching antlers.",
			"",
			"The other, less destructive tales involving wakandagis portray them as considerate and kind-hearted beasts, sometimes flooding a burning field to save a crop of corn, pushing a sinking boat to shore to save the crew, or even saving a child bitten by a viper while playing in the river.",

			"",
			"**Structural Possession (Su)** As a full-round action, a walcofinde adjacent to a wall in a sealed chamber can merge part of itself with that wall. For as long as it maintains physical contact with a portion of the wall, the walcofinde can manifest through any part of that wall within 100 feet, including the opposite side of the wall. A walcofinde's manifestation occupies the same space as a 5-foot-long portion of the wall, appearing as if its torso were emerging from the wall but with the texture of the wall (such as wood or stone) instead of its normal decayed flesh. It cannot manifest from broken areas of a wall, nor can this manifestation separate from the wall at any time. The walcofinde can perceive creatures with all of its senses through this manifestation, and the manifestation can make claw attacks against creatures within 10 feet of the portion of wall from which it is manifested. As a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the manifestation can reposition itself along this wall at a maximum speed of 15 feet per round. The manifestation can be attacked as though such attacks targeted the walcofinde, but it gains a +2 bonus to its AC due to partial cover from the wall it occupies. While using this ability, the walcofinde is helpless. It can cease its manifestation as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening either the manifestation or the walcofinde. If a walcofinde using this ability is moved 10 or more feet away from the wall it has merged with, it takes 1d8 points of damage and its manifestation immediately disappears. If the walcofinde is killed, its manifested body is immediately reabsorbed into the possessed wall.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Similar to the undead monstrosities known as {monster/immured}, walcofindes are pitiful undead creatures that manifest when a living being is sealed within a structure and perishes there. These unquiet dead often rise after having been intentionally walled into a structure. This process is what many have attributed its name to, with some treatises on undead referring to them as \"wall-coffined.\" While both walcofindes and immured form from humanoids who were either sealed within a wall or victims of a collapse, their divergent abilities have led scholars of the undead to posit why the differences manifested as they have. Immured have the ability to displace life-giving oxygen, suggesting they perished through suffocation while trapped. Walcofindes, instead, ultimately succumbed to death by starvation while trapped. These latter transformed undead resemble the decayed appearance of zombies, albeit with vicious bony claws - the result of desperate escape attempts prior to the starvation that ultimately sealed their demise. It is rare for other creatures to ever see a walcofinde's true appearance, as these undead most often harry the living by possessing nearby walls.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Most adventurers stumble upon a walcofinde as it manifests from nearby walls, using its structural possession ability to move beyond its sealed chamber and unleash its rage against creatures traversing halls or caverns it possesses. In this manifested form, the walcofinde takes on the texture of the structure it possesses, appearing with the shape it had in life but made from stone, wood, or whatever substance makes up the wall from which it emerges.",
			"",
			"A walcofinde's structural possession ability is its primary means of movement and interaction with the outside world. The walcofinde positions itself adjacent to a wall within its chamber and then touches the wall with both claws, entering a trance wherein it possesses and manifests along the wall. Prior to its death, a creature destined to become a walcofinde often succumbs to the basest, most desperate attempts to escape its imprisonment. Desperately clawing at walls reduces the creature's fingers to ragged stumps of jagged and sharpened bone. To assist in its murderous capabilities, a walcofinde possessing a structure can elongate its vicious clawed arms while manifesting from a wall to strike foes who might have thought themselves safe.",
			"",
			"Those startled by the sudden appearance of a walcofinde often believe the undead has the same structural makeup as the wall it emerges from, but the walcofinde receives only minor protection from the nearby terrain, and its manifested form is almost as vulnerable as its true body. In fact, defeating a walcofinde's manifested form also destroys the undead. Because of this, a walcofinde often retreats from combat, rather than risk destruction. The fact that a walcofinde exhibits supernaturally expedited healing while within sealed chambers likewise encourages a hit-and-run style of punishing intruders.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"For a walcofinde to rise, a living creature must die while trapped in a walled-in chamber. Sometimes this can be as mundane as a group of miners trapped in a collapse. In some cultures, immurement is a sign of favor, and rising as a walcofinde is considered a gift from the heavens that enables the creature to continue defending a site in death. Most often, though, this grisly event occurs during a construction project where secrecy is paramount and workers involved with important portions of the construction are intentionally trapped within the edifice. The often-flawed logic behind this method of murder is to prevent the bodies from ever being exhumed and interrogated.",
			"",
			"Due to its relatively intact intelligence, a walcofinde can understand enemy tactics and even recognize different threats based on its observations over time. Many walcofindes are cunning enough to assess the appearance and equipment of their foes, allowing them to prioritize targets. As with most undead, a walcofinde endeavors to slay divine spellcasters as quickly as possible. Because of the effort required to cease manifesting, a walcofinde knows that it is particularly vulnerable to channeled positive energy, so it often hides in order to surprise intruders in an opening assault before foes with such abilities can act.",
			"",
			"Humans are the most populous progenitor species for walcofindes, simply a result of humanity's high population. After humans, dwarves and halflings are the most frequently encountered varieties of walcofindes. Old dwarven rituals, such as the Droskar-demanded rites common during Ordrik Talhrik's reign of the Five Kings Mountains, required fortresses to be regularly fortified by walcofindes at regular intervals-hundreds died to fuel these depraved rituals. Conversely, halfling variants (walcofindes with the young creature simple template) are found in the ruins of many Inner Sea empires, having died while serving as slave labor in construction efforts."

This proximity allows deep ones to pursue one of their favorite goals - commingling with and corrupting surface-dwelling humanoids.
