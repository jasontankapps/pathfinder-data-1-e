This Absalom-based secret society may seem like a band of lunatics unable to cope with their philosophy being negated by the passing of time, but in fact they pose a real threat to the safety of the City at the Center of the World. After all, nothing is more important to the Harbingers of Fate than restoring prophecy, even if doing so causes the deaths of thousands of innocents.",

			"Founded in 4648 AR by Lord Garron, an exiled Chelish noble living in Absalom, the Harbingers believe that bringing about the prophesies foretold the mysterious Book of 1,000 Whispers will put history back on its proper course and usher in the promised Age of Glory, perhaps even returning of Aroden himself to the world. But like all other forms of soothsaying, the writings in the Book of 1,000 Whispers-accurate up until 4606 AR-lost all reliability in predicting the future after Aroden's demise. Lord Garron desperately (and fruitlessly) tried to fulfill these prophecies for the remainder of his life, before dying in one such failed attempt. His daughter Lady Arodeth continues his work today and leads the small but fanatical group of disciples of the Book of 1,000 Whispers in Absalom. The Harbingers' methods have been growing more and more desperate in recent years, as the book's final pronouncements are said to occur in 4714 AR; so far, none of them have come true."

Some Lumber Consortium enforcers are disaffected mercenaries or soldiers from elsewhere who have been recruited by the consortium to keep order in their company mill towns.

Though not necessarily well schooled, some enforcers are selected for their cunning, intuition, and ability to motivate underlings by finding methods that keep people in line.",

While a few do their best to maintain order and pursue justice, others spend more time spying on the populace and arresting people for \"interfering with company business.\" Those living in areas controlled by the consortium are often subjected to threats, intimidation, and even beatings. Occasionally, the enforcers' strong-arm tactics do elicit useful information about people working outside the company's control, but for many enforcers the bullying is its own reward, and a means to maintain a climate of fear and control."

Rising from initiation into the cult to full status as a masked Red Mantis assassin can take years, even decades, but none should underestimate Red Mantis killer who haven't yet attained that rank. Quite the opposite is true, in fact, as those who have yet to master the mystic arts of the prayer attack, red shroud, and mantis form are particularly driven; they see every contract as their chance to prove to the Vernai that they are ready for such training, that they live to serve and kill for Achaekek. Beyond simply their aspirations and fervor, initiate Red Mantis assassins also benefit from their lack of iconic armor, mask, and in some cases even sawtooth sabres. Such assassins can more easily mask the threat they present to a potential target long past when a more experienced Red Mantis assassin would be revealed, a fact that helps make up for their less advanced training.",
			"",
			"While there are many paths to becoming a fully initiated Red Mantis assassin, most aspirants specialize in combat with the sawtooth sabre - the favored weapon of their god - as well as two-weapon fighting and magic in the schools of illusion and enchantment, as all these skills help them prove their eventual worth to the Vernai to earn full acceptance into the cult of the Red Mantis."

A river cleric never turns down a job unless she feels it clearly violates her deity's code of conduct (such as obstructing or defiling the river or acting against the interests of the pharaoh and his loyal subjects).

If these duties spare her any time, a Besmaran priest goes out of her way to assist others in their tasks onboard and learn everything there is to know about running a ship and crew, for there is no telling what duties will be required aboard Besmara's own Seawraith should the cleric earn a coveted berth in the afterlife. In addition, every priest of Besmara is expected to make a pilgrimage to the mysterious island called Besmara's Throne at least once in her life, and shipmates greeting a cleric upon her return are often struck by the renewed fervor with which she sets about her tasks.",

Those strix witches who make pacts with dark forces are perhaps the most feared of all Devil's Perch rebels, for their hexes and arcane magic allow them to infiltrate their enemies and pick them off one by one in darkness and silence."

			"Since time immemorial, the people of Sarkoris have embraced an immense number of deities, outsiders, guardian spirits, and legendary beings as part of their ever-changing regional pantheons. Each Sarkorian community boasted its own pantheon of patrons, with characters from folklore and history standing alongside true supernatural beings as objects of distinct local importance and worship. Passing on the tales of these figures and giving form to the faiths of their people were the god callers. For each god caller, and for those who looked to these magic-users as leaders, an eidolon was not just a mysterious being brought forth by magic - it was an embodiment of the divine, the manifestation of a being they believed to be a true god.",
			"",
			"God callers are aptly named, as they were traditionally held by the people of Sarkoris - laymen in matters of arcane and divine magic, but no more ignorant than most commoners - as the only mortals able to communicate with and conjure their \"gods.\" In rural Sarkoris, the distinctions between deities, demigods, powerful outsiders, summoned entities, and pure fictions blurred to such an extent that summoners were considered spiritual leaders, and stood alongside the druids, clerics, witches, and clerics that guided the clans of that land. Each eidolon is different, conjured as much from the strange realms where those creatures originate as from the imaginations, history, and tales of the Sarkorian people. Some eidolons are even inherited, after a fashion, with elder summoners passing on the techniques for calling their conjured allies to their offspring or apprentices so their gods might go on to serve the next generation. While most god callers understand that their eidolons are not the almighty deities of grand churches and world-spanning faiths, most are not insincere with their belief in their summoned creatures' divinity. Most view their eidolons as manifestations of greater beings, spirits of fallen heroes, children of legendary creatures, or the gods of small things - like a particular well, road, town, or family.",
			"",
			"During Sarkoris's height, most god callers were benevolent, calling on their eidolons to aid and protect their communities from the many dangers of the rugged north. But some called upon angry gods, and served as the mouthpieces of beings that demanded worship, fear, and terrible offerings. Fortunately, Sarkoris was a land of many deities and ever-changing regional pantheons, ensuring that the petty tyrannies of such wicked god callers and their small gods were regularly confronted by the summoners of nearby lands, or sometimes even by another in the same town.",
			"",
			"The first god caller was Domora Hume, who famously called the heavily armored god-creature called Dyzad, a spiny, crustacean-like creature that could fire its poisonous spines at enemies. With its aid, Domora repulsed a force of Mammoth Lord raiders and established the tradition of god calling across Sarkoris. So inspiring was Dyzad that many who studied under Domora or simply emulated her called lesser versions of her famed ally. In the ages since, many of the entities and legendary characters worshiped in Sarkoris as deities have taken the form of eidolons. Among them are such beings as the Dragoneagles of Neverhome, Aienu the Wall, Sister Last Tear, the Shackled Shadows of Rauglain, Alep's Steed, the Torches of Dawn, and Clanliege Histunsun. Thousands of other deities and eidolons were once known in Sarkoris, but most either have been lost, or are remembered only in legends and on the rare broken monoliths known as godstones.",
			"",
			"With the destruction of Sarkoris and the exodus of its surviving people, god callers found themselves in a world with vastly different religious traditions. In the less clannish lands, divorced from the ancient Kellid beliefs of Sarkoris, the tradition of god calling was largely viewed as ignorant at best and as outright heresy at worse. As a result, many god callers were shunned, or even hunted, for their strange beliefs and for the monstrous company they kept. Many sought out quiet and hidden places where they might continue to practice and share the traditions of Lost Sarkoris, surviving in small groups at the edges of the Worldwound, in the Tusk Mountains, in the Graidmere Swamp, in the Estrovian Forest, and beyond. Still others took the destruction of their home as a sign - as evidence that it was time to spread their beliefs to a world of complacent, distant deities. These god callers have struck out on their own, spreading the tales of their people and their storied eidolons, or even founding new cults devoted to their gods. Some have even allied with the churches of existing deities, allying their eidolons with the faiths and true gods that share similar beliefs and purposes. The tradition of god calling might be fractured, but it's far from dead.",
			"",
			"Today, some of the world's most active god callers continue to work in and around the Worldwound. The town of Valahuv in the Worldwound survives against the demonic hordes largely thanks to the efforts of Feinroh Balemoon (LN male human summoner 4), his eidolon Tammerri the Dawncaller, and a mysterious other patron. Similarly, the Sarkorian town of Gundrun is home to the determined god caller Alase Brinz-Widowknife (NG female human summoner 5) and her wolf like eidolon Tonbarse. Hidden away in the Graidmere Swamp, in the dark holy place called Baallalota, Clanliege Lesaul Blackearth (NE female changeling summoner 10) guides the remnants of her proud clan in their reverence for the Mother of Fangs, the snake-like spirit of the swamp - and perhaps something more.",

Most longboat captains are certainly capable in melee combat, but prefer to issue orders and provide support with their arrows from a vantage point from which they can observe the whole battle - often the bows of their ships. A captain's swift reactions, as well as her ability to yell a hasty word of warning or command to her crew, can determine whether she and her crew face victory or defeat, life or death.",

Many refer to the collections of sodden scavengers as gangs, which in many ways they are.

These autocratic communities range in population from barely two dozen into the hundreds.",

The strongest of these gangs is the ironically named Knights of Abendego, whose reach for territory has been expanding in recent years. Other gangs such as the reptile-wrangling Crocodile Raiders, the metal-salvaging Machine Union, the diseased and drug-dealing Possum Gang, the mystical cult known as Three Prong, and the skygazing descendants of the Lirgeni known as the An-Ydak - as well as dozens of others - all stake their claims on the apocalyptic lands of the Abendego Gulf.",

The Koboto tribes in the south, said to be the descendants of the lost nation of Yamasa, pose a further threat to the holdings of the sodden scavengers. In the far southern coast of the Sodden Lands, a pirate town known as Greenblood hosts an annual bloodsport event called Green Blood on a Black Rock that brings pirates from the Shackles and beyond to the Sodden Lands, leaving the sodden scavengers with yet more foes in the harsh and daunting region."

In the time since, the cult has flourished in Thuvia, where in the vast deserts of that nation the House of Oblivion stands as a permanent marker of Ahriman's presence.

Many Usij are skilled alchemists and entire cells are dedicated to refining deadly poisons and powerful drugs.",

Usij cabals operate independently of each other, but they always pursue the same goal: ruin. Recent rumors claim a cabal of Usij alchemists have joined with a great wyrm blue dragon and are scouring the desert for sun orchids in order to synthesize their own version of the {magic-artifact/sun orchid elixir}. Some say that certain Usij leaders meet annually at a secret location somewhere in central Casmaron, but this may be only whispers on paranoid lips.",
