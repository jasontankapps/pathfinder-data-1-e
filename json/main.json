			"",
			"**{race/Dwarf}**",
			"",
			">These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen as stern and humorless. Known for mining the earth's treasures and crafting magnificent items from ore and gemstones, they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties of the deep earth. Dwarves also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation that sometimes manifests as xenophobia.",
			"",
			"**{race/Elf}**",
			"",
			">Tall, noble, and often haughty, elves are long-lived and subtle masters of the wilderness. Elves excel in the arcane arts. Often they use their intrinsic link to nature to forge new spells and create wondrous items that, like their creators, seem nearly impervious to the ravages of time. A private and often introverted race, elves can give the impression they are indifferent to the plights of others.",
			"",
			"**{race/Gnome}**",
			"",
			">Expatriates of the strange land of fey, these small folk have a reputation for flighty and eccentric behavior. Many gnomes are whimsical artisans and tinkers, creating strange devices powered by magic, alchemy, and their quirky imagination. Gnomes have an insatiable need for new experiences that often gets them in trouble.",
			"",
			"**{race/Half-Elf}**",
			"",
			">Often caught between the worlds of their progenitor races, half-elves are a race of both grace and contradiction. Their dual heritage and natural gifts often create brilliant diplomats and peacemakers, but half-elves are often susceptible to an intense and even melancholic isolation, realizing that they are never truly part of elven or human society.",
			"",
			"**{race/Half-Orc}**",
			"",
			">Often fierce and savage, sometimes noble and resolute, half-orcs can manifest the best and worst qualities of their parent races. Many half-orcs struggle to keep their more bestial natures in check in order to epitomize the most heroic values of humanity. Unfortunately, many outsiders see half-orcs as hopeless abominations devoid of civility, if not monsters unworthy of pity or parley.",
			"",
			"**{race/Halfling}**",
			"",
			">Members of this diminutive race find strength in family, community, and their own innate and seemingly inexhaustible luck. While their fierce curiosity is sometimes at odds with their intrinsic common sense, halflings are eternal optimists and cunning opportunists with an incredible knack for getting out the worst situations.",
			"",
			"**{race/Human}**",
			"",
			">Ambitious, sometimes heroic, and always confident, humans have an ability to work together toward common goals that makes them a force to be reckoned with. Though short-lived compared to other races, their boundless energy and drive allow them to accomplish much in their brief lifetimes.",
			"",
			"## Less Common Races",
			"",
			"**{race/Aasimar}**",
			"",
			">Creatures blessed with a celestial bloodline, aasimars seem human except for some exotic quality that betrays their otherworldly origin. While aasimars are nearly always beautiful, something simultaneously a part of and apart from humanity, not all of them are good, though very few are evil. *(Also see: {monster/aasimar} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Catfolk}**",
			"",
			">A race of graceful explorers, catfolk are both clannish and curious by nature. They tend to get along with races that treat them well and respect their boundaries. They love exploration, both physical and intellectual, and tend to be natural adventurers. *(Also see: {monster/catfolk} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Dhampir}**",
			"",
			">The accursed spawn of vampires, dhampirs are living creatures tainted with the curse of undeath, which causes them to take damage from positive energy and gain healing from negative energy. While many members of this race embrace their dark sides, others are powerfully driven to rebel against their taint and hunt down and destroy vampires and their ilk. *(Also see: {monster/dhampir} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Drow}**",
			"",
			">Dark reflections of surface elves, drow are shadowy hunters who strive to snuff out the world's light. Drow are powerful magical creatures who typically serve demons, and only their chaotic nature stops them from becoming an even greater menace. A select few forsake their race's depraved and nihilistic society to walk a heroic path. *(Also see: {monster/drow} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Fetchling}**",
			"",
			">Long ago, fetchlings were humans exiled to the Shadow Plane, but that plane's persistent umbra has transformed them into a race apart. These creatures have developed an ability to meld into the shadows and have a natural affinity for shadow magic. Fetchlings - who call themselves kayal - often serve as emissaries between the inhabitants of the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane. *(Also see: {monster/fetchling} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Goblin}**",
			"",
			">Crazy pyromaniacs with a tendency to commit unspeakable violence, goblins are the smallest of the goblinoid races. While they are a fun-loving race, their humor is often cruel and hurtful. Adventuring goblins constantly wrestle with their darkly mischievous side in order to get along with others. Few are truly successful. *(Also see: {monster/goblin} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Hobgoblin}**",
			"",
			">These creatures are the most disciplined and militaristic of the goblinoid races. Tall, tough as nails, and strongly built, hobgoblins would be a boon to any adventuring group, were it not for the fact that they tend to be cruel and malicious, and often keep slaves. *(Also see: {monster/hobgoblin} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Ifrit}**",
			"",
			">Ifrits are a race descended from mortals and the strange inhabitants of the Plane of Fire. Their physical traits and personalities often betray their fiery origins, and they tend to be restless, independent, and imperious. Frequently driven from cities for their ability to manipulate flame, ifrits make powerful fire sorcerers and warriors who can wield flame like no other race. *(Also see: {monster/ifrit} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Kobold}**",
			"",
			">Considering themselves the scions of dragons, kobolds have diminutive statures but massive egos. A select few can take on more draconic traits than their kin, and many are powerful sorcerers, canny alchemists, and cunning rogues. *(Also see: {monster/kobold} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Orc}**",
			"",
			">Savage, brutish, and hard to kill, orcs are often the scourge of far-flung wildernesses and cavern deeps. Many orcs become fearsome barbarians, as they are muscular and prone to bloody rages. Those few who can control their bloodlust make excellent adventurers. *(Also see: {monster/orc} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Oread}**",
			"",
			">Creatures of human ancestry mixed with the blood of creatures from the Plane of Earth, oreads are as strong and solid as stone. Often stubborn and steadfast, their unyielding nature makes it hard for them to get along with most races other than dwarves. Oreads make excellent warriors and sorcerers who can manipulate the raw power of stone and earth. *(Also see: {monster/oread} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Ratfolk}**",
			"",
			">These small, ratlike humanoids are clannish and nomadic masters of trade. Often tinkers and traders, they are more concerned with accumulating interesting trinkets than amassing wealth. Ratfolk often adventure to find new and interesting curiosities rather than coin. *(Also see: {monster/ratfolk} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Sylph}**",
			"",
			">Ethereal folk of elemental air, sylphs are the result of human blood mixed with that of airy elemental folk. Like ifrits, oreads, and undines, they can become powerful elemental sorcerers with command over their particular elemental dominion. They tend to be beautiful and lithe, and have a knack for eavesdropping. *(Also see: {monster/sylph} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Tengu}**",
			"",
			">Long oppressed as a poor underclass within human nations and viewed as thieves and dishonorable scoundrels, many raven-headed tengus yearn to break free of these casterestrictions and stereotypes. *(Also see: {monster/tengu} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Tiefling}**",
			"",
			">Diverse and often despised by humanoid society, tieflings are mortals stained with the blood of fiends. Other races rarely trust them, and this lack of empathy usually causes tieflings to embrace the evil, depravity, and rage that seethe within their corrupt blood. A select few see the struggle to smother such dark desires as motivation for grand heroism. *(Also see: {monster/tiefling} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Undine}**",
			"",
			">Like their cousins, the ifrits, oreads, and sylphs, undines are humans touched by planar elements. They are the scions of elemental water, equally graceful both on land and in water. Undines are adaptable and resistant to cold, and have an affinity for water magic. *(Also see: {monster/undine} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"## Uncommon Races",
			"",
			"**{race/Changeling}**",
			"",
			">Women of strange powers, changelings are the unaware offspring of hags, living with mysterious gifts and unknowingly awaiting a call to become a hag themselves. *(Also see: {monster/changeling} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Duergar}**",
			"",
			">Gray skinned, deep-dwelling dwarves who hate their lighter skinned cousins, duergar view life as constant toil ending only in death. Though these dwarves are typically evil, honor and keeping one's word means everything to them, and a rare few make loyal adventuring companions. *(Also see: {monster/duergar} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Gillman}**",
			"",
			">Survivors of a land-dwelling culture whose homeland was destroyed, gillmen were saved and transformed into an amphibious race by the aboleths. Though in many ways they appear nearly human, gillmen's bright purple eyes and gills set them apart from humanity. Reclusive and suspicious, gillmen know that one day the aboleths will call in the debt owed to them. *(Also see: {monster/gillman} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Grippli}**",
			"",
			">Furtive frogfolk with the ability to camouflage themselves among fens and swamps, gripplis typically keep to their wetland homes, only rarely interacting with the outside world. Their chief motivation for leaving their marshy environs is to trade in metal and gems. *(Also see: {monster/grippli} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Kitsune}**",
			"",
			">These shapeshifting, foxlike folk share a love of mischief, art, and the finer things in life. They can appear as a single human as well as their true form, that of a foxlike humanoid. Kitsune are quick-witted, nimble, and gregarious, and because of this, a fair number of them become adventurers. *(Also see: {monster/kitsune} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Merfolk}**",
			"",
			">From the waist up, merfolk bear the torsos of well-built humans and delicate features reminiscent of elves and other humanoids tied to the natural world. *(Also see: {monster/merfolk} monster entry.)*",
			"",
			"**{race/Nagaji}**",

			"| :ripple[corruption/Aboleth] | The veiled masters have long controlled countless minions in the Inner Sea region's political arenas. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Accursed] | A foul curse has a deep hold on your body and soul. Your resentment toward the one who cursed you has taken on a life of its own. You notice slights against you by everyone around you, and can gain solace only by punishing them. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Amoral] | When an otherwise upstanding person turns to evil deeds to achieve his goals - whether by accident, due to sinister influence, or through desperation - he begins to slip, every excuse and justification furthering his descent into evil. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Deep One] | The waves call to you, like a siren's song echoing across crashing surf. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Demonic] | Close contact with the Abyss or demons clouds your mind and twists your body. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Ghoul] | A hunger for the flesh of the living grows more every day, until every sentient creature seems no more than a meal. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Hellbound] | The pit of Hell waits for your damned soul. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Hive] | Your body is a vessel for an invasive otherworldly species that seek to spread across the stars and devour all other life. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Lich] | Your attempt to transition into unlife has gone horribly awry and your soul is trapped. Lich corruption also works for becoming another sort of corporeal undead (except ghouls and vampires, which have their own corruptions). |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Lycanthropy] | There is a sound pulsing through your blood, a call to the wild and savage places of the world, where you are free to hunt and to kill to satisfy your bloodlust. You are filled with the desire to rend foes limb from limb with tooth and claw. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Plagued] | Disease can become a corruption when it causes long-lasting and physical changes to the body. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Possessed] | Whether it's an actual spirit or an alternate personality, another mind vies with you for control of your body. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Promethean] | Your body is slowly wasting away. As your body decays, you must gradually replace more and more of it with artificial components - corpse flesh, bone, wood, metal, or other exotic materials. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Psychometabolic] | Those who survive a brush with cosmic phenomena, occult mysteries, or horrors from beyond the veil occasionally find psychic abilities awakening in their minds. Although potent, such power corrupts the body, subconscious mind, and emotions - often with disastrous results. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Shadowbound] | Darkness and fear are all that guide you. As the shadow consumes you, you are becoming a gaunt caricature of your former self, emptied of life and color. |",
			"| :ripple[corruption/Vampirism] | You salivate when blood is spilled, and struggle against the urge to sink your teeth into the necks of friends and innocents. |",

			"The following terms and actions are some of the most commonly used around a game table.",
			"",
			"## Roleplaying Shorthand",
			"",
			"Below are several common abbreviations used when talking about the game.",
			"",
			"- **GM:** Game Master. The game's storyteller, referee, and director.",
			"- **PC:** Player Character. A character controlled by you or one of the other players.",
			"- **NPC:** Nonplayer Character. A character run by the Game Master, such as townsfolk, villains, monsters, and so on.",
			"- **1d4, 1d20, 2d6, etc:** How many dice of what type you need to roll; 1d20 translates into \"1 die with 20 sides,\" while 2d6 means \"2 dice with 6 sides each.\"",
			"- **DC:** Difficulty Class. The number you must match or roll higher than to succeed on a die roll.",
			"",
			"## Character Elements",
			"",
			"Every character has the following stats, which reflect their capabilities with regards to things like combat and interpersonal interactions.",
			"",
			"- **Abilities:** The [six abilities](rule/ability_scores) that define your character: {rule/Strength}, {rule/Constitution}, {rule/Dexterity}, {rule/Intelligence}, {rule/Wisdom}, and {rule/Charisma}. The higher the related number, the more significant the ability. Each ability has a [modifier](rule/determine_bonuses) that influences many other rolls.",
			"- **Initiative:** Your ability to react to danger. {rule/Initiative} is a d20 roll + Dexterity modifier + any bonus modifiers. The higher the result, the earlier you can act.",
			"- **Movement:** How many feet you can move with a single move action on your turn. Each square on a battle grid represents 5 feet.",
			"- **Saving Throw:** Your skill at avoiding negative effects, such as poisons, effects that target a wide area, or mental attacks, divided into three categories: Fortitude, Reflex, and Will. A [saving throw](rule/saving_throws) is a d20 roll + your relevant saving throw bonus + the relevant ability modifier (Constitution, Dexterity, and Wisdom, respectively).",
			"- **Skill Check:** Your ability to do something, from lying to climbing a wall or healing wounds. A {rule/skill check>s} is a d20 roll + your skill modifier from the related skill (if any).",
			"    - **Taking 10 and Taking 20:** [These are ways to reduce your chances of failing a check.](rule/taking_10_and_taking_20) They require extra time, and are not allowed for all uses of all skills.",
			"    - **Aid Another:** You [assist a friend](rule/aid_another) in their skill check.",
			"",
			"## Combat Basics",
			"",
			"These are some of the most common terms that arise during battle.",
			"",
			"- **AC:** This is your {rule/Armor Class,} a specific type of DC. This is the target number enemies need to hit you. Your basic AC is 10 + Dex modifier + armor bonus + shield bonus + spells or magic items that grant an AC bonus.",
			"    - **Touch AC:** It is generally easier to hit someone when you merely need to touch them. Your touch AC is the same as your regular AC, minus your armor bonus, shield bonus, and any natural armor bonus you may have.",
			"    - **Flat-Footed AC:** If you haven't yet acted in combat, you are considered \"flat-footed\" and are easier to hit. Your Flat-footed AC is the same as your regular AC, minus any Dexterity *bonus* you may have, and any dodge bonuses you may have.",
			"    - Your AC may temporarily improve if you have {rule/Cover} in between you and your attacker, and {rule/Concealment} can also help you evade an attack.",
			"- **hp:** Hit points. These represent your character's health, based on your Hit Dice. Damage subtracts hit points, while healing restores hit points.",
			"- **Attack roll:** [Resolving an attack.](rule/attack_roll)",
			"    - **Melee attack:** An attack in hand-to-hand combat. A basic melee attack is a d20 roll + base attack bonus + Strength modifier + any related or magical bonuses.",
			"    - **Ranged attack:** An attack with a projectile weapon, such as a bow and arrow. A basic ranged attack is a d20 roll + base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier + any related or magical bonuses.",
			"- **Damage:** Damage is determined by rolling the dice listed with the weapon. Melee weapons and thrown weapons deal their listed damage + your Strength modifier. Two-handed melee weapons will deal their listed damage + 1.5 &times; your Strength modifier (rounded down). Ranged weapons usually deal only their listed damage. Some weapons gain additional bonuses from magic or other effects. Spells do their listed damage.",
			"",
			"## Fractions",
			"",
			"In general, when you have to divide or multiply a number and end up with a fraction, you always round down: 4.999 and 4.001 would both be counted as 4. Exceptions will be clearly stated.",
			"",
			"## Actions During Combat",
			"",
			"Here's [an overview of combat](rule/how_combat_works), outlining how it starts and continues. {rule/This section summarizes |combat statistics.}",
			"",
			"Below are the most basic types of actions available during combat. A typical round involves one standard action and one move action per combatant, representing about 6 seconds in the game world.",
			"",
			"- A **standard action** allows you to do something, most commonly one attack roll, one spell with a casting time of 1 standard action, drinking one potion, or using most special abilities. You can take one standard action per round. You may also use a standard action to take a move action, explained next. {rule/Here are common |standard actions.}",
			"- A **move action** allows you to move up to your speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time, such as drawing a weapon, opening a door, dismounting a steed, loading a light or hand crossbow, getting something out of a pack. {rule/Here are common |move actions.}",
			"    - If you don't actually move during a round, you can take a free {rule/take_<5-foot step}}.",
			"- **Full-round actions** include making more than one attack, charging an enemy, loading a heavy or repeating crossbow, and running. [Here are more.](rule/full_round_actions)",
			"- A **swift action** consumes a very small amount of time. You can perform one swift action per turn.",
			"    - An **immediate action** is the same as swift action, but you can do it during someone else's turn. Using an immediate action before your turn \"uses up\" your swift action for the coming turn.",
			"    - Swift actions and immediate actions are generally rare and often involve feats, class abilities, or specific reactionary spells like {spell/feather fall}.",
			"- **Free actions** can be done at any time during your turn for free. They include speaking, dropping an item, dropping prone on the ground, [and more](rule/free_actions).",
			"",
			"## Advanced Combat Actions",
			"",
			"You can do more in battle than simply swing or shoot a weapon. On your turn you might attempt any of the following actions to hinder your opponents or aid your allies.",
			"",
			"- **Aid Another:** Sometimes the best way to defeat a foe is [to help an ally.](rule/aid_another_2) To do this, you must be in a position to attack your ally's opponent and make an attack roll against AC 10. If you succeed, your ally gains your choice of either a +2 bonus on his next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus on his AC against that opponent's next attack.",
			"- **Attacks of Opportunity (AoO):** Some actions reduce your attention or otherwise leave an opening in your defenses. This is called \"provoking an attack of opportunity.\" [AoOs](rule/attacks_of_opportunity) can be tough to understand on the fly, so be sure to read about them beforehand.",
			"- **Charge:** You rush at an enemy in [a reckless rush.](rule/charge) By moving at least 10 feet in a straight line at your foe, you gain a +2 bonus on one attack roll but take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your next turn.",
			"- **Combat Maneuvers:** There's more to combat that just striking a foe with your weapon. The following are {rule/combat_maneuvers} any character might perform. Your Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB) influences your ability to perform these attacks, while your Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD) determines your skill at resisting them.",
			"    - **{rule/Bull Rush:}** A charge that forces an enemy backward.",
			"    - **{rule/Dirty Trick:}** An action that causes a minor hindrance to an enemy.",
			"    - **{rule/Disarm:}** A strike that knocks an item from an enemy's hands.",
			"    - **{rule/Drag:}** Drag a foe in a straight line behind you without doing any harm.",
			"    - **{rule/Grapple:}** An attempt to grab and hold an enemy.",
			"    - **{rule/Overrun:}** A dash carrying you through an enemy's space.",
			"    - **{rule/Reposition:}** Force a foe to move to a different position without doing any harm.",
			"    - **{rule/Steal:}** An attempt to take an item from a foe by force.",
			"    - **{rule/Sunder:}** An attack that breaks something held or worn by an enemy.",
			"    - **{rule/Trip:}** A strike that knocks an enemy down.",
			"- **Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB):** Attempts to use combat maneuvers rely on a character's Combat Maneuver Bonus (or CMB). Your CMB is your base attack bonus + Strength modifier + a special size modifier. This number is added to a d20 roll whenever you attempt one of the combat maneuvers noted above.",
			"- **Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD):** To succeed at a combat maneuver (or for a foe to succeed at a maneuver against you) you must make a combat maneuver roll that equals or exceeds your target's Combat Maneuver Defense. Your CMD is 10 + base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + a special size modifier.",
			"- **Flanking:** When a character or enemy is in battle with foes directly on opposite sides of him (directly in front and behind for example), he is considered \"flanked.\" Those who attack a flanked foe gain a +2 bonus on melee attack rolls against that foe.",
			"",
			"## Common Conditions",
			"",
			"- **Dazed:** The character can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.",
			"- **Dazzled:** The character has a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks.",
			"- **Dying:** Creatures that have negative hit points and have not stabilized are dying. On their next turn, and on all subsequent turns, the dying character must make a DC 10 Constitution check to become *stable*. The penalty on this roll is equal to their negative hp.",
			"- **Entangled:** The creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, has -2 on all attack rolls and -4 to Dexterity. If casting a spell, must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.",
			"- **Exhausted:** The character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, has -6 to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued.",
			"- **Fatigued:** The character cannot run nor charge and has -2 to Strength and Dexterity. Cured with 8 hours of complete rest. Extra fatigue leads to the exhausted condition.",
			"- **Flat-footed:** A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, loses their Dexterity bonus and dodge bonuses to AC (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.",
			"- **Helpless:** A character paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent's mercy. Treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (-5 modifier). Melee attacks against them are at +4. Ranged attacks get no special bonus. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.",
			"- **Prone:** The character is lying on the ground. They have a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls, cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow), and take a -4 AC penalty against melee attacks. However, they also gain a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks. Standing up is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"- **Shaken:** The creature has -2 on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is the first stage of fear.",
			"- **Sickened:** The character has -2 on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.",
			"- **Stunned:** The character drops everything held, can't take actions, takes -2 to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).",
			"",
			"The full list of conditions can be found [here](rule/conditions).",
			"",
			"## Identifying Monsters",
			"",
			"You can use Knowledge skills to identify the type of monster you're dealing with, and perhaps remember its strengths or weaknesses. The Knowledge skill used depends on the monster's type:",
			"",
			"- **Acrana:** constructs, dragons, magical beasts",
			"- **Dungeoneering:** aberrations, oozes",
			"- **Local:** humanoids",
			"- **Nature:** animals, fey, monstrous humanoids, plants, vermin",
			"- **Planes:** outsiders",
			"- **Religion:** undead",
			"",
			"## Magic Items",
			"",
			"There is a limit to how many magic items you can utilize at the same time, based on \"slots\", [explained here](rule/magic_items_on_the_body).",
			"",
			"Many items are clear as to which slot they occupy. For example, helmets will use the head slot and boots will use the feet slot. However, some items are ambiguous. Cloaks sometimes use the body slot, and sometimes use the shoulders slot. Gauntlets can use the hands slot or the wrists slot. Always check the item in question to be sure.",
