Sometimes Ulfen raiders might put in at a nearby, uninhabited harbor so as to approach their quarry on foot from inland, using nearby terrain as cover. However they approach, the raiders aim to catch their prize unawares to prevent their prey from fleeing with valuable plunder. When a group of raiders attacks, the clamorous sound of their Ulfen war songs floats over the din of battle, and the battle plan changes from stealth to intimidation. While Ulfen raiders have a keen sense of tactics, they prefer to fight as bold individuals, rather than in strict formations, in hopes of gaining personal glory. Once battle commences, Ulfen raiders often form a wedge of spears to drive their way through enemy lines. They use shield wall tactics when outnumbered or when they encounter stiff opposition.",

			"After a successful attack, Ulfen raiders quickly gather loot and valuable captives onto their longships. As well as coins and other riches, the raiders often take bulky luxury goods that are hard to obtain in their homeland, such as well-made furniture or carpets, and even appropriate highpedigree livestock to increase the quality of their own herds. Slaves are often harvested from the ranks of a village's ablebodied youths. While Ulfen raiders seize anything of value that they can bring on board their longships, they are unlikely to wantonly destroy a raided settlement. After all, if the settlement is able to eventually recover from the attack, it can provide more plunder in the next raiding season.",
			"",
			"In large groups, Ulfen raiders can take over a wide area of countryside, and often demand an exorbitant payment from local leaders to move on. Smaller communities frequently pay, rather than attempting the expensive process of raising an army and then fighting an uncertain battle against these bloodthirsty raiders."

Founded in 23 AR by the god Aroden, who commanded soldiers to defend the city walls against the First Siege of Absalom, the First Guard has stood vigil over the city ever since, and its members play a large role in the City at the Center of the World's impenetrable defenses. Thanks to the efforts of the First Guard, the city has never, in the course of its nearly 5 millennia of existence, fallen to either outside invaders or plots from within its walls.",
			"",
			"The First Guard today consists not only of elite soldiers, but also of skilled wizards and scouts who dedicate themselves to uncovering any threats to the safety of the city and to dealing with any dangers as they arise. While each member of the First Guard brings her own talents and training to her post, all soldiers are drilled in melee combat (usually with both a polearm and a sword), military tactics, the laws of Absalom, and the use of siege engines in the event the city's walls should need to be defended at a moment's notice.",
			"",
			"Members of the First Guard serve in a much more militaristic role than their counterparts on the city watch, with whom they share their headquarters in Azlanti Keep. Unlike the city watch, whose duties consist of keeping the peace and policing the city's laws, the First Guard is ever vigilant for threats to the city from both beyond and within its walls. The First Guard wards Azlanti Keep and makes up the core of the Absalom military, commanding other troops - both enlisted and conscripted - in times of war.",
			"",
			"The First Guard is unique in that each soldier within the unit swears an oath to defend the city of Absalom, but not specifically to defend the Grand Council. In the millennia since the First Guard's founding, such a stipulation has saved the city on numerous occasions when the guards' investigations into members of the council uncovered treasonous plots. Bringing these conspiracies to justice has always been a relatively simple matter because no First Guard soldier ever questions where her true loyalties lie."

Duergar tend to focus on capturing individuals from races that are already adapted to life in the Darklands, particularly their dwarven kin, but they aren't averse to making slaves of those who originated on the surface or of other Darklands denizens with valuable skills should an easy opportunity arise.",

After all, a lame slave is worth less gold at market than one with who has his full physical faculties. Mental scars, in contrast, may actually add value if they help ensure the slave's compliance."

They travel not as seditionists (unless they are subverting tyranny), but rather as emissaries sharing the national narrative that makes Andoran unique among the nations. They are also trained listeners, culling important intelligence from information commonly available in the foreign lands they roam, returning to Andoran with invaluable details about attitudes and activities abroad."

			"One does not step lightly on the path to becoming a [Hellknight](rule/aff_lawknights). A Hellknight is not simply a disciplined warrior, nor is she just a strict supporter of a lawful society. A Hellknight is an instrument of unyielding, inevitable order. Every Hellknight knows that she and her fellows are the tools by which society will be broken and remade in accordance with the teachings of their code, which they call \"The Measure and the Chain.\" By that code, all who live must be forced to obey the law. Only by imposing order can the Hellknights establish justice; only by overcoming the most difficult trials can a mortal be made worthy and able to impose that order.",

She has not yet earned a rank or title from her chosen order and instead serves one or more Hellknights as a squire or banner bearer while she prepares herself to undertake the tests of knighthood. An armiger strives to emulate her betters by mastering the order's favored weapons - such as the glaive for those among the Order of the Pyre - and learning the Measure's seemingly endless list of infractions and violations and the required punishments for each.",
			"",
			"An armiger also studies the lore of Hell of the infernal realms. This study serves two purposes. First, it allows her to understand and apply infernal law without mercy-valued because that infernal realm is an unflinching example of absolute order. Second, it prepares her to do battle with Hell's minions. These battles are required for admittance into the ranks of the Hellknights, but they continue throughout a knight's development, as her courage and strength are constantly tested to ensure that she remains worthy.",
			"",
			"Hellknight armigers are most likely to be found in the lands and towns surrounding their order's citadel. Because they are not yet full Hellknights, they may not travel outside of the areas controlled by their order without permission. When they do travel with a contingent of Hellknights, it is usually as part of a test of discipline, loyalty, or courage. Those who fail are subjected to the same terrible punishments as any who break the law."

Where this notion came from is anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn such tengus, referred to as \"jinx eaters,\" some special treatment aboard ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conflicts altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn and steel.",
			"",
			"Jinx eaters are typically mad for plunder, especially seeking out jewelry and other such baubles, at times even lifting them from unsuspecting shipmates. Such pilfering inevitably leads to angry confrontations onboard, and the kleptomaniacal tengu must rely on his reputation as a source of good luck if he is to be spared a severe beating at the hands of his cohorts.",
			"",
			"Several settlements around the Shackles host rookeries of decent size, and it is common to find retired jinx eaters in such districts; often these are particularly boastful individuals who have given up on the life at sea or have been ousted from their old ship by their increasingly jaded crew members."

Often skilled singers as well, kitharodes play the kithara as accompaniment to dances, epic recitations, odes, and songs, as well as the odd solo performance.",

They are drilled in combat as well as magic, and learn to use their performances to sway the thoughts and attitudes of any audience. To successfully pass the rigorous final exams, a prospective graduate must demonstrate that her mind and body have both been honed to keen precision.",

Kitharodian Academy performers are also frequently skilled duelists, as competition for engagements, noble favors, and prestigious awards is fierce and sometimes violent. A graduate of the academy can easily become a popular celebrity, but fame and fortune are fickle and fleeting, never more so than in Oppara's cutthroat high society - the toast of the town today can find herself penniless and forgotten tomorrow.",
			"",

Others forsake the performance halls of the cities for the open road, seeking fame of a different sort, drawn by the lure of a life filled with adventure."

			"Just as the legendary Mistress Ordellia Whilwren once prayed to a mysterious angel to save Magnimar from a devastating deluge, other dwellers of the city have likewise devoted themselves to holy figures, including angels, azatas, and agathions. Called \"mystery cultists\" by most Magnimarians because of their small numbers and esoteric manner of worship, the dedicated followers of the empyreal lords keep to themselves and rarely proselytize. Most mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues.",

Some nobles may hail from families with a long lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers. In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the region.",

			"When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 AR and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most influential and significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled by blas&eacute; nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine.",

			"While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up, corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's holdings. Many of the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent threats to the city."

Their unique fighting style and unusual weapons bring numerous spectators to gladiatorial events, and their strength, skill, and fearlessness make them exciting to watch. Outside the ring, Shoanti gladiators live well. Tavern owners gift brawlers with free drinks and meals after a successful bout, and canny bartenders often sponsor gladiatorial warriors, using their local celebrity to drum up more business and set their establishment apart from the rest. Such subsidized fighters are usually garnered from among the many toughs that frequent Magnimar's dives, and one can never be sure when an accidental bar brawl might turn into a potential business opportunity."

Any place Norgorber's dark followers are found, one could expect at least one who follows the aspect of Father Skinsaw.",
			"",
			"Skinsaw cultists seek ecstasy with every slaying. They offer their acts of murder in the name of Father Skinsaw, and believe that when they finally meet death, every kill they made in his name will grant them a higher status in the afterlife. Skinsaw cultists don't waste their efforts on those they consider lesser targets, like vagrants, prostitutes, or commoners, instead choosing their marks from influential members of society and others who exhibit strength and hold power. This is not for any sort of political gain, but rather to offer Norgorber only the best possible sacrifices.",
			"",
			"Worshipers of Norgorber following one of the god's other three aspects interact with Skinsaw cultists in different ways. Those who revere Blackfingers may work with Skinsaw cultists in order to provide their deadly poisons for the Skinsaw cultists' blades, more concerned about proliferating poison than the act of murder. Followers of the Reaper of Reputation may guide Skinsaw cultists toward choice targets, using them as tools to enact their political machinations, preferring that those they wish dead be slain by a fellow Norgorberite. Many who follow Norgorber's fourth aspect, that of the Gray Master, tend to avoid Skinsaw cultists unless they have a need to sow chaos and terror. While they believe murder is certainly a tool of thievery, it is a secondary aspect, and makes for a sloppier job in the eyes of their masked deity.",
			"",
			"Skinsaw cultists rarely interact with followers of Father Skinsaw from different cells, each city typically hosting only one such cult. That said, when a fellow cultist comes through a foreign town, a local cell will always take her in temporarily, sometimes even urging her to kill while there. Occasionally, however, a Skinsaw cultist receives a calling from her god to travel the world and leave a wake of murder and mayhem in her wake. In these instances, such a slayer would likely seek out safe havens in unfamiliar ports, relying on her compatriots to guide her to choice targets in each new city.",
