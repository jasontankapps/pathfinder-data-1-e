A meditative spell must already be prepared at the time when you start your 1-hour spell preparation ritual, and at the end of that time, the meditative spell of your choosing is cast, leaving you with that one spell slot used for the remainder of the day. You can have only one meditative spell in effect on you at any one time. All meditative spells have a range of personal and a target of you, and they can't be brewed into potions or part of similar one-use items like elixirs. A meditative spell can be placed on a scroll or in a wand, but the act of casting the spell must always be incorporated into the user's spell-preparation time; it also takes 1 hour for a character who succeeds at an appropriate Use Magic Device check to operate such an item. Though some of these spells are on the cleric spell list, they can't be part of an oracle's list of spells known. Spontaneous casters such as oracles or sorcerers cannot benefit from the effects of a meditative spell, nor can characters who use such magic without preparation via Use Magic Device and a magic item, since part of the process of casting and maintaining the effects of a meditative spell involves tying the act of weaving the magic into the very process of meditation and study that a prepared spellcaster (such as a cleric or wizard) undergoes at the start of every day."

Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells.

The one attempting the check can correctly identify the spell only by exceeding the DC by 10. The false spell is typically a level lower than the ruse spell, so skill checks use the DC for the lower-level spell. Even {spell/detect magic} and most similar spells don't prevent the caster from being fooled by a ruse spell. {spell/Analyze dweomer}, {spell/greater arcane sight}, and similar spells of the same or higher spell level that automatically identify spells reveal a ruse spell for what it is. Ruse spells that mimic harmless spells still list harmless on their saving throw or spell resistance lines; a creature that knows or suspects the true nature of the spell typically chooses to attempt the save."
