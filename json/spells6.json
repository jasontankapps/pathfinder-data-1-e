This is different for every petitioner and usually requires research to discover, although those who knew the petitioner well in life can often identify the item easily.

The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well.

The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma's code of conduct."
