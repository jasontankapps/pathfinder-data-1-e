			"One of the most potent tools a spellcasters can wield is the command of summoned creatures; the most powerful of these spells call forth allies mightier than mere flesh, reaching from the depths of Hell to the peaks of Heaven, and even stranger places beyond the pale. When reaching for knowledge and forces from other planes, a spellcaster must have control over the strengths and weaknesses of their targets, or face doom far worse than any that might be visited upon them in the Material Plane. A spellcaster wishing to bind such creatures who cannot play to the desires of his summoned captive will surely lose control, and may find himself torn from his reality as a plaything of the multiverse's cruelest tormentors."

			"The first step in calling extraplanar assistance is to determine the method of bringing the outsider to the Material Plane. If the caster is a cleric, the spell of choice is {spell/planar ally}; wizard, sorcerers, and summoners rely primarily on {spell/planar binding} (or [summon monster](spell/summon_monster_1), which controls without requiring binding). However, none of these necessarily bind the outsider to the caster's needs, and a wise spellcaster augments the summoning with additional encouragement, usually in the form of gifts or bargains.",
			"",
			"### Divine Casters",
			"",
			"Clerics and oracles find the job of summoning and binding outsiders much easier than arcane spellcasters do. A cleric calls upon her deity to send a like-minded creature by way of one of the {spell/planar ally} spells. That outsider is in the service of the god, and its desires almost always align with the cleric's goals, or at least run in parallel with them.",
			"",
			"The cleric must bargain with the deity's servant for a payment agreed upon before the outsider will perform the task: gold, magic items, gifts, sacrifices, or promises by the cleric to achieve certain goals particular to the conjured ally. The greater the task, the greater the payment required, with a minimum of 100 gp worth of goods or services, sometimes extending into the thousands - and sometimes the ally simply refuses the cleric's binding if the job is too dangerous or beneath its dignity.",
			"",
			"### Arcane Casters",
			"",
			"The arcane method for binding outsiders is more difficult. First, a binder must create a trap, a [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) focused inward. Typically the circle is outlined in a substance that is anathema to the outsider he wishes to summon. He must protect this circle against any sort of disruption, for even the smallest variation in its energies opens the circle and allows the escape of the creature he has summoned. It is for this reason that most binders' lairs are in high towers or deep dungeons, far from wind or pests.",
			"",
			"When an arcane caster speaks the words of the {spell/planar binding} spell, the outsider can resist via a Will saving throw, with no aid from its spell resistance. If it fails the save, the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) draws it inexorably into the trap. Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). Succeeding at any of these checks breaks the binding, and a fortunate binder suffers no additional harm from such a breach; the annoyed outsider just leaves. This is not always the case, however.",
			"",
			"Some outsiders lash out at their failed binders. Because of this, many binders take additional precautions: a second [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) in which they can stand, and {spell/dimensional anchor} cast within the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) to prevent the conjured outsider from fleeing instantly. A tremendously powerful wizard or sorcerer might even use {spell/trap the soul} on his victim, forcing it into a prepared vessel until it agrees to the binder's strictures.",
			"",
			"Smart arcane binders often make deals with the creatures they call. Like clerics using {spell/planar ally}, they bargain and shower the outsider with gifts in exchange for their services. While it is always good for an arcane spellcaster to make these deals from a position of strength, it is much better to get the outsider to come to mutually agreed upon terms for the service, rather than forcing it to commit actions against its nature or desires."

			"There is one method of outsider coercion that helps guarantee that a binder can bargain from a position of relative security. Many spellcasters believe that a ***true name*** is inscribed on the essence of every creature, a secret word that describes it so perfectly and utterly that to speak the name is to define the being. For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders' true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated. It is said that some outsiders have assumed names and that they use the aliases to lure foolish mortals into using for summoning; the outsider pretends to be under the control of the binder, but merely bides its time before it strikes.",
			"",
			"To discover a single outsider's true name, a spellcaster must spend at least a month in a library or on a quest of discovery to uncover occult mysteries and riddles hidden in the pages of books, scrolls, and glyphs written millennia ago, buried in ancient temples or found among the ravings of madmen's spellbooks. At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. The GM can increase the DC by +2, +5, or even +10, based on the power of the outsider or the circumstances of the true name search. A failure by 5 or more turns up false information that may expose researchers to unexpected dangers.",
			"",
			"For most outer-planar outsiders, knowledge of the creature's true name is a powerful weapon. In summoning, if the name is spoken correctly (requiring knowledge of at least one of the outsider's languages, or a Linguistics skill check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's Hit Dice), the target takes a -5 penalty on the Will save to resist being conjured, and if its name is inscribed in the protective [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil), the outsider takes a -5 penalty on all checks to escape or breach that circle.",
			"",
			"For elementals (including geniekind), such true names are not binding as they are for fiends and other outsiders, and do not give the creature a penalty to its Will save to resist being summoned. However, if the caster speaks the true name of the elemental, the elemental will most likely be intrigued enough to listen - a wizard with power and cunning enough to find an elemental's true name is a wizard with guile and strength, and elementals treasure these qualities.",
			"",
			"Not all outsiders have true names. The chaotic and primeval nature of proteans defies the strange logic of true names, as does the writhing chaotic nature of the qlippoth. It is unclear whether aeons have true names. There are those sages who believe each aeon has two true names, and only by finding out both names can a creature gain some control over the aeon, but such matters are purely conjecture."

Indeed, if the gift is sweet enough, the outsider may choose not to break the strictures of the summoning, even if it has the opportunity to do so. All gifts, whether or not they are good enough to please the outsider, disappear at the spell's conclusion.

The greater lords of the daemons' the deacons and the Four Horsemen themselves - are almost never summoned. Whether this is because they force others to arrive in their place, or because they have somehow anchored themselves to the plane of Abaddon, none can say with certainty.",

			"***Ceustodaemon:*** The most common daemons summoned to the Material Plane, ceustodaemons are relatively easy to deal with, though none know if this is because of some deliberate action by more powerful daemons. They are often called guardian daemons, as they are frequently bound to that task.",

Less intelligent than cacodaemons and twice as vicious, derghodaemons do not deal with any creature, and relentlessly attempt to escape their binding, usually with brute force.",
			"",
			"***Hydrodaemon (SR 19):*** On their home plane, these vile creatures swim the River Styx; on the Material Plane, they are often called to serve as guardians in swamps and sanctuaries of unscrupulous spellcasters. More pliable than most of their fiendish kin, hydrodaemons take treasure and the promise of souls as gifts for their services.",
			"",

Even those olethrodaemons serving one of the Four Horsemen as paragons can be summoned, though it is often assumed that such a feat is done only at their master's whim.",

Those who renege on their bargains with gelugons often learn what it means to displease Hell.",

Each elemental type is uniquely suited to adapting to conditions on its particular plane, and is arrogant about its powers when surrounded by its element... and uniquely frightened and cowed when shown a greater power or encased in an element not its own. Most elementals do not bargain for favors - they respect only strength. Genies are the more human-like denizens of the elemental planes, both in shape and mentality.

			"",
			"***Earth Elemental:*** Prepare the summoning chamber with swirling wind- and air-based spells to prevent the elemental from touching the floor. Maintaining this state for 5 rounds demonstrates the binder's superiority over the elemental, and grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check.",
			"",
			"***Efreeti:*** These warlike creatures value weapons with enhancement bonuses of at least +2 and scrolls of 4th-level or higher spells; these provide a +2 bonus on the binder's Charisma check. Efreet also appreciate attractive humanoid slaves, which give a +1 bonus on the binder's Charisma check for every 10 slaves offered.",
			"",
			"***Fire Elementals:*** When summoning a fire elemental, enclose the casting chamber with stone, remove flammable materials from the room, and prepare a magic circle and spells to protect against fire. Keeping large blocks of ice in the room saps the elemental's power and cows it into submission more quickly, giving the caster a +4 bonus on the Charisma check to trap the elemental.",
			"",
			"***Ice Elemental:*** Binders use actual fire, fire spells, protections against cold, and sometimes even fire creatures to keep ice elementals at bay during summoning. An ice elemental often yields to its binder as soon as serious melting occurs.",
			"",
			"***Invisible Stalker:*** The tactics used to bind invisible stalkers are similar to those used for binding air elementals. Unlike many elementals, invisible stalkers bargain for their services, which is why they are often summoned by mortal spellcasters.",

			"***Janni:*** The weakest of the genies, the jann are also proud and prone to insult. Gifts of rich fabrics, gems, or jewelry worth 1,000 gp or more soften their outlook and give the conjurer a +2 bonus on her Charisma check.",

			"***Lightning Elemental:*** Lightning elementals are similar to air elementals in that the same bindings work on them, though binders would do well to reinforce such bindings and themselves with protections against electrical damage.",
			"",
			"***Marid:*** Capricious and unpredictable, marids love performance and art-providing them artwork worth 1,000 gp or playing a DC 30 Perform (any) piece (whether performed by the binder or his ally) piques their interest long enough for the conjurer to gain a +2 Charisma bonus.",

			"",
			"***Mud Elemental:*** While mud elementals vary in consistency, all of them fear becoming too watery or too dry, as both conditions have adverse effects on them. Using air spells and petrification spells as punishments for non-compliance usually makes these elementals more willing to take direction and enter into negotiations for appropriate gifts for services rendered.",

			"",
			"***Shaitan:*** As the most dense and brash of the genies, shaitans like games of chance and physical skill best of all. Should the caster offer services in exchange for a throw of the dice or a wrestling match - and go through with the offer - he'll receive a +2 bonus on his Charisma check.",
			"",
			"***Thoqqua:*** Natives of the harsh landscape where the Planes of Fire and Earth collide, thoqquas are dangerous creatures to summon and bind, and typically rage against their confines, even when properly bound. Those wishing to bind a thoqqua frequently use mephit intermediaries, as those creatures seem to understand thoqquas enough to calm them.",
			"",
			"***Water Elemental:*** When summoning a water elemental, remove sources of water from the room and prepare a bonfire. A ring of fire around the magic circle exposes the elemental to its hated enemy the instant it appears on the Material Plane, distracting it long enough for the binder to seize control. This is an opposed Will check, granting a +1 bonus to the caster for each large fire in the room; success grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check."

			"The {feat/Craft Construct} feat allows a spellcaster to create all manner of permanent constructs in a process much like magic item creation. Each construct has a purchase price and a crafting cost, along with a list of requirements and the skills used to create them. Some require special materials in addition to the cost for basic crafting supplies, generally for the construct's body. Special material costs increase both the purchase price and the crafting cost of the construct. The DC to craft a construct is 5 + the default caster level of the construct, just like for a magic item. Like when crafting magic items, a creator with a sufficiently high skill bonus may ignore these requirements. Each missing requirement increases the Craft DC by 5. Regardless, the creator must meet all item creation feats and minimum caster level requirements. Crafting a construct takes 1 day per 1,000 gp in the item's base price, excluding any special material costs. This process is identical to the process for crafting a magic item, including the rules for accelerating creation and handling interruptions."

As a rough guideline, a construct's price is equal to its challenge rating squared, then multiplied by 500 gp. Constructs with a fractional CR rating base their price on that fraction of 500 gp. For example, a CR 1/2 construct has a price of 250 gp. The cost of magical supplies for the {feat/Craft Construct} feat is half this price, with the construct taking 1 day to create per 1,000 gp of the construct's base price. Some constructs, particularly golems, have additional raw material costs that must be paid in full, regardless of whether the creator possesses the {feat/Craft Construct} feat. Raw materials typically cost somewhere between 5% and 10% of the construct's base price.",

Examples of special abilities include having a higher DR value than a typical construct of its CR (above DR 5 for CRs 1-8, above DR 10 for CR 9+), monster statistics that exceed those recommended for the [construct's CR](rule/step_2_target_statistics), the standard golem immunity to magic, DR or hardness that can't be overcome by all adamantine weapons, ability to be fully healed by a single spell, and most special attacks and special qualities.",

Animated objects are a special case - their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points (see the [Animated Object monster entry](monster/animated_object)), since these abilities are already factored into an animated object's CR. In addition, golems and homunculi created with extra Hit Dice, the advanced template, or shield guardian abilities should all be priced as described in the Bestiary, rather than by adjusting pricing for their new CR.",
			"",
			"Abilities that weaken or potentially place a construct at a disadvantage rarely reduce the construct's price. An exception is the berserk ability. Constructs that have a chance of going berserk receive -1 CR adjustment to their calculated price if control can be reestablished (like a flesh golem) or -2 CR adjustment for permanent loss of control (like a clay golem).",
			"",
			"The following is an example of the calculated costs for creating a stone golem (CR 11). A stone golem's special abilities are golem immunity to magic, full healing from {spell/transmute mud to rock}, a high to-hit bonus (+22 vs. the +19 typical for CR 11), and the ability to slow its foes. Further, since its spell vulnerabilities are not tied to common spells or effects, its immunity to magic cost is doubled, giving the stone golem a total of 5 special abilities. The first special ability doesn't affect the cost, the next two increase the cost by +1/2 CR each, and the final two each increase the cost by +1 CR individually, making its effective CR for pricing equal to 14. This produces a calculated price of 98,000 gp, rounded up to an even 100,000 gp.",

When you design a spell, you have to take those power levels into account by comparing the new spell to existing spells in the Core Rulebook - a spell has to fall into the narrow range of power for one of the nine spell levels (plus cantrips or orisons). In contrast, prices for magic items are strongly granular, and are calculated to the gold piece based on precisely what features the item possesses. In other words, if you add more power to a magic item, you just increase its price to compensate, but if you add too much power to a spell, you have to make it a higher-level spell, which means you then have to compare it to a different set of example spells.",

Just as it's not necessary to know whether a wizard is using squid ink or ink from a rare plant when crafting a [scroll of burning hands](spell/burning_hands), it's not necessary to know whether he's modifying gestures described in Irulark's Incunabulum or altering the pronunciation of words detailed in Murlost's Great Grimoire to create a new 1st-level attack spell. While it's fine to include these elements for flavor, particularly in a high-narrative campaign, they don't affect the outcome of the item crafting or spell research, both of which largely take place outside of game time. Therefore, this section is about the game mechanics of a player or GM designing a new spell, not the in-world requirements of a character researching a new spell.",

			"Compare your spell to similar spells, and to other spells of its intended level.",

The entire process is a matter of comparing the new spell you're creating to other spells and evaluating whether your spell is weaker, stronger, or about the same as that spell or group of spells. Designing a spell requires a firm understanding of all the game's rules, not just those related to spells. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of some unwritten game assumptions, most of which are discussed throughout this section.",
			"",
			"**Example:** If you look at the spell list in the Core Rulebook, you'll notice that there isn't a 1st-level wizard spell that deals sonic damage. You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after {spell/burning hands}, except dealing sonic damage instead of fire - perhaps you'd call it sonic screech. However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: \"sonic\" as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before \"sonic\" was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, sonic screech will almost always be a better spell than {spell/burning hands}. That means if you introduce sonic screech into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of burning hands. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices - and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this.",
			"",
			"### Core is King",
			"",
			"When designing a new spell, you should always compare it to the spells in the Core Rulebook to get a sense of whether the spell is strong or weak for its level. You can compare it to spells in other books as well, but you should use the Core Rulebook as a baseline. This is because if a spell in another sourcebook pushes the boundaries of what's acceptable or balanced, even just by a little bit, it's easy to push the boundaries a little more with your new spell, which means that over time, new spells end up more and more powerful compared to those in the Core Rulebook. The Core Rulebook spells are the most playtested, optimal versions of spells in the game - new spells shouldn't be significantly better than them (see also the {rule/Benchmarks} section).",
			"",
			"Remember that it's acceptable to make a spell that isn't as powerful as an existing spell. Just because it's not the best spell of its level doesn't mean it won't get used by adventurers. In fact, that's why easily crafted scrolls are a significant part of the game - to allow parties access to spells they wouldn't normally prepare or learn, but may find useful in some circumstances."

A typical damage spell deals 1 die of damage (typically a d6) per caster level for an arcane spell (for example, {spell/shocking grasp} or {spell/fireball}), or 1 die of damage (typically a d6, but sometimes a d8) per two caster levels for a divine spell (for example, {spell/searing light}).",

			"When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, {spell/searing light} is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the reduced damage against constructs).",
			"",
			"**Tip:** If your spell does *more* damage than the amount defined on the table, you should reduce the damage or increase the spell's level. If your spell does *less* damage than the amount defined on the table, you should increase the damage or add another effect to the spell. An example of this is {spell/sound burst}, which only deals 1d8 points of damage (this amount never increases), but can stun creatures in the area.",

			"The simplest spells only affect one target, whether that target is a creature, an object, or just the caster. Technically, a spell that only affects the caster (with a range of \"personal\" and target of \"you\") is slightly weaker than one with a target of \"one creature,\" because being able to cast the spell on anyone makes it more versatile and thus more powerful. However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell \"caster-only\" should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they've always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.",
			"",
			"**Example:** {spell/Shield} and {spell/true strike} are both 1st-level spells that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells on others, they'd still be at the right power level for 1st-level spells - they aren't 2nd-level spells that you knocked down a level because you designed them as caster-only. {spell/Shield} has always been a spell that only affects the caster, and there's a game-balance reason to keep it that way: because {spell/shield} grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee character means the fighter could drop his actual shield and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra damage. {spell/True strike} was deliberately designed as a caster-only spell so a sorcerer couldn't just cast it every round on the fighter, who'd be guaranteed a hit against a difficult monster even if he used {feat/Combat Expertise} (for extra AC) and {feat/Power Attack} (for extra damage). Making those spells caster-only doesn't really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.",
			"",
			"A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like {spell/fireball}), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like {spell/slow}). A burst effect like {spell/fireball} can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your-targets spell like {spell/slow}, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use {spell/slow}. Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many)."

Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat, and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster - even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.",
			"",
			"In indoor situations, most medium-range combat spells may as well have an infinite range, because at the level the caster gains access to the spell, the caster can reach 150 feet or more, and few encounters deal with ranges that far - the caster can hit anything he can see. Even outdoors, a spell with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by 30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat - longer than many tables used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in abstract situations like launching a {spell/fireball} at enemies across a large prairie, using {spell/dimension door} to return to an earlier (and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.",
			"",
			"Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for most purposes. Given that the {feat/Enlarge Spell} feat doubles a spell's range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the {feat/Reach Spell} feat increases the range by one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it's reasonable to balance a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell that works like {spell/cure light wounds} (normally 1st level) at close range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell.",

If your PC didn't get any chance to resist the effect with a save or to dodge it entirely because of a failed attack roll, would you be annoyed, embarrassed, or angry? If so, you should give the spell some kind of save or attack roll, just so it's not an always-effective option.",

For example, this makes them immune to creature-oriented polymorphing spells, but not spells such as {spell/disintegrate}, which can attack objects.",

			"***Reflex Save:*** Spells with Reflex saves usually create a physical burst or spread in an area, like an explosion, which the target is able to dodge with a successful saving throw. In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect. Note that you shouldn't build a spell where the caster makes an attack roll and the target also makes a Reflex saving throw; doing so brings Dexterity into play twice for the same spell (once for the target's AC, once for the target's Reflex save modifier).",

For example, {spell/wall of stone} conjures an instantaneous wall of stone that cannot be dispelled; spell resistance doesn't help you walk through the spell's wall any more than it would if you tried to walk through a mortared stone wall in a castle - neither wall is magical, and both walls remain there even if you use {spell/dispel magic} or {spell/antimagic field} on them.",
			"",
			"The general rule is that most spells allow spell resistance. Only when you're deliberately designing a spell that creates a nonmagical object or nonmagical effect is spell resistance likely to be irrelevant. You can use {spell/move earth} (instantaneous duration) to create a hill, and spell resistance won't help you get over or through the hill because the spell moves the earth and thereafter stops being magical; likewise, you can use {spell/move earth} to create a pit, and spell resistance won't help you ignore the pit because it's a nonmagical pit, just as if you had created it with a shovel. {spell/Magic stone} adds magical power to stones, but spell resistance doesn't help protect against being hit by the stones any more than spell resistance helps protect against a +1 arrow because the magic is focused on the stones, not on the creature with spell resistance.",

In many cases, the idea behind the design is just silly, like a spell that creates a sphere of burning oil and hurls it at the intended area, where it bursts in an explosion of flame; clearly the intent is to create a nonmagical {spell/fireball} that bypasses spell resistance. Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes them completely immune to any effect that allows spell resistance. You should avoid letting these sorts of trick spells into your campaign, as they meddle with the balance of encounters (some monsters are designed to be harder for melee characters to fight, some are designed to be harder for spellcasters to fight, and some are just supposed to be difficult all around).",

Making combat spells with faster casting times devalues the {feat/Quicken Spell} feat; even if you design the spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4 level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that feat, and your spell would become a common combo for high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level. For example, if you create a 5th-level quickened {spell/magic missile} spell that acts just like a {spell/magic missile} spell with the {feat/Quicken Spell} feat, any 14th-level wizard (who has at least three 5th-level spells available) is going to be tempted to learn this spell just because it allows him to add 5d4+5 extra points of damage to any high-level combat spell he casts, which is a way to get around the spell-damage cap. Furthermore, allowing spellcasters to routinely cast two spells per round means they tend to use up their spells more quickly and push their allies to camp and rest rather than continue exploring.",

Most material components are part of a spell for flavor rather than to satisfy rules. The guano and sulfur material components of {spell/fireball} are there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material components of {spell/lightning bolt} come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the \"it has whatever I need\" spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat) - they're just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.",
			"",
			"Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as {spell/stoneskin}), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as {spell/augury}, {spell/divination}, and {spell/commune}), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as {spell/raise dead} and {spell/restoration}). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like {spell/augury}, as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it's free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as {spell/glyph of warding} also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving {spell/glyph of warding} a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring - otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).",

			"Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components - in most cases they're just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it's a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once they've crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it's essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component."

Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).",

			"***Shadow:*** Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the Shadow Plane, or allow transport to or from that plane.",
			"",
			"***Sonic:*** Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.",

			"Make sure the spell description is clear and concise. Remember that players are going to refer to the spell description in a hurry during their turn of combat, and if they have to fight their way through flowery language to figure out the details, the resulting delay will annoy other players and the GM. If the spell has several complex effects, put each effect into its own paragraph. If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see {spell/binding} for an example).",
			"",
			"Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn't need to appear again in the spell description - it's redundant. For example, the {spell/fireball} description doesn't say, \"The spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.\" Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player to sift through when looking up the spell's effects in the middle of combat.",
			"",
			"Avoid using language that implies something that the game mechanics of the spell don't back up. For example, a spell's description shouldn't say \"using the foul powers of necromancy\" if the spell doesn't actually have some sort of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as {spell/astral projection}, {spell/gentle repose}, and {spell/undeath to death}). People who read your spell description may not know your intent, and using flavorful language can trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.",
			"",
			"Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a particular character or class in mind, most spells are going to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form - you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.",

			"",
			"When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets affected, and so on) are equal.",
			"",
			"***Control:*** A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are {spell/charm monster}, {spell/charm person}, {spell/confusion}, {spell/dominate monster}, and {spell/dominate person}.",
			"",
			"***Kill:*** A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target's depletable statistics, typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with {spell/dispel magic}). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are {spell/disintegrate}, {spell/finger of death}, {spell/phantasmal killer}, {spell/power word kill}, {spell/slay living}, and {spell/wail of the banshee}.",
			"",
			"***Incapacitate:*** An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target's condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are {spell/fear}, {spell/flesh to stone}, {spell/hold monster}, {spell/hold person}, {spell/power word stun}, and {spell/sleep}.",
			"",
			"***Damage:*** A damage spell reduces the target's depletable statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster's fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they'll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it's possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are {spell/cone of cold}, {spell/fireball}, {spell/lightning bolt}, {spell/magic missile}, {spell/poison}, and {spell/sound burst}.",
			"",
			"***Penalize:*** A penalize spell gives the target some penalty not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can't kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don't stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are {spell/bane}, [blindness/deafness](spell/blindness_deafness), {spell/ray of enfeeblement}, and {spell/slow}.",
			"",
			"There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster's allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster's allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than {spell/speak with dead}).",
			"",
			"Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results - a {spell/confusion} spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it's a control spell. Likewise, a [summon monster](spell/summon_monster_1) spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it's just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage."

			"Depletable statistics are any values in a creature or object's stat block that can be reduced by some form of attack and that can neutralize, kill, or destroy the creature or object when they reach a low value (typically 0). Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics - a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target's depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target.",
			"",
			"However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a spell that gives a target a -10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting fireball, as would a spell that gave her a -10 penalty on her Will saving throws; despite her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are -10 or -100. Similarly, a fighter with a -10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a -10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties.",
			"",
			"\"Depletable statistic\" isn't an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells - attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties."

			"",
			"{spell/Resist Energy}: This defensive spell works exactly like monster energy resistances, so it's a perfect example of the power level of this sort of spell. It also scales at higher caster levels, keeping it a viable spell even later in the game.",
			"",
			"{spell/Web}: This is a powerful, nonlethal spell that remains viable even at higher levels (even a lich who makes his save against a web has to deal with the difficult terrain and risks becoming stuck if he moves). It even provides cover, and can be set on fire to damage targets in the area.",

			"{spell/Dispel Magic}: This spell sets the standard for negating other magic without a specific counter.",
			"",
			"{spell/Displacement}: This short-duration combat spell makes attackers miss 50% of the time, setting the standard for one-target defensive spells.",
			"",
			"{spell/Fireball}: This is the definitive low-level area attack spell. Gaining this spell changes the paradigm of the game, allowing spellcasters to deal a large amount of damage to multiple targets anywhere they can see.",
			"",
			"{spell/Fly}: This is the most important movement spell, usable in combat to great effect and allowing easy maneuverability around the battlefield.",
			"",
			"{spell/Lightning Bolt}: This spell establishes that a line of this range is about the same power level as a 20-foot burst.",
			"",
			"{spell/Stinking Cloud}: Capable of neutralizing many foes at a good range, stinking cloud is the best multiple-target nonlethal spell of its level.",

			"{spell/Contingency}: This spell lets the caster set up conditions to trigger another spell effect, whether something direct such as a protective spell or something paranoid like an escape-teleport. In many ways it models what an immediate-action {feat/Quicken Spell} feat would be like. Because it lasts 1 day per level, the caster can prepare the contingency on one day and adventure the next day with a full allotment of spells.",
			"",
			"{spell/Guards and Wards}: Although not often used by PCs because they usually don't have permanent residences, this spell is important because it establishes that a large-area defensive spell can use multiple effects to protect a home and befuddle invaders.",

Allowing a character to alter or craft an item for one of these underused slots is allowing the character to bypass built-in choices between popular items.",

If there is a trend of all Core Rulebook items of a particular type using a particular slot (such as items that grant physical ability score bonuses being belts or items that grant movement bonuses being boots), GMs should be hesitant to allow you to move those abilities to other slots; otherwise, they ignore these deliberate restrictions by cheaply spreading out these items over unused slots.",

			"***Classes Value Some Slots More Than Others:*** This is a combination of the two previous warnings.

This means a wizard can change an item that's useful to wizards into a belt and not have to worry about a future slot conflict by discovering a wizardly magic belt in a treasure hoard. Likewise, fighters have little use for most standard head items, so altering an existing fighter item to use the head slot means it has little risk of competition from found head slot items.

This is especially the case if you're a new character starting above 1st level or one with the versatile {feat/Craft Wondrous Item} feat.

You might want to use an appropriate business to sell crafted items for more than half price, but the downtime system already accounts for using a building to generate money, as well as spending personal time helping run the business (see {rule/Run a Business}). A typical magic shop earns about 3 gp per day, or perhaps 4-5 gp per day if a skilled owner PC directly participates in running the business. Because magic items are very expensive (with the most common potions costing 50 gp or more, far higher than what most commoners can afford), this income represents many days where the business sells nothing, followed by selling one or two high-priced items, which averages out to a few gp of profit per day. In other words, just because you can craft one +1 longsword each day doesn't mean you're likely to sell one each day in your shop. The GM has two options for resolving this mercantile dilemma.",

In areas of minor spellblight, each time a spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be affected by a random minor spellblight. In areas of major spellblight, the caster must succeed at a DC 22 saving throw or contract a major spellblight.

Other spells may inflict a specific spellblight or may allow the caster to select any spellblight as part of the spell.

			"",
			"***Caster Blank:*** A spellcaster with caster blank has a hard time focusing her spells or spell-like abilities on the same creature more than once. After targeting a creature with a spell, the caster cannot target that creature again with a spell until caster blank is removed or suppressed. To suppress caster blank, the afflicted spell caster must spend a standard action concentrating, which shakes off all effects of the caster blank until she casts a targeted spell again. Caster blank only affects spells that target creatures, and a spellcaster can still affect the creature with area spells.",
			"",
			"Caster blank can be cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Caster Croak:*** The afflicted spellcaster's throat or mouth is magically constricted. The spellcaster can barely make her words heard, and then only with great effort. A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4. Spell-like abilities are not affected by this spellblight because they lack verbal components. Shouting and screaming is impossible while the creature is affected by this spellblight.",
			"",
			"A {spell/heal} spell or similar effect cures this spellblight, as does casting the {spell/shout} spell, though doing so is still affected by the spellblight's effects.",
			"",
			"***Confounded Casting:*** A spellcaster with confounded casting has a mental disconnect between the spells she intends to cast and the spells she actually casts. The first time on her turn that she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she makes a concentration check with a DC of 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast. If the concentration check fails, the caster must pick another spell or spell-like ability of the same level or lower to cast with the same casting time. If the spellcaster has no other spell or spell-like ability, the action is lost. The spell or spell-like ability she originally picked is not spent and she can attempt to cast that spell again later.",
			"",
			"Confounded casting is cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Disassociation:*** A spellcaster with disassociation lapses into a mild insanity in which she dissociates her identity and starts to perceive herself as someone else. While subject to disassociation, a spellcaster is incapable of using spells or effects with a range of personal or of targeting herself with a spell effect. A spell with an area that includes her but does not need targeted individual creatures functions normally.",
			"",
			"Disassociation can by cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"***Ebon Eyes:*** A spellcaster with ebon eyes develops a jet-black film over her eyes, which inverts her capacity to perceive light and darkness. The creature treats darkness as bright light, dim light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and bright light as darkness. The ebon eyes protect against blinding, dazzling, patterns, or other visual effects, granting a +2 bonus on all saving throws against those effects.",
			"",
			"Ebon eyes can be removed with an effect that removes blindness.",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Ague:*** Eldritch ague manifests itself as a sickness that is debilitating to spellcasters. A spellcaster with this spellblight is sickened until the curse is removed. When the subject of the curse casts a spell, she is overcome with shaking for 1 round, requiring any spellcasting or the use of a spell-like ability during that time to succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the save, the spell and the action to cast it is lost.",
			"",
			"While a curse, eldritch ague acts much like a disease, and creatures with immunity to disease are also immune to eldritch ague. {spell/Remove disease} cures eldritch ague; unlike with most spellblights, using this spell to remove the spellblight does not impose a -5 caster level check penalty.",
			"",
			"***Hemoculysis:*** A spellcaster with hemoculysis bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell. While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided it's greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster's eyes bleeding is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a -4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.",
			"",
			"Hemoculysis can be cured by {spell/heal} or {spell/regenerate}.",
			"",
			"***Lassitude:*** Whenever a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the check, the spellcaster takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level (or 1 point of nonlethal damage when casting a 0-level spell or 1 point per 2 caster levels if using a spell-like ability). This nonlethal damage cannot be reduced in any way so long as the spellcaster suffers from lassitude.",
			"",
			"Lassitude can be cured by {spell/lesser restoration}, {spell/restoration}, or any effect that completely removes exhaustion. Simply resting has no effect. Creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Ritualistic Obsession:*** A spellcaster afflicted with ritualistic obsession adds unnecessary gestures to her spellcasting activities. Any spell without a somatic component (even a spell cast with the {feat/Still Spell} feat) now requires one, and any spell that already has a somatic component requires two free hands rather than one. Spell-like abilities now require a somatic component. The extra complexity increases swift action casting times to a standard action, standard action casting times to 1 round, and 1 round casting times to 2 rounds. Other casting times are not increased. The extra focus does serve to increase the efficacy of the caster's spells. All save DCs for spells and spell-like abilities that have their casting time increased with ritualistic obsession are increased by 1.",
			"",
			"Ritualistic obsession is cured by any effect that removes insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to ritualistic obsession.",
			"",
			"***Spell Addiction:*** A spell addict feeds off the elation of wielding magic, but suffers rapid withdrawal once spellcasting ends. After successfully casting a spell, the addict gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws until her next turn. On any round the spell addict does not cast a spell on her turn, however, she goes into withdrawal, and is sickened until her next turn.",
			"",

			"The following list details some of the most common major spellblights.",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Cataracts:*** Each time a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, her vision becomes fuzzier and fuzzier until eventually she is blinded. Each time the spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 15 + the spell's level. If she fails, she takes a -1 penalty on vision-based Perception checks until the spellblight is removed. Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a -4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead.",
			"",
			"Eldritch cataracts is a difficult spellblight to cure. Any effect that cures blindness reduces the penalty by 1. If the penalty is reduced to -3 or lower, any blindness is relieved until the caster fails the Fortitude saving throw enough times to bring the penalty back to -4. Reducing the penalty to 0 cures the spellblight.",
			"",
			"Blind creatures and creatures that don't use sight are immune to eldritch cataracts.",
			"",
			"***Nameless Dread:*** A caster with nameless dread believes strange beings from far dimensions or the blackness between the stars are hounding her and sapping her sanity. Every time the caster uses a spell or a spell-like ability, she sees a glimpse of her nameless pursuers. She must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level), or become shaken for 1 round per level of the spell. If already shaken, the spellcaster becomes frightened for the duration of the original effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. If she is already frightened, she becomes panicked (and cannot cast) for the duration of the current effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. Each time a spellcaster becomes panicked, there is a 5% chance she will become permanently insane (as the {spell/insanity} spell, or the GM may choose [a form of insanity](rule/sanity_and_madness).",
			"",
			"A spellcaster suffering from nameless dread is particularly adept at wielding spells with the fear or chaos descriptor. When she casts a spell with that descriptor, the save DC for that spell is increased by 1, and she gains a +1 competence bonus on all caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance.",
			"",
			"Spells that suppress fear work on nameless dread. Those that remove fear effects suppress the effects of nameless dread (and its benefits to spellcasting) for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"***Negated:*** A negated spellcaster has his ability to manipulate magical energies disrupted. He gains spell resistance equal to 10 plus twice the highest spell level he can cast. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. In addition, anytime he casts a spell, he must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against this spell resistance. On a successful check, the spell is completed and the spellcaster's spell resistance is removed until the start of his next turn. Failure indicates he failed to muster up enough magical energy to cast the spell, but the spell is not lost and may be attempted again. Any feats or abilities that aid in bypassing spell resistance help with this check.",
			"",
			"{spell/Restoration} suppresses the negated spellblight for one day.",
			"",
			"***Obsessive Fixation:*** A spellcaster with an obsessive fixation develops a tendency toward repetition. This manifests itself differently depending on whether the spellcaster prepares spells, is a spontaneous caster, or uses spell-like abilities. When preparing spells, an afflicted spellcaster must attempt to prepare as many duplicate spells as she can, meaning she prepares two copies of each spell she picks, but cannot exceed her normal number of spell slots to do so. This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect. If the spellcaster is a spontaneous caster or uses spell-like abilities, when that spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must cast that spell again on her next turn, or becomes dazed for 1 round at the end of her turn. Once she casts two copies of the same spell in a row or becomes dazed, the obsessive fixation resets, and she can cast any spell she knows, starting the cycle again.",
			"",
			"Obsessive fixation can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"***Phase Blight:*** A spellcaster afflicted with spellblight fades in and out of existence. Each time she casts a spell, she phases in and out of reality for 1 round per level of the spell cast. While phasing, any physical attacks made against the spellcaster have a 50% miss chance, any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail to affect the caster, and the spellcaster takes only half damage from area attacks. In addition, while actively phasing, all of a spellcaster's physical attacks have a 50% miss chance, all of the caster's spells that target creatures have a 50% chance of affecting the target, and all of the caster's area attacks do 50% of their normal damage. Unlike when casting the {spell/blink} spell, the spellcaster does not become ethereal; she blinks in and out of reality altogether.",
			"",
			"Effects that block planar travel, like {spell/dimensional anchor}, stabilize a phasing creature for the duration of the effect.",
			"",
			"***Spell Burn:*** Each time a spellcaster afflicted with this spellblight casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin feels like it burns, as if she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level cast), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she is staggered for a round. While the caster is staggered by this spellblight, any spell with the fire descriptor that she casts has its saving throw DC increased by 1.",
			"",
			"The burning sensation is a figment of the caster's imagination. Spellcasters that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight, and don't gain the beneficial effect when casting spells with the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"***Spell Sap:*** A spellcaster with spell sap is subject to blackouts when casting spells. She may become mentally locked, distant, or catatonic, or may even slip into unconsciousness. Each time the afflicted spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14 + caster level) or become dazed until the end of her next turn. If she fails the save by 10 or more, she instead falls prone and lapses into unconsciousness for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"Spell sap can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"***Transference Block:*** A spellcaster with transference block has difficulty targeting allies with spell effects. Anytime she casts a spell on an ally, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level) or the spell is lost.",
			"",
			"Transference block can be cured by spending 1 hour in an {spell/antimagic field}.",
			"",
			"***Vertigo:*** A spellcaster with vertigo becomes dizzy and lightheaded when she casts a spell. Each time she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, the world spins and shifts around her. She must succeed at a concentration check (with a DC equal to the 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast). If the spellcaster fails the check, she falls prone, and for 1d4 rounds takes a penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim checks equal to 1 + the level of the spell. While the afflicted spellcaster takes those penalties, she must also succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check in order to stand up from prone.",
			"",
			"A {spell/restoration} cast on the afflicted spellcaster suppresses this spellblight for 1 day."

Also, when a blinded spellcaster casts a spell with the light descriptor, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the blinded condition.",
			"",
			"***Confused:*** While confused (either temporarily, or permanently by way of an {spell/insanity} spell or effect), a spellcaster can tap into that confusion during periods of lucidity. When a confused spellcaster can act normally, the DCs of her spells that give confusion or insanity effects are increased by 1. The caster also gains a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance with those spells.",

			"***Entangled:*** A spellcaster who is entangled and casts a spell with the force descriptor can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure on that spell.

If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the deafened condition.",
			"",
			"***Disabled:*** A disabled spellcaster can tap into her fears of impending death to empower her conjuration (healing) spells. Once per day, while disabled due to damage taken, a spellcaster can choose to treat a single conjuration (healing) spell she casts on herself as having a caster level two levels higher than her actual caster level. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.",
			"",
			"***Grappled:*** While being grappled, a spellcaster can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a touch attack spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the attack roll against the creature grappling her.",
			"",
			"***Nauseated:*** A nauseated spellcaster can use some of the energy of a conjuration (healing) spell to try to counteract the nauseated condition. When a nauseated spellcaster casts a conjuration (healing) spell, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the nauseated condition.",
			"",
			"***Poisoned or Sickened:*** Once per day, while a spellcaster is poisoned or sickened, she can take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a single spell that causes a poison or sickened effect. If the spell is successful, the DC of any poison or sickened effect granted by that spell increases by 2.",
			"",
			"***Shaken:*** While a spellcaster is shaken, once per day she can channel her fear to increase the power of a single spell with the fear descriptor that she casts. When she does so, the spell DC of that spell is increased by 1. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.",
			"",
			"***Staggered:*** Once per day, while a spellcaster is staggered, she can take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a single spell that takes a swift or standard action to cast. If the spell is successfully cast, she can take a move action directly after casting the spell."
