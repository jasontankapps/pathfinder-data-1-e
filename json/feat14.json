Like with a charge, you can perform a partial version when limited to a single standard action (such as in the surprise round); in addition to moving half as far as normal for a partial charge, the attack doubles only the damage dice (as per {feat/Vital Strike}) rather than the full damage roll."

Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).",

For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of {faith/Desna} might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way."
