			"Aquatic elves can live either in or out of the water, but most prefer homes in the watery depths of oceans and seas. They establish small communities, uniting with other aquatic elves as needed for protection but remaining largely independent. Some of these communities are built partly above and partly below the water, with half-elves of aquatic descent living in the open air, while their aquatic kin make their homes below. An example of such a settlement is Acisazi, off the coast of the Chelish archduchy of Ravounel.",
			"",
			"Aquatic elves consider themselves an enlightened people capable of appreciating life in more dimensions than other creatures. When they do interact with other races, they often appear aloof and dismissive, as though bored or distracted, though this is not necessarily the case. Aquatic elves are simply thinking of what wonders they might find during their explorations of their watery environs.",
			"",
			"Aquatic elves living in the Arcadian Ocean maintain cordial relations with the elves of the Mordant Spire - the guardians of the ruins of ancient Azlant. Mordant Spire elves trust their aquatic kin to explore the ruins and recover valuable historical artifacts while leaving the dangerous ones undisturbed. These elves take pride in the faith placed in them, and to maintain good relations with their surface cousins, they refuse to share their knowledge of the Azlanti ruins with others.",
			"",
			"Considered beautiful by many elves, humans, and similar surface races, aquatic elves are a graceful and quick-witted people. Their skin can be the pale white or gold of beach sand, the russet of living coral, or the greenblack of deepwater kelp. Often, aquatic elves' coloration adjusts to their usual environment over time, sometimes changing over the course of a few generations. Their hair is long and silky, rippling with shades of blue and green. Aquatic elves have delicate, translucent webbing between their fingers and toes, allowing them to swim adroitly through the water.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Groups of aquatic elves are known to specialize in searching ruins for pieces of art, historical records, and magical artifacts from sunken and forgotten empires. Those exploring the submerged debris of long-lost cities sometimes partner with adventurers of other races to overcome dangerous traps or guardians. Prideful as they are, aquatic elves know that other creatures can contribute specialized abilities to an expedition, though they are happiest working with gnomes, halflings, and surface elves, as these creatures are likely to return to the surface when their business beneath the waves is done. Some aquatic elves distrust humans, who they believe conceal expansionist motives and have a reckless disregard for danger: especially as concerns ancient and dangerous magic. Aquatic elves ally with gillmen only when necessary, as they worry that any such collaboration could be a part of some deeper aboleth scheme.",
			"",
			"Aquatic elves believe that life is more vivid underwater than on land and that exceptional possibilities - both material and spiritual - exist for aquatic explorers. Aquatic elf adventurers, particularly those with no obligations to family or community, seek out hidden caverns, new species of plants or animals, and undiscovered ruins in the deepest reaches of the ocean, believing that their journeys lead to personal spiritual evolution.",
			"",
			"As with surface elves, aquatic elves often have an aptitude for arcane magic, and the lure of lost power can draw aquatic elf adventurers far from familiar environments. Arcane practitioners venture into submerged abandoned sites associated with other races, such as cecaelias or merfolk, hunting for lost magic items or forgotten spells; these expeditions often bring the aquatic elves into conflict with the races that consider the ruins their own. Aquatic elf adventurers may even leave the ocean and travel on dry land to pursue rumors of particularly powerful treasures, no matter how thinly substantiated. When they do so, they prefer to ally with surfacers who know the area well (or hire one or more guides or specialists), as they harbor an unnatural fear of getting lost while on land and being unable to return to their vibrant ocean homes, even though they suffer no physical detriments from being on land for extended periods of time.",

			"{SOURCE Inner Sea Races/242;Bestiary 2/123;Advanced Race Guide/108}  ",
			"Descended from humans trapped on the Shadow Plane, fetchlings are creatures of darkness and light intertwined. Generations of contact with that strange plane and its denizens have made fetchlings a race apart from humanity. While fetchlings acknowledge their origins, they exhibit little physical or cultural resemblance to their ancestors on the Material Plane, and are often insulted when compared to humans. Some members of the race also take offense at the name fetchling, as it was given to them by humans who saw them as little more than fetchers of rare materials from the Shadow Plane. Most fetchlings instead prefer to be called kayal, a word borrowed from Aklo that roughly translates to \"shadow people\" or \"dusk dwellers.\"",
			"",
			"Infused with the essence of the Shadow Plane and possessing human blood commingled with that of the Shadow Plane's natives, fetchlings have developed traits and abilities that complement their native plane's bleak and colorless terrain. Though most fetchlings treat the Shadow Plane as home, they often trade and deal with creatures of the Material Plane. Some fetchlings go so far as to create enclaves on the Material Plane in order to establish alliances and trade routes in areas where the boundary between the two planes is less distinct. These fetchlings often serve as merchants, middlemen, and guides for races on both sides of the planar boundary.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Superficially, fetchlings resemble unnaturally lithe-bordering on fragile-humans. Their adopted home has drained their skin and hair of bright colors. Their complexion ranges from stark white to deep black, and includes all the various shades of gray between those two extremes. Their eyes are pupilless and pronounced, and they typically glow a luminescent shade of yellow or greenish yellow, though rare individuals possess blue-green eyes. While their hair tends to be stark white or pale gray, many fetchlings dye their hair black. Some members of higher station or those who dwell on the Material Plane dye their hair with more striking colors, often favoring deep shades of violet, blue, and crimson.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Fetchling are adaptable creatures, and as such display no singular preference for moral philosophy or the rule of law. Most mimic the cultural norms and governmental structures of those they live near or the creatures they serve. While fetchlings are arguably the most populous race on the Shadow Plane, they rarely rule over their own kind; most serve as vassals or subjects to the great umbral dragons of their homeland, or the bizarre nihiloi who dwell in the deeper darkness. Above all, fetchlings are survivors. Their tenacity, versatility, and devious pragmatism have helped them survive the harsh environs of the Shadow Plane and plots of the powerful creatures dwelling within it. On the Material Plane, especially if unable to return to their home plane at will, fetchlings tend to cluster in small, insular communities of their own kind, mimicking the cultural norms and political structures of those they trade with.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Because of their shared ancestry, fetchlings interact most easily with humans, though they also find kinship with gnomes and other races that were cut off from their home planes or are not native to the Material Plane. Their pragmatism and adaptable nature put them at odds with warlike or destructive races, and when they do have to deal with orcs, goblinoids, or other savage cultures, fetchlings will often play the part of the fawning sycophant, a tactic learned from serving umbral dragons and one they see as key to their race's survival. Strangely, their relationship with dwarves and elves are rather strained. Dwarves find fetchlings duplicitous and creepy, while the tension with elves is so subtle and inexplicable that both races find it difficult to explain.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Fetchlings - especially those living outside the Shadow Plane - worship a wide variety of gods. A smaller number of evil fetchlings worship demon lords of darkness and lust.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** The Shadow Plane's ever-present hazards pose great danger to fetchling adventurers, but also great opportunity. Because of their servile status on their home plane, however, most fetchlings prefer to adventure on the Material Plane, which often offers more freedom and trading opportunities between the two planes.

			"Ganzis are the end result of planar chaos touching living creatures. Where the planes brush against the Material Plane or where chaotic inhabitants (be they chaos beasts, proteans, valkyries, or others) affect or influence mortal life, ganzis are born in their wake like ripples in a pond.",
			"",
			"While ganzis are superficially human in appearance, they often have features that set them apart from the rest of humanity. These features can vary widely; one ganzi might have a discolored hand that flickers with entropic (but harmless) energy, while another might have brightly colored scales covering her shoulders and back, and yet another might have horns and glowing green eyes. Likewise, ganzi height and weight can vary dramatically, even by human standards, but the average ganzi stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs anywhere from 100 to 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Many ganzis are mistaken for aasimars or tieflings at birth, but in truth ganzi births very rarely result from mortals mingling with outsiders. The vast majority are born after one or both parents were exposed to a force of chaotic or entropic energy. As such, the circumstances of a ganzi's childhood can vary dramatically and depend on the parents' tolerance for the unexpected. A ganzi's tendency towards chaos exacerbates this, with many ganzis developing gregarious, iconoclastic, or thrill-seeking reputations among their peers. A sizable minority of ganzis appear completely human early in life, their anarchic heritage manifesting shortly after puberty in a chaotic - and traumatic - spasm of rapid evolution. While ganzis are most commonly of human stock, it is not unknown for ganzis to be born among other races. These ganzis bear superficial signs of their non-human heritage, but their statistics and abilities are identical to those born to humans.",
			"",
			"Like other native outsiders of humanoid heritage, ganzis are found most often scattered amidst the societies of their parent races. The rare ganzis who choose not to wander may live their entire lives without meeting another of their kind. Due to their scattered pattern of birth and their tendency towards wandering lifestyles, ganzis rarely congregate in significant numbers and almost never form cultures of their own. On occasion, a Material Plane society in a region with links to other planes will produce enough ganzis over time for them to form their own subculture, but such societies are rare indeed.",
			"",
			"Given their relationship to the Cerulean Void and its natives, it is not uncommon for ganzis with awareness of their heritage and the resources for planar travel to journey to the Maelstrom. Some ganzis make this pilgrimage to seek out proteans, valkyries, or other natives of the Maelstrom in hopes of understanding their own place in the cosmos, while others are drawn to the idea of communing with the vast and potent force of primordial chaos itself.",
			"",
			"As befits their chaotic origin, the personality and outlook of individual ganzis can vary significantly. Often chaotic-aligned, with no particular tendency towards good or evil, many find themselves drawn to the life of the wandering adventurer. Ganzis are commonly possessed of deep curiosity and powerful creative talent, leading many to become artists or bards, while others enjoy the alchemist's dichotomous mastery of creation and destruction. Sorcerous talents and oracular mysteries of all varieties are unsurprisingly common among ganzis.",
			"",
			"::h3[Ganzi Oddities]{jl}",
			"",
			"- 1-2: **Chaos Champion (Su):** Ganzis with a lineage linked to the einherji often become crusaders for the forces of entropy and excel in combat against lawful beings. The ganzi can smite law once per day as a swift action, targeting a lawful foe. She adds her Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to her Hit Dice. Once activated, smite law persists until the target is dead or the ganzi rests, whichever comes first.",
			"- 3-4: **Entropic Flesh (Ex):** Ganzis with lineages that link strongly to chaos beasts retain some of their ancestors' immunity to transformation. In addition to gaining a +2 bonus on Escape Artist checks and to CMD against grapple combat maneuvers, when such ganzis are affected by a hostile transmutation effect (such as polymorphing or petrification), they can attempt a new saving throw at the start of their next turn to end the effect. They gain a +4 bonus on this second saving throw, but if they fail, the transmutation effect persists as long as it normally would.",
			"- 5-6: **Prehensile Tail (Ex):** Ganzis with lineages that are particularly influenced by the presence of proteans often have colorful feathers, scales, or skin, and a long serpentine tail. This tail can be used to carry items. While ganzis with this oddity cannot wield weapons with their tails, they can use their tails to retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.",
			"- 7-14: **Quibble (Su):** For most ganzis, the influence of chaos is relatively subtle and manifests as an ability to infect others with entropy and unexpected luck (be it good luck or bad). Once per day as an immediate action, a ganzi can twist probability and alter the luck of a single creature within 20 feet, forcing it to reroll a single d20 roll it has just made. The target must take the second result, even if it is worse. A ganzi can use this ability after the target has rolled but must use it before the GM declares whether the roll was a success or failure. Unwilling creatures can resist a ganzi's quibble with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's level + the ganzi's Charisma modifier). This is a curse effect.",
			"- 15-18: **Spell-Like Ability (Sp):** Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from regions other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such ganzis gain one of the following spell-like abilities, usable once per day at a caster level equal to the ganzi's HD: {spell/alter self}, {spell/blur}, {spell/detect thoughts}, {spell/hideous laughter}, {spell/minor image}, {spell/shatter}, or {spell/spider climb}.",
			"- 19-20: **Weaponplay (Ex):** Ganzis with lineages that link to the valkyries manifest their heritage in their skill in combat. Such ganzis are always proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and they can qualify for feats normally available only to fighters (such as {feat/Weapon Specialization}) even if they don't have any fighter class levels.",
			"",
			"::h3[Expanded Oddities]{jl}",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Plane-Hopper's Handbook/18}  ",
			"Due to the Maelstrom's entropic influence on their compositions, ganzis each have an unusual but defining feature-referred to as an oddity-that sets them apart from other races and even from other members of their own race. These oddities vary wildly from ganzi to ganzi, and they can manifest as physical features, such as feathers, scales, or a tail, or as more subtle magical abilities. At the GM's discretion, players with ganzi characters can roll 1d20 to randomly determine what form their characters' oddities take using the list below.",
			"",
			"- 1-3: **Amorphous Limbs (Su):** The influence of the Maelstrom manifests in the ganzi's ability to transform one of her limbs at will, often into a natural weapon such as a massive clawed arm. Every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, a ganzi can transform one of her limbs into a natural melee weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. The transformation lasts until the beginning of the ganzi's next turn. The damage dealt by this natural weapon can be lethal or nonlethal, at the ganzi's discretion, and she chooses whether the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.",
			"- 4-6: **Ink (Ex):** As a standard action, the ganzi can spit a stream of opaque, black ink from her mouth to a distance of up to 20 feet. The ganzi can target either a creature or a square on the ground, each with different effects, as detailed below. The ganzi can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 Hit Dice she has.  ",
			"    - *Creature:* The ganzi shoots a stream of ink into a creature's eyes as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. If the ganzi hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's Hit Dice + the ganzi's Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.  ",
			"    - *Ground:* The ganzi spits the ink into a single square on the ground within 30 feet, which becomes slippery for 1d6 rounds. Any creatures entering the square must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's Hit Dice + the ganzi's Constitution modifier) or fall prone.",
			"- 7-10: **Racing Mind (Ex):** A ganzi whose lineage is linked to hunduns might inherit an aspect of the outsiders' chaotic minds. The ganzi's churning vortex of thoughts bolsters it against mental attacks, granting the ganzi a +2 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects.",
			"- 11-13: **Spell-Like Ability (Sp):** Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from sources other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such a ganzi gains one of the following spell-like abilities, which can be used once per day with a caster level equal to the ganzi's HD: {spell/acid arrow}, {spell/gust of wind}, {spell/mirror image}, {spell/resist energy}, {spell/scorching ray}, {spell/see invisibility}, or {spell/warp wood}.",
			"- 14-16: **Uncanny Aura (Su):** Some ganzis have an unsettling aura of chaos that rattles hostile creatures that venture too close. Once per day as a standard action, such a ganzi can activate an uncanny aura; enemies within 30 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's Hit Dice + the ganzi's Charisma modifier) or become frightened until the beginning of the ganzi's next turn. The aura remains for a number of rounds equal to the ganzi's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Once a creature has been affected by an uncanny aura, whether it failed its save or not, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours.",
			"- 17-18: **Vestigial Wings (Ex):** The ganzi has a pair of small, vestigial wings, likely but not limited to resembling those of a flying creature or some manner of construct. Though these appendages do not grant flight, these ganzis can use their wings to stabilize themselves when they're thrown off balance. Such ganzis gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws and a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to balance.",
			"- 19-20: **Void Touch (Su):** A ganzi whose lineage is influenced strongly by voidworms might exhibit the ability to inflict chaos on others' minds. Three times per day when such a ganzi hits a creature with a melee attack, the ganzi can deliver a burst of chaos to that creature as a free action. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi's Hit Dice + the ganzi's Constitution modifier) or be confused for 1 round.",

			"According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples awakened in the First World, the primal realm of the fey. Gathlains grow from the seeds of an enormous magical tree-seeds that often drift for hundreds of miles before developing into adolescent gathlains, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh to form their strange wings. Despite being born with a basic understanding of their world, gathlains are inquisitive to a fault. They are known to be invaluable guides and knowledgeable explorers, if one can put up with their numerous questions and strange japes.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Wings of wood and vines grow out of the bodies of these lithesome fey. Gathlains prefer to wear a mix of clothing, with a base of natural materials like grass skirts or simply woven tunics combined with bits of finery gathered from a variety of sources.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Gathlain society is built around art, discovery, experimentation, and storytelling. These fey constantly seek new ways to look at the world. Gathlain leaders are often popular explorers followed primarily as idols worth emulating and as sources of intriguing gossip. Although gathlains tend to engage in raucous romances born of melodramatic or fanciful encounters, they do not procreate conventionally from such pairings, even when the two happen to be of different physical sexes. Gathlains show little interest in gender, finding it quaint when other races use it as a basis for assigning roles or choosing partners.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Gathlains associate with a variety of other fey as freely as among their own kind. These mixed communities of fey are called courts and feature elaborate titles for those members deemed most interesting or most worthy of admiration. When a gathlain chooses to join a different community, it is generally a temporary membership, whether it lasts only a season or persists for decades. Adventuring gathlains frequently seek out and attempt to mingle with like-minded gnomes; however, gnomes often find gathlains too flighty, foolish, and undisciplined for their tastes.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Mischievous and capricious, gathlains have discordant temperaments. Most are chaotic, and they tend to be morally neutral. The typical gathlain finds mortal religions strange; like many fey, they trade respect and token offerings to godlike fey in exchange for protection, but they see little difference between that and offerings to lesser kings and queens.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Gathlains strive to entertain themselves and sate their immense curiosity about the world around them, and those who decide to become adventurers often migrate to the Material Plane to explore. Those who remain in the First World seek the strangest parts of their home plane and try to learn about its most unusual inhabitants. They favor spellcasting classes and skilled classes such as bard or rogue.",
			"",
			"**Names:** Gathlains lack gender-specific names, but instead attempt to create unique names for each individual. Some examples are Agollia, Armath, Arnonwy, Brazial, Dwynnen, Eirgara, Finnath, Gummow, Inirha, Marcanth, Nirialu, Sollowy, Tiltiu, and Urhiod.",

The gathlain's vines provide only the ability to glide rather than true flight; the gathlain takes no damage from falling, as if subject to a constant nonmagical {spell/feather fall} spell.

			"The first ghorans came into being thousands of years ago during a great war between two nations ruled by rival archmages. When mighty necromantic curses blighted the lands of one nation, leaving its inhabitants on the brink of starvation, their canny leader cut a deal with the renegade druid Ghorus, bidding him to put his forbidden talents to use in saving the realm. The druid's solution was the creation of a race of hardy and fast-adapting plants that could thrive even upon the curse-blighted ground. These plants, which the druid named \"ghorans\" after himself, swiftly developed the ability to move on their own, searching out the most nourishing soil and continuously adapting themselves to survive in more and more dangerous environments. As they grew in intelligence, ghorans evolved humanlike forms as a defense mechanism to induce sympathy and prevent further butchery.",
			"",
			"When he died, Ghorus took the secrets of creating new ghorans to his grave, and from that point forward the number of ghorans in the world became fixed. While each ghoran could perpetuate itself via a single immortal seed, the inability to grow or propagate their species ensured that no new ghorans would ever appear. With each death of a ghoran by accident or violence, their race as a whole dwindled. The fact that their \"flesh\" had come to be regarded as a delicacy only further complicated their role in society, and even though most regions soon made the harvesting and consumption of the newly sentient ghorans illegal, they are still hunted by those who have developed a taste for their succulence.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** The typical ghoran stands roughly as tall as a human and occupies a similar silhouette, but that's where their similarities with humanity end. A ghoran's \"skin\" is a complex layer of fibrous vines and rinds with a texture similar to moss-covered bark. Ghoran faces consist of layered petals that flush and flutter at a whim, allowing them to mimic the facial behaviors of their would-be devourers. They do not lack emotion per se, but ghoran \"feelings\" are primordial and abstract, making them utterly alien to most non-ghorans. A ghoran might laugh, smile, or raise its voice, but their companions seldom understand if these are displays of true emotion or merely more adaptive evolutions designed - like so many other aspects of their physiology - simply to keep them alive.",
			"",
			"Ghorans have considerable control over their mass and can shape their bodies however they wish within the basic confines of a humanoid silhouette; this trait often gives them the impression of rustling about, especially when they are frightened or agitated. Ghorans who deal often with humanoids tend to adopt a masculine or a feminine silhouette based on their preference, but gender remains a fluid and somewhat elusive concept to them - an evolutionary adaptation of more import to the comfort of their companions than to ghorans themselves.",
			"",
			"A ghoran has a deep cavity within its belly, housing a single seed the size of a balled human fist. Roughly every 20 years, a ghoran's body becomes decrepit enough to no longer function. The ghoran imprints its abilities and memories into this seed and then plants it in the ground. After 1 to 2 months, a new ghoran body is born from the seed, the consciousness from the original transferring over to the fully grown body and leaving the old body behind as a mindless mass of inert plant matter. In this way, a ghoran's legacy lives on with every regrowth; while the body regenerates, the inner self and memories of the past endure.",
			"",
			"**Society:** A ghoran's alien thought processes (to say nothing of the empty holes upon its flower-petal face roughly approximating its eyes and mouth) make it very difficult for other races to understand and empathize with, leading many ghorans to stick to themselves in segregated communities of cosmopolitan and magic-rich city-states or in the deepest wild places of their barren homeland and its neighboring kingdoms.",
			"",
			"Ghoran architecture consists of round, multifloor greenhouse towers composed of fibrous plant material coated in organic resins that grant it the hardness of stone. The towers have no roofs and several wide, stylized windows, granting the colony of ghorans living within ample access to the essential life-giving rays of the sun. Within, the air is redolent with organic aromas that often induce soporific effects upon non-ghorans, making them pliant to ghoran suggestions and uneager to take aggressive action. When unobserved, ghorans belonging to the same colony sometimes array themselves around the edges of the tower's internal balconies, swaying in unison to some unheard rhythm and basking in the communal warmth of daylight.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Ghorans are most comfortable with other intelligent plants (such as treants and vine leshys) and wary around plant-eating creatures (including humans, whom ghorans know created them as a food source). Because their regeneration brings minor personality changes with each incarnation, ghorans have trouble forming long-lasting relationships with races such as elves, dwarves, and gnomes. Ghorans deeply distrust warmongering humanoids such as goblins and gnolls, especially those with pyromaniac tendencies. The ghorans' relation with humanity is the most complex, for while they admire humans for their capacities and are grateful for their creation, they fear their appetites more, and it is difficult for a ghoran to trust that a human doesn't simply want to eat it.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Ghorans seldom follow humanoid deities, instead preferring to worship nature itself by means of the {faith/Green Faith} or other powerful nature spirits, such as the Eldest of the First World. Ghorans have no predisposition toward law, chaos, good, or evil, but many struggle to differentiate right from wrong as defined by most societies.",

Others maintain the same name over several incarnations, though minor personality and physical changes from life to life ensure that while the ghoran's name might remain the same, aspects of the ghoran's gradual change can often confuse and frustrate longtime friends and allies.",

			"Gnomes are distant relatives of the fey, and their history tells of a time when they lived in the fey's mysterious realm, a place where colors are brighter, the wildlands wilder, and emotions more primal. Unknown forces drove the ancient gnomes from that realm long ago, forcing them to seek refuge in this world; despite this, the gnomes have never completely abandoned their fey roots or adapted to mortal culture. Though gnomes are no longer truly fey, their fey heritage can be seen in their innate magic powers, their oft-capricious natures, and their outlooks on life and the world.",
			"",
			"Gnomes can have the same concerns and motivations as members of other races, but just as often they are driven by passions and desires that non-gnomes see as eccentric at best, and nonsensical at worst. A gnome may risk his life to taste the food at a giant's table, to reach the bottom of a pit just because it would be the lowest place he's ever been, or to tell jokes to a dragon - and to the gnome those goals are as worthy as researching a new spell, gaining vast wealth, or putting down a powerful evil force. While such apparently fickle and impulsive acts are not universal among gnomes, they are common enough for the race as a whole to have earned a reputation for being impetuous and at least a little mad.",
			"",
			"Combined with their diminutive sizes, vibrant coloration, and lack of concern for the opinions of others, these attitudes have caused gnomes to be widely regarded by the other races as alien and strange. Gnomes, in turn, are often amazed how alike other common, civilized races are. It seems stranger to a gnome that humans and elves share so many similarities than that the gnomes do not. Indeed, gnomes often confound their allies by treating everyone who is not a gnome as part of a single, vast non-gnome collective race.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Gnomes are one of the smallest of the common races, generally standing just over 3 feet in height. Despite their small frames, however, gnomes are extremely resilient, and not as weak as many of their foes assume. Though their diminutive stature reduces their ability to move quickly, gnomes often train to take advantage of their size, especially when fighting foes much larger than themselves.",
			"",
			"The coloration of gnomes varies so wildly that many outsiders assume gnomes commonly use dyes and illusions to change their skin and hair tones. While gnomes are certainly not above cosmetic enhancement (and may wish to change their appearance just to see how outlandish they can look), their natural hues truly range over a rainbow of coloration. Their hair tends toward vibrant colors such as the fiery orange of autumn leaves, the verdant green of forests at springtime, or the deep reds and purples of wildflowers in bloom. Similarly, their flesh tones range from earthy browns to floral pinks, and gnomes with black, pastel blue, or even green skin are not unknown. Gnomes' coloration has little regard for heredity, with the color of a gnome's parents and other kin having no apparent bearing on the gnome's appearance.",
			"",
			"Gnomes possess highly mutable facial characteristics, and their proportions often don't match the norm of other humanoid races. Many have overly large mouths and eyes, an effect which can be both disturbing and stunning, depending on the individual. Others may have extremely small features spread over an otherwise blank expanse of face, or may mix shockingly large eyes with a tiny, pursed mouth and a pert button of a nose. Gnomes rarely take pride in or show embarrassment about their features, but members of other races often fixate on a gnome's most prominent feature and attempt to use it as the focus of insults or endearments.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Unlike most races, gnomes do not generally organize themselves within classic societal structures. Gnome cities are unusual and gnome kingdoms almost unknown. Further, gnomes have no particular tendency to gather in specific neighborhoods even when a large number of them live among other races. While specific laws meant to contain the potential impact of gnomes on a society may require a \"gnome quarter,\" and societal pressure sometimes causes all non-gnomes to move away from areas with high gnome populations, left to their own devices, gnomes tend to spread evenly throughout communities that allow them.",
			"",
			"However, even when gnomes are common within a community as a group, individual gnomes tend to be always on the move. Whimsical creatures at heart, they typically travel alone or with temporary companions, ever seeking new and more exciting experiences. They rarely form enduring relationships among themselves or with members of other races, instead pursuing crafts, professions, or collections with a passion that borders on zealotry. If a gnome does settle in an area or stay with a group for a longer period, it is almost always the result of some benefit that area gives to a vocation or obsession to which the gnome had dedicated himself.",
			"",
			"Despite their extremely varied backgrounds and lack of a unifying homeland, gnomes do possess some common cultural traits. Male gnomes have a strange fondness for unusual hats and headgear, often wearing the most expensive and ostentatious head-covering they can afford (and that their chosen careers will allow them to wear without causing problems). Females rarely cover their heads, but proudly wear elaborate and eccentric hairstyles that often include intricate jeweled combs and headpieces.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Gnomes have difficulty interacting with the other races, on both emotional and physical levels. In many ways the very fact other races see gnomes as odd is itself the thing gnomes find most odd about other races, and this leads to a strong lack of common ground upon which understanding and relationships can be built. When two gnomes encounter one another, they generally assume some mutually beneficial arrangement can be reached, no matter how different their beliefs and traditions may be. Even if this turns out not to be the case, the gnomes continue to look for commonalities in their dealings with each other. The inability or unwillingness of members of other races to make the same effort when dealing with gnomes is both frustrating and confusing to most gnomes.",
			"",
			"In many ways, it is gnomes' strong connection to a wide range of apparently unconnected ideas that makes it difficult for other races to build relationships with them. Gnome humor, for example, is often focused on physical pranks, nonsensical rhyming nicknames, and efforts to convince others of outrageous lies that strain all credibility. Gnomes find such efforts hysterically funny, but their pranks often come across as malicious or senseless to other races, while gnomes in turn tend to think of the taller races as dull and lumbering giants.",
			"",
			"Gnomes get along reasonably well with halflings and humans, who at least have some traditions of bizarre, gnome-like humor. Gnomes generally feel dwarves and half-orcs need to lighten up, and attempt to bring levity into their lives with tricks, jokes, and outrageous tales the more dour races simply cannot see the sense of. Gnomes respect elves, but often grow frustrated with the slow pace at which members of the long-lived race make decisions. To gnomes, action is always better than inaction, and many gnomes carry several highly involved projects with them at all times to keep themselves entertained during rest periods.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Although gnomes are impulsive tricksters, with sometimes inscrutable motives and equally confusing methods, their hearts are generally in the right place. What may seem a malicious act to a non-gnome is more likely an effort to introduce new acquaintances to new experiences, however unpleasant the experiences may be. Gnomes are prone to powerful fits of emotion, and find themselves most at peace within the natural world.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Gnomes' propensity for wanderlust, deep curiosity, and desire to master odd or esoteric skills and languages make them natural adventurers. They often become wanderers to experience new aspects of life, for nothing is as novel as the uncounted dangers facing adventurers. Many gnomes see adventuring as the only worthwhile purpose in life, and seek out adventures for no other motive than to experience them. Other gnomes desire to find some lost lore or material that has ties to their chosen vocation and believe only dragon hoards and ancient ruins can contain the lore they need, which can result in gnomes who think of themselves as bakers or weavers being just as accomplished adventurers as those who declare themselves to be mages or scouts.",
			"",
			"Gnomes are physically weak compared to many races, and see this as a simple fact of life to be planned for accordingly. Most adventuring gnomes make up for their weakness with a proclivity for sorcery or bardic music, while others turn to alchemy or exotic weapons to grant them an edge in conflicts.",

			"{SOURCE Inner Sea Races/244;Pathfinder RPG Bestiary/156;Advanced Race Guide/114}  ",
			"Goblins are a race of childlike creatures with a destructive and voracious nature that makes them almost universally despised. Weak and cowardly, goblins are frequently manipulated or enslaved by stronger creatures that need destructive, disposable foot soldiers. Those goblins that rely on their own wits to survive live on the fringes of society and feed on refuse and the weaker members of more civilized races. Most other races view them as virulent parasites that have proved impossible to exterminate.",
			"",
			"Goblins can eat nearly anything, but prefer a diet of meat and consider the flesh of humans and gnomes a rare and difficult-to-obtain delicacy. While they fear the bigger races, goblins' short memories and bottomless appetites mean they frequently go to war or execute raids against other races to sate their pernicious urges and fill their vast larders.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Goblins are short, ugly humanoids that stand just over 3 feet tall. Their scrawny bodies are topped with oversized and usually hairless heads with massive ears and beady red or occasionally yellow eyes. Goblins' skin tone varies based on the surrounding environment; common skin tones include green, gray, and blue, though black and even pale white goblins have been sighted. Their voracious appetites are served well by their huge mouths filled with jagged teeth.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Violent but fecund, goblins exist in primitive tribal structures with constant shifts in power. Rarely able to sustain their own needs through farming or hunting and gathering, goblin tribes live where food is abundant or near places that they can steal it from. Since they are incapable of building significant fortifications and have been driven out of most easily accessible locations, goblins tend to live in unpleasant and remote locations, and their poor building and planning skills ensure that they dwell primarily in crude caves, ramshackle villages, and abandoned structures. Few goblins are good with tools or skilled at farming, and the rare items of any value that they possess are usually cast-off implements from humans or other civilized cultures.",
			"",
			"Goblins' appetites and poor planning lead to small tribes dominated by the strongest warriors. Even the hardiest goblin leaders quickly find out that their survival depends on conducting frequent raids to secure sources of food and kill off the more aggressive youth of the tribe. Both goblin men and women are ugly and vicious, and both sexes are just as likely to rise to positions of power in a tribe.",
			"",
			"Goblin babies are almost completely self-sufficient not long after birth, and such infants are treated almost like pets. Many tribes raise their children communally in cages or pens where adults can largely ignore them. Mortality is high among young goblins, and when the adults fail to feed them or food runs low, youths learn at an early age that cannibalism is sometimes the best means of survival in a goblin tribe.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Goblins tend to view other beings as sources of food, which makes for poor relations with most civilized races. Goblins often survive on the fringes of human civilization, preying on weak or lost travelers and occasionally raiding small settlements to fuel their voracious appetites. They have a special animosity toward gnomes, and celebrate the capturing or killing of such victims with a feast. Of the most common races, half-orcs are the most tolerant of goblins, sharing a similar ancestry and experiencing the same hatred within many societies. Goblins are mostly unaware of half-orcs' sympathy, however, and avoid them because they are larger, meaner, and less flavorful than other humanoids.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Goblins are greedy, capricious, and destructive by nature, and thus most are neutral or chaotic evil.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Goblin adventurers are usually curious and inclined to explore the world, though they are often killed off by their own foolish misdeeds or hunted down for their random acts of destruction. Their pernicious nature makes interacting with civilized races almost impossible, so goblins tend to adventure on the fringes of civilization or in the wilds. Adventurous individuals who survive long enough often ride goblin dogs or other exotic mounts, and focus on archery to avoid close confrontation with larger enemies. Goblin spellcasters prefer fire magic and bombs over almost all other methods of spreading mayhem.",

			"Among the hardiest and longest-lived of Barsoom's savage races, the green men of Mars rove the planet's wastelands in brutal tribes of thousands of warriors, seeking their fortunes as nomads amid the crumbling ruins of ancient cities and the vast barren wildlands between them. The green Martians have ever been at war with the red, black, yellow, and white inhabitants of Barsoom. Legends speak that once, long, long ago, the races of Mars shared a common ancestor, but today most civilized red Martians of city-states like Helium and Zodanga consider green Martians dangerous. subhuman raiders. Their tall frames, four arms. and battle ferocity nonetheless make the green Martians among the most respected denizens of Barsoom.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Green Martians stand 12 to 15 feet tall. with imposing features accentuated by their four agile arms, their mighty tusks, and the red hue of their perceptive eyes. They dress simply in leather harnesses and jewels, each carrying at least one weapon at all times from a very young age. Skin ranges from olive hues to deep forest green, with heavy scarring common among more savage tribes such as the much-feared Warhoon.",
			"",
			"Each adult green Martian female gives birth annually to about 13 eggs, which the tribes deposit in subterranean vaults near their settlements. Every year, tribal chieftains visit the vaults to examine the eggs. All but about 100 of the most perfect are destroyed out of each year's supply, lest the tribe grow to a size the meager resources of Mars cannot support. Those that survive 5 years of cullings are transported to incubators hidden in the dried seabeds of Barsoom's ancient oceans, where they are nurtured by the sun's rays before hatching 5 years later. Green Martians reach maturity at age 40. A green Martian's natural life span might last as long as a thousand years. but most are killed in tribal squabbles, honor duels, arena battles, and wars long before they are considered -old.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Green Martians gather in tribes under the leadership of a chieften counseled by a gaggle of elder warlords. Their tribes usually take the names of the abandoned ruined cities of Martian ancients along the dried seabeds of Barsoom that they inhabit, though few tribes remain stationary for long, preferring a nomadic existence centered on the hardscrabble hunt for the precious resources of the Martian desert. All green folk maintain their status within the tribe through constant examples of skill, strength, and courage. Prone to shocking displays of violence, green Martians possess dark humors; they are more likely to laugh at the gruesome beheading of an enemy than at a simple irony or turn of phrase. Apart from their weapons and harnesses, green Martians tend toward communal ownership of property, even raising children collectively. leaving them with little sense of friendship or family. Their limited telepathic abilities ensure that green Martians speak with few words. preferring hrutish action to academic conversation.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Green Martians tend to keep to their own, and are. inherently distrustful of Barsoom's other barbaric races. The more civilized green Martian tribes - such as the Tharks under the leadership of Jeddak Tars Tarkas - make common cause with the red Martians of Helium. Despite the shared religion of Issus, green Martians as a rule interact infrequently with the white-skinned Therns or black-skinned First Born. Green Martians hold particular antipathy toward the Red Planet's cannibalistic four-armed apes, whom they attack upon sight.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Green Martians are brutish and devoid of sentiments of friendship or love, worshiping only physical prowess and bravery. Most green Martians are chaotic neutral and worship Issus, Goddess of Death and Life Eternal.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Before a green Martian kills his first enemy and takes his victim's name, he is \"o mad,\" a warrior with a single name. Many green Martian adventurers begin their careers as o mads with something to prove, delving abandoned ancient cities, baiting the much-hated Barsoomian White Ape denizens of these crumbling ruins into hard-fought battles to the death to prove their bravery and achieve status within the tribe. Others sell themselves as mercenaries, arena fighters, or bounty hunters after being exiled from their tribes. forced away from lack of resources, or defeated in war. Green Martians eschew spellcasting classes (magic is almost completely unknown on Barsoom), preferring instead martial occupations like fighter, brawler. or swashbuckler. With its focus on providing a boost to Armor Class when unarmored, the warlord fighter archetype (forthcoming in a future issue of Pathfinder Worldscape) is a particularly popular choice for many green Martians.",
			"",
			"**APL Adjustment:** Green Martian characters are more powerful than members of the standard Pathfinder RPG races presented in the Core Rulebook. When creating encounters to challenge a party of green Martians, the Game Master should add +2 to the party's Average Party Level (APL) for levels 1-5 and +1 for levels 6-10.

			"Elves have long drawn the covetous gazes of other races. Their generous lifespans, magical affinity, and inherent grace each contribute to the admiration or bitter envy of their neighbors. Of all their traits, however, none so entrance their human associates as their beauty. Since the two races first came into contact with each other, humans have held up elves as models of physical perfection, seeing in these fair folk idealized versions of themselves. For their part, many elves find humans attractive despite their comparatively barbaric ways, and are drawn to the passion and impetuosity with which members of the younger race play out their brief lives.",
			"",
			"Sometimes this mutual infatuation leads to romantic relationships. Though usually short-lived, even by human standards, such trysts may lead to the birth of half-elves, a race descended from two cultures yet inheritor of neither. Half-elves can breed with one another, but even these \"pureblood\" half-elves tend to be viewed as bastards by humans and elves alike. Caught between destiny and derision, half-elves often view themselves as the middle children of the world.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** Half-elves stand taller than humans but shorter than elves. They inherit the lean build and comely features of their elven lineage, but their skin color is normally dictated by their human side. While half-elves retain the pointed ears of elves, theirs are more rounded and less pronounced. Their eyes tend to be humanlike in shape, but feature an exotic range of colors from amber or violet to emerald green and deep blue. This pattern changes for half-elves of drow descent, however. Such elves are almost unfailingly marked with the white or silver hair of the drow parent, and more often than not have dusky gray skin that takes on a purplish or bluish tinge in the right light, while their eye color usually favors that of the human parent.",
			"",
			"**Society:** Their lack of a unified homeland and culture forces half-elves to remain versatile, able to conform to nearly any environment. While often considered attractive to both races for the same reasons as their parents, half-elves rarely fit in with either humans or elves, as both races see too much evidence of the other in them. This lack of acceptance weighs heavily on many half-elves, yet others are bolstered by their unique status, seeing in their lack of a formalized culture the ultimate freedom. As a result, half-elves are incredibly adaptable, capable of adjusting their mind-sets and talents to whatever societies they find themselves in.",
			"",
			"Even half-elves welcomed by one side of their heritage often find themselves caught between cultures, as they are encouraged, cajoled, or even forced into taking on diplomatic responsibilities between human and elven kind. Many half-elves rise to the occasion of such service, seeing it as a chance to prove their worth to both races. Others, however, come to resent the pressures and presumptions foisted upon them by both races and turn any opportunity to broker power, make peace, or advance trade between humans and elves into an exercise in personal profit.",
			"",
			"**Relations:** Half-elves understand loneliness, and know that character is often less a product of race than of life experience. As such, they are often open to friendships and alliances with other races, and less likely than most to rely on first impressions when forming opinions of new acquaintances.",
			"",
			"While many races join together to produce mixed offspring of notable power, such as half-orcs, half-dragons, and half-fiends, half-elves seem to have a unique position in the eyes of their progenitors and the rest of the world. Those humans who admire elvenkind see half-elves as a living link or bridge between the two races. But this attitude often foists unfair expectations and elevated standards upon half-elves, and quickly turns to derision when they do not live up to the grand destinies that others set for them. Additionally, those half-elves raised by or in the company of elves often have the human half of their parentage dubbed a mere obstacle, something to be overcome with proper immersion and schooling in the elven ways, and even the most well-meaning elven mentors often push their half-elven charges to reject a full half of themselves in order to \"better\" themselves. The exception is those few half-elves born of humans and drow. Not unlike most half-orcs, such unions are commonly born out of violence and savagery that leaves the child unwanted by its mother if not killed outright. Moreover, as the physical features of half-drow clearly mark their parentage, crafting a reputation founded on deeds and character instead of heritage is more challenging for them. Even the most empathetic of other half-elves balk at the sight of a half-drow.",
			"",
			"Among other races, half-elves form unique and often unexpected bonds. Dwarves, despite their traditional mistrust of elves, see a half-elf's human parentage as something hopeful, and treat them as half-humans rather than half-elves. Additionally, while dwarves are long-lived, the lifespan of the stout folk is closer to a half-elf's own than that of either of her parents. As a result, half-elves and dwarves often form lasting bonds, be they ones of friendship, business, or even competitive rivalry.",
			"",
			"Gnomes and halflings often see half-elves as a curiosity. Those half-elves who have seen themselves pushed to the edges of society, truly without a home, typically find gnomes and halflings frivolous and worthy of disdain, but secretly envy their seemingly carefree ways. Clever and enterprising gnomes and halflings sometimes partner with a half-elf for adventures or even business ventures, using the half-elf's participation to lend their own endeavors an air of legitimacy that they cannot acquire on their own.",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most peculiar and dichotomous relations exist between half-elves and half-orcs. Those half-orcs and half-elves who were raised among their non-human kin normally see one another as hated and ancient foes. However, half-elves who have been marginalized by society feel a deep, almost instant kinship with half-orcs, knowing their burdens are often that much harder because of their appearance and somewhat brutish nature. Not all half-orcs are inclined or able to understand such empathy, but those who do often find themselves with a dedicated diplomat, liaison, and apologist. For their own part, half-orcs usually return the favor by acting as bodyguards or intimidators, and take on other roles uniquely suited to their brawny forms.",
			"",
			"**Alignment and Religion:** Half-elves' isolation strongly influences their characters and philosophies. Cruelty does not come naturally to them, nor does blending in or bending to societal convention - as a result, most half-elves are chaotic good. Half-elves' lack of a unified culture makes them less likely to turn to religion, but those who do generally follow the common faiths of their homeland. Others come to religion and worship later in their lives, especially if they have been made to feel part of a community through faith or the work of clerical figures.",
			"",
			"Some half-elves feel the pull of the divine but live beyond the formal religious instruction of society. Such individuals often worship ideas and concepts like freedom, harmony, or balance, or the primal forces of the world. Still others gravitate toward long-forgotten gods, finding comfort and kinship in the idea that even deities can be overlooked.",
			"",
			"**Adventurers:** Half-elves tend to be itinerants, wandering the lands in search of a place they might finally call home. The desire to prove themselves to the community and establish a personal identity - or even a legacy - drives many half-elf adventurers to lives of bravery. Some half-elves claim that despite their longevity, they perceive the passage of time more like humans than elves, and are driven to amass wealth, power, or fame early on in life so they may spend the rest of their years enjoying it.",

			"#### Aquatic Half-Elves (Shoreborn)[^A] [^B]",
			"",
			"The children of aquatic elves and land-bound humans feel the disparity between their heritages more than any other. These half-elves show their parentage on their faces, with sandy, russet, or green-black skin to match their elven parent. Slightly webbed fingers and toes aid in swimming, but their neck slits almost never function as gills. A few aquatic half-elves can breathe underwater and live with their elven parents, but far more shoreborn live on land, feeling a constant call to the water. Many find work as sailors. Fishing vessels and merchant ships often have shoreborn deckhands and first mates, and a crew made up solely of aquatic half-elves sails an infamous pirate ship known as the Shoreline Scourge.",
			"",
			"#### Ekujae Half-Elves (Wildborn)[^A] [^C]",
			"",
			"The half-elves of the Mwangi Expanse have the dark skin of their Ekujae parents, but they tend to be closer in stature and build to their human parents, allowing wildborn to pass for human more easily than most of their fellow half-elves. These half-elves are equally at home in the wilds of the jungle or arranging trade deals in the larger Mwangi cities. While some Ekujae raise their wildborn children, others ritually turn over their half-elven offspring to specific half-elven villages within their Mwangi nation. The adult wildborn of these villages seek out and accept any of these children who might have fallen through the cracks, raising them with respect for both the wilderness and society. Even a few half-elves from other backgrounds travel to the Mwangi Expanse to join these villages, finding acceptance they can't get anywhere else. The members of these villages protect their homes fiercely, and few dare attack them.",
			"",
			"#### Elf-Raised[^D]",
			"",
			"These half-elves represent those embraced by their elven relatives, and raised with all of the traditional cultural training and education typical of most full-blooded elves. These half-elves have the ancestral arms and arcane training alternate racial traits.",
			"",
			"#### Half-Drow (Darkborn)[^A] [^C] [^D]",
			"",
			"Scorned by both drow, who call them thinbloods, and humans, who call them darkborn, half-drow face discrimination and tribulation from an early age. Those half-drow who are not crushed by persecution are forced to age into particularly strong and independent adults. Some give into bitterness from their upbringing, becoming hardened assassins or wanton killers. Others deliberately rebel against their brutal childhoods, becoming righteous warriors against evil. Either way, half-drow fight fiercely to the very last. Darkborn have the gray skin and light-colored hair of the drow but have human-looking eyes, and they have a more difficult time appearing fully elven or human than most half-elves do.",
			"",
			"#### Human-Raised[^D]",
			"",
			"These half-elves were born and raised into accepting human communities, often raised by generations of a single family, or through the charity of churches and temples. These half-elves have the integrated and wary racial traits.",
			"",
			"#### Mordant Spire Half-Elves (Spireborn)[^E] [^F]",
			"",
			"Mordant Spire elves and humans almost never meet by accident. Their offspring, the Spireborn, only come about when Mordant Spire elves travel to human villages. Spireborn half-elves are almost always taken back to the Mordant Spire by their elven parent, and they are usually trained from youth to go on important missions outside of the Mordant Spire. Spireborn undergo both physical training and extensive education on the Azlanti. They tell no one they meet on their travels of their heritage or their top-secret duties.",
			"",
			"#### Snowcaster Half-Elves (Snowborn)[^E] [^F]",
			"",
			"Found throughout the northern countries, snowborn are typically the children of twilight speakers-religious envoys from the normally distrustful Snowcaster clans, who consider it a sacred duty to befriend humans and other non-elves. Snowcaster clans vary in their acceptance of these children, but the average clan's seclusion from humanity and inability to understand half-elves almost invariably ends up driving the snowborn away. Twilight speakers, however, tend to enjoy a particularly close relationship with their snowborn children, and the two groups often wander together. Snowborn have their elven parents' snowy white skin and particularly sharp ears. Some Snowcaster half-elves find welcome homes among the Jadwiga and Ulfen communities, as well as the Erutaki tribes. Others wander, looking for a permanent place to belong.",
