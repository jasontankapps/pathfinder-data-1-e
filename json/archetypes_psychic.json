			"",
			"**Repressed Memories:** All the amnesiac's older memories have been deeply hidden, as though she had been affected by multiple repress memory spells. She isn't prevented from remembering things that happen over the course of a game, but might be forgetful. If the amnesiac's memories are ever restored, she loses this archetype and reverts to a standard psychic.",
			"",
			"**Spells:** An amnesiac's ability to cast psychic spells is the same as that of the psychic class, with the following exceptions.",
			"",
			"An amnesiac's faulty memory makes remembering and casting spells difficult, but the increased flexibility can be a great benefit. Instead of choosing a number of spells known from the {class/psychic/'s} Spells Known table, an amnesiac accesses spells she knew the previous day from the recesses of her mind. This requires 1 hour of meditation. Each day, for each spell level the amnesiac can cast, she retains a number of spells known equal to half the number listed on the Spells Known table, rounded up. These spells must be selected from spells the amnesiac knew the previous day (including any spells she remembered using spell recollection; see below). The remainder of her spells known (half that of a normal psychic, rounded down) become amnesia slots, which the amnesiac can use with her spell recollection ability (see below). To determine the spells she knows on the day when she first takes this archetype, the amnesiac picks any one 1st-level spell from the psychic spell list.",
			"",
			"This change to spells doesn't apply to knacks (0-level spells) or discipline spells, which function the same way they do for a normal psychic. When the amnesiac gains access to 3rd-level spells, she gains full recall of her 1st-level spells and no longer gains 1st-level amnesia slots, instead gaining the full number of 1st-level spells known from the Spells Known table and casting them as a normal psychic. When this happens, the amnesiac can select any level-appropriate spells from the psychic spell list as her spells known, even if they were never among the spells she prepared or recalled; once selected, these spells can no longer be changed, as with a normal psychic. Each time the psychic gains access to a new level of spells, she gains full memory of spells 2 levels lower in the same way (gaining full memory and permanently selecting her 2nd-level spells when she gains access to 4th-level spells, and so on). This ability alters spellcasting.",
			"",
			"**Spell Recollection (Ex):** Once per hour as a swift action, an amnesiac can attempt to remember any spell from the psychic spell list of her choice from either of the 2 highest spell levels she can cast. When she does, she rolls on the table below to determine the result. Because the mental stress of combat brings memories to the surface more easily, the amnesiac adds 1d10 to this roll's result if she's in combat when she attempts to recall a spell. Regardless of the result, the amnesiac expends an amnesia slot of the appropriate level for the spell she is attempting to remember; she must cast the spell remembered (if any) using that amnesia slot during the same round, or the spell slot is lost without effect. Once a spell has been remembered in this way, the amnesiac can cast it as one of her spells known for the rest of the day (even if she failed to cast the spell during the round in which she remembered it), unless spell recollection allowed her to cast a spell of a higher level than she would normally be able to cast.",

			"| 36-95 | The amnesiac remembers and can cast the new spell. |",
			"| 96+ | The amnesiac can choose to treat this result as 36-95. Alternatively, once per day, she can instead temporarily recall any spell from the psychic spell list that's 1 level higher than the spell she's attempting to remember. When she does, her caster level counts as the minimum caster level required to cast the higher-level spell, and she forgets the spell after it's cast. |"

			"**Skewed Mentality (Ex):** At 2nd level, a psychic marauder becomes alienated from reality as others perceive it. The psychic marauder uses her Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of her Wisdom modifier.",

			"**Aura of Insanity (Su):** At 3rd level, a psychic marauder's madness begins to leak out. As a standard action, the psychic marauder can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to manifest an aura of insanity, letting bits of her psyche penetrate the minds of those around her. The aura is centered on the psychic marauder and has a radius of 10 feet, increasing by 5 feet for every 3 class levels beyond 3rd. Any creature starting its turn within the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the psychic marauder's level + the psychic marauder's Charisma modifier) or be confused for 1 round. The psychic marauder can exclude a number of targets inside the radius equal to 1 + 1 for every 3 class levels beyond 3rd, shielding them from her madness. The aura of insanity lasts for a number of rounds equal to the psychic marauder's Charisma modifier. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"At 11th level, when a creature rolls to determine the effects of a confusion effect while within the aura of insanity, the psychic marauder can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to force the affected creature to roll twice. The psychic marauder selects which result is used.",

			"At 19th level, when a creature would roll to determine the effects of a confusion effect while within the aura of insanity, the psychic marauder can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to select the result of the affected creature's confused condition without rolling. This does not allow the psychic marauder to control how that result is applied.",

			"A number of exceptional Darklands half-orcs have developed potent psychic abilities, unlocked by generations of exposure to a specific combination of mind-altering fungi and radiation. Powerful half-orc manipulators often rule smaller Darklands tribes from the shadows, but with few orcs able to match their mental acuity, their only limit is their own ambition.",

			"**Manipulation (Sp):** At 2nd level, a terror weaver can cast {spell/charm person} once per day as a spell-like ability. He can also expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast charm person. If he does so, he uses the level of the spell slot expended to determine the save DC. When a terror weaver gains this ability, if he already knows charm person, he can learn a different 1st-level spell in place of charm person, losing the old spell in exchange for the new one.",

			"**Aura of Intimidation (Sp):** Because he lacks the physical prowess of most orcs, a terror weaver seeks to end fights before they start. At 9th level, he can cast {spell/aura of doom} as a spell-like ability once per day. He can also expend any unused spell slot of 4th level or higher to cast aura of doom. Casting the spell using a higher-level spell slot gives no benefit on its own, but the terror weaver can apply metamagic feats that would increase the spell level to the appropriate level. At 11th level, a terror weaver's aura of doom causes enemies to become frightened instead of shaken. At 19th level, it causes enemies to become panicked.",

At 15th level, when he successfully casts a mind-affecting spell on a target, he can spend 2 points from his phrenic pool to afflict the target with a nightmare spell the next time it goes to sleep. The day after nightmare has taken effect, regardless of the victim's saving throw, the target takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against the terror weaver's mind-affecting spells and abilities for 24 hours.",
