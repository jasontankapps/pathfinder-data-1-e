			"A character background details the significant events, people, and life experiences that make up the origin story of a character prior to his or her role in the saga of a campaign. Some characters are born under extraordinary circumstances, heralded by prophecy and omen; others live completely ordinary lives until some dramatic event casts them onto the dangerous roads traveled by heroes and monsters.",
			"",
			"A character's background forms the basis for complex motivations and emotional vulnerabilities, and these past experiences guide the way the character responds to circumstances in his or her present life. As the child of a goddess and a mortal, do you view ordinary creatures as inferior beings? Having grown up in abject poverty, how do you react when someone steals from you? If a militant theocracy burned your siblings as heretics, how do you respond to clerics of other religions? When playing a new character, the details in your background give you a quick handle on your past, making it easier to slip into the character's skin and embrace this mindset in play. As the campaign proceeds, your early adventures gradually become part of that background - a seamless chain of events that make up your life and contribute to your constantly changing and evolving persona."

			"There are several ways you can approach character background. One approach is an organic method: brainstorming character details, guided by the questions in the following sections.

You can also use the charts and tables in the background generator as a springboard for your imagination, deliberately selecting background elements that inspire you or fit the direction you wish to explore.",
			"",
			"For published Pathfinder Adventure Paths, you often have the option of selecting campaign {rule/traits} that tie your character thematically into a specific storyline relevant to that Adventure Path. Check with your GM to see if she can point you to official campaign traits or other traits that may help link your character to the campaign or adventure she's running. Such traits provide a good foundation upon which you can add details from this section, either by rolling randomly or by manually selecting background details that mesh well with your campaign's themes.",
			"",
			"No matter how you go about developing your character's background, the next step is to quantify that background in terms of game mechanics. Select two traits (or three traits and a drawback) that capture the background you imagined. {main/Traits/ and drawbacks are listed here}. These traits provide small bonuses that reflect skills and knowledge gained from your life experiences. The drawback, if you choose to take one, represents an emotional vulnerability or character flaw that should not only provide a slight mechanical disadvantage, but also (more importantly) serve as a roleplaying tool for making interesting choices. After all, nobody's perfect!"

			"Sometimes, creating a character that feels original and stands out from others of the same class and race can seem like a challenge. It's easy to fall into playing the stereotype of a race or class: the ale-swilling dwarven fighter with the battleaxe, the quick and wise elven ranger roaming the woodlands with a longbow, the sneaky and childlike halfling rogue, and so on. While there's nothing wrong with these, and they can be a lot of fun - after all, there's a reason they became cultural archetypes in the first place - sometimes you want to try something new. Presented here are some techniques you can use to help you break away from stereotypes.",
			"",
			":HL[Originality:] If you strive too hard to be original, you'll likely be disappointed when you discover that someone else has already implemented your idea in a book, film, game, or other kind of media. Yet, while original ideas are hard to come by, every person you meet is unique, shaped by his or her individual experiences. Rather than strive for an original concept, try focusing on the experiences that define your character's life and give him his personality and point of view. Specific experiences will help move you away from the stereotypical and cliche.",
			"",
			":HL[The Third Idea:] When you're brainstorming ideas, it sometimes helps to reject the first and second ideas that leap to mind, and instead consider the third, fourth, and fifth ideas you come up with. This way, you're challenging yourself to explore wider, more interesting possibilities full of unexplored story potential. The easy ideas that spring to mind first probably do so because you've seen them before.",
			"",
			":HL[Opposites:] When you're stuck on an characteristic that strikes you as boring, plain, or stereotypical, decide that the opposite is instead true of yourself. For instance, if you're playing the aforementioned dwarven fighter, perhaps one of the following holds:",
			"",
			"- You have taken a vow against drinking, can't hold your liquor, or act in a peculiar, eccentric way when drunk.",
			"- You can't grow a beard.",
			"- You favor a weapon that is not a hammer, axe, crossbow, or other typical dwarven weapon.",
			"- You live in a forest or on an island rather than in the hills and mountains favored by most dwarves.",
			"- You are a pacifist who loathes violence.",
			"- You deeply pity or love orcs and goblins.",
			"",
			"Any one of these character quirks can prove ripe for character development and story hooks in the campaign.",
			"",
			":HL[Steal Shamelessly:] Sometimes when starting a new character, you just need a good template or foundation from which to build. Characters from literature, comics, history, real life, or television and film can provide that foundation in an instant. The key is to alter various aspects of the model character until you have changed enough to have an altogether different concept.",
			"",
			"How would Count Dracula be different as an elven wizard? What about as a halfling cleric? Are you obsessed with feasting on blood, or are you simply ancient, creepy, solitary, and mysterious?",
			"",
			"What about reinterpreting Julius Caesar as a human rogue or a gnome illusionist? Is this human rogue one of three mobsters scheming to eliminate the competition and rule a city the way Caesar eliminated his competitors to rule Rome? Has your gnome illusionist received a prophetic message predicting his own death, as Caesar did from the soothsayer?",
			"",
			"Building on the foundations of established characters or people gives you a framework, at which point you just need to give yourself different circumstances in order to inspire a new idea, one that will grow on its own as you continue to play. The initial inspiration or model you choose helps you come to grips with your character quickly without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel.",
			"",
			"Another way to accomplish this is to combine notable traits of two disparate characters from media or history. For instance, how would you play a character with Sherlock Holmes' skill at deduction and Hamlet's indecision? Achilles' battle prowess paired with Nikola Tesla's inventive mind? Merlin's magic with Marie Curie's search for scientific truth? Joan of Arc's faithful conviction and Napoleon's overwhelming ambition?"

These shouldn't be commonplace or mundane. \"Tall\" is a poor one, but \"too big for my body\" could be great. \"Charismatic\" is weak, but \"flirts with nearly everybody I meet\" is specific and actionable. \"Homebody\" is not as good a quirk as \"Tall\"",

If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection).

This intuition sometimes leads to discoveries through methods most of your peers would never have thought possible, but that you somehow know will work. You gain access to the {trait/Alchemical Intuition} magic trait. |",

Fire has always been a seductive and powerful force that you have either embraced with glee or focused care. You are adept at exploiting a weakness to fire when you recognize it. You gain access to the {trait/Focused Burn} magic trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Wasn't Strong Enough:** You suffered something at an early age that made you feel powerless. Maybe a relative died from plague, a friend was crushed beneath rubble you were too weak to move, or some other horrible tragedy occurred. You turned to alchemy to transcend the limitations of your physical form. Your relentless dedication has made your bolstering abilities more persistent. You gain access to the {trait/Enduring Mutagen} magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Magic for the Uninclined:** You were always interested in the arcane, but lacked the innate magic of sorcerers or the single-minded dedication possessed by wizards. As a disciple of science, the magic of faith was also closed to you. You dedicated yourself to alchemy, focusing on extracts that mimic the magic you once hoped to wield. That original interest in magic still grants you occasional rare insight into the workings of your formulae. You gain access to the {trait/Cross-Knowledge} magic trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **Master Craftsman:** The first time you saw air mix with the shapeless goo of a tanglefoot bag or shielded your eyes at the heatless light of a sunrod, you became ensnared by the wonders of alchemy.

You gain access to the {trait/Precise Treatment} magic trait. |",

Though others in your craft come up with ways to substitute certain ingredients when making bombs or mutagens, you disdain such practices, deeming them pollutions. To you, there is always a perfect ingredient and its addition makes your alchemy more potent. You gain access to the {trait/Meticulous Concoction} magic trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Nature's Foe:** You lost something or someone important to you through the cruel indifference of nature. Perhaps you watched someone get swallowed by a storm-tossed sea or witnessed a summer forest fire destroy your home and all of your possessions. No matter the impetus, the unpredictability of nature made you feel small and helpless. Your subsequent devotion to alchemy has been in no small part due to a desire to exert control over nature itself, a domineering intent palpable to all creatures of nature.

You gain access to the {trait/Reckless} combat trait and the {feat/Foeslayer} story feat. |",

This might be a gentle part of yourself you wish to eliminate or a brutal, prideful, greedy, or monstrous side you can't control. Your rage is fueled by self-loathing, or by projecting this part of yourself onto a foe you wish to destroy. You gain access to the {trait/Axe to Grind} combat trait. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Hatred of Civilization:** When you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you. Once, such people were free and strong, but rules and laws made them feeble. Your rage is the wild part - the pure part - of yourself that separates you from the craven ways of \"civilized\" people. You gain access to the {trait/Savage} social trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Persecution:** You grew up under the persecution of another power - perhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors. You gain access to the {trait/Bullied} combat trait. |",

In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you rage, a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you're going down, you're taking everyone with you. You gain access to the {trait/Reactionary} combat trait. |",

You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that's how you like it. You gain access to the {trait/Unpredictable} social trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Bloodthirsty:** The first time you spilled a deserving foe's blood and watched the thing's life ebb out onto the hard ground, you found yourself filled with a mad, euphoric ecstasy like none other.

You gain access to the {trait/Worldly} social trait. |",

Paladins sometimes take on younger charges such as orphans or runaways during their journeys, and the seeds of goodness can be sowed into these impressionable youths to grow another knight on the quest for righteousness. Roll on the table below to determine the formative events that led you to become a paladin.",

			"| --- | --- |",
			"| 01-10 | **Divine Calling:** An otherworldly agent of law and good - such as an angel, empyreal lord, or perhaps some other celestial envoy of the gods - tasked you to be a divine champion. You accepted the calling (maybe grudgingly) because ultimately you realize that the laws of destiny and one's divine calling cannot be denied. In return, that celestial agent watches over you and makes sure you can fully realize your destiny and meet the course that has been set for you by a higher power. You gain access to the {trait/Blessed} faith trait. |",
			"| 11-20 | **Dread Penance:** You, or perhaps your family, owe a debt for some past wrongdoing or vice. Maybe you made deals with some unscrupulous loan sharks during a gambling binge or your not-so-distant ancestors were responsible for the persecution of a marginalized group of people. Whatever the offense, your past action hangs over your head and fills you with guilt. You've taken a solemn oath to make good on this past misdeed. Only then will you feel like your life is truly worthwhile. You gain access to the {trait/Oathbound} faith trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Holy Epiphany:** Your faith and purpose came in a brilliant flash of insight. Maybe you suddenly realized that evil can be stopped only with vigilance and deliberate action, or maybe an epiphany showed you that the innocent need protection from corrupt forces for good to flourish in the world. Whatever the nature of your epiphany, it guides your actions and gives you insights others lack. You gain access to the {trait/Inspired} faith trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Zealous Devotion:** Maybe your faith was not popular among those around you during your youth. Maybe you have strange or controversial views regarding your religion, and the other members of your congregation find your practices bizarre or insulting. Whatever the case, your faith is constantly being questioned regardless of your obviously pious nature, and such persecution only serves to embolden your zeal. You gain access to the {trait/Indomitable Faith} faith trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **Moral Debt:** The world and all things material are intrinsically corrupt. All creatures are born with a moral debt, and only by fighting evil, upholding law, and championing the common good can one be truly free of that corruption. You work every day to pay off this debt and move those around you to do the same. You gain access to the {trait/Principled} faith trait and the {feat/Fearless Zeal} story feat. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Mark of Faith:** You were born with the mark of your faith.

You gain access to the {trait/Birthmark} faith trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Righteous Mentor:** A paladin of note and great honor took you under her wing and taught you many things.

You gain access to the [Natural-Born Leader](trait/natural_born_leader_social) social trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Warrior of Truth:** Early in your life, you learned that the philosophies of law and good not only create the best society but also reveal truths that would otherwise remain obscured. You are rarely clouded by pure dogma; instead you're unafraid to question and create your own path toward truth, justice, and righteousness. You gain access to the {trait/Skeptic} magic trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Knight-Errant:** You know that evil stalks the world, and only one who is dedicated to the spread of good can stop these vile forces. To make sure fiends and wrongdoers do not go unpunished, you adopted the code of the paladin in order to travel the land and eradicate the wicked. Your goal is the relentless pursuit to seek out evil and put it down. You gain access to the {trait/Seeker} social trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Terrible Secret:** You know a terrible secret about an ancient evil that threatens your homeland or perhaps even the entire world. You have sworn to keep this secret quiet lest it gain power in the retelling, but you also must work to thwart the evil whenever possible. This at times contradictory path has led you many places in your travels, and the knowledge you have gleaned from your adventures continues to serve you well in your fight against the wicked.

			"Rangers are the hunters of legend. Although known for their ability to master varying environments and their dangers, rangers often achieve this expertise through the dedicated pursuit of their quarry. Though such a target could be a lost or kidnapped friend or a forgotten ruin, more often a ranger's target is a hated enemy, and no feature of the class lends itself better to the establishment of character than his favored enemy. While a professional headhunter might hone his skills to track down humans or other civilized folk, a ranger whose family was murdered by ravenous orcs likely has a different set of priorities while on the hunt. Roll on the table below to determine the formative events that led you to become a ranger.",

			"| d% | Result |",

Perhaps you lost a loved one, family, or even a whole community to the vicious rampaging of a ferocious beast, or saw your entire homeland swallowed up by monstrous hordes. No matter the reason, your drive to hunt down and destroy creatures of their kind won't be sated so long as even one lives. You gain access to the Tireless Avenger faith trait and the {feat/Foeslayer} story feat. |",
			"| 11-20 | **Ancient Hatred:** The history of your people is a saga of struggle against another race. Though common among elves and orcs or dwarves and giants, many different races can have such longstanding animosity. Your choice of a favored enemy was a simple outgrowth of this racial antipathy. You gain access to the {trait/Knowing the Enemy} social trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Big Game Hunter:** Whether you sought out the thrill of hunting large prey or merely grew up in the shadows of creatures large enough to crush an entire village with a careless step, you have learned how to be quick and to size up weaknesses in those behemoths who seem to have none. You gain access to the {trait/Evasive Sting} combat trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Blood Cleansing:** Either you have forsaken your kinsfolk or they have forsaken you. Maybe you grew up among a wicked or corrupt people who you needed to escape, or maybe they exiled you for being different.

Most likely you hunt humanoids of either your own subtype or of one common to your region. You gain access to the Easy Way or the Hard Way combat trait and the {feat/Town Tamer} story feat. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Detached Observer:** You set yourself apart with a pall of cold logic that allows you to see weaknesses in members of your own race that you strive not to succumb to yourself. Most likely, you pick your own race as your dominant favored enemy, and you excel as a spy or assassin paid to capture enemies of your organization. You gain access to the {trait/Cold and Calculating} combat trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Divine Purpose:** Not all those who hear the voices of the gods can distill that echo into magical power like clerics or oracles. These whispers of belief encouraged you to track and hunt those creatures who pose the greatest threat to your faith. Perhaps you're a good ranger who hunts the undead or devotes effort to slaying fiends, or you could choose to target good fey and celestials, emboldened by divine invective. You gain access to the {trait/Faith's Hunter} combat trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Nightmare Slayer:** From an early age, you stood up against some of the most terrifying creatures imaginable, facing off against creatures most mortals only dream of in their wildest nightmares. Possibly hailing from lands besieged by dragons or plagued by the living dead, you are not only resistent to the fear such creatures normally engender, but you live to show your enemies the face of the unafraid. You gain access to the {trait/Fearless Defiance} faith trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Opportunist:** You are an expert in creatures both common and exotic, particularly in terms of what valuable items you can harvest from their remains. The natural world exists for the benefit of those who know what to take, and you have learned how to scavenge pelts, toxins, and even rare spell components from your defeated foes. You might pick animals, magical beasts, or dragons as your dominant favored enemy - or humanoids if you're a particularly grisly trophy collector. You gain access to the {trait/Harvester} social trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Survivalist:** You were orphaned at a young age and left to fend for yourself in the wilds, or simply lived a life at the edge of society that required a constant scrabble for basic existence. You probably have animals or magical beasts (the edible ones) as your dominant favored enemy, and are adept at lying in wait and springing into action. You gain access to the {trait/Hunter's Knack} combat trait. |",

You gain access to the [Dirty Fighter](trait/dirty_fighter_apg) combat trait. |",

You gain access to the {trait/Fast Talker} social trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **The Kill:** You killed someone when you were relatively young. You might have done it in self-defense, in anger, or as part of an initiation ritual.

You gain access to the {trait/Killer} combat trait and the {feat/Innocent Blood} story feat. |",
			"| 51-60 | **The Trained:** Your early talent for feats of agility and acrobatics garnered you an experienced mentor.

You gain access to the {trait/Mentored} social trait. |",

Since then, you've become an adrenaline junkie, performing dangerous tasks in order to chase that high. You gain access to the {trait/Acrobat} social trait. |",

You gain access to the {trait/Canter} social trait. |",

			"Wielders of power on a seemingly impossible scale, sorcerers are conduits of the arcane energies inside them. These powers stem universally from the sorcerers' distinctive bloodlines. Either linked to powerful scions of mystical power like angels, devils, or dragons or touched by the forces of destiny themselves, sorcerers prove that sometimes when magic is involved, either you have it or you don't.

Or the moment could have come at the grave of a great ancestor or in a lush and verdant glen. What slumbered in your blood has never quieted, and you frequently draw upon the inspiration of your awakening. You gain access to the {trait/Ascendant Recollection} magic trait. |",
			"| 11-20 | **Dreams of Something Different:** The first hints of your exceptional nature came to you as fragments of remembered dreams or split-second visions. As these episodes increased in both frequency and clarity, they unlocked a power in your blood you didn't know you had. You gain access to the Strength Foretold magic trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Failed Wizard:** Although your arcane aptitude was evident at an early age, you were pushed toward wizardry as the conduit for your magic. While you never mastered magic in this fashion, your time spent studying arcane tomes gave you obscure but often pertinent knowledge. You gain access to the {trait/Reluctant Apprentice} magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **One of a Kind:** You know that sorcerous power comes from the blood, but as far as you know, none of your ancestors possessed your gift.

You gain access to the {trait/Knowledgeable Caster} magic trait. |",

			"| 51-60 | **Proud Heritage:** You hail from a long line of prominent sorcerers with even more prominent ancestral features. Your acceptance of your bloodline brings with it a pride and imposing mien that becomes amplified among others. You gain access to the {trait/Imposing Scion} social trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Shameful Heritage:** The obvious hints of your heritage were a source of shame to your family. No matter the manifestation of your differences, being a pariah taught you to practice your arts in secret. You gain access to the {trait/Unseen But Not Undone} magic trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Too Lucky:** You've always had a knack for getting out of trouble. This sense of preternatural good fortune led to your inquiries into magic and the discovery of your own sorcerous powers. You gain access to the {trait/Fate's Favored} faith trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Unharmed:** At some point in your early life, you were exposed to something dangerous like a fall into stormy waters or a spell cast your way.

You gain access to the {trait/Unscathed} magic trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Wild Talent:** The magic in your blood was always as uncontrollable as it has powerful. You were forced to learn control at an early age, either out of fear that your powers might hurt someone or out of remorse once they had. This relentless vigilance and self-control gave you tremendous focus and arm you with strategic methods to redirect those wild energies coursing through you.

			"| 11-20 | **Caretaker:** You met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this panicked, otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, outsider or not. You gain access to the {trait/Destined Diplomat} social trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Forced to Confront Your Own Limits:** The bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your eidolon - whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. You gain access to the {trait/Desperate Speed} magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Imaginary Friends:** As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of outsiders trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to summon your eidolon and other outsiders, these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of outsiders. You gain access to the {trait/Unintentional Linguist} social trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **Monophobic:** You were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your eidolon that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your eidolon is not with you, you know it's never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. You gain access to the {trait/Perpetual Companion} faith trait. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Outsider's Lineage:** You have the blood of outsiders in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. You gain access to the {trait/Planar Savant} faith trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Pick On Someone Your Own Size:** When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your eidolon trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. You gain access to the {trait/Twinned Presence} magic trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Raising Gone Wrong:** You lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the dead, but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occur... at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kin's soul bonded with a powerful outsider on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your eidolon. Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. You gain access to the {trait/Loyalty Across Lifetimes} faith trait. |",

It might have been a family member who saved you from a precipitous fall or adventurers who saved you from a marauding monster. Your sense of gratitude fostered a strong sense of protectiveness, particularly when defending your allies or your eidolon. You gain access to the {trait/Dedicated Defender} combat trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Stranger in Your Own Skin:** You have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasn't truly yours. Your quest to become what you've always felt you should be led you to your eidolon, in which you found what you see as your own idealized form.

Only when you turned your eye to ancient tomes and ruins and experimented with strange powers beyond your comprehension were you able to get what you wanted. You gain access to the {trait/Dangerously Curious} magic trait. |",

			"| 71-80 | **Invocation:** When you reached adolescence, you wanted power and you wanted it immediately.

You gain access to the {trait/Oathbound} faith trait. |",

You were burdened by the knowledge that magic - perhaps even a spell as simple as {spell/feather fall} - could have changed the course of lives.

			"| 01-05 | **The Hunter:** This person was a lone wolf who nonetheless cautiously allowed you to become a member of her solitary pack. She taught you how to thrive on your own in spite of the many perils and natural dangers of your native environment. You gain access to the {trait/Child of Nature} religion trait. |",
			"| 06-10 | **The Pariah:** You met a disgraced exile, and found in his words and attitudes something that spoke to you. What once seemed true in your religion, society, or family began to appear false the more time you spent with this person, and you quickly learned not to trust everyone you meet - especially among those who would claim to be most deserving of it. You gain access to the {trait/Suspicious} social trait. |",
			"| 11-15 | **The Confidante:** There was a person in your life to whom you could tell anything. She knows your deepest secrets and your emotional weaknesses and vulnerabilities just as you know hers. This person could be a valuable friend and a frightening enemy, so you make sure to never divulge her secrets or give her a reason to do so with yours. You gain access to the {trait/Trustworthy} social trait. |",
			"| 16-20 | **The Mentor:** You had a mentor who taught you everything worth knowing about life. This could have been the person who taught you the heroic abilities you possess, or simply a kindred spirit who helped form your worldview. You gain access to the {trait/Mentored} social trait. |",
			"| 21-25 | **The Mercenary:** With this person, there was always a cost. No deed was done making a trade for something of equal or greater value. Whether this individual's actions tended toward good, evil, or pure balance, he was always fair in his dealings. You respected this trait and it influenced your own philosophy. You gain access to the {trait/Mercenary} social trait. |",
			"| 26-30 | **The Lover:** You had a romantic connection in your adolescent years, and this person deeply influenced your personality. Perhaps this was a first love, a casual partner you grew close to, or the one who got away. The experience bolstered your confidence in romantic interactions even though you often find your thoughts still straying toward that special someone from so long ago. You gain access to the {trait/Charming} social trait and the {feat/True Love} story feat. Roll a d12 instead of a d20 on the {rule/Romantic Relationships/ table}. |",
			"| 31-35 | **The Fool:** One of your close associates was a clown who mocked propriety and custom, instead engaging in wild and somewhat random actions from time to time. After a while, you learned that there was simple wisdom to this foolery - a careless worldview that taught you how to cast off concern. You gain access to the {trait/Unpredictable} social trait. |",
			"| 36-40 | **The Liege Lord:** You became close with someone you were bound to serve, be it a minor lord or lady, master (in the case of a slave), prince or princess, king or queen. Though this person held power over you, she held you closer than a subject or servant. As a result, you're used to dealing with and being close to power, and your name is known among the ranks of the privileged. You gain access to the {trait/Influence} social trait. |",
			"| 41-45 | **The Relative:** There is a relative you were especially close to. To you, this person was the meaning of family. He helped shepherd you into adulthood, teaching you everything you know about the world. You are bound to this person or his memory, and you strive to keep a promise, vow, or oath that you made to him. You gain access to the {trait/Oathbound} faith trait. |",
			"| 46-50 | **The Boss:** You once gained employment under an organized and powerful individual with far-reaching influence. When the boss was present, everyone listened. This could have been a military commander, tribal chieftain, guild leader, or gang leader. From the boss, you learned how to make people listen, make them see reason, and keep them in line. You gain access to the [Natural-Born Leader](trait/natural_born_leader_social) social trait. |",
			"| 51-55 | **The Academic:** One of your associates had such a lust for knowledge that she could never be satisfied with simple answers or obvious solutions. This desire for knowledge frequently exceeded her need for companionship, but you were the single exception. Through this association you developed a keen appreciation for numbers, geometry, logic, hard study, and problem solving. You gain access to the {trait/Mathematical Prodigy} magic trait. |",
			"| 56-60 | **The Criminal:** One of your associates committed crimes regularly. He regaled you with many stories of daring robberies and break-ins - and perhaps even murders. You learned most of what you know of the criminal element from him, and he trusted you as a friend. You gain access to the {trait/Canter} social trait. |",
			"| 61-65 | **The Seer:** You were close to a person who claimed to see the future - perhaps an oracle, seer, prophet, or merely some festival charlatan. Whether they're true or a trick, you've seen visions of distant places and of times that may come to pass. The seer's influence either made you into an optimist with a drive to change the future or a fatalist resigned to accept it. You gain access to the {trait/Scholar of the Great Beyond} faith trait. |",
			"| 66-70 | **The Mystic:** You were especially close to a holy person in your community who fundamentally changed your life by opening your eyes to the incredible powers that exist beyond the natural world. Regardless of whether you follow a faith, certain religious artifacts, rituals, and texts played a large part in making you the person you are. You gain access to the {trait/Child of the Temple} faith trait. |",
			"| 71-75 | **The Dead One:** One of your greatest influences was a sentient undead creature, such as a ghost, lich, grave knight, wraith, or vampire. You encountered it on several occasions and survived... mostly unscathed. Through this strange relationship you learned of its mortal life, giving you perspective on your own life. You gain access to the {trait/Deathtouched} bloodline race trait and the {feat/Glimpse Beyond} story feat. |",
			"| 76-80 | **The Fiend:** In your adolescent years, you dealt with or were possessed by a fiend who lent you raw power at a time of great need. This experience tainted your body and mind and changed your life. Some part of the demon remains inside you like an old friend, influencing you toward destructive ends. You gain access to the {trait/Possessed} magic trait and the {feat/Damned} story feat. |",
			"| 81-85 | **The Wanderer:** You knew someone who traveled from place to place with the changing of the wind, such as a minstrel, convict, merchant, outcast, soldier, or sailor. This person brought you wondrous mementos and told you of all the places he had traveled and the people who lived there, inspiring a wanderlust within you. You gain access to the {trait/Worldly} social trait. |",
			"| 86-90 | **The Champion:** You were close to someone who excelled at athletic endeavors and tests of strength or skill. Through your friendship or rivalry, you developed the competitive spirit that continues to drive you in everything you do. You gain access to the {trait/Ambitious} social trait. |",
			"| 91-95 | **The Craftsperson:** One of your major influences cherished perfection in every form of art. This person might have followed any path in life, from craftsperson to artist to assassin. From this person you developed a disciplined mind, a solitary focus, and the ability to create something useful and beautiful. You gain access to the {trait/Artisan} social trait. |",
			"| 96-100 | **Well-Connected Friend:** In your circle of disparate associates, there was someone everyone knew. This person collected friends like trophies, and she had contacts in every social or professional circle. Through this connection, you continue to meet and associate with a wide variety of people in every walk of life. You gain access to the {trait/Well-Informed} halfling race trait (which you may take regardless of your race). |"

Most of the selected backgrounds grant access to either one trait or two traits and a drawback. As normal, taking a drawback entitles the character to a free trait. If you choose a background that has two traits and a drawback and you take both traits as well as the drawback, your third trait can be any sort of trait appropriate to your character - you can even choose a trait of the same type as one of the background's traits (which is normally prohibited). This benefit assumes that your GM allots each player character the option of either two traits or three traits and one drawback.

You were raised with the understanding that you would keep important secrets for your parents, things that could never be spoken of to outsiders. Evil and deception are second nature to you, and have always been a facet of your life. |",

But some twist of fortune—your family's own missteps or the predations of courtly intrigue—destroyed your family's reputation and fortunes. The final years of your childhood were spent watching your family's finances slowly vanish and your loved ones lose themselves to alcohol, drugs, or suicide. |",

Your parents spoke little of this event, but rumors and legends floated constantly throughout your hometown. You still don't know the reason for your brief exile in the beyond. |",

Dedicated to a deity or power forbidden by the laws of your nation—or any religion in atheistic Rahadoum—you kept your faith and involvement a secret. When the authorities finally discovered and purged your circle's members, you escaped. To this day, you maintain a longstanding grudge against those agents who killed or imprisoned your friends. |",

You served a vicious gang—such as the Sczarni, Absalom's Bloody Barbers, or Westcrown's Council of Thieves—but your youth shielded you from the guild's most horrific activities.

Your pursuers believe you to have special significance in their grand scheme, but your death can empower them only through ritual sacrifice, so they endeavor to protect you from other threats and capture you alive. |",

The target of your affections tried hard to curb the dark impulses growing within for your sake, and you likewise compromised your morals for the sake of the relationship. Whose outlook and agenda will eventually win out remains unclear, but neither of you can ignore the deep passion between you. |",

But your clarity of purpose was shattered when your so-called allies turned against you, making you realize that not all conflicts are clear-cut.
