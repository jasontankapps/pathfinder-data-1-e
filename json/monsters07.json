			"**Tree Dependent (Su)** A dryad is mystically bonded to a single, enormous tree and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. Most dryad trees are oak trees, but other trees function as well (often having subtle influences on a specific dryad's personality and appearance). A dryad who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. A dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can forge a new bond with a new tree by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save.",

			"Dryads are tree-fey who prefer secluded woodlands far from humanoids in need of lumber. Dryads' main interests are their own survival and that of their beloved forests, and they have been known to magically coerce passersby into aiding them in tasks they cannot complete. They are more likely to be friendly to non-evil druids and rangers, as they recognize a mutual respect for or empathy with nature.",
			"",
			"Dryads are benign guardians of trees, and though they can do little in the way of direct violence, they can trap and disable threats to their homes or turn enemies into allies. Some keep one or more charmed humanoids in their territory to fend off or lead away attackers. Incapacitated foes are typically dragged to the edge of the forest by the dryad's allies and left there, but evil or overtly hostile ones are killed once combat is over."

Derros often abduct surface dwellers to perform hideous experiments on them in their never-ending quest to divine what protects those who dwell above from the burning death, yet the intrinsic madness that plagues all derros dooms these experiments to failure every time. In the end, traumatized victims are returned to their homes, memories not quite completely wiped of their ordeal, to live the rest of their lives in vague fear of a nightmare they can't quite recall.",
			"",
			"A typical derro fights with a short sword or a repeating light crossbow with plenty of poison bolts. Some derros also carry an aklys - a hooked throwing club attached to a 20-foot-long cord.

			"These master infiltrators creep through dark alleys and shadowy corners looking to waylay victims and drag them to Nar-Voth. Bodysnatchers prefer marginalized targets who walk the streets alone: criminals, the homeless, addicts, and any person few others would miss. Well studied in nonlethal tactics, bodysnatchers switch to deadly force only if their presence is exposed. When detected, these kidnappers usually break off pursuit, knowing all too well that they can plan another attempt during the next starless night. Abandoned targets usually then shout maniacal warnings, telling and retelling of their encounters with a race of unblinking nightmares that dwell below the city streets. Unfortunately, most of these testimonials fall on deaf ears. Derros depend on this surface-world indifference to conceal their nocturnal expeditions and keep their slave pens stocked.",
			"",
			"When the moon and stars above shine too brightly, derros forgo the surface and turn upon their Darklands neighbors, abducting dwarven miners, dark folk cultists, and even the rare lone drow. Only kobolds-for reasons that remain largely mysterious even to other derros-escape these hunters' sights. Derros consider the stock of subterranean races common at best and tainted at worst, but a steady supply of captives is needed for slave labor and as subjects of experiments, so even second-rate bodies will suffice in lean times.",
			"",
			"When derros grow brazen enough to take multiple specimens, they target complete households. Bodysnatchers are unparalleled in their ability to pluck victims from secure havens. Since news of an entire family's disappearance creates a stir, derros often direct such operations toward a settlement's rural outskirts and make it look like their marks were the victims of raiding bandits or a wild beast. Sometimes bodysnatchers even provide such cover themselves, dragging captured monsters with them from the depths to rampage through a home once their own work is complete, covering up any trace of derro involvement and leaving a delightful surprise for any concerned citizens who rush to their neighbors' aid."

			"These sinister derros specialize in the skills needed to keep their underground civilization hidden from the surface world. Years of study and experimentation provide them with an unnatural understanding of how the humanoid mind works, especially the sections governing memory. Derro brainwashers program new memories into their targets and remove unwanted memories altogether; they edit away any evidence of their people and sow chaos within a subject's psyche, leaving the unfortunate soul jabbering and confused.",
			"",
			"Brainwashers typically venture aboveground to examine former test subjects when their memories of Nar-Voth visits threaten to return with unwelcome clarity. Instead of killing these leaks outright, the derro would rather protect their investment and try to recover these subjects, open them up to see what went wrong, and return them after appropriate repairs. Fortunately for the brainwashers, these former guests are generally so unhinged from their experience that they're unable to hide effectively. Most rave about white-eyed abductors, slobbering in seedy taverns where they quell the horrible visions with strong drink, or are locked away in asylums when they're caught violently preparing for their tormentors' return. Once the brainwashers locate their targets, they incapacitate the unfortunate victims, bring them back underground, and alter their memories of recent events using either magic or drastic surgery. They rarely come to the surface unprepared or alone, however, and their expeditions often return with new subjects as well as old ones."

They keep to their shallow burrows during the hottest parts of the day, but remain near the opening to ambush creatures that wander near.

			"Childlike souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul, accuser devils embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of the infernal host. From the depths of the Pit they rise in buzzing, shrieking plagues unleashed to taint the land, despoil weak flesh, and reveal exploitable secrets. En masse they display little of the cunning or subtlety typical of devilkind, spreading ruin at the will of their fiendish masters. Alone, though, a zebub is a craven, deceitful thing, lurking in darkness and filth, endlessly spying and vying for the petty favors of greater evils.",
			"",
			"Accuser devils are almost exclusively formed amid the cesspits of frozen Cocytus, the seventh layer of Hell. Within the Pit they serve countless infernal lords as messengers and spies, with droves being unleashed upon myriad mortal worlds with a mandate to seek out souls ripe for corruption or those whose sins might lead to greater damnations. Many zebubs overstep the freedoms of such vague missions, seeking to manipulate weak-willed or easily intimidated mortals into all manner of trivial evils, dispensing shrill orders in their buzzing, childlike voices. Despite the fact that many zebub plots end in the zebubs' own revelation and destruction, few diabolical lords allow the slaying of their spies to go unpunished.",
			"",
			"The zebub's ability to grant other creatures visions of what it has witnessed makes it an unusually useful creature to many conjurers. Relatively easy to conjure with a spell like lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding, an accuser devil can be an invaluable spy. One simply orders the foul little devil to become invisible and then infiltrate an area where visual information is hidden, with orders to teleport back to its point of origin to grant visions of what it observed to its master. Those who make use of accuser devils in this manner should take care to watch their own actions or what they reveal, of course, for such a creature can just as easily be bribed or intimidated into revealing visions that some conjurers might not want being made public. It's common practice among conjurers to kill their accuser devils once they've completed their missions of infiltration and observation.",

			"**Devil Mark (Su)** An advodaza can grant worthy servants a measure of its power. As a full-round action, an advodaza can touch a willing adjacent creature, marking it with a unique symbol similar to an arcane mark. This symbol can be either visible or invisible, as the devil chooses. For as long as the target possesses the mark, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see the False Divinity ability). The target also gains the ability to telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance as long as the two creatures are on the same plane. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to an amount equaling its Hit Dice (typically 18). An advodaza can dispel its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, deal pain to a mark bearer that causes 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza's mark cannot be removed physically, but a dispel magic or erase spell that succeeds on a dispel check or caster level check of DC 30 removes the effect.",
			"",

Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (up to 5th level) of that domain as spell-like abilities, each of which it can use 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, War, or Weather domains, though any domain is possible.",

			"",
			"**Idol Armor (Su)** Advodazas armor themselves in their fallen idols and ornaments of devotion. This armor grants an advodaza a +6 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and immunities (its cold immunity decreases to its normal resistance 10). If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Wound (Su)** The damage an advodaza deals with its claws causes persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to stanch - a DC 30 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed on a DC 30 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects. The Heal check and caster level DC are Constitution-based.",

Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to renew their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are eidolons of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, devils of faith, and fiends of blasphemy: the idol-clad advodazas.",
			"",
			"No two advodazas look exactly alike, each embodying the powers and concerns that saw it worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal, half-bestial shapes bristling with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith, usually in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons. Despite their range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess unique abilities. Most advodazas stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly 9 tons.",

			"**Boundless Reach (Su)** A deimavigga's claws slice through reality, allowing it to make melee attacks against any creature it is aware of - typically meaning creatures within 100 feet. The devil still only threatens the 10-foot area around it and cannot make attacks of opportunity against creatures farther away. This ability can span vast distances, allowing a deimavigga making use of divination magic to detect distant creatures and attack foes separated by miles or even planes. Spells like forbiddance, which prevent planar travel, protect against a deimavigga's claws. The spell dimensional anchor also prevents a deimavigga from using this ability for the duration of that spell. An attacked creature can retaliate until the beginning of the deimavigga's next turn, striking at the devil's claws with weapons or spells as if it were physically present, but the deimavigga's claws receive a size bonus to AC as if they were two sizes smaller than the deimavigga, and the attacked creature cannot grapple or otherwise prevent the claws from vanishing out of reach at the end of the round.",
			"",
			"**Evangelization (Su)** The words of deimaviggas are poison to the mind. Every round a deimavigga speaks (a free action), all non-devils with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 30 feet must make a DC 28 Will save or become vulnerable to its blasphemous discourse. The DC of this Will save increases by 1 for each consecutive round a creature has listened to the same deimavigga speak. Creatures must be listening to a deimavigga to be affected by its oration. Deafened creatures and those in combat - either with the deimavigga or with other creatures - are not considered to be listening. Victims cannot simply declare they are not listening without taking steps to impede their hearing. Upon failing this save, a victim can be affected by the heretical power of a deimavigga's words. The devil may use its speech to affect a listener in ways that mimic any of the following spells: calm emotions (DC 21), charm monster (DC 23), command (DC 20), confusion (DC 23), crushing despair (DC 23), deep slumber (DC 22), enthrall (DC 21), modify memory (DC 23), rage (DC 22), or suggestion (DC 22). Victims still receive saving throws against these spell effects, but if they fail their saves they are not aware the devil is working its power upon them. A deimavigga can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The base save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Indomitable Oration (Su)** A deimavigga's speech is always perfectly clear and cannot be silenced or warped. Even in areas of incredible noise, through water or airless voids, or in areas of magical silence, these devils' voices can still be heard normally. All beings understand deimaviggas, as if these devils constantly spoke in all tongues at once.",
			"",
			"**Malleable Form (Su)** A deimavigga has complete control over its physical form, and if transformed into another shape against its will, it can revert to its own form as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Ohrwurm (Su)** As a standard action, three times per day, a deimavigga can whisper a fundamental and terrifying multiversal truth to one creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 28 Will save or have the devil's words take root in its psyche. Outsiders and elementals have a +2 bonus on their saves to resist this ability. Initially, the deimavigga's words seem to have no effect. Any time the victim tries to rest, though, he must make an additional DC 28 Will save or be affected as per the spell nightmare (even if the victim doesn't technically sleep). After a night of suffering vivid dreams and wrestling with the devil's words, the victim must make yet another DC 28 Will save or have its alignment shift one step toward lawful evil. Only by unlearning what the deimavigga told it can a victim be free of this effect, requiring a spell such as miracle, modify memory, or wish.",
			"",
			"**Wisdom Drain (Su)** A deimavigga drains 1d6 points of Wisdom each time it hits with its claw attack. (A deimavigga does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.)",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Regal, fearsome, and unfeeling, deimaviggas seek to turn the faithful from their gods, using cold logic to proselytize the path of atheism, the freedom of the mortal spirit, and the order offered by Hell. Their ever-shifting masks speak envenomed words and give their hollow lies the ring of truth. Speaking out against all deities - except for Asmodeus, whom they subtly tout as a bringer of discipline even as they downplay his divinity - these deadly intellectuals know that those who turn from their deities are more likely to succumb to the temptations of diabolism. Rather than attempting to sway the souls of individual mortals, these cunning fiends take on the roles of prophets of reason, disguising themselves beneath layers of illusion to evangelize the virtues and freedoms of lives unshackled by the demands of egotistical deities. Occasionally one might focus its arguments on a soul of particular piety, delighting in throwing a deity's most devoted servant into an inescapable crisis of faith. Deimaviggas care little for what gods their depredations affect, disenfranchising the worshipers of the pure and the profane alike.",
			"",
			"In their natural shapes, deimaviggas stand 7 feet tall and weigh a mere 120 pounds. When disguised, though, they typically take the forms of wise elders who have lived long enough to understand fundamental truths about the universe, priests who have \"realized their folly\" and rejected their former dogma, or even \"angels\" of truth. Though they prefer to fight with words rather than with physical means, deimaviggas attack those who attempt to strip away their disguises and illusions, or who can argue as eloquently as they - though if possible, they prefer to do so discreetly and dispose of the bodies secretly.",
			"",
			"Deimaviggas prefer to spend most of their time upon the Material Plane, swaying the weak and corruptible souls of mortals. There they seek out either vast mortal cities, where their heresy might reach many ears, or small communities where the isolated might fall to their blasphemous philosophizing. When in Hell, though, they linger in Caina, tormenting the souls of those trapped upon its lonely islands, developing and testing complicated and often confusing arguments.",
			"",
			"Preferring to operate alone, these poison-tongued devils rarely work with others of their kind, even though their status affords them control over their lesser brethren. They find that their arguments benefit from a single voice, and that their endeavors are complicated by even the most obedient minions. They bow to Hell's hierarchy, however, and serve if compelled to do so. Pit fiends and infernal dukes sometimes utilize deimaviggas as personal majordomos, spies, and spreaders of dissension, though even among devilkind these enigmatic fiends are considered particularly unnerving.",

As such, all of an uniila's spells (not her spell-like abilities) are strange and terrible to behold. This increases the Spellcraft DC required to identify an uniila's spell as it is being cast by +5. In addition, at will, an uniila can choose to make a spell she casts particularly frightening. Any creature forced to make a saving throw to resist a spell cast by an uniila must make an additional Will save at the same DC or be shaken for 1 round. This effect can potentially increase the severity of other fear effects. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Arcana (Su)** Once per day, after spending a minute whispering strange formulas and cosmic truths, an uniila can grant an adjacent mortal spellcaster additional profane insight into the ways of magic. This counts as a bonus spell prepared or spell per day of 6th level or lower, which is immediately accessible by the target in addition to all its regular spells. The uniila chooses what spell to grant the target. It need not be a spell already known by the target, though it must be of 6th level or lower and of a level he can cast or from his class's spell list. This spell remains available to the target for 24 hours. The spell can be any arcane or divine spell. An uniila can never use this ability on herself or non-mortal targets. ",

In addition, as the uniila chooses, she may spontaneously add the effects of any metamagic feat to the spell (without the spell being treated as though it were of an increased spell level). Typically, uniilas use this ability to compel magic users to rely on them for more powerful magic, though they might also use effects like {feat/Widen Spell} to affect unintended targets.",
			"",
			"**Scroll Mastery (Su)** All uniilas possess {feat/Scribe Scroll} as a bonus feat. An uniila is treated as knowing all spells of 6th level or lower in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook and can create scrolls of any of those spells. Whether an uniila knows rarer magic is decided by the GM.",

			"**Witch Token (Su)** By spending an hour in concentration, an uniila can create a token of arcane power. This token may take any form that takes up an item slot, and typically appears as a subtly fiendish ring, amulet, or similar piece of jewelry. While it is worn by a mortal, all of the DCs of any spells the wearer casts increase by +1 (this effect stacks with {feat/Spell Focus}). However, while wearing a witch token, the bearer takes a -5 penalty on all saves made to resist spells and effects cast by the token's creation. Also, while the token is being worn, the uniila can effectively scry through the token at will and without the wearer's knowledge as long as he remains on the same plane. Spells and effects that typically bar or confound scry also affect the witch token. ",
			"",
			"As a standard action, an uniila can cause her witch token to erupt in a burst of destructive magic that deals 10d6 points of damage to the wearer. An uniila can only ever have one witch token in existence at a time and must destroy a previously created token before creating a new one. The damage of this effect is based on the uniila's Hit Dice. ",
			"",
			"All witch tokens are also under effects similar to magic aura, and are detected as possessing auras of moderate universal magic. Those who use identify or a similar spell must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to receive correct information (that the token sheds an aura of strong divination). Detect evil reveals no aura from a witch token. The saving throw is Charisma-based.",

			"The tools devils use to ensnare the minds and ultimately the souls of their victims vary incredibly, from the most blatant of infernal corruptions to enticements that seem not like temptations at all. The elusive cabal devils, or uniilas as they are known by diabolists, employ one of the most seductive drugs in existence in their snares: magic. Mistresses of the arcane with an understanding of the cultic arts - both arcane and divine - that rivals even that of many greater fiends, these mysterious and aloof sages haunt the most ancient ruins and moldering depths of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, researching arcana and puzzling over formulae destined to shake the cosmos. When conjured forth or left to their own devices upon the Material Plane, uniilas make no untoward offers or forceful demands of their mortal hosts; they merely offer greater magical power in any of the various ways they might do so. Should the ease with which such might is granted pollute a mortal's ambitions or lead him to rely upon a devil for his power, such ultimately proves the student's fault, not the eager teacher's. So too does the resulting damnation at the end of the mortal's short life prove more of his own doing than any overt diabolical trap, making uniilas' methods all the more sinister for their subtlety.",

			"Uniilas eagerly seek passage to the Material Plane and as such welcome summons by mortal casters. Whether to experiment with spells, seek out new magic, or corrupt mortals with their knowledge, what plots an uniila holds often prove inscrutable and of secondary interest to a summoner. Tempering their desire to reach the mortal plane, an uniila's vanity prevents it from serving a witless or hopeless summoner. Thus, uniilas turn the act of summoning about on those who call upon them via a planar binding spell, requesting that such mortals demonstrate their spellcasting prowess. If the mortal effectively casts a spell the uniila does not know (not one of those spells she possesses as a sorcerer spell or spell-like ability), or performs a spell of 5th-level or higher, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to bind the devil. Occasionally, an uniila purposefully remains to serve an inferior spellcaster, or one that fails his opposed Charisma check. Granting the inept tools they should never possess amuses the devils, and even the most incompetent \"masters\" might prove useful in seeking out components of an uniila's ongoing projects in Hell.",

This compulsion can be temporarily dismissed by a break enchantment, dispel law, or dispel magic spell that overcomes a DC 25 dispel check. This frees the chortov of its bondage for 1d6 minutes, during which the baffled creature acts as though under the effects of the spell confusion. Destroying the armor via sundering attacks also frees the devil for 1d6 minutes, after which the armor magically reforms. A chortov's armor has hardness 13 and 45 hit points.",

Born from the remains of souls not destined for Hell but damned nonetheless, chortovs carry with them the rage of those who have suffered the multiverse's cruelest injustice, and by the inescapable yoke of diabolical magic find themselves set upon the enemies of their merciless captors. Trapped within grotesque bodies of writhing, porcine flesh and smoldering hellfire, these horrors hate all things' other creatures, their fate, and the lords who have ensnared them and forced them to serve even past damnation.",
			"",
			"Standing over 20 feet tall, chortovs are mountains of flesh, muscle, and flame. Each weighing upward of 5 tons, these devils bear plates and bands of diabolical armor that serve as physical manifestations of the infernal sorceries that bind them as eternal slaves to Hell. Each chortov's armor is unique, often bearing images of the vaguely remembered torments their constituent souls once suffered. Their bodies, too, bear incongruities uncommon in other diabolical races, harkening toward the lawless natures of the soul-stuff from which these terrors are sculpted.",

They can wield these contracts like whips, but deal lethal damage regardless of the armor bonus of their target. A contract devil modifies attack and damage rolls when using a binding contract by its Intelligence modifier, not its Strength modifier (this equates to a +7 bonus for most contract devils). Wounds created by a binding contract resemble horrifically deep paper cuts and cause 1d6 points of bleed damage. A contract devil can use its binding contract to disarm and trip foes as if the contract were a whip. If it is itself disarmed of the contract, the devil can rearm itself with a new contract as an immediate action.",

This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, as detailed on the following page. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the mortal must sign its true name to the document of its own free will. Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil, condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall it upon the mortal's death. Breaking a contract with a contract devil is difficult and dangerous; as long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a {spell/miracle} or a {spell/wish}. If a mortal is restored to life in this way, the contract devil immediately senses the development - it not only knows which soul has been restored to life, but also gains the benefits of a {spell/discern location} spell targeted on the character or creature that restored the damned soul to life.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Investment (Su)** As a subclause of all infernal contracts, a contract devil can use greater scrying at will upon any creature it has a contract with. The target creature always fails its save against the devil's scrying attempt-this ability otherwise functions at caster level 20th.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"A contract devil, also a called phistophilus, always appears handsome and confident, its chiseled features housing a perpetually smug grin. Contract devils have red skin and black hair and stand near 6-1/2 feet in height, not counting their horns. The thicket of horns around a contract devil's body increases its height to 7 feet and its weight to 350 pounds.",
			"",
			"They exist to keep track of the damned, to manage Hell's endless ordinances, and, when time and opportunity permit, to coax mortals into damnation. Most phistophiluses spend their eternities in the various courts of Hell's nine layers, particularly in the maze-like fortress-libraries where all infernal laws and oaths are recorded. Occasionally they serve similar roles on the Material Plane when summoned by particularly desperate, arrogant, or foolish mortals.",
			"",
			"When one of the souls damned by a contract devil is restored to life (typically via powerful magic like a wish or miracle), the phistophilus immediately notices the transgression. Usually, the contract devil recruits the aid of more powerful allies to track down and punish such transgressors and to collect the escaped soul as quickly as possible.",

			"### Infernal Contracts",
			"",
			"While numerous types of infernal contracts exist, the following two are those most often offered to mortals by contract devils.",
			"",
			"Evil Wishes: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted three wishes, as per the spell. It must use these wishes within 24 hours of signing the contract - if it does not, the wishes are wasted but it remains bound to the contract nevertheless. While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase a wish.",
			"",
			"Infernal Slave: A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. The mortal chooses any type of devil (except for a contract devil) of a CR equal to or less than its own character level at the time of the bargain. Upon signing the contract, the mortal's infernal slave appears and is bound to do the mortal no harm and follow its orders for as long as it lives. Although the devil must obey its master's commands, many devils delight in corrupting the intentions of these orders in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways.",
			"",
			"### Breaking an Infernal Contract",
			"",
			"An agreement with a contract devil can only be broken in two ways. When a contract is signed, a second copy manifests; one copy is retained by the devil and the other is given to the mortal. Mortals are free to do whatever they please with the lengthy, obviously evil documents, while contract devils typically keep active contracts with them at all times. Should both copies of a contract be destroyed, any effects caused by the contract are canceled or reversed and the mortal's soul goes to its normal place of rest after death and can be resurrected as normal. Merely absconding with both copies of the contract is not enough to break the contract - as long as both copies exist, the signer's soul remains forever damned.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, a second mortal might be allowed to adopt the terms of a contract-with its soul replacing that of the original contract signer after death. The mortal who seeks to pay the debt of another must contact the contract devil who holds the relevant contract. The contract devil has a choice of whether or not to allow one mortal to pay another's debt, but values religious and good-aligned souls over others. Shrewd manipulators, contract devils often only agree to allow one mortal to pay another's debt in return for some service or proof of worth. If a contract devil agrees to accept another soul in payment, the original contract signer retains all of the benefits of the contract, but is released from damnation and may be resurrected as normal. The new signer, however, receives no benefits, cannot be returned to life upon dying, and spends an eternity in Hell after death.",

If a munagola's attacks reduce a creature to below 0 hit points, her critical threat range for all attacks doubles until the end of her next turn (typically increasing her battleaxe threat range to 17-20 and her gore threat range to 19-20).

The result of fleshwarping and infernal tinkering that defies even the archdevils' scrutiny, munagolas combine the aerial strength and craftiness of erinyes with the sheer brute force of barbed devils, bone devils, and even pit fiends. It takes centuries to create one munagola from a progenitor erinyes, but once she's transformed, the devil is even stronger, more furious, and more determined to conquer Hell on Eiseth's behalf than ever before.",

			"**Double Down (Su)** A gambling devil's understanding of probability is so good that it knows the best moment to play its hand, even if that means having to lose one first. As an immediate action, anytime a gambling devil rolls a d20 (for an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check), it can take a luck penalty of up to 1/2 of its Charisma modifier on the roll (-2 for most magadazes). The next time within 1 minute it attempts a d20 roll of the same category (for example, if the first roll was a skill check, the second can be any skill check), it gains a luck bonus to the roll equal to double the penalty taken earlier (+4 for most magadazes).",
			"",
			"**Produce Coins (Su)** A gambling devil can produce up to 50 gold coins by drawing them from its body as a free action. Typically, a magadaz uses this ability to pay its debts at a gaming table, but it must successfully use Sleight of Hand if it wishes to conceal the supernatural nature of this ability from any observers. Coins produced in this way disappear 1 hour after leaving the gambling devil's possession. In addition, a gambling devil can use these coins as weapons, turning them into dangerous thrown projectiles. Each coin deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage and counts as evil, lawful, and magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A gambling devil can produce a number of gold coins per day equal to 50 &times; its Constitution score (850 coins for most gambling devils).",
			"",
			"**Risk Aura (Su)** The presence of a gambling devil encourages nearby creatures to make riskier decisions and take bigger gambles. Any creature within 30 feet of a gambling devil must succeed at a DC 16 Will saving throw each round or be compelled to throw caution to the wind so long as it remains within the aura's effects. Whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll, any creature affected by this ability must roll twice. If either roll is a natural 20, the affected creature can use that roll. Otherwise, it must use the lower of the two results. A gambling devil can suppress or reactivate this aura as a swift action. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Gambling devils, also known as magadazes, are born from the damned souls of mortal gamblers, bookies, and even moneylenders. Although they can be found throughout Hell and even on the Material Plane, they are most numerous in Erebus, the third layer of Hell, where they use their immense luck and cunning to serve the archdevil Mammon, Hell's accountant and treasurer. In addition to their pathological love of and skill at gambling, magadazes are known for their willingness to provide ledgers claiming anything that their customers - usually diabolists or other foolish souls - might desire. Common requests include paperwork proving clients' destitution or statements showing that their vaults overflow with gold and jewels.",
			"",
			"To pay for this creative accounting, the client must simply engage the gambling devil in a game of chance. Sometimes these competitions are even fair (or as fair as any such game can be), but a gambling devil's unique skills give even the toss of a coin poor odds. This, coupled with a magadaz's ability to encourage risk-taking, means that gambling devils have caused many mortals to lose everything they own. Gambling with magadazes almost always seems fair until the devils miraculously win at the last moment.",
			"",
			"Some believe that magadazes are extensions of Mammon's reach, tempting mortals away from their wealth and siphoning it into Erebus's innumerable vaults. But gambling devils also simply take pleasure in manipulating chaos to force probability toward their own advantage - or that of their patron. Gambling devils vary widely in shape and size, but they stand 5-1/2 feet tall on average. Their incredible density, however, results in them weighing an average of 500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Gambling devils resemble living gold statues, and their bodies are as soft and malleable as one would expect, especially in the heat of Hell. Melting doesn't harm or even particularly inconvenience a magadaz - it can speak or see even if its face has melted away, and it can hold a humanoid shape in front of all but the fiercest flame. However, even the heat from a torch can melt away finer features, forcing the magadaz to shape them again. If destroyed, gambling devils aren't reduced to scrap gold. Instead, they melt into puddles of molten lead, as does any piece that is severed from a still-living magadaz. Some say that such leaden puddles litter Erebus, particularly the areas Mammon frequents. Those rumors claim that the archdevil regularly destroys gambling devils who have, in his eyes, shirked their greater duty to him in favor of frivolous gaming activities that bring no profit to the vaults.",
			"",
			"Perhaps to avoid this destructive wrath, many gambling devils are overly eager to gain the Ardent Prince's approval. Those that enjoy Mammon's highest favor sometimes serve as the archdevil's bookkeepers. They are particularly useful in roles where the amount owed Erebus, or Hell in general, is in dispute. In addition to their meticulous accounting skills, magadazes' luck and skills ensure that Hell ends up on the winning side of almost any monetary arrangements. This role seems to suit many gambling devils well, as it allows them to manipulate money and debts while staying in Mammon's good graces.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Devil}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Gambling devils tend to be either meticulously devoted to or colossally incompetent in their infernal service. Additionally, though they can suppress their ability to encourage risky decisions in others, they are easily distracted and may unintentionally affect other devils. Because of this, despite their ubiquitous presence in Hell, they are often kept at arm's length from important proceedings. When an important decision needs to be made, incompetent gambling devils are often sent elsewhere and tasked with long and tedious jobs, such as tallying all the casualties in a battle against Heaven. In rare cases, however, they are invited to key proceedings to encourage carelessness in their masters' rivals.",
			"",
			"When visiting the Material Plane, magadazes take the forms of humanoids typical of the particular region they are visiting. In this guise, they often fund and encourage gambling halls and other dens of temptation, even going so far as founding gambling halls when none can be found nearby. They take special delight when they can establish these dens of sin near temples of Abadar, undermining the temples' authority while at once overworking and infuriating the clerics.",
			"",
			"Conjurers who call gambling devils to their sides must be sure to steel themselves against the temptation these devils engender, for magadazes possess great skill in making even the most unlikely bet sound tempting. Despite this risk, many still bind these devils, seeking allies who gladly provide discreet aid in high-stakes gambling ventures; in turn, though, gambling devils almost always demand a game of chance with the caller as payment, and those games' subsequent costs can run high indeed.",
			"",
			"The fact that one never knows whether a called gambling devil will be meticulous or incompetent poses an additional risk. When not tasked with a job, less effectual gambling devils seize upon any opportunity for a game of chance. To combat this inclination, canny summoners provide a bound magadaz with constant distractions. Many find benefit in calling two magadazes at once, allowing them free rein to gamble as they will so long as they do so only with one another."

Willingly serving spellcasters as familiars, imps play the role of dutiful servants, often granting their masters cunning advice and infernal insights. In truth, though, an imp works to deliver souls to Hell, assuring that its master's soul - and as many collateral souls as possible - faces damnation upon death.",

An imp consular can be summoned via the Improved Familiar feat, but only by a spellcaster of 8th level or higher. Diabolists tell of other breeds of imps with similarly specialized abilities, but if such creatures truly exist they are an especially rare lot.",

			"The least of devilkind, lemures roil forth from the ranks of souls damned to Hell, shapeless masses of quivering flesh. What spark of instinct or memory lingers on within a lemure's semi-consciousness regularly shapes its features to mimic those of its tormentors or the tortured souls around it. Grotesque and useless, a lemure's features speak nothing of what it once was. Many exhibit multiple terrible visages or are nothing more than churning pillars of cancerous flesh. Only their knobby, flailing limbs work as they should, and those they merely use to destroy any non-infernal life that draws too near. Moving lemures typically congeal in forms over 4 feet tall and weigh upward of 200 pounds, though when at rest these disgusting fiends often appear to be little more than lumps of melted flesh and malformed features.",
			"",
			"Although among the most loathsome creatures in existence, lemures serve a vital role in Hell's perverse ecology. When at the end of a mortal life a creature's soul is damned - whether because it revered diabolical forces or failed in the worship of another deity - it joins the masses of suffering souls filling the plains of Avernus, Hell's first layer. Here a soul's torments begin as lesser devils marshal it along with similar spirits in preparation for a long, perilous journey to one of Hell's deeper layers - typically one suited to the punishments appropriate to the soul's crimes, or merely the domain of a devil who has need for slaves. Upon reaching the realm of their damnation, souls face untold lifetimes of torment at the hands of devils, other fiendish beings, and the deadly machinations of Hell itself. As the formerly mortal essences slowly go mad, they forget their lives, grow bestial, and eventually become little more than automatons of fear and hatred. After ages of such existence, the cruel processes of Hell either utterly annihilate the soul or - in the cases of the most profane spirits - reconsecrate such forsaken beings into lemures, the building blocks of devils, unthinking waves of filth and diabolical flesh. Such repulsive beings assemble in vast mobs, waves of putrescence thousands upon thousands strong. Greater devils can spot the most corrupt of these fiends and, either through mysterious tortures or the powers of Hell itself, reshape them into true devils, newly born and ready to obediently serve in the legions of the damned.",

While memory devils always keep their bargains, those who anger them may find that their altered memories cause more trouble than the originals. Mnemor devils are particularly skilled in the subtle manipulation of memory to drive mortals' actions in destructive directions or even trick them into making the same bargain again and again as the mortal unearths the unbearable secret on her own, paying the devil each time. The most skilled among them subtly alter the false memories they grant to those who would bargain with them in ways that cast the subjects' true memories in a different light, making memories of affectionate smiles seem to take on smirking undertones, or adding sly malice to memories of innocent comments. The bargainer finds himself driven into maddening doubt about the intentions of everyone he thought he knew, suspicion tainting all his interactions.",

For as long as the creature is marked, it gains a spell-like ability it can use once per day. This spell-like ability comes from the advodaza's chosen domain (see False Divinity, below). The target can also telepathically communicate with the advodaza over any distance while on the same plane. An advodaza can dismiss its mark as a standard action, no matter where the bearer is. It can also, as a standard action, cause pain to a mark bearer that deals 6d6 points of damage with no saving throw. An advodaza can mark multiple creatures, up to a number equal to its Hit Dice (typically 18).",
			"",
			"**False Divinity (Su)** Each advodaza chooses one cleric domain and gains the domain spells (5th level and lower) of that domain as spell-like abilities. Each of these abilities can be used 3 times per day. The advodaza does not gain any of the domain's granted powers. Most advodazas possess powers from the Evil, Fire, Law, Trickery, War, or Weather domains, though any domains except Good or Chaos are possible.

This armor grants an advodaza a +7 armor bonus to AC and immunity to cold, electricity, and sonic damage, as well as immunity to the spell dismissal. The spells chaos hammer, holy smite, holy word, and word of chaos destroy this armor, removing the devil's armor bonus to AC and its immunities (its cold immunity is replaced with the devil's normal cold resistance of 10). The armor is automatically destroyed if the advodaza is slain. If uninterrupted for 1 hour, an advodaza can summon new armor to replace its destroyed protection.",

The damage an advodaza inflicts with its claws leaves persistent wounds that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. Bleeding caused in this way is difficult to stanch - a successful DC 29 Heal check is required to stop the bleeding, and anyone attempting to magically heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 29 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects. The Heal check DC and caster level DC are Constitution-based.",

			"False gods, fallen demagogues, nemesis devils-all are names for the fiends known collectively as advodazas. They survive from dark ages past, when mortals offered worship to base things and unwholesome spirits that masqueraded as baleful gods. Although time and faith have turned against these beings, the most tenacious of their kind have refused to fade into oblivion, and to these obstinate corruptors and one-time deities the gates of Hell swing wide and welcoming. These lords of cults and masters of forgotten mysteries find renewed vigor in the depths of the Pit, and those seeking to restore their power and lordship over mortalkind undergo terrible indoctrinations and binding rites that transform them over the ages into true devils. What emerge are shades of half-remembered demigods, fallen princes seeking to claim their subjects anew, and fiends of blasphemy: the idol-clad advodazas.",
			"",
			"Fantastically ancient beings, advodazas rose from spirits worshiped by mortals in distant ages, typically as part of primitive and deranged cults. While humanoids still huddled in crude shelters, begging any power that would listen to protect them from storms, beasts, enemies, hunger, and countless other fears, the spirits of the land, sky, and animals were the first to give heed. Not deities, but elusive influences, these forces heard the early prayers and worked what appeared to be miracles in return for sacrifices and adoration. Slowly, these formless vestiges took shape as idols, fetishes, palladia, and all manner of cult images. Yet as knowledge of true deities and the powers they offered worshipers spread, the old spirits were either forgotten or demonized and rooted out.",
			"",
			"All advodazas desire to eventually return to the Material Plane, where they might tempt new followers to serve, sacrifice, and raise idols to their names. Though merciless, advodazas appeal to many mortals because of the directness of their interaction and their willingness to grant power or to violently smite enemies for a seemingly paltry price. In death, however, advodazas' servants find no divine realm, nor do they sit beside some grand deity. When they die, there is only Hell.",
			"",
			"No two advodazas look exactly alike. Each one embodies the powers and spheres of influence for which it was worshiped in ages past and subsequently anthropomorphized as a monstrous being. Typically, this results in quadrupedal and half-bestial shapes that bristle with terrible wings, hooves, claws, and fangs. Universally, though, they bear the broken remnants of their fallen faith - in the form of cracked idols worn like armor, profane talismans crafted into jewelry, or fearful totems wielded like massive weapons - and bristle with archaic power and unquenchable arrogance. Despite this wide range of appearances, all advodazas possess the same core abilities, though some particularly ancient or powerful fiends possess augmented or even unique abilities.",

After a minute passes, the lemures reform into the shape of a new lesser devil ready to follow the orders of the pit fiend.

Thick muscles cling to their gigantic frames, armored over by dense, bladed scales capable of deflecting all but the most potent assaults. Fangs as thick as daggers fill their maws, bestial visages disguising some of the most insidious minds in Hell. Born within the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest layer of Hell, pit fiends are raised from the ranks of cornugons and gelugons by the archdevils and their dukes alone. While many travel to higher layers and far from Hell to command infernal legions, most remain in Nessus serving in the courts of Hell's elite or in dark councils with unknowable purposes. Pit fiends always stand over 14 feet tall, with wingspans in excess of 20 feet and weights over 1,000 pounds.",

When convinced they've formed the perfect legions, they turn their attentions to vulnerable demiplanes and mortal worlds, eyeing them for infernal domination and the glory of conquest. While obedient to the hierarchies of their kind, they are also strict in their enforcement, and should a pit fiend find itself subservient to a master unfit to rule, it holds itself duty bound to cast down such an incompetent lord. Thus, whether as masters or servants, pit fiends embody the will of Hell's merciless law and assure that only the strongest of devilkind flourish (or dare to).",

A pit fiend might dutifully serve a mortal master for centuries, but its goal is always the same: to further corrupt the mortal soul, assure its absolute damnation, and when the mortal inevitably dies, claim its soul and begin the process of creating a perfectly corrupt lemure servant. Pit fiends know they are immortal and are intelligent enough to indulge in impossibly disciplined patience.

			"**Contract Killer (Su)** A salikotal gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls when attacking a specific individual it has marked for death. At the beginning of each day, it determines an individual to serve as its target and which one of its three vengeances it may make use of that day. It may not change this target or ability until the next day. The target may be any specific creature the salikotal knows of, even if it has not seen its target before. This target is treated as being known to a salikotal for the purposes of using its locate creature ability, even if the devil has never seen its victim before.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex)** Anytime a salikotal's opponent is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, or if a salikotal flanks his opponent, he deals an extra 3d6 points of damage. This ability is just like the rogue's sneak attack and subject to the same limitations.",
			"",
			"**Suicide (Su)** As a standard action, a salikotal may target itself with a coup de grace attack. If the salikotal reduces itself to fewer than 0 hit points - or fails to do so but still fails the associated Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt) - the salikotal erupts in a burst of destructive energy. Any creature within 15 feet of a salikotal that commits suicide is damaged by a blast of metal shards and needle-like scales, taking 6d6 points of damage (DC 17, save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based. Upon using this ability, a salikotal is permanently destroyed. This effect only takes place if a salikotal willingly ends its own life, not if it is killed by outside effects.",
			"",
			"**Vengeance (Su)** While seeking a victim a salikotal prepares itself daily, honing its will to effectively slaughter its intended quarry. On a given day, chosen as part of its contract killer ability, a salikotal may gain the benefit of any one of the following powers, either the one it feels will most aid it or whichever one its summoner requests. Only one of these abilities is active on a given day, and it only comes into effect when a salikotal kills its intended target with a coup de grace. These executions only function on living creatures.",
			"",
			"- Fideicide: The victim's soul is immediately shunted to a infernal prison on Erebus, the third layer of Hell. The soul can be returned to life, but upon casting the spell, the spellcaster attempting the {spell/resurrection} takes an amount of fire damage equal to 1d6 &times; the victim's number of Hit Dice, and must make an immediate concentration check (DC 10 + damage delt + spell level) or lose the spell.",
			"- Necrocide: After 1d4 rounds, the victim's body animates as a zombie under the salikotal's control. The devil may permanently grant control of the zombie to any sentient creature as a free action.",

			"Prince-killers and assassins of souls, salikotals serve as the bloody chisels by which the lords of Hell subtly shape the mortal world to their whims. Soaring through the night on silent wings, these murderous devils care nothing for life or reason, knowing only a single, murderous goal. Cloaked by shadow and silence, few ever glimpse the sharp features of a salikotal, for Hell's death-dealers reveal themselves only amid the haze of fading life.",
			"",
			"Lean, deft hunters, salikotals move like terrible predatory birds, each taloned step measured, cautious, and full of deadly intent. Protected by an armor of sharp, thin scales, these agile devils universally stand 5 feet, 4 inches tall, and weigh 85 pounds, their barbed frames supporting the breadth of their 8-foot-wide, bat-like wings. They have full control over their slender tails, nimbly manipulating objects and even wielding deadly, Hell-forged blades in these dexterous, prehensile appendages.",
			"",
			"### Summoning Salikotals",
			"",
			"As in all things, salikotals prove emotionless when it comes to being summoned. They have little reason to purposefully resist or accept a diabolist's call, unless ordered to do so by their infernal masters. Once a salikotal is summoned, though, only murder interests it. Any Charisma check made as part of the spell planar binding to convince a salikotal to undertake a mission other than assassination takes a -2 penalty.",
			"",
			"Once a salikotal has agreed to perform a murder for its summoner, it explains the signature vengeances its kind can inflict upon a victim and offers to exact one upon its summoner's victim for an associated price. The devil requests 1,000 gp for every Hit Die its target possesses (intrinsically gauging its victim's prowess), to be paid entirely in one of three types of gemstones: ruby for fideicide, onyx for necrocide, and jacyinth for omnicide. Salikotals prove exceedingly particular in these payments, and if a summoner cannot pay the price in the type of gem requested, the devil refuses to exact one of its vengeances. If the summoner tries to force a salikotal to use one of its vengeances, the devil takes offense and all of the summoner's Charisma-related interactions with it in the future take a -2 penalty.",

			"**Devour Soul (Su)** By making a touch attack as a standard action, a devourer can deal 12d6+18 points of damage as if using a slay living spell. A DC 22 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the devourer's chest. The creature cannot be brought back to life until the devourer's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. A devourer can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides a devourer with 5 essence points for each Hit Die possessed by the soul. A devourer must expend essence points when it uses a spell-like ability equal to the spell's level (for sake of ease, spell levels for its spell-like abilities are included in its stats in superscript). At the start of an encounter, a devourer generally has 3d4+3 essence points available. The trapped essence gains one permanent negative level for every 5 points of essence drained - these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.",

			"**Ghost Touch Jaws (Su)** A drocha swarm's many biting jaws are considered to have the ghost touch special ability. This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal foes, and to deal normal damage to incorporeal creatures such as ghosts, shadow demons, and even other drocha swarms.",
			"",
			"**Project Death (Su)** As a standard action, a drocha swarm can target a creature within 30 feet and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own death. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.",
			"",
			"Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.",
			"",
			"It is postulated drocha swarms can form anywhere death has occurred on a massive scale. Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually non-existent in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating them from the Inner Sea.",
			"",
			"The dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful, and attack any living thing near them with impunity.",
			"",
			"Since these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing. Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling, for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown no hint of letting up.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Drocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast, some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible for their demise.",
			"",
			"Because of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's existence - which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living things.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more) swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them, though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens, the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens in these rare circumstances is unknown.",
			"",
			"To the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is anyone's guess."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Drochtacs are evil fey that, given their mottled skin and many limbs, are almost verminlike in appearance. These creatures move in an undulating motion, with each pair of a drochtac's feet taking turns dragging its body along the ground. Although a drochtac looks emaciated, the muscles between its ribs are powerful and allow the creature to quickly stretch its body like a spring. This enables the creature to attack targets far beyond its apparent reach, often to the shock and terror of its enemies. Unfortunately for drochtacs' prey, these vicious fey can survive in a wide variety of climates.",
			"",
			"The flesh of a drochtac contains vomit-inducing chemicals that, when ingested, cause nausea in most living creatures. For this reason, these fey creatures have few natural enemies. Rather, drochtacs are patient ambush predators that prefer to catch creatures close to their own size. Drochtacs prefer to make meals out of intelligent creatures, as they find this prey requires them to employ more advanced hunting and stalking skills than when they're hunting animals or other low-intelligence creatures.",
			"",
			"Also, despite their violent natures, drochtacs are curious creatures that enjoy talking to their victims before killing them. Sometimes, although rarely, drochtacs keep their prey alive for weeks if the victims can keep them entertained with stories (and the fey creatures can find something else to eat). When very hungry, however, they often do not even bother to kill their paralyzed victims before they start eating them.",
			"",
			"Drochtacs often stalk small parties of travelers or lost wanderers, waiting for just the right time to strike; in this way, they ensure that their hunting skills stay sharp. Their metabolisms are slow; and after gorging on a creature of suitable size, a drochtac can go for weeks without eating. When they're not hunting, drochtacs lair in secluded ravines, inside the hollows of large trees, or in caves or other places abandoned by larger predators. Drochtacs also use such places to bear and rear their offspring, turning once peaceful spots into terrifying dens of many-legged young."
