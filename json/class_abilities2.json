			"Each animal companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All animal attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Animal attacks add the animal's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 its Strength modifier. Some have special abilities, such as {umr/scent}. As you gain levels, your animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or 7th level, in addition to the standard bonuses noted on **the {sidekick/Animal Companion} page.** Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Dexterity and Constitution by 2.",

			"{SOURCE Inner Sea Combat}  ",
			"Fantastical mounts are not uncommon in the Inner Sea region, rife as it is with magic and the extraordinary. The Monstrous Mount Choices section below details monsters that are ridden primarily by cavaliers, rangers, and paladins. Taking on a monstrous mount requires [a feat](feat/monstrous_mount), but otherwise uses the rules for the animal companion class feature. Unlocking the most useful abilities and powerful attacks of a monstrous mount requires [a second feat](feat/monstrous_mount_mastery).",

			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Wilderness}  ",
			"Plant companions have a variety of different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All plant companion attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant companion attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions can't gain armor or weapon proficiency feats even as they advance in Hit Dice, and they can't use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise.",
			"",
			"Plant companions are typically suitable only for specific archetypes, such as the treesinger druid archetype, but with the GM's permission, any druid could select a plant companion.",
			"",
			"**Trip:** Because many plant companions have several rootlike legs, they are very difficult to trip. As a result, a CMD entry has been included for each, indicating the bonus to CMD such plants receive against trip attacks.",
			"",
			"### Vermin Companions",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Ultimate Magic}  ",
			"Vermin companions follow the same rules as animal companions, advancing their Hit Dice and other abilities per the animal companion base statistics table. Vermin companions can be trained as if they were animals using the Handle Animal skill.",
			"",
			"**Mindless:** Vermin companions have no Intelligence score and possess the mindless trait. In spite of this, vermin companions may learn one trick, plus additional bonus tricks. If a vermin animal companion gains an ability score increase (at 4 Hit Dice, 8 Hit Dice, and so on), the druid can apply this increase to the companion's Intelligence, changing it from - to 1, at which point the companion loses the mindless quality and is able to know up to 3 tricks per point of Intelligence, plus the additional bonus tricks. Vermin companions have no skill points or feats as long as they have the mindless quality.",
			"",
			"**Trip:** Because many vermin have multiple limbs, they are very difficult to trip. As a result, a CMD entry has been included for each, indicating the bonus to CMD such vermin receive against trip attacks.",

			"Each eidolon receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus - 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon only has a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.",

Select one spell from the following list: compel hostility, lesser confusion, hypnotism, mind thrust IOA, or vanish. The eidolon can use that spell thereafter as a psychic spell by spending 1 point of psychic energy. The caster level and save DC are the same as for basic psychic magic. This evolution can be selected more than once, selecting a different spell each time. The eidolon's amount of psychic energy available to spend each day does not stack - it uses only the highest number of points granted by its most powerful psychic magic evolution. *Requirements:* Aberrant subtype; basic psychic magic evolution; Charisma 11; summoner level 5th.",
			"",
			"**Limbs (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon grows an additional pair of limbs. These limbs can take one of two forms. They can be made into legs, complete with feet. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon's base speed by 10 feet. Alternatively, they can be made into arms, complete with hands. The eidolon does not gain any additional natural attacks for an additional pair of arms, but it can take other evolutions that add additional attacks (such as claws or slam). Arms that have hands can be used to wield weapons, if the eidolon is proficient. This evolution can be selected more than once.",

			"",
			"**Rake (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon grows dangerous claws on its feet, allowing it to make two rake attacks against foes it is grappling. These attacks are primary attacks. The eidolon can make these additional attacks each time it succeeds at a grapple check against the target. These rake attacks deal 1d4 points of damage (1d6 if Large, 1d8 if Huge). This evolution counts as one natural attack toward the eidolon's maximum. *Requirements:* Summoner level 4th, quadruped base form.",
			"",
			"**Rend (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon learns to rip and tear the flesh of those it attacks with its claws, gaining the rend ability. Whenever the eidolon makes two successful claw attacks against the same target in 1 round, its claws latch on to the flesh and deal extra damage. This damage is equal to the damage dealt by one claw attack plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modifier. *Requirements:* Summoner level 6th, claws evolution.",
			"",
			"**Shared Slot (Su) ({source/Legacy of the First World/ pg. 19}):** Select a magic item slot. A magic item worn by the eidolon in that slot remains active even if the summoner is also wearing a magic item in that slot. This evolution can be selected more than once. Each time an eidolon selects this evolution, it applies to a new slot. *Requirements:* Twinned eidolon.",
			"",
			"**Trample (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon gains the ability to crush its foes underfoot, gaining the trample ability. As a full-round action, the eidolon can overrun any creature that is at least one size category smaller than itself. This works like the overrun combat maneuver, but the eidolon does not need to attempt a check; it merely has to move over opponents in its path. The creatures take 1d6 points of damage (1d8 if Large, 2d6 if Huge), plus 1-1/2 times the eidolon's Strength modifier. Targets of the trample can make attacks of opportunity at a -4 penalty. If a target forgoes this attack of opportunity, it can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Strength modifier. A trampling eidolon can deal trampling damage to a specific creature only once per round. *Requirements:* Biped or quadruped base form.",
			"",
			"**Tremorsense (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon becomes attuned to vibrations in the ground, gaining tremorsense with a range of 30 feet. This works like the blindsense evolution, but only if both the eidolon and the creature to be pinpointed are in contact with the ground. *Requirements:* Summoner level 7th.",
			"",
			"**Trip (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 37}):** The eidolon becomes adept at knocking foes to the ground with its bite, granting it a trip attack. Whenever the eidolon makes a successful bite attack, it can attempt a free combat maneuver check. If the eidolon succeeds at this check, the target is knocked prone. If the eidolon fails, it is not tripped in return. This ability works only on creatures of a size category equal to or smaller than the eidolon. *Requirements:* Daemon, demon, devil, elemental, or protean subtype; bite evolution.",

The eidolon can cast that spell as a psychic spell by spending 2 points of psychic energy. The caster level and save DC are the same as for basic psychic magic. This evolution can be selected more than once, selecting a different spell each time.

			"**Alien Consciousness (Ex) ({source/Horror Realms/ pg. 19}):** The eidolon's mind is dangerously incomprehensible to mortals who contact it. Non-aberrations that read the eidolon's mind or make mental contact with it take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if you use the {rule/sanity/ rules}). This contact also includes communication via telepathy - an eidolon that has telepathic capability must initiate this particular contact as a swift action against a single target in order to force its alien consciousness on another creature. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's HD + the eidolon's Charisma modifier) halves the damage. Once a creature has been subjected to the eidolon's alien consciousness, it is immune to further damage from that eidolon's alien consciousness for 24 hours. The eidolon's summoner is immune to his own eidolon's alien consciousness, but he can still be affected by other eidolons' alien consciousnesses. This is a mind-affecting effect. *Requirements:* Aberrant or protean subtype; summoner level 9th.",
			"",
			"**Blindsense (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon's senses become incredibly acute, giving it blindsense with a range of 30 feet. This ability allows the eidolon to pinpoint the location of creatures that it can't see without having to attempt a Perception check, but such creatures still have total {rule/concealment} from the eidolon. Visibility still affects the eidolon's movement, and it is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see. *Requirements:* Summoner level 9th.",
			"",
			"**Burrow (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon grows thick and gnarled claws, allowing it to move through the earth. The eidolon gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed. It can use this speed to move through clay, dirt, earth, and sand. It does not leave a hole behind, nor is its passage marked on the surface. *Requirements:* Summoner level 9th.",
			"",
			"**Damage Reduction (Su) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon's body becomes more resistant to harm. Increase the damage reduction granted by the eidolon's subtype by 5. *Requirements:* Summoner level 15th, damage reduction granted by the eidolon's subtype.",
			"",
			"**Frightful Presence (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon becomes unsettling to its foes, gaining the frightful presence ability. The eidolon can activate this ability as part of an offensive action, such as a charge or attack. Opponents within 30 feet of the eidolon must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 3d6 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Charisma modifier. If the eidolon has at least 4 more Hit Dice than an opponent that fails this save, that opponent becomes frightened instead. Foes with more Hit Dice than the eidolon are immune to this effect. *Requirements:* Summoner level 11th.",
			"",
			"**Pounce (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon gains quick reflexes, allowing it to make a full attack after a charge. *Requirements:* Summoner level 7th, quadruped base form.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon gains the swallow whole ability, giving it the ability to consume its foes. If the eidolon begins its turn with a creature grappled using its bite attack (see the grab evolution), it can attempt a combat maneuver check to swallow the creature. The creature must be at least one size category smaller than the eidolon. Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal. Success indicates that it has returned to the eidolon's mouth, where it can attempt to escape or can be swallowed again. *Requirements:* Summoner level 9th; agathion, daemon, demon, devil, div, elemental, protean, or psychopomp subtype; grab (bite) evolution.",
			"",
			"**Web (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon gains a pair of spinnerets, giving it the ability to spin webs. The eidolon can use these webs to support itself plus one creature of up to the same size. It can throw webbing as a ranged touch attack up to eight times per day, entangling a creature up to one size larger than the eidolon. The webbing has a range of 50 feet and a 10-foot range increment. Creatures entangled by the web can escape with a successful Escape Artist check, or with a Strength check at a -4 penalty. The DC of these checks is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The webs have a hardness of 0 and a number of hits points equal to the eidolon's total Hit Dice. The eidolon can climb its own webs at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its webs. *Requirements:* Summoner level 7th; daemon, demon, or protean subtype; climb evolution.",

			"",
			"**Blindsight (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon's senses sharpen even further, granting it blindsight with a range of 30 feet. The eidolon can maneuver and attack as normal, ignoring darkness, invisibility, and most forms of concealment as long as it has line of effect to the target. *Requirements:* Summoner level 11th, blindsense evolution.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon learns to exhale a cone or line of magical energy, gaining a breath weapon. Select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The eidolon can breathe a 30-foot cone (or 60-foot line) that deals 1d6 points of damage of the selected type per Hit Dice it possesses. Those caught in the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can use this ability once per day. The eidolon can gain additional uses of this ability per day by spending 1 evolution point per additional use (to a maximum of three total uses per day). *Requirements:* Summoner level 9th.",
			"",
			"**Disease ({source/Horror Realms/ pg. 19}):** One of the eidolon's natural weapons carries a disease chosen from the following list: bubonic plague, filth fever, leprosy, red ache, or shakes. Each hit forces a saving throw against the disease's normal effects. The disease has no onset, however. The save DC equals 10 + 1/2 the eidolon's Hit Dice + the eidolon's Constitution modifier. The eidolon can expose a creature to its disease no more than once per round. By spending 2 additional evolution points, you can instead choose the following additional diseases: demon fever (only if the eidolon has the demon subtype), devil chills (only if the eidolon has the devil subtype), or slimy doom. *Requirements:* Aberrant, daemon, demon, or devil subtype or the undead appearance evolution; summoner level 7th.",
			"",
			"**Fast Healing (Su) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 38}):** The eidolon's body gains the ability to heal wounds very quickly, giving it fast healing 1. The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner. This healing can be increased by 1 point per round for every 2 additional evolution points spent (to a maximum of 5 points per round). *Requirements:* Summoner level 11th.",
			"",
			"**Large (Ex) ({source/Pathfinder Unchained/ pg. 39}):** The eidolon grows in size, becoming Large. The eidolon gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +2 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -1 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a -2 penalty on Fly checks, and a -4 penalty on Stealth checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains a reach of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total.",

			"If 6 additional evolution points are spent, the eidolon instead becomes Huge. The eidolon gains a +8 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +5 bonus to its natural armor. It takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity. This size change also gives the creature a -2 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a 10-foot reach, a -4 penalty on Fly checks, and a -8 penalty on Stealth checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet instead of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total. These bonuses and penalties replace, and do not stack with, those gained from becoming Large.",

Despite extensive effort, not all arcanists achieve the power they seek. Some discover that their blood lacks the innate power of a sorcerer's, or that deciphering mysteries in ancient tomes requires a degree of scholarly discipline they do not have. Undeterred, such individuals continue their quest by turning to the powerful mysteries of the Outer Rifts, be they blasphemous secrets found in lost ruins, tricks of magic etched into fiendish runestones, or any other dangerous form of sinister exploitation from these horrific realms.",
			"",
			"Not all arcanists who choose this route are necessarily evil - they justify these exploits by claiming to be in control of their actions and to use the tools of their enemies against them. Nevertheless, those who bend magic using exploits from the Outer Rifts should be wary of attracting the wrong attention or enabling a greater evil than that which they seek to defeat.",
			"",
			"All of the following exploits can be learned by arcanists of any alignment, but these exploits come with a risk. If you use an Outer Rift exploit and in doing so reduce your arcane reservoir to 0, you immediately gain the stain of one manifestation from the accursed, demonic, hellbound, or possessed corruption. The GM chooses which corruption, manifestation, and stain you receive; this stain persists for 24 hours. Reducing your arcane reservoir to 0 in this way multiple times within a 24-hour period results in a new stain for each such instance, and each time you do so you reset the timer for all stains gained in this manner to 24 hours. At the GM's option, multiple instances of abusing exploits in this manner could result in a permanent corruption, but otherwise these corruptions are temporary and do not progress. You can never gain a gift from a corruption in this way.",
			"",

			"### Blood Tears (Su)",

			"As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During this time, the arcanist's vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that creature does not gain {rule/concealment} against him. At a distance of greater than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand, splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn't wipe his bleeding tears away, the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of 1 minute per arcanist level.",

A creature that fails a Will save to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level. Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.",

			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist's face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit's effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis's tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target's magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target's life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target's ability to use magic, the tongue's unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.",

			"### Rift Fog (Su)",

			"As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog's supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the {spell/slow} spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.",

			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to pull fiendish essence from the Outer Rifts into his own shadow. Malformed and nearly amorphous, the shadow-things swarm across his body, turning his eyes completely black and distorting his physical form. These shadows persist for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round) and grant the arcanist a +2 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. The shadows are threatening, and as long as they persist the arcanist is considered armed for the purpose of flanking or threatening an attack of opportunity. Whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the arcanist, he may make the attack of opportunity with his shadow, striking as a touch attack that deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier plus 1 point of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage. This ability does not itself increase the number of attacks of opportunity the arcanist can make in a round, but feats like {feat/Combat Reflexes} do allow him to make multiple attacks of opportunity with his shadow. The shadows cannot be compelled to make normal attacks - they lash out in this way only as a reaction to being provoked.",
			"",
			"### Soulrider (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a \"soulrider.\" The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target's subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell's effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell's effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. {spell/Detect magic} and {spell/detect evil} can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of {spell/status}, and the creature takes a -2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per {spell/sending}. Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"### Tentacles (Su)",
			"",
			"As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist's size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist's Strength score. The arcanist's reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach."

A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",

			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Abominate (Sp):** The witch transforms a creature within 30 feet into an aberration. This hex acts as baleful polymorph, except the target is transmuted into a Small, Medium, or Large aberration. The target's abilities are modified as monstrous physique IV. Whether or not its save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Animal Servant (Su):** The witch can use this hex to turn a humanoid enemy into an animal and rob it of its free will. The transformation works as {spell/beast shape II} and is negated by a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its mind. This effect functions as {spell/dominate monster}, except the creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the hex. The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch also ends the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Curse of Nonviolence (Su):** The witch can curse a creature to prevent it from attacking innocents. If the target fails its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than itself. If another creature takes hostile action against the cursed creature, the cursed creature can act normally in regard to that creature only. This is an abjuration effect. The curse is permanent but can be removed with a {spell/break enchantment}, {spell/miracle}, or {spell/wish} spell. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Curse (Su):** This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Interrupted (Su):** A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature's soul from the River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual resurrection. In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally's soul must be free and willing to return at the witch's behest. When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Dire Prophecy (Su):** The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty equal to the witch's caster level to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Slumber (Su):** The witch can touch a creature, causing it to drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed with a wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Forced Reincarnation (Su):** The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately reincarnated into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell reincarnate. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Lay to Rest (Sp):** The witch may target a single undead creature with this hex as if with an {spell/undeath to death} spell. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Life Giver (Su):** Once per day the witch can, as a full round action, touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This functions as {spell/resurrection}, but it does not require a material component.",
			"",
			"**Natural Disaster (Su):** A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a {spell/storm of vengeance} combined with an {spell/earthquake} that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per day.",
			"",
			"**Summon Spirit (Sp):** The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Hut (Su):** The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as \"follow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."

			"Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Deadeye (Ex):** At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger's Dodge (Ex):** At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.",
			"",
			"**Quick Clear (Ex):** At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):** At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the {feat/Quick Draw} feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.",
			"",
			"**Pistol-Whip (Ex):** At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/&times;2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.",
			"",
			"**Utility Shot (Ex):** At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.",
			"",
			"- Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.",
			"- Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.",
			"- Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Dead Shot (Ex):** At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.",
			"",
			"**Startling Shot (Ex):** At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.",
			"",
			"**Targeting (Ex):** At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.",
			"",
			"- Arms: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.",
			"- Head: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Legs: On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.",
			"- Torso: Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20.",
			"- Wings: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.",
			"",
			"### 11th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Wound (Ex):** At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",
			"",
			"**Expert Loading (Ex):** At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.",
			"",
			"**Lightning Reload (Ex):** At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If she has the {feat/Rapid Reload} feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"### 15th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Evasive (Ex):** At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.",
			"",
			"**Menacing Shot (Ex):** At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"**Slinger's Luck (Ex):** At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed's cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.",
			"",
			"### 19th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Cheat Death (Ex):** At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Death's Shot (Ex):** At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a killing blow.",
			"",
			"**Stunning Shot (Ex):** At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect."

A swashbuckler or gunslinger (though not members of other classes) can select a renowned deed for her class upon reaching the class level listed in the deed's description. This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Thundering Shot (Ex):** The gunslinger's shots explode with deafening reports. At 1st level, as a standard action the gunslinger can spend 1 point of grit and make a single ranged attack with a firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot cone, starting at the corner of the gunslinger's square closest to the target and extending directly toward the target, must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the gunslinger's class level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier) or be deafened for 1 minute. This deed replaces the *gunslinger's dodge* deed and one other 1st-level deed.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Gruesome Parry (Ex):** Some gunslingers wield guns and blades in concert, readying a shot to unbalance attackers and then eviscerating their assailants. At 7th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point when she readies an action to make a ranged attack with a firearm against a creature that declares a melee attack against her. If she does, the readied ranged attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this readied attack hits, she gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering attack, and she can make a single melee attack with a slashing or piercing weapon against the creature that attacked her; if this melee attack hits, it is considered to be a critical threat. This deed replaces the *dead shot* deed and one other 7th-level deed.",
			"",
			"### 15-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Lethal Patience (Ex):** While wild flurries of bullets are certainly effective at felling foes, veteran gunslingers appreciate the value of lining up the perfect shot. At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point to line up a shot against a target as a full-round action. On her next turn, she can make an attack against the target as a standard action, and if the attack hits, the attack is treated as a critical threat. This deed replaces the *slinger's luck* deed and one other 15th-level deed."

At 6th level, the Hellknight gains a second discipline, choosing from any listed as being available to \"any order.\" At 9th level, the Hellknight gains his third discipline, choosing this one from any of the disciplines listed below, even those from another order, with the exception of pentamic faith. When applicable, the save DC to resist a discipline's effect is equal to 10 + the Hellknight's level + his Charisma modifier. The Hellknight can use any one discipline a number of times per day equal to the total number of disciplines he has access to, so at 3rd level he can use his discipline once per day. At 6th level, he can use both disciplines twice per day each. At 9th level, he can use all three of his disciplines three times per day.",

			"**Call Armor (Su; any order):** As a move action, the Hellknight can cause her armor to instantly appear on her body. Alternatively, she can dismiss it as a move action, causing it to vanish. (Doing either of these counts as one use of this discipline.) Where the armor appears from or vanishes to can be anywhere the Hellknight designates, but it must be a place the Hellknight has seen on the same plane of existence where she is, or be in an extradimensional space she controls, such as a bag of holding. This armor is a specific suit of Hellknight plate that the Hellknight designates when she selects this discipline. The Hellknight can attune this ability to a new set of armor, but doing so takes 1 week.",
			"",
			"**Censor (Su; Order of the Rack):** When the Hellknight uses smite chaos on a creature, he can strike the creature mute for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a successful Will save. A mute creature cannot speak, nor can it cast spells that have verbal components or use language-dependant effects.",

The Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of her selected type. She can also attempt Knowledge skill checks untrained to identify those creatures. Each time the Hellknight chooses an additional discipline, this bonus increases by 2 (to a potential maximum of +6 at 9th level).",

While this ability does not require an expensive material component, a single Hellknight can maintain only one glyph of warding at a time; if he uses this spell-like ability a second time, the previously created glyph of warding vanishes. In addition, the Hellknight gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against glyph of warding or [symbol spells](main/spell_groupings).",

The Hellknight gains all of the granted powers (but not domain spells) of that domain, treating his Hellknight levels as cleric levels to determine what domain abilities he has access to.",
			"",
			"**Seek the Taken (any order):** When a member of the Order of the Torrent becomes a 3rd-level Hellknight, he gains his first discipline: seek the taken. This enables the Hellknight to use an {feat/enlarged} {spell/locate creature} as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his total character level. At 9th level, when a Order of the Torrent Hellknight gains his third discipline, he cannot choose the summon devil discipline.",

She also learns the direction the creature is currently moving, if any. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level. An object can be used as the focus for this ability only once. For the purposes of this ability, a \"personal belonging\" is any object a creature owned or carried with it for more than a week. If the target is under the effects of {spell/nondetection} or a similar spell or effect, or is on a different plane, this ability gives no result.",

At 9th level, the Hellknight can choose an additional skill from the list above and use Intimidate to reproduce its effects.",
			"",
			"**Vigilance (Su; Order of the Scourge):** The Hellknight gains low-light vision (this effect is constant). In addition, as a full-round action, the Hellknight can see through up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers as if they didn't exist. Metal or denser barriers block this effect. Each use of this ability lasts as long as the Hellknight concentrates, up to a number of rounds equal to the Hellknight's level.",

			"Witches learn a number of magic tricks, called hexes, that grant them powers or weaken foes. At 1st level, a witch gains one hex of her choice. She gains an additional hex at 2nd level and for every 2 levels attained after 2nd level. A witch cannot select an individual hex more than once.",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise noted, using a hex is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The save to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Ameliorating (Su):** The witch can touch a creature to suppress or protect it from negative conditions. The witch chooses one of the following conditions each time she uses this hex: dazzled, fatigued, shaken, or sickened. If the target is or later becomes afflicted with the chosen condition, that condition is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. Alternatively, the witch can grant her target a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects that cause any two of the listed conditions (which condition is always the witch's choice) for 24 hours. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from the hex again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Purity (Su):** The witch's aura purifies the air around her. Diseases, inhaled poisons, and noxious gaseous effects (such as stinking cloud) are negated in a 10-foot aura around the witch for a number of minutes equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. Effects caused by spells whose level is more than half the witch's class level are unaffected.",
			"",
			"**Beast of Ill-Omen (Su):** The witch imbues her familiar with strange magic, putting a minor curse upon the next enemy to see it. The enemy must make a Will save or be affected by bane (caster level equal to the witch's level). The witch can use this hex on her familiar at a range of up to 60 feet. The affected enemy must be no more than 60 feet from the familiar to trigger the effect; seeing the familiar from a greater distance has no effect (though if the enemy and familiar approach to within 60 feet of each other, the hex takes effect). The bane affects the closest creature to the familiar (ties affect the creature with the highest initiative score). Whether or not the target's save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of the bane effect for 1 day (later uses of this hex ignore that creature when determining who is affected).",
			"",
			"**Blight (Su):** The witch can curse an animal, plant creature, or plot of land, causing it to wither and die. Blighting an area takes 1 round, during which time the witch and her familiar must be in contact with the target. If it's used on a plot of land, the land begins to wither the following day, and over the next week all plants in the area die. Nothing will grow in that area so long as the curse persists. A witch can affect an area with a radius equal to her class level &times; 10 feet. Blighting a creature is a standard action that requires a melee touch attack. If used on a creature of the animal or plant type, the creature gains the following curse: Blight Hex-type curse; *save* Will negates; *frequency* 1/day; *effect* 1 Con damage. Both types of curse can be removed with a {spell/remove curse} or similar magic, using the save DC as the DC to remove the curse. A witch can only have one blight in effect at a time. If another blight hex is made, the first immediately ends.",
			"",
			"**Cackle (Su):** A witch can cackle madly as a move action. Any creature that is within 30 feet that is under the effects of an agony hex, charm hex, evil eye hex, fortune hex, or misfortune hex caused by the witch has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Cauldron (Ex):** The witch receives {feat/Brew Potion} as a bonus feat and a +4 insight bonus on Craft (alchemy) skill checks.",
			"",
			"**Charm (Su):** A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning and speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid creature by 1 step, as if the witch had successfully used the Diplomacy skill. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.",
			"",
			"**Child-Scent (Ex):** The witch gains the scent ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, she could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but not the child's parents or the den mother.",
			"",
			"**City Sight (Su):** The witch curses a target with the simple vision of urban mortals. On a failed Fortitude save, the subject loses the use of darkvision, greensight, low-light vision, see in darkness, and other visual abilities beyond simple sight, but not nonvisual means of perception like blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. This effect lasts 1 minute. At 8th level, this effect lasts for 10 minutes instead. Whether or not the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it can't be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Combat Hypnosis (Su):** The witch can lull her enemies into a trance, even in the chaos of combat. This hex functions as {spell/hypnotism}, except it can affect only one creature at a time, and the target creature does not receive the usual +2 bonus on its saving throw while in combat. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Congeal (Su):** The witch can make the water in a 10-foot radius around her sludgy and viscous for 1 minute, causing it to function as difficult terrain for all swimming creatures except herself. This also provides partial cover against physical effects that pass through the affected area.",
			"",
			"**Coven (Ex):** The witch counts as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag. In addition, whenever the witch with this hex is within 30 feet of another witch with this hex, she can use the aid another action to grant a +1 bonus to the other witch's caster level for 1 round. This bonus applies to the witch's spells and all of her hexes.",
			"",
			"**Cursed Wound:** The witch can curse a living creature, preventing it from healing completely. For a number of days equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), whenever the victim is the target of a conjuration (healing) spell or magical healing effect, the caster of the healing effect must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 11 + the witch's level) to end the hex. If the check fails, the healing effect functions as normal, except it cannot remove the last 10 points of damage the victim suffered. Similarly, natural healing, fast healing, and regeneration fail to cure the victim's last 10 points of damage. Thus, the victim's effective maximum number of hit points is 10 fewer than normal. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to 1 round. At 5th level, the victim of this hex also takes a -2 penalty on Fortitude saving throws to avoid contracting a disease or poison from an injury. This is a curse effect and can be removed by {spell/remove curse}.",
			"",
			"**Dark Apothecary (Ex):** The witches of ancient Iblydos were masters of herbalism, crafting potent drugs and poisons. The witch receives a +4 insight bonus on checks to craft and apply poison.",
			"",
			"**Deathcall (Su):** The witch's presence makes death more likely for wounded foes. Creatures within 120 feet of the witch take a -1 penalty on checks to stabilize when dying. At 8th level, this penalty changes to -2, and at 16th level, it changes to -3.",
			"",
			"**Discord (Su):** The witch can make an animal or humanoid within 30 feet distrust another creature within line of sight. The target's attitude toward the other creature decreases by one step. A successful Will save negates this effect. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. The duration can be extended with the cackle hex. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this effect decreases the attitude of the target creature by two steps. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.",
			"",
			"**Disguise (Sp):** A witch can change her appearance for a number of hours equal to her class level, as if using disguise self. These hours do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments.",
			"",
			"**Disrupt Connection (Su):** The hexer disrupts the connection between a summoned creature within 30 feet and its master. The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it's confused in this way, during any round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature's confusion result is 76-100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned it (attacking the hexer's enemies or performing such other tasks that the hexer can communicate to it). At 8th level, this hex causes the summoned creature to act as if the hexer had summoned it on a result of 51-100. At 16th level, this hex causes the summoned creature to act this way on a result of 26-100. The cackle hex extends the duration of this hex by 1 round. Once a creature has been the target of this hex, that creature is immune to this hex for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Distraction (Su):** The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer hallucinatory distractions whenever it tries to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability for 1 round. Anytime the creature attempts to do so, it must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) or lose the spell. A successful Will saving throw negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. Hexes that affect the misfortune hex, such as cackle, also affect distraction.",
			"",
			"**Enemy Ground (Su):** The witch curses a target with clumsiness when in dangerous terrain. The target takes a -4 penalty on Acrobatics checks to move over slippery or uneven surfaces and to avoid attacks of opportunity while moving through threatened squares. This effect lasts for 1 minute. On a successful Will save, the penalty is reduced by half and the duration is only 1 round. At 8th level, this penalty increases to -8.",
			"",
			"**Evil Eye (Su):** The witch can cause doubt to creep into the mind of a foe within 30 feet that she can see. The target takes a -2 penalty on one of the following (witch's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This hex lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save reduces this to just 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. At 8th level the penalty increases to -4.",
			"",
			"**Feral Speech (Su):** This hex grants the witch the ability to speak with and understand the response of any animal as if using speak with animals, though each time she uses the hex, she must decide to communicate with either amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, or reptiles, and can only speak to and understand animals of that type. The witch can make herself understood as far as her voice carries. This hex does not predispose any animal so addressed toward the witch in any way. At 12th level, the witch can use this hex to communicate with vermin.",
			"",
			"**Flight (Su):** The witch grows lighter as she gains power, eventually gaining the ability to fly. At 1st level, the witch can use feather fall at will and gains a +4 racial bonus on Swim checks. At 3rd level, she can cast levitate once per day. At 5th level, she can fly, as per the spell, for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. This hex only affects the witch.",
			"",
			"**Floating Lotus (Su):** The witch can conjure a large lotus flower that floats by her side for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. While summoned, the witch can use the lotus to cross water as if she was affected by {spell/water walk}. She can also use the flower for short bursts of flight, gaining a +10 enhancement bonus on Acrobatics checks when attempting high jumps and long jumps. This bonus increases by 10 at 5th level, and again at 9th level.",
			"",
			"**Fortune (Su):** The witch can grant a creature within 30 feet a bit of good luck for 1 round. The target can call upon this good luck once per round, allowing him to reroll any ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, taking the better result. He must decide to use this ability before the first roll is made. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. Once a creature has benefited from the fortune hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Gift of Consumption (Su):** The witch curses a creature to share any effects that target her vitality. Whenever the witch is exposed to an effect that requires her to attempt a Fortitude save, as an immediate action she can curse a creature within 30 feet to share the effect. The hexed creature must also attempt a Fortitude save at the same DC as the witch's, and on a failure it is subject to the same effects as the witch. Regardless of the outcome of the saving throw, the creature can't be targeted by this hex again for 1 day. This hex does not function with effects that require additional types of saves, such as phantasmal killer.",
			"",
			"**Greater Gift of Consumption (Su):** The witch can more effectively redirect effects to her proxy chosen by the gift of consumption hex. When the witch succeeds at her Fortitude save against an effect that she has redirected to a proxy, the hexed creature takes a -4 penalty on its Fortitude save against the redirected effect. If the witch ever fails a Fortitude save or intentionally exposes herself to an effect that requires a Fortitude save, such as by ingesting a poison, she can redirect that effect to affect only the hexed creature, though the hexed creature can still attempt a saving throw to resist the effects. Once she has redirected an effect to another creature in this way, that creature cannot be affected by the gift of consumption hex again for 24 hours. The witch must have the gift of consumption hexgift of consumption to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Healing (Su):** A witch can soothe the wounds of those she touches. This acts as a {spell/cure light wounds} spell, using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 5th level, this hex acts like {spell/cure moderate wounds}.",
			"",
			"**Heralding Bloom (Su):** A witch can compel a plant within 30 feet to spread a message, which must be 25 words or fewer and in a language the witch speaks. This message can't contain verbal spell components, command words, or other magical effects. An intelligent plant that's targeted can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the plant is magically compelled to \"speak\" this message in an audible voice, repeating it each time one or more intelligent creatures to whom the message has not yet been repeated comes within range, until 24 hours after the hex has been placed. The plant under the effect of the hex does not gain any special intelligence from this hex or gain any ability to understand the message if it does not normally understand the language the message is delivered in, and it is in no way otherwise compelled to act in any way it would not normally. A witch can have a number of heralding blooms active equal to her witch level + her Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"**Iceplant (Su):** This hex grants the witch and her familiar a +2 natural armor bonus and the constant effects of {spell/endure elements}. The effect leaves the witch's skin thick and stiff to the touch.",
			"",
			"**Leshy Summoning (Su):** The witch counts as a plant creature for the purpose of growing leshys. She adds {monster/leaf leshy/s}, {monster/gourd leshy/s}, {monster/fungus leshy/s}, {monster/seaweed leshy/s}, and {monster/lotus leshy/s} to the list of creatures she can summon with {spell/summon monster I}, [II](spell/summon_monster_2), [III](spell/summon_monster_3), [IV](spell/summon_monster_4), and [V](spell/summon_monster_5), respectively.",
			"",
			"**Minor Prophecy (Su):** The witch can call on her prophetic ancestors to cast {spell/augury} once per day. She can spend a full hour casting the spell to negate the need for material components, but this reduces the accuracy of the spell by 5%.",
			"",
			"**Misfortune (Su):** The witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Anytime the creature makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A Will save negates this hex. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. This hex affects all rolls the target must make while it lasts. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Mother's Eye (Su):** The witch can see through plant matter, as the {umr/greensight} universal monster ability, for a number of minutes per day equal to her witch level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"**Mud Witch (Su):** A witch with this hex can assume the form of viscous brown mud. The witch's type changes to ooze and she is able to squeeze through even the smallest cracks, but she can't make attacks or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components while in this form, and she loses her supernatural abilities. If the witch has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when she uses this hex. While the witch is in mud form, her speed becomes 10 feet and she gains a swim speed of 20 feet. The witch gains DR 10/slashing and cold resistance 10. At 10th level, while the witch is in mud form, her speed increases to 20 feet and her swim speed increases to 40 feet. She can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. The duration doesn't need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. This hex affects only the witch. The witch must have the swamp hag hexswamp hag to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Murksight (Su):** The witch can see through natural fog, mist, and rain without penalty, ignoring any {rule/concealment} bonuses gained from such effects. If the effect is created by magic, the witch can see up to 15 feet without penalty, with normal penalties and effects applying beyond that distance. This ability functions underwater as well, allowing the witch to see in murky water as though it were clear. This does not allow the witch to see anything she could not see otherwise, such as an invisible creature.",
			"",
			"**Nails (Ex):** The witch's nails are long and sharp, and count as natural weapons that deal 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small witch). These attacks are secondary attacks. If trimmed, the witch's nails regrow to their normal size in 1d4 days.",
			"",
			"**No Place Like Home (Su):** The witch fills an ally with the safety he feels at home or inflicts pangs of homesickness to hamper an enemy's defenses. She chooses a target for the hex within 30 feet. If she chooses an ally, that ally gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. If she chooses an opponent, that opponent takes a -2 penalty to AC against traps and on Reflex saves against traps. Either way, the effects last for 1 minute. The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effects of the hex. At 8th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 4. At 16th level, the bonus or penalty increases to 6. A creature targeted by this hex cannot be targeted again by this hex for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Peacebond (Su):** A witch can use this hex on a creature to prevent it from drawing a weapon for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex has no effect on natural weapons or weapons already in a creature's hands, but does prevent an archer from drawing arrows. A Will save negates this effect, and whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Poison Steep (Sp):** The witch can use her cauldron to brew a foul toxin in which she can steep fruits and other delicious edibles, transforming them so that when eaten, they have the same effect as a poison spell. Brewing the toxin and then steeping the food takes 1 hour in total; steeping can affect up to 1 pound of food. The food is poisoned for 24 hours, and the poison cannot be transferred to other objects. The food tastes normal, but magic detects it as poisonous. The witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Poison Touch (Ex):** The witch empowers herself or an ally within 30 feet with poisonous nails. The affected creature gains a claw attack as a secondary attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for Small creatures) and has the following poison ability: Witch Toxin: Claw-injury; *save* Fort DC 10 + half the witch's level + the witch's Intelligence modifier; *frequency* 1/round for 6 rounds; *effect* 1d2 Str; *cure* 1 save. The creature gains this claw attack for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. If the target already has a claw attack, that attack gains the poison ability listed above, but the DC is 1 higher. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Pollute Water (Su):** The witch can corrupt bodies of water with foul energies. This functions as the blight hex, except it affects only either an area of standing water or a creature with the aquatic or water subtype. A creature of any type that drinks water from a polluted area must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated for 1d3 rounds and afflicted as if blighted with the blight hex curse. A creature that succeeds at this saving throw is immune to the effects of polluted water from this area for 24 hours. Polluted water does not quench thirst.",
			"",
			"**Polluting Glance (Su):** The witch can corrupt nonmagical liquid items (such as alchemical remedies) with a look. The witch can choose one liquid item she can see within 30 feet and change its contents into polluted water as per her pollute water hex. The number of polluting glance hexes the witch can have active at one time is equal to her Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). The witch must have the pollute water hexpollute water to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Prehensile Hair (Su):** The witch can instantly cause her hair (or even her eyebrows) to grow up to 10 feet long or to shrink to its normal length, and can manipulate her hair as if it were a limb with a Strength score equal to her Intelligence score. Her hair has reach 10 feet, and she can use it as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small witch). Her hair can manipulate objects (but not weapons) as dexterously as a human hand. The hair cannot be sundered or attacked as a separate creature. Pieces cut from the witch's elongated hair shrink away to nothing. Using her hair does not harm the witch's head or neck, even if she lifts something heavy with it. The witch can manipulate her hair a number of minutes each day equal to her level; these minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. A typical male witch with this hex can also manipulate his beard, moustache, or eyebrows.",
			"",
			"**Protective Luck (Su):** The witch can cause fate to twist so that it benefits a creature within 30 feet for 1 round. Whenever that creature is targeted by an effect that requires an attack roll, including weapon attacks, the attacker must roll twice and take the worse result. At 8th level and 16th level, the duration of this hex is extended by 1 round. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Hexes that affect the fortune hex, such as cackle, also affect protective luck.",
			"",
			"**Scar (Su):** This hex curses a single target touched with horrible scars of the witch's choosing, whether something as simple as a single letter on the target's forehead or blotchy, burnlike scars on his body. The target may make a Will save to resist this hex. These scars do not interfere with the target's senses or prevent it from using abilities, but may affect social interactions. They persist through disguises and shapechanging. The witch can user her hexes on the scarred target at a range of up to 1 mile, and she is considered to have a body part from the target for the purpose of scrying and similar divination spells. The witch can withdraw this hex from a target as a move action at any range. The number of supernatural scars the witch can maintain at once is equal to her Intelligence bonus; once she reaches this limit, she must remove the scar from a current victim in order to mark another. Effects that remove curses can remove the scar.",
			"",
			"**Seduction (Su):** The witch uses enthralling movements to fascinate a single creature within 60 feet that can see the witch. A Will save negates this effect. If the target is (or could be) sexually attracted to the witch, the save DC is increased by 2. The effect lasts for 1 round, but the witch can extend this effect for 1 additional round (up to a total number of rounds equal to her class level) by taking a standard action to continue her enthralling movements. Whether or not the target succeeds at its save, it cannot be the target of this ability again for 1 day. At 8th level, the fascination effect lasts for 2 additional rounds after the witch ceases taking a standard action to maintain it. This is a mind-affecting charm effect.",
			"",
			"**Sink (Su):** The witch can cause a creature in water to struggle, imposing a -4 penalty on its Swim checks and reducing its swim speed (if any) by 10 feet for 1 minute unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw; on a successful save, the effect's duration is reduced to 1 round. The duration of this hex can be extended with the cackle hex. This hex does not stack with itself.",
			"",
			"**Slumber (Su):** A witch can cause a creature within 30 feet to fall into a deep, magical sleep, as per the spell sleep. The creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. This hex can affect a creature of any HD. The creature will not wake due to noise or light, but others can rouse it with a standard action. This hex ends immediately if the creature takes damage. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Soothsayer (Su):** The witch's predictions become self-fulfilling prophecies. When the witch uses the evil eye hex, fortune hex, misfortune hex, or retribution major hex, she can choose to delay the effect. If she does so, the hex takes effect the next time the target makes a roll that could be affected by the hex (such as an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check) or is affected by an action that could be modified by the hex (such as being attacked when the hex would affect the target's AC), whichever comes first (ignoring actions that are not in combat and actions that have no penalty for failure). The duration of the hex begins on the same round as the action that causes it to take effect. The hex is wasted if it is not triggered within 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Summer's Heat (Su):** The witch surrounds her target with oppressive heat, dealing a number of points of nonlethal damage equal to her witch level and causing the target to become fatigued. The target can attempt a Fortitude save to reduce this nonlethal damage by half and negate the fatigued condition. Whether or not the target succeeds at this save, it can't be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Swamp Hag (Sp):** While traveling through swamps, mires, bogs, and similar terrain, the witch leaves no trail and cannot be tracked, as the trackless step druid ability. The witch can walk through mud and even quicksand as if it were normal ground.",
			"",
			"**Swamp's Grasp:** The witch can cause an area to become an entangling quagmire. One 10-foot square per witch level within 90 feet becomes difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. If the witch uses this hex again before the duration of the previous use has expired, the effects of the previous use of this hex end immediately.",
			"",
			"**Swine (Su):** The witch can partially transform an enemy into a pig. The effects of the transformation are mostly cosmetic and do not change the creature's size category or overall shape, but the affected creature takes a -2 penalty on Will saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier (Will negates). At 8th level, the affected creature's hands (or paws) turn into hooves, preventing it from using claw attacks or taking any action that would require the creature to use its fingers.",
			"",
			"**Tongues (Su):** A witch with this hex can understand any spoken language for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as comprehend languages. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a witch can use this ability to speak any language, as per tongues.",
			"",
			"**Unnerve Beasts (Su):** The target becomes offensive to animals (Will negates). Animals become distraught and aggressive in the victim's presence - horses buck, dogs snap and bark, bulls charge, and so on. The hex lasts a number of hours equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A creature that saves against the hex cannot be affected by the hex for 1 day. The reaction of the animals is a mind-affecting charm effect, but the hex on the target is not.",
			"",
			"**Verdant Familiar (Ex):** The witch's familiar's creature type changes to plant, gaining all respective {type/plant/ traits}.",
			"",
			"**Ward (Su):** A witch can use this hex to place a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws. This ward lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A witch knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A witch can have only one ward active at a time. If the witch uses this ability again, the previous ward immediately ends. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. At 8th level and 16th level, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by +1.",

			"",
			"**Witch's Bottle (Su):** Once per day, the witch can perform a 10-minute ritual to create a potion imbued with the power of one of her hexes. Any creature that consumes this potion is affected by the hex as if cast by its creator. The witch can't use that hex until the potion is consumed or rendered inert. Only hexes that can target a creature other than the witch can be distilled in this way. The potion remains potent until consumed or rendered inert by the witch as a free action. A witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex."

			"A stalker vigilante can apply only one talent below to a given hidden strike, and only when that hidden strike is dealt against a foe that is unaware of the stalker vigilante's presence (or who considers him an ally), unless otherwise noted.",
			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Foe Collision (Ex):** The vigilante can shove one of his foes into another. When the vigilante deals hidden strike damage to a corporeal foe with a melee attack, he can also deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to his reduced hidden strike damage to an opponent adjacent to the first (even if the second opponent is out of his reach). The damage is bludgeoning damage, and if the colliding foe has any natural attacks, the damage is also considered magic, evil, or any other type of damage the natural attack deals. Unlike normal vigilante talents that affect hidden strikes, this vigilante talent applies in all cases when the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Leave an Opening (Ex):** The vigilante's hidden strike leaves an unbalancing opening in a foe's defenses, setting up the foe to be attacked again. At the beginning of the foe's next turn, if the vigilante threatens the foe, the foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the vigilante. Multiple attacks against the same foe don't create multiple attacks of opportunity in the same round (but attacks against several foes can cause each to provoke one attack of opportunity). Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Mighty Ambush (Ex):** Once per round, when the vigilante succeeds at a hidden strike, he can instantly drop the damaged enemy unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's class level + the higher of the vigilante's Strength and Dexterity modifiers). Whether or not a creature's saving throw is successful, it can't be affected by that vigilante's mighty ambush again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 10th level can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Throat Jab (Ex):** The vigilante's hidden strike jabs his opponent in the throat, preventing that opponent from speaking until the vigilante's next turn. (If the vigilante uses this ability on the surprise round, it lasts until the end of his first full turn after the surprise round.) This prevents the target from calling out for help, using spells with verbal components, or doing anything else that requires speaking. The target cannot be affected by that vigilante's throat jab again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 4th level can select this talent."

While not all implements psychically resonate with all other kinds of implements, such *panoplies* unlock even greater magical potential when used to complement one another.",

			"An occultist can select a panoply anytime he selects a new implement school. To do so, he must already have learned to use the implement school of each implement within the panoply at least once. As with any other implement school, when an occultist learns to use a panoply, he gains access to the resonant power and base focus power, and he becomes able to learn the panoply's other focus powers. He also adds one spell of each spell level to his spell list, and these spells can be taken from any of the implement schools associated with the panoply. To use a panoply's resonant power or any of its focus powers, the occultist must select and invest mental focus into the associated implements that day. A single bearer must hold all the panoply's associated implements to gain the panoply's resonant power, and the occultist counts the total number of points of mental focus invested among all of the associated implements to determine the resonant power's effect. The occultist can expend points of mental focus from any of the associated implements to use the panoply's focus powers. Unlike for other implement schools, an occultist cannot select a panoply more than once.",

			"",
			"An occultist can adopt a sacred implement whenever he gains access to an implement school. Once chosen, the sacred implement is permanent and grants the occultist access to a bonus focus power for that implement school, but causes the occultist to take a -1 penalty to his caster level when using the spells and associated implement powers of a school of magic opposed to that deity's portfolio.
