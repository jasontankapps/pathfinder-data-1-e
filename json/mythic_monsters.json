			"Residents of an enigmatic and unknown world that is believed to exist out of phase with the Material Plane, anunnaki are mysterious, god-like beings that shape the very direction of civilizations. Little is known about the anunnaki homeworld, but fragmented information collected by scholars indicates that it comes into contact with the Material Plane only once every few thousand years. During this time, anunnaki travel to other worlds in order to manipulate the course of evolution, creating civilizations and uplifting primitive creatures using their esoteric technology, which includes external power sources called \"lanterns of civilization.\" The anunnaki do not typically remain to guide these societies, and are often remembered as deities by the civilizations they leave behind. Because the anunnaki can take on various forms, piecing together which civilizations have or haven't been visited by anunnaki is exceedingly difficult. The creatures could have arrived to guide one civilization in the guise of powerful, glowing creatures and secretly assimilated into another society by adopting the appearance of members of that society and subtly making changes over the course of decades. Each anunnaki calibrates its form to fit the mores and prejudices of the specific society it means to advance.",
			"",
			"Anunnaki's role as manipulators of civilization and natural order often puts them into direct confrontation with elohim. The source of the enmity between these mighty creatures is unknown, but the aftershocks of their conflicts can be felt for millennia after the fighting has ended. Some sages believe that the anunnaki and elohim are both working to circumvent some future calamity, but differ along ideological or philosophical lines as to how to prevent this event from coming to pass. Ancient records from cultures that were shaped by the anunnaki reference divine visions of great, devouring rifts in the darkness between the stars and the terrible, unimaginable entities that dwell within them.",
			"",
			"For all the knowledge and power anunnaki possess, the civilizations they create do not always see them as benevolent saviors. Some anunnaki might have more sinister agendas not shared by the rest of their people. These rogue anunnaki have free rein over the societies they manipulate as long as they can avoid the notice of their fellow anunnaki - and since it is difficult for other creatures to find or contact any of their race, the renegade anunnaki can often do whatever they please. Some of these renegades use their civilizations for large-scale experiments, creating bizarre hybrid creatures. Others advance their subjects too rapidly by the standards of the other anunnaki, attempting to create creatures as advanced as the anunnaki themselves rather than simply giving cultures the means to advance themselves. In many of these cases, the uplifted society isn't truly equipped to handle such vast changes. Rather than advancing in a surge of scientific and creative thought, its members become absorbed with existential doubt or fall into madness as they recognize the gulf between their lofty ambitions and the materials and means they have at their disposal.",
			"",
			"Anunnaki prefer to interact with most humanoids without being recognized for what they are, and an anunnaki may depart a conversation abruptly if a non-anunnaki reveals that she knows it is not the god or mortal it pretends to be."

Despite the construct's tremendous might, further divination determined that the Champion of the Gilded Host was still incapable of defeating a Spawn of Rovagug.

A different kingdom claimed each one as spoils of Praramdav's folly. Nearly a millennium later, these same kingdoms had managed to reunite three of the pieces when Unyielding Kothogaz arrived in Vudra, but the Spawn of Rovagug attacked and scattered the pieces far and wide in its rampage.

Any creature born within her aura gains a mutation as if it were the drakainia's spawn, though if the creature's parent was not impregnated by the drakainia, the creature born is an infant of the kind its biological parents would produce, and doesn't count toward the CR limit the drakainia can spawn per day.",

She makes a grapple combat maneuver check, and if she succeeds she impregnates that creature regardless of its gender. A mythic character must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw to avoid being impregnated; a non-mythic character is impregnated automatically. An impregnated creature's pregnancy lasts for 2d4 rounds.

On a successful check, the offspring is removed, and the formerly pregnant creature takes 1d4 points of bleed damage. On failed check, the pregnant creature takes 2d6 points of bleed damage and is stunned for 1 round, but the offspring is not removed. The creature spawned by means of this impregnation is any creature of the drakainia's choice that is at least one size category smaller than the creature she impregnated.

She doesn't need line of sight or knowledge of the spawn's location. If she chooses a spawn that is farther than a mile away, she does not lose the use of the spell-like ability, but does lose the action. On arrival, she explodes out from her offspring, destroying it entirely.",

A glaistig's leaf blast is a physical composite blast that deals slashing damage. The glaistig can apply the infusions of deadly earth, entangling infusion, impale, and pushing infusion, as well as any of the glaistig's universal infusions, to her leaf blast. The glaistig also gains infusions and utility talents listed under her other special abilities, but doesn't gain any other abilities of a 20th-level kineticist.",

The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based. On a successful melee attack, a glaistig can affect her target with either her agony, misfortune, or retribution hex as an additional effect. When she uses her earth blast or leaf blast, she can choose one of these hexes to affect all creatures damaged by the blast.",

			"",
			"Hailed as either protectors or plagues, glaistigs are ancient fey, tied to the earth and wielding its powers. Although not evil, glaistigs are unpredictable and hot-tempered-easily stirred to anger and possessing powerful magic to deal great harm to the objects of their scorn.",
			"",
			"A glaistig resembles a comely human woman with greenish skin and the lower legs of a goat, similar to a faun or satyr. Glaistigs usually cover their bestial lower body in flowing robes or gowns, typically woven from leaves frozen in the colors of summer or autumn, and adorn themselves with simple but elegant jewelry. Their haunting eyes show no pupils, and every step they take seems as one move in an endless dance. They can be whimsical, but often move and act with great deliberation, especially when their anger is roused.",
			"",
			"Glaistigs are among the oldest and most powerful fey in existence. Legends say that they were once incorporeal spirits of the earth that strove to protect early humans living the simple lives of farmers in harsh worlds, and it was through that protection and proximity that these spirits coalesced into the forms they now hold. Regardless of their origins, many glaistigs still protect swaths of rural countryside, forests, and swamps, as well as the people who live therein. Their protection is often unobtrusive; they prefer to manifest their power and protection from the camouflage of foliage, making it seem like the wilderness itself is acting against interlopers. In times of great need, however, or when they become very angry, glaistigs confront dangers in the open. Inhabitants of places protected by a glaistig often leave food, drink, jewels, and crafts at a designated place of honor, or gather to sing songs or tell tales for the glaistig to hear from the shadows. Such communities tell stories of the green maiden who lives in the forest or some other stretch of pristine wilderness, and relate a number of cautionary tales about their fickle protector. Such tales have twofold purpose: to keep the favor of a local glaistig and to protect the young and foolish from doing something that angers the green maiden, which can often mean death. In return for such cautious reverence, those under the elder fey's protection often find furrows dug and earth mysteriously moved for them, troughs and barrels filled with fresh water during droughts, or even marauding monsters driven far away. But such harmony is often tenuous, and those that leave tribute for a glaistig do so as much to placate her as to praise her. For the same glaistig that brings water and turns earth can blight an entire countryside or cause the ground to tremble. A glaistig's mere presence can incite others to uncontrollable fits of dancing and demented antics, and those that move a glaistig to rage earn themselves a powerful foe indeed.",
			"",
			"In combat, a glaistig moves with ease and grace, typically targeting those under the effects of her aura with debilitating hexes before withdrawing to summon earth elementals to aid her, and bombarding her opponents with leaves and dirt. The living link of her body to the earth and its plants and trees makes a glaistig vulnerable in the air, and she does what she can to stay grounded. Even at the height of anger, however, a glaistig can still sometimes be reasoned with. A glaistig will typically pause to parley, and can be swayed to cease hostilities in exchange for some valuable, preferably magical, item of sufficient value, particularly a wooden or stone item. While glaistigs themselves have no compunction about bending the truth or flagrantly dissembling, they take extreme offense when others lie to them, and are quite adept at sniffing out falsehoods. When a glaistig deduces that someone has lied to her, even if the untruths were spoken in an attempt at flattery, her outrage is such that she is unwilling to even speak with that person again.",
			"",
			"Among some of the most prevalent cautionary tales involving glaistigs is that they sometimes lure young children deep into their wilderness homes, kidnapping them and even replacing them with some form of fey impostor. In truth, these fey enjoy the innocence, honesty, and playfulness of children, and usually keep them only to chat and dance with for a short while before sending them home unharmed.",

Creatures more than 60 feet away treat the beast as having total {rule/concealment} due to the dazzling brilliance, and any creature within 60 feet that looks at the grogrisant must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. Creatures can avert their eyes as if this were a gaze attack.",

			"Tales of Taldor's earliest founding speak of a terrible beast - a gigantic six-eyed lion whose mane burned like the sun and whose footsteps shook the earth-that laid waste to the desperate city-states of the region, feeding on their livestock and plundering their wealth to line its den. Called the grogrisant, it terrorized the region for centuries until First Emperor Taldaris finally slew the terrible beast.",
			"",
			"Sometimes called the Imperial Beast, the grogrisant has reappeared occasionally throughout Taldor's history, always in times of great peril and always to eventually be slain by a hero of the people - but only after slaughtering many more who would lay claim to that title. No one is certain if the grogrisant is part of a rare race of mythical leonine beasts that hide within the World's Edge Mountains or if it is simply a lone beast that refuses to die; mythic magic conceals its tracks and hides it from divinations, leaving its life and lair a mystery.",
			"",
			"The grogrisant's pelt amplifies sunlight, creating a deadly blaze of light that burns out the eyes of those nearby and renders the beast nothing but a barely perceptible shimmer to distant creatures. Taldan folklore insists the beast's blood can cure any disease.",
			"",
			"The grogrisant stands 18 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 12,000 pounds.",
