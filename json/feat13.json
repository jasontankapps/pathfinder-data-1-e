Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up.

Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] &times; 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged magic missile takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants.

This potent object is treated as a wooden unholy symbol that radiates faint necromancy magic. If your Umbrae-Token is ever destroyed, your connection to the shadowy heart of the Uskwood is severed and all benefits of this feat are lost until another is created.
