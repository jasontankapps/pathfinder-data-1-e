Their territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs put them in direct conflict with other undersea races such as merfolk and sahuagin.",

Dragon turtles possess shells 15 feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their powerful tails."

A typical flying polyp measures 30 feet in length but is unusually light for its size, weighing no more than 2,000 pounds. These creatures seem to have no maximum lifespan, but their violent, warlike nature ensures that death eventually occurs - even if it takes eons for the polyp to encounter something capable of defeating it.",
			"",
			"A flying polyp is a physical being, but one composed of material strangely unlike the flesh that garbs most living creatures. While the stuff that makes up the exterior of a flying polyp's body might seem similar to ordinary flesh, it often behaves in ways that should be impossible. The material seems to fade in and out of visibility, almost at random, at points becoming transparent enough that the nauseating inner workings of the thing's body are laid bare. Although the polyp feels moist and damp to the touch, what might serve as blood in other creatures behaves more like strange vortices of wind within a flying polyp's body. When wounded, its damaged flesh does not bleed so much as whistle and gust.",
			"",
			"A flying polyp's association with wind goes far beyond the strange storms that surge through what pass as veins and arteries in its massive body. These creatures have a remarkable ability to control the air around them, both via a wide array of spell-like abilities and through the use of potent supernatural powers. They do not wield tools or weapons as a rule, instead using their mastery of the winds themselves to wage war and build their grim cities, scouring towers and chambers out of basalt with precise blasts of sand-laden wind.",
			"",
			"Although flying polyps display some of the features of other sentient races, particularly in their habit of building cities (although these towering settlements usually incorporate architectural features that most other races find awkward and unsettling), in other areas they seem strangely primitive or uninterested. They are as aberrant in mind and philosophy as they are in physical form. For example, they seem to have neither a name for their own race, nor a language to call their own. Their cities, while bewildering in their vast scale, seem to serve little purpose other than to unnerve, for flying polyps do not engage in trade or politics or other social constructs.",
			"",
			"The primary exception to this, to the detriment of other creatures unfortunate enough to dwell in regions claimed by flying polyps, is war. Flying polyps excel at genocide, using their mastery over wind to scour clean entire cities and civilizations when they come upon them. Some among their kind can even travel to other planets by bringing with them a sizable sphere of purloined wind to carry them aloft and sustain them, and with this power they lead armies from planet to planet as necessary, relentlessly tracking their chosen enemies across worlds. Every so often, flying polyps encounter a race that is their equal in war, and on some worlds, they still endure the humiliation of these ancient defeats after being imprisoned in extensive underground chambers where they are cut off from the outside world. Yet flying polyps are long-lived, and should unforeseen tectonic events creates new exit to their prison chambers, lost in the forgotten corners of those planets' depths, they emerge with unabated fury to seek revenge against the enemies who dared humiliate them so."

Cast out from both sylvan and fiendish society, the typical forlarren is a lonely creature, cursed by its own existence. It detests itself and everything it sees, and soon becomes consumed by hatred of life itself. The forlarren vents its rage on good and evil alike, lashing out at anything that approaches it.",

Yet curiously, when a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother sometimes surface, and it shows profound remorse for its cruelty. With such a pendulum of erratic behavior, it is no wonder that forlarrens are all but incapable of forming lasting friendships - even with others of their own kind.",

However, those who stumble across one of the so-called formless spawn of Tsathoggua would do well to remember that not all oozes are mindless and easily hit in combat, for these deadly guardians prove quite cunning and display an alacrity that grants them incredible defenses against physical attacks.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn at rest resembles nothing more than a simple puddle of tar, oil, or another dark, thick liquid; once roused to attack, however, it could never be mistaken for anything other than a monstrous and malignant predator. The creature's outline changes constantly, shifting from serpentine to insectile to a truly shapeless mass-at times even approximating humanoid or other bestial shapes before collapsing in on itself a moment later. Always, the formless spawn sends forth a storm of tendrils that whip and writhe, blocking attacks and fouling attempts at combat maneuvers. The creatures can speak if they deign to, yet they rarely bother to do so with creatures that have fixed shapes-formless spawn consider talking to one's food a waste of time.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn is elephantine in size, capable of covering a 15-foot-diameter pool to a depth of a foot, and it weighs just over 9,000 pounds. Even at this weight, a formless spawn is only about as dense as oil and thus floats on water, unless it actively swims down under the surface.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn is a sentient and quite intelligent mass of protoplasm capable of assuming any basic shape but incapable of holding that form for long. It has no true shape. The ooze's characteristic formlessness results from a combination of physical disinclination to stay in one configuration (doing so causes a formless spawn something akin to nausea) and a mental inability to even comprehend the concept of a fixed form. Still, a formless spawn hardly seems to suffer at all in power or intellect for these constant fluctuations in appearance. Indeed, they often ridicule those who they view as being \"locked\" into a single shape, although most creatures never even get the chance to hear such mockery, for formless spawn are usually more eager to slaughter and consume those they encounter than speak to them.",
			"",
			"Formless spawn do not age - a process that spawn refer to as \"a crude biological function\" - nor do they reproduce. All formless spawn that exist were themselves spawned from sources deep below the ground. The original formless spawn issued fully formed and aware from Tsathoggua himself, but after a time, the very rocks in places where that Great Old One slumbered seemed to gain the ability to create them. Just as pockets of oil might bubble up from a fissure in the stones, so too might a fully formed spawn come into being. Fortunately, such points are few and far between. While spawn do not grow old or mate, they must eat, and a spawn denied meals can starve to death. When a spawn uses its freeze ability, its metabolism slows significantly - a spawn masquerading as a pool can live for decades or even centuries without eating, but upon awakening, it is always ravenous and must seek sustenance promptly or begin to starve.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The majority of formless spawn that are encountered are acting as temple guardians or agents of the cult of Tsathoggua, to the extent that many texts refer to these monsters by a longer name: the formless spawn of Tsathoggua. Within the Great Old One's temples, a formless spawn often resides within a large font or other carved container that upon first glance might appear to be little more than a decorative aspect of the shrine. Those formless spawn that are encountered in the wild are almost always ones that have lost their temples or have survived the destruction of a cult they once served. Formless spawn wander the deep tunnels of the Darklands relentlessly, driven by an urge to seek out new cults or temples of their father to serve. These formless spawn, subjected to a wider range of obstacles and challenges, most often advance beyond the standard powers presented above, either by gaining Hit Dice or class levels. Formless spawn that gain levels generally do so as clerics of Tsathoggua, psychics, rogues, or sorcerers. A spellcasting formless spawn usually takes Eschew Materials as a feat as early as possible, but as long as it worships Tsathoggua, it can use its own body as a divine focus in place of a holy symbol when casting spells.",
			"",
			"In some cases, formless spawn manage to ascend beyond being mere guardians of a temple or agents of a cult, and wind up actually leading the temple itself. These formless spawn are almost always clerics of Tsathoggua, and they often count several standard spawn among their servitors, alongside the various humanoid or monstrous cultists who make up the bulk of the clergy. Legends of formless spawn being able to hold a single shape for extended periods of time are inaccurate, and they are often confused with accounts of shoggoths that have developed this capability. Despite both being dark-colored oozes, shoggoths and formless spawn have very little in common - the former being regarded by the latter as dangerous but useful beasts of burden, and with the shoggoths themselves generally showing minimal interest in anything other than themselves.",

This instinct may be tied to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures.",

			"**Sticky Resin (Ex)** A frost fir's bark constantly exudes a sticky resin that aids its combat maneuvers and natural attacks. The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world, the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants, citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other creatures.",
			"",
			"The grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.",
			"",
			"Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly.",
			"",
			"Frost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind. This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status when representing the grove in external matters (see below).",
			"",
			"Once a frost fir's fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a supply of carcasses for this effort.",
			"",
			"Following 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member. Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir's development remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself. Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to mourn their loss.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Frost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time, banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances of their species. Only in times of great conflict do multiple groves join forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight - usually followed by great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs' ire.",
			"",
			"Within frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.",
			"",
			"### Frost Firs in Alchemy",
			"",
			"Some alchemists prize frost firs for their sticky resin and easily combustible branches. When used as a component in manufacturing tanglefoot bags, a frost fir's resin increases the DC of the bag's Reflex save by 2 and extends the duration of the goo's entangling effect by 1 round. Frost fir resin can also aid in the crafting of tindertwigs, reducing the Craft DC from 20 to 15 and cutting the raw material cost in half."

			"Fuldrexes are mean, territorial creatures that, despite naturally taking the shape of small humanoids, seem to share more physical characteristics with fungi than anything else. Layers of thin, spotted, fibrous flesh cover their bodies like skin; their chubby fingers seem more like mushroom stalks than digits; and where hair might normally grow instead drips lacy growths that would seem more at home growing along the walls of a cave. Fuldrexes crave warm, dark, isolated places, and react violently when disturbed. The exception is when a much more powerful creature - particularly [a fungal creature](template/fungal_creature) - enters their demesne with an overwhelming display of might. In this case, the cowardly and dull creatures are apt to prostrate themselves before their better, vowing to serve and venerate it as other creatures might worship a deity.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes are notorious shapechangers that can appear to be naturally occurring fungi whenever they wish. They often use this ability to blend in with their surroundings before ambushing their enemies, or simply to fade from sight when a major threat barrels their way. In its natural form, a fuldrex stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"The product of natural growth run evilly amok, fuldrexes spawn in remote places where mundane fungus is abundant, especially in underground caves and oases. Fuldrexes always live where moisture and spots to hide among other plant life are abundant and where the searing light of the sun is scarce. Unlike most plants, though, fuldrexes have an advanced physiology and thus crave meat - the fresher the better - to sustain their strange little bodies. They also need moisture from their diets as well as from their surroundings to keep their bodily systems running smoothly.",
			"",
			"In a pinch, fuldrexes eat small animals native to their homes. However, fuldrexes prefer to accost larger creatures, especially humanoids, both for the large supplies of meat those victims provide as well as the liquids their bodies retain. They are most common and most comfortable as a species underground, though some fuldrexes thrive in the depths of primeval forests - especially blighted forests - where the treetop canopies keep their surroundings dark, moist, and perfectly suitable. When they do live in blighted areas, fuldrexes tend to gorge themselves on the fey that have so far escaped physical harm, and ignore those whose bodies and minds have been transformed into evil shadows of their previous selves (see the {template/blighted fey/ template}).",
			"",
			"Regardless of where they live, fuldrexes reproduce using spores. There is no sexual dimorphism among fuldrexes, but two of the creatures are required for this process to take place. One fuldrex leaves a collection of spores in a safe, fungus-filled place, such as the hollow of an enormous, rotted log, or a crevice in an underground rock formation. Then, noticing the deep and pungent smell that distinctively marks these spores, another fuldrex later adds its own spores to the mix. The parents invariably abandon their gestating spawn, and after a few weeks, a new fuldrex springs fully formed from its fibrous sac.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes have no concept of parenthood and often squabble with their young over the best places to hunt or gather moisture. However, they do often allow the young specimens to live in their territories, usually provided that the children help lure fresh meat to the area. On rare occasions, fuldrexes spawn outside of any of their kin's territories, and in these cases the young are left entirely to their own devices.",
			"",
			"Although disease and blight have no hand in spawning fuldrexes, the creatures nonetheless maintain an incredible concentration of choking spores within their bodies. Mature fuldrexes know how to harness these physical characteristics into attacks that can weaken or kill their prey. Worse, though such planning and collaboration is rare among their kind, some fuldrexes even sneak unnoticed next to potential prey, releasing the noxious fumes from their rotten flesh just as a number of other fuldrexes descend upon the weakened victim. Terrifying as this sounds, though, fuldrexes almost always hunt alone or in pairs, even in territories where half a dozen or more of the creatures dwell. It is only in the most inhospitable environments that infestations of fuldrexes typically work together to kill any living creature unlucky enough to wander by.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As fiercely territorial creatures, fuldrexes are most concerned with maintaining a home that provides a steady stream of prey upon which to feed. They are cruel but rather cowardly, and thus prefer to use their environment as camouflage before ambushing victims. A stretch of deeply forested land or an expansive underground cave might seem abandoned, but it well may be teeming with an infestation of hiding fuldrexes simply waiting to strike.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes typically treat each other neutrally; that is, fuldrexes occupying the same territory that aren't hunting partners tend to ignore one another - unless a fight breaks out over a kill or a prime spot to hide and ambush prey, of course. In this case, fuldrexes battle each other viciously and often to the death.",
			"",
			"Despite their ambivalence toward one another, fuldrexes do not brook other hunters living in or even passing through their territory. They often band together to drive out rival predators weaker than themselves, if they don't kill the offending creature outright for food. In a strange way, this behavior emulates a code of honor, though the evil creatures might turn on one another once the offending interloper is dispatched.",
			"",
			"The exception to fuldrexes' hostility toward rival predators lies in evil creatures that are significantly more powerful than they are, such as dragons, demons, and divs. These terrors' auras of evil are like siren songs to fuldrexes. If such a powerful rival rampages through a fuldrex territory - especially if the rival makes a wanton display of sheer power or wickedness - the local fuldrexes are likely to emerge from hiding and vow to serve the creatures unfailingly. Should the rival accept the fuldrexes' offer, the plant creatures dedicate themselves to being loyal minions, following even orders that would result in their certain deaths. As they are rather thick and blatantly self-centered, fuldrexes also tend to believe that they are the chosen acolytes of powerful creatures, and that they can achieve supernatural power through serving those they deem worthy."

Fungoid creatures and spore zombies are under the control of the fungus queen that created them, and remain enslaved until that fungus queen is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation. A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane. She can control a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than double her own Hit Dice. Any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures or spore zombies. A fungus queen can free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a creature cannot be enslaved again (although fungoid creatures can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities).",
			"",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** A fungus queen drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before she can use this ability. The fungus queen's embrace bestows one negative level and has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the fungus queen. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the suggestion. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. Creatures killed by this attack do not die - they instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn above). The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Plant Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy ability, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted with a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train them as guardians.",
			"",
			"**Sporepod (Su)** As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle, though she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full attack, and only one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object with an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.",

			"Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins attempted to invade the Abyssal realm of the demon lord of disease and fungus. These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with this development, the witch seeded numerous Material Plane worlds with fungus queen spores, and these new fungus queens have taken to these new environments like rot to a carcass; today, hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the fouler reaches of the Material Plane. They are particularly fond of large cave systems and the slums of ruined cities. Fungus queens also often dwell in areas of corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule, or in the sewers of active cities with an unusually large amount of magical pollution.",
			"",
			"An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way can be evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but fungus queens are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves - particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus queen's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Yet a fungus queen knows that a diverse array of guardians is best, and is certain to keep some non-plant minions on hand to protect her lair.",
			"",
			"Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those who have been infested elicit their eternal ire, but it is succubi that most enrage fungus queens. Whether this is due to a simple territorial conflict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the plants abandon their normal approach of subtle mental control and trickery, instead bringing all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus queens also take great and specific delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.",
			"",
			"While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to \"poach\" from their sisters' harems of charmed and infested pets.",
			"",
			"Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in bard, ranger, or sorcerer; they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. Fungus queen druids are remarkably rare.",
			"",
			"A fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds."

			"",
			"**Displacement (Su)** A furcifer's illusory pollen constantly distorts its presence. It gains a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss chance, and creatures immune to illusions or poison are immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"**Tongue (Ex)** A furcifer can grab a foe with its tongue and draw the victim to its mouth. This tongue attack has a reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows the furcifer to grab its target. A furcifer does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.",
			"",
			"**Utopia (Sp)** A furcifer is blessed with strange powers of illusion and can warp the world around it at will to seem idyllic and safe. This functions as a mirage arcana spell, though the furcifer's simplistic intellect means it may create unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw; otherwise, the furcifer's powers lull them into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the furcifer itself appears as something harmless within the affected area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly animal, making it effectively invisible; if the furcifer attacks, it immediately breaks the invisibility effect but does not end the mirage arcana effect. Creatures immune to illusions and mind-affecting effects are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating blossoms, the furcifer is a bizarre synthesis of reptile and plant born from enormous surges of positive energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers are ravenous predators, capable of warping the world around them into almost any placid scene and concealing themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of human-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one from above thanks to the clever reptilian hunters' long, prehensile tongues.",
			"",
			"Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in false wonderlands for days or weeks as the furcifer picks off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.",
			"",
			"Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up to 6-1/2 tons.",
			"",
			"A primordial creature of incredible size and impressive innate magic, the furcifer blends reptile and plant features into the form of a deadly ambush hunter. With the frame of a massive, hunchbacked lizard, opposable claws on each limb, a long prehensile tail, and a bony crest to protect their neck, this vicious beast lacks little in comparison to other predators. Despite all this, furcifers are lazy and capricious, preferring to lie in wait and snatch smaller prey with their long, prehensile tongues. Their broad-set eyes can rotate independently, allowing them to look in multiple directions at once and constantly watch for other dangerous creatures.",
			"",
			"Furcifers command impressive innate magic that allows them to cloak the world around them in a placid disguise. They have rudimentary psychic abilities and can read glimpses of whatever their prey finds inviting and harmless, and then spin those stolen images into a soft landscape. When confronting intelligent creatures, the beasts' limited intellects sometimes result in surreal illusions - such as fruit trees heavy with bunnies, rippling ponds sitting at angles in hillsides, or houses made from candy - but the mind-numbing euphoria of their magic often makes such impossible landscapes feel sensible to their unsuspecting prey.",
			"",
			"The orchid-like plants growing from the furcifer's back help further define their abilities. Rather than a symbiotic relationship, the blossoms are as much a part of the predator's anatomy as its eyes or claws, and they secrete a sweetly scented narcotic pollen that lulls most warmblooded animals into a mild euphoria. The plants provide some sustenance to the furcifer but also produce a bevy of alchemical reagents that help power its magical abilities as well as its consumption. With the aid of these botanical factories, furcifers can digest practically anything they can swallow, from rocks and debris to armor worn by their prey.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Furcifers flourish in warm and temperate forests, as their cold-blooded nature and hothouse flower elements make them vulnerable to the cold. The resilient creatures could survive in desert and mountain environments if transplanted, limited only by available water and prey, but they rarely leave the familiar hunting grounds where they are born.",
			"",
			"As asexual creatures, furcifers rely on pollinating insects for reproduction. Once their blossoms are fertilized, they release their spore-like eggs into the wind, and those that settle on trees develop into small, carnivorous flowers that feed on their host trees and passing insects and birds for several years before maturing into miniature furcifers that begin hunting. The youngs' first meals often consist of other larval furcifers that have yet to mature into their ambulatory states. On rare occasion, a single larval bloom will produce twin young, who bond and share their territory for life.",
			"",
			"Infused with positive energy and strange alchemical reagents, furcifers are useful components for a variety of projects. Their pollen remains psychoactive for years after death, and the nectar harvested from a single beast can provides weeks' worth of potent hallucinogens. Their bones are coveted for magic items involving acid, and their skin can be readily fashioned into cloaks and robes with illusory properties. The flesh itself is mildly toxic, and dead furcifers may rot slowly for months rather than be scavenged by other animals."
