			"Eggal is a friendly, outgoing young halfling, generous with his spirit, spirits, money, and affection - but not particularly bright. Fortunately, Eggal is so likable and headstrong that few ever try to take advantage of him, and those who do discover that his lack of \"book learning\" hasn't done anything to dull his innate cunning, and he remembers who has done him wrong every bit as well as he recalls who has done him favors, repaying both with interest. He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about - to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more \"monstrous\" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.",
			"",
			"**Combat Encounters:** Though he is hard to influence with magic, clever lies and subtle manipulation can easily turn Eggal against the PCs, and it's not uncommon for him to come into conflict with the lawful authorities in a region if he feels they are profiting at the expense of the common people. If he sees the PCs as agents of oppression, regardless of their justifications, he's likely to oppose them-with his mace if necessary. Because of his reluctance to kill, he is useful for an encounter where the PCs should negotiate or surrender instead of fighting.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Eggal can be a reliable feature of local taverns, even showing up in other cities where the PCs travel. Because he tends to help when asked, he might end up in over his head and need rescuing, or have friends in need of rescue. He can also help out the PCs as an ally against undead, as a backup healer, or as a contact in Cayden Cailean's church.",

Such assassins are responsible for taking care of nosy adventurers or pesky guards who don't know to mind their own business. Night Scale assassins work to silence some of Magnimar's mouthiest nobles as well as its uncorrupted political figures, and it is rumored that if one can get a hold of the shadowy gang, private parties might be able to arrange an assassination for a steep price.",

Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth, knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however, pirates do all they can to protect their magic-wielding allies from harm, knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and swinging from a gibbet.",
			"",
			"The majority of shackled sorcerers are considered officers, but they rarely assume traditional positions of authority such as a captain's first mate. Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are highly prized among sea-faring magic-wielders. While the bloodlines of shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at sea - including the Aquatic or Stormborn bloodlines - any gifted arcane casters who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships."

			"Based in the Nidalese city of Nisroch, the Silent Enforcers maintain brutal order in the name of Zon-Kuthon and the city's Silent Shroud, the official security force that they're members of. Rather than recruiting from among Nisroch's populace, the enforcers of the Silent Shroud kidnap children from the city's lowest classes, whom they mold to fit their ideals. These children must endure a terrifying regimen of indoctrination and torture, and are rendered mute by the application of a hot poker to the throat. Those who survive emerge nameless and almost devoid of identity, their bodies hardened into living weapons that need neither armor with which to protect themselves nor implements with which to kill. Indoctrinated only to listen and react, to obey and not to think, a fully trained Silent Enforcer is a merciless and imposing agent of the Shrouded One - the mysterious leader of the Silent Shroud, and the only member to retain the ability to speak. The Shrouded One's identity is known only to Nisroch's top city officials, but even she is said to remain nameless, like her enforcers, identifying herself only with a series of hand gestures despite her ability to speak her own name should she wish to do so.",
			"",
			"Silent Enforcers primarily exercise authority over the peasants of Nisroch, but have jurisdiction over any criminal act committed in their sight. For the most part, the punishment for a crime the monks witness is up to each Silent Enforcer's own discretion, and they more often err on the side of the harsh and lethal variety. Should a Silent Enforcer catch a more notable citizen or an influential foreigner committing a crime, the perpetrator is expected to be apprehended rather than killed; it is acceptable for such criminals to turn up battered, so long as they're taken alive. Completely devoid of redeeming emotion, Silent Enforcers show mercy not to spare lives, but rather to subject their prisoners to the fearsome justice of Nidal. Most victims prefer a clean death in battle to the unimaginably sadistic tortures that would be exacted upon them should they be taken prisoner by an agent of the Silent Shroud.",
			"",
			"Typically, Silent Enforcers work in pairs or other multiples of two. Partners are assigned randomly each dawn, lest undue attachments form between agents that might compromise their duties. Should a Silent Enforcer be defeated, the lives of any peasants who bear witness to or spread tales of such an embarrassment are forfeit. Even nobles fear to speak of such occurrences, for the protections normally provided for those of their stature are ignored when the flawless reputation and intimidating legend of the Silent Shroud is at stake. Silent Enforcers treat the elimination of those attempting to escape their authority as a paramount duty, though their pursuit rarely extends beyond Nisroch's walls."

Despite their racial and local loyalties, though, the Blue Warders are generally happy to escort those of other races or with allegiances to other scholarly organizations through the library, provided such visitors come to them in peace and with a polite request. However, they reserve the right to deny access to anyone they deem an enemy of their people - and to any who are too rude or presumptuous."

Cannibalism is a sacred rite in the worship of the Three Feasters, and the Koboto believe that consuming the flesh of their enemies grants them strength and power. These warriors rarely rush into combat without some consideration and preparation. They prefer to cast preparatory spells such as shield of faith and weapon of awe if time permits. Their preferred method of combat is ambush; they use Stealth and attempt to approach their enemies undetected. The cannibals prefer to incapacitate their enemies using hold person or tanglefoot bags so they can tie up and eventually cook and eat their victims; a living prisoner spoils less quickly than a decaying corpse. If open combat becomes necessary, these zealots let the ferocious rage of the Three Feasters overtake them and don't back down until they or their enemies are dead.",

Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide {rule/cover} in addition to {rule/concealment} from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity. As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the Rapid Shot feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6.

			"Pure Legionnaires fill a variety of roles, from serving as ship inspectors and camel-riding desert caravan guards to city law enforcement and cult-hunters who infiltrate secret sects of illicit deity worshipers within the Rahadoumi population. Smugglers who are tempted to make a steep profit by transporting religious items into the nation often discover that the cost of challenging the Pure Legion is more than they're willing to pay, and much of the Pure Legion's work involves maintaining enough of a reputation to deter hidden priests and closet faithful from publicly violating their nation's most important law. While Pure Legionnaires aren't as bloodthirsty as other nations may portray them, all are zealously devoted to the cause."
