			"Eggal is a friendly, outgoing young halfling, generous with his spirit, spirits, money, and affection - but not particularly bright. Fortunately, Eggal is so likable and headstrong that few ever try to take advantage of him, and those who do discover that his lack of \"book learning\" hasn't done anything to dull his innate cunning, and he remembers who has done him wrong every bit as well as he recalls who has done him favors, repaying both with interest. He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about - to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more \"monstrous\" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.",
			"",
			"**Combat Encounters:** Though he is hard to influence with magic, clever lies and subtle manipulation can easily turn Eggal against the PCs, and it's not uncommon for him to come into conflict with the lawful authorities in a region if he feels they are profiting at the expense of the common people. If he sees the PCs as agents of oppression, regardless of their justifications, he's likely to oppose them-with his mace if necessary. Because of his reluctance to kill, he is useful for an encounter where the PCs should negotiate or surrender instead of fighting.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Eggal can be a reliable feature of local taverns, even showing up in other cities where the PCs travel. Because he tends to help when asked, he might end up in over his head and need rescuing, or have friends in need of rescue. He can also help out the PCs as an ally against undead, as a backup healer, or as a contact in Cayden Cailean's church.",

Members of the Night Scales range from toughs to pickpockets to con artists, following a strict hierarchy of power based on skill as much as social connections. Among these ranks, the Night Scale assassins are perhaps the most feared members of the thieves' guild. Such assassins are responsible for taking care of nosy adventurers or pesky guards who don't know to mind their own business. Night Scale assassins work to silence some of Magnimar's mouthiest nobles as well as its uncorrupted political figures, and it is rumored that if one can get a hold of the shadowy gang, private parties might be able to arrange an assassination for a steep price.",

These children must endure a terrifying regimen of indoctrination and torture, and are rendered mute by the application of a hot poker to the throat. Those who survive emerge nameless and almost devoid of identity, their bodies hardened into living weapons that need neither armor with which to protect themselves nor implements with which to kill. Indoctrinated only to listen and react, to obey and not to think, a fully trained Silent Enforcer is a merciless and imposing agent of the Shrouded One - the mysterious leader of the Silent Shroud, and the only member to retain the ability to speak. The Shrouded One's identity is known only to Nisroch's top city officials, but even she is said to remain nameless, like her enforcers, identifying herself only with a series of hand gestures despite her ability to speak her own name should she wish to do so.",

For the most part, the punishment for a crime the monks witness is up to each Silent Enforcer's own discretion, and they more often err on the side of the harsh and lethal variety. Should a Silent Enforcer catch a more notable citizen or an influential foreigner committing a crime, the perpetrator is expected to be apprehended rather than killed; it is acceptable for such criminals to turn up battered, so long as they're taken alive. Completely devoid of redeeming emotion, Silent Enforcers show mercy not to spare lives, but rather to subject their prisoners to the fearsome justice of Nidal. Most victims prefer a clean death in battle to the unimaginably sadistic tortures that would be exacted upon them should they be taken prisoner by an agent of the Silent Shroud.",
			"",
			"Typically, Silent Enforcers work in pairs or other multiples of two. Partners are assigned randomly each dawn, lest undue attachments form between agents that might compromise their duties. Should a Silent Enforcer be defeated, the lives of any peasants who bear witness to or spread tales of such an embarrassment are forfeit. Even nobles fear to speak of such occurrences, for the protections normally provided for those of their stature are ignored when the flawless reputation and intimidating legend of the Silent Shroud is at stake. Silent Enforcers treat the elimination of those attempting to escape their authority as a paramount duty, though their pursuit rarely extends beyond Nisroch's walls."

Each Blue Warder is tattooed in counter-sigils that permit passage through the innumerable wards and other magical defenses of the library; the number and complexity of a dwarf's tattoos increase with age and responsibility, allowing access to ever-deeper chambers within the repository and unlocking progressively more secret collections to the Warder.",
			"",
			"The Blue Warders also act as escorts for patrons of the library, guiding them through the facility, a labyrinthine maze of tunnels confusing even to those of dwarven blood. They show special favoritism in both priority and access to the Sage's Guild of Tar-Kazmukh, an organization that's dedicated to the study of all things arcane and planar. Despite their racial and local loyalties, though, the Blue Warders are generally happy to escort those of other races or with allegiances to other scholarly organizations through the library, provided such visitors come to them in peace and with a polite request. However, they reserve the right to deny access to anyone they deem an enemy of their people - and to any who are too rude or presumptuous."

Worship of this pantheon, they believe, is all that protects their people from devastation by monsters and weather. Cannibalism is a sacred rite in the worship of the Three Feasters, and the Koboto believe that consuming the flesh of their enemies grants them strength and power. These warriors rarely rush into combat without some consideration and preparation. They prefer to cast preparatory spells such as shield of faith and weapon of awe if time permits. Their preferred method of combat is ambush; they use Stealth and attempt to approach their enemies undetected. The cannibals prefer to incapacitate their enemies using hold person or tanglefoot bags so they can tie up and eventually cook and eat their victims; a living prisoner spoils less quickly than a decaying corpse. If open combat becomes necessary, these zealots let the ferocious rage of the Three Feasters overtake them and don't back down until they or their enemies are dead.",

			"**Laser Pistol (Ex)** The gunslinger's laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its attacks resolve against the target's touch AC. Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide {rule/cover} in addition to {rule/concealment} from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity. As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the {feat/Rapid Shot} feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2 pounds.",
			"",
			"**Numerian Silverdisks (Ex)** These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10 charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger's laser pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun's internal capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator. A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.",
			"",
			"**Rare Resources (Ex)** The Numerian gunslinger's access to the rare and expensive technology of the land's many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her level. This increases his CR by 1.",
			"",
			"Not content with the black powder guns of Alkenstar, the Numerian gunslinger tracks down and masters the high-tech weaponry of Numeria. In the course of his travels, he's made enemies among the Technic League, who, like the people of Alkenstar, want to ensure that their advanced technology doesn't spread beyond their reach. Other technological firearms can be found in Numeria beyond the laser pistol."

			"The members of Rahadoum's elite Pure Legion are among the most vigilant and skilled police force in the Inner Sea region, dedicated to the sole purpose of keeping that nation free of the influence of gods and those who worship them. In the wake of the Oath Wars, which tore northern Garund apart as the churches of Nethys, Norgorber, and Sarenrae fought for control of the region, the nation of Rahadoum was founded upon the belief that all religions were a pox upon the world and that the worship of any divine force could bring about nothing but ill fortune. To stay true to this belief, for the last 21 centuries the Pure Legionnaires have worked ceaselessly to keep priests, lay worshipers, and religious paraphernalia out of their land.",
			"",
			"Based in Azir, the birthplace of the Laws of Man and now known as Port Godless, the Pure Legion inspects all vessels coming into Rahadoum to ensure they contain no religious paraphernalia and convey no would-be proselytizers. Any religious iconography found within the nation is confiscated and destroyed, and those who profess the veneration of any deity are forbidden entry into the land; such residents are deported or worse, depending on the seriousness of their crime. Legionnaires are trained to see through deception, from mundane lies about a visitor's faith to illusions and magical misdirections, and often utilize trusted arcane spellcasters to verify that magical items brought into Rahadoum pose no divine threat to their strictly atheist society.",
			"",
			"Pure Legionnaires fill a variety of roles, from serving as ship inspectors and camel-riding desert caravan guards to city law enforcement and cult-hunters who infiltrate secret sects of illicit deity worshipers within the Rahadoumi population. Smugglers who are tempted to make a steep profit by transporting religious items into the nation often discover that the cost of challenging the Pure Legion is more than they're willing to pay, and much of the Pure Legion's work involves maintaining enough of a reputation to deter hidden priests and closet faithful from publicly violating their nation's most important law. While Pure Legionnaires aren't as bloodthirsty as other nations may portray them, all are zealously devoted to the cause."

She is content to remain at her current rank until she dies or retires, for she took this job because of her love of horses and battle.

Flowery words and flattery are tiresome to her, and her closest friends are those who speak to her openly and honestly, as she would to them. She enjoys the company of druids and rangers, appreciating their respect for animals and feeling only slight envy because of her inability to control the magic they wield.",

She has retired many cavalry horses in her lifetime, finding ranches where they can be put to stud, tasked with light work, or used to train novice riders. She is disgusted by the idea of butchering horses for meat, would rather starve than eat a horse, and won't permit any in her company to do so. When a warhorse dies, she buries its heart and head with honor and burns the rest, unwilling to let a noble companion be eaten by scavengers. Seeing someone mistreat a horse drives her into a frenzy, and she has been known to tackle and beat a peasant or merchant she spots whipping a horse to get it to work. (She is wise enough to not do this to an officer or noble, but if by some inaction on her part that person dies in combat, so much the better.) She especially dislikes goblins for their cruelty toward horses, and enjoys skewering them on her lance, leaving the corpses on her lance for follow-up attacks to better intimidate their allies.",

Given enough gold and access to the right potions, she destroys the opposition's arguments, eradicates the witnesses' credibility, discovers conflicts of interest in judges and jurors, digs up obscure laws that invalidate the charges of which her client is accused, suggests plausible conspiracies or mistaken identities, points fingers at other possible suspects, bogs down trial proceedings, and offers plea bargains to a trivially smaller sentence in order to get trials over with.",

She usually has the assistance of one or more less skilled lawyers (use the successful merchant stat block, expert 7) hoping to gain some prestige by association, and payrolls two or three investigator wizards (human diviner 4) at any one time. All of these agents are people she believes she can trust not to violate any laws in the pursuit of information, for one slip-up can invalidate her entire case and-worst of all-embarrass her professionally. An agent who shows a lack of discretion or discipline in this matter is cut off and disavowed; depending on the infraction, she might bring her litigious powers to bear against that person, in which case it is usually best for the target to flee the city, change his or her name, and attempt a new life somewhere else."

			"When Ileosa fell from power, the Gray Maidens were disbanded. While many removed their masks and now do all they can to pursue a normal life, the most fanatical and psychologically scarred spread throughout Varisia, into some parts of Cheliax, and to more distant lands. Without a leader but knowing little else beyond service and violence, these remaining Gray Maidens seek new names and purposes in a world they no longer feel connected to. In Korvosa itself, Sabina Merrin (LN female human fighter 14) - the order's founder and Queen Ileosa's former consort - works to right the wrongs committed by the Gray Maidens, though many in the city are still understandably wary of her intentions. Elsewhere in Varisia, however, the former Gray Maiden Oriana (CN female human fighter 8) leads a devout group of fellow dishonored maidens who are unrepentant of their actions under Ileosa. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but Oriana and those faithful to her are believed to be working toward retaking Korvosa in Queen Ileosa's honor, though what means they plan to use remain as shrouded as their scar-marked faces. (For more details on the Gray Maidens, see Pathfinder Adventure Path #62.)"
