			"Monstrous hunters and bullies of the ocean depths, karkinoi live only to destroy creatures that dare cross their path and then feed on the corpses of the vanquished. Though not mindless, they have no inclination to build civilizations or even settlements, living in roving gangs or nomadic tribes. The tools they use in their more humanoid appendages are always scavenged, usually from victims, and are discarded when broken or of no more immediate use. Pursuits such as crafting, learning, and diplomacy are a waste to them; they see these as the activities of food-creatures not strong enough to see the world as it is - a stage for domination, feeding, and spawning. Even when these brutes band together, it is usually to spawn or to face sources of food that are too strong for only one or two karkinoi alone.",
			"",
			"Large hordes of karkinoi come together to hunt inhabitants of coastal settlements. Striking at night, they do as much damage as possible before dragging their meals into the sea. They make such attacks night after night until the settlement is destroyed or the resistance becomes too fierce, at which point the horde disbands and each karkinoi makes its own way in the sea. While karkinoi can walk on land, they do not enjoy long periods away from the sea, as they dry out, crack, and eventually suffocate. Coastal raids are part of the karkinoi breeding cycle. The corpses that they drag off into the ocean are tethered to masses of eggs, and serve as food for karkinoi spawn. The spawn develop a taste for land-meat and crave it, ensuring the next generation of hungry raiders.",
			"",
			"While karkinoi rarely ally with other creatures, they are easily swayed by aboleths promising destruction and raw power. In return, the aboleths gain expendable, fastbreeding shock troops and guardians. Some scholars believe this race was actually created by aboleths in ancient times, but were later turned loose in the ocean because skum made more reliable slaves than karkinoi brutes."

			"Among the myriad horrors inhabiting the Shackles, a karkinoi brood swarm is one of the most terror-inspiring to behold. The brutish karkinoi reproduce after collecting sufficient meat to feed their offspring, which is usually obtained by raiding coastal settlements. After mating, the female karkinoi lays a mass of eggs in the calm water of a coastal sea cave or sheltered underwater area. The voracious spawn hatch almost simultaneously, instinctively cluster together to form an endlessly ravenous karkinoi brood swarm, and devour all nearby meat. The taste of that first meal imprints itself on the karkinoi spawn, pushing these creatures to become savage marauders when they mature.",
			"",
			"The karkinoi brood mother remains close by her progeny after they hatch, both to educate them and to safeguard them from predators, especially other karkinoi, which have been known to cannibalize karkinoi spawn. Karkinoi spawn mature rapidly, growing larger and aggressively vying for domination over each other. A karkinoi brood swarm's spawn rapidly diminish in number as the stronger members consume the vanquished. Eventually the karkinoi adolescents split up, searching for their own aquatic lairs and ample sources of soft meat."

A creature within range of a keeper's disquieting aura can be affected by its bestow curse spell-like ability from a distance (not only by touch). If a target of the aura has seen the Yellow Sign, it takes a -2 penalty on its saving throws against the aura and the keeper's bestow curse spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Entropic Drain (Ex)** A keeper's use of its energy draining ability can result in a surge of entropy that consumes its body and disrupts life all around it. Every time the keeper's entropic drain attack results in a creature's death, the keeper must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or be destroyed. If the keeper is destroyed, all sentient beings in a 15-foot radius around the keeper gain a negative level (Fortitude DC 17 negates). If any negative level bestowed by a keeper becomes permanent, the victim must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or die after 1 hour of delirium. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)** A keeper of the Yellow Sign is powerless in natural sunlight (though not in an area of daylight or similar spells), and it cannot attack and is staggered. It can use its supernatural and spell-like abilities, but with a 50% failure chance.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Sign Affinity (Su)** When the keeper of the Yellow Sign stays within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours, it gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the {spell/Yellow Sign} spell. If the keeper leaves this range, it loses the bonuses immediately and can regain them only after once more staying within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign is the undead form of a cultist of {faith/Hastur} who willingly sacrificed his soul to rise as his god's servant after death. A quiet but relentless champion of the Unspeakable One, a keeper brings anxiety and woe to the lives of any infidel who comes too close to the secrets of its master. Like a vampire, a keeper can easily pass for a living human, if it so wishes, although it tends to have a pale, unhealthy look and a swollen face that can give away its true nature to those who know what to look for. Feeble and sluggish in the sunlight, a keeper can easily be mistaken for a sickly vagrant or even a leper if seen in the open during the day. In the darkness, however, a keeper grows supernaturally strong and attentive, and its eyes glow with a malignant, yellow luminescence.",
			"",
			"A keeper's primary purpose is to haunt and persecute unbelievers who witness the Yellow Sign or, worse, have a document or item that bears the dreaded symbol, such as a copy of The King in Yellow or another artifact of Hastur's cult. Against these favored victims, the keeper uses {spell/dream} to create a sense of anticipation and awareness of its victim's forthcoming doom. Although a keeper's actions are mainly motivated by a sadistic eagerness to spread pain and misery, the creature can also perform special duties on behalf of a cleric of Hastur, such as slaying her personal enemies or harassing cultists she considers unworthy. These monsters also have an odd, morbid attraction for art in all its forms, favoring bizarre and decadent creations. Since a keeper's energy drain ability can cause its own destruction, one interested in prolonging its own existence uses its touch attack sparingly. Typically, a keeper switches to touch attacks when it faces heavily armored adversaries otherwise difficult to hit, when it is reduced to half hit points (and therefore already facing destruction), or when it simply feels the urge to \"taste\" the energy of a victim, usually one with artistic talent (such as anyone who demonstrates particular skill in the areas of Craft or Perform).",
			"",
			"As undead creatures, keepers of the Yellow Sign do not reproduce, though their existence in a given area can signify the presence of a cult of Hastur. Interacting with such creatures can sometimes influence other followers of the King in Yellow to undergo the transformation ritual and become keepers themselves. Keepers do little to proselytize and do not seek out potential converts to their faith or possible additions to their ranks. Rather, they are singularly focused on preventing evidence or knowledge of Hastur's cult from spreading to unbelievers, pursuing anyone who has seen the Yellow Sign, has an artifact bearing the powerful symbol, or has intimate knowledge of a cult's activities or plans.",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but it nevertheless has an urge to consume the energy of those who show particular talent in the arts. When using its energy draining abilities to sate such a hunger, the keeper typically drops its normally dour demeanor in favor of one of ecstasy and satisfaction, a small hint at Hastur's predilection for decadence and depravity. The keeper generally regains its composure immediately after it is done draining its victim's energy, though in rare cases a keeper might become so enraptured by the experience that it does not stop before its victim dies, thus putting itself in danger of self-destructing as the essence of life drained from its victim overwhelms it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign can be found anywhere there are active cults of Hastur or in ruins where a cult once existed, especially those locations marked by a Yellow Sign. Keepers rarely travel far from the site of their creation, preferring to live reclusive, solitary existences in nearby communities. They seldom congregate with others of their kind, except when multiple keepers serve the same priest of Hastur. The undead retain their memories of life, and those rare independent keepers that share the company of other keepers often knew one another in life-likely they came from the same cult of the Unspeakable One and took part in the same transformation ritual. Despite this connection, however, even paired keepers yearn to be alone with their despair and insanity-wracked thoughts, coming together only for protection from outside threats or to overpower potential targets that are more powerful than a lone keeper could handle.",
			"",
			"In the communities where they reside, keepers are often mistaken for vagrants, mendicants, and diseased beggars. They often sit on unoccupied stoops, on public benches, or in gutters, muttering to themselves for hours on end, all the while watching passersby for indications that their neighbors may have witnessed the Yellow Sign. When offered charitable help by kind souls who encounter them, keepers of the Yellow Sign typically flee rather than risk giving away their true nature, which leads to the common belief that they are simply mad and either unwilling to receive aid or incapable of accepting it. Other times, they take on jobs that the general populace deems unsavory or macabre, such as gravedigger or hearse driver. They can observe potential targets from afar in these roles, lurking in cemeteries or churchyards and turning their unnerving gazes on the targets of their ire.",
			"",
			"By remaining on the fringes of society, however, a keeper of the Yellow Sign can exist unheeded in a single settlement or region for generations, as most residents pay so little attention to it that they fail to notice that the creature never ages or dies. As such, some keepers are old enough to remember past millennia - yet, they are rarely sane enough or willing enough to recount their knowledge to anyone but the most devout and powerful members of Hastur's faith."

An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so.

			"So named for a northern word for \"river,\" a gare linnorm's body resembles that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature's head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through water and ice holes.",
			"",
			"A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years.",
			"",
			"Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins, but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite dwelling in water, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting through rivers and waterways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects prey above. A gare linnorm's breath weapon is similarly linked to this internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature's serpentine body pass water through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en route to the linnorm's mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the water through a series of muscular chambers that turn the water into a gout of steam hot enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between the inside of the linnorm's mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward and, because of the linnorm's magical nature, achieves an almost solid state, hampering movement throughout its area.",
			"",
			"In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm's fangs are infused with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist's fire. Meanwhile the poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing the target's reflexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in.",
			"",
			"Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwater creatures don't provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves when such creatures come to the water's edge to drink or cross. When hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through ice or emerges from the water. It bites first to poison its prey, then strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it into the water, where any creature affected by the linnorm's poison soon drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring another while others burn within the dragon's steaming breath. After feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riverbed dens to sleep, often for days at a time.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Linnorm}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm's territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000 square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead, after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lake or section of river. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard until the water refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it deep in the mud and silt of a riverbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency. Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females producing an egg just once every century.",
			"",
			"Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface of the water. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than the giant's entire clan."

			"",
			"Cunning and brutal, maraxes are far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the planet's most fearsome competitors.",
			"",
			"Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"While they are far from the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability. Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs. Their seasonal migrations create famine in their wakes as they drain a region of fauna, and entire lashunta villages may relocate seasonally to avoid starvation. Maraxes possess only a single lung, and those introduced to alien environments often become extremely irritable due to shortness of breath.",
			"",
			"Maraxes are overwhelmingly carnivorous. The larger, more aggressive females dominate their packs, bringing down prey and eating first. Maraxes have voracious appetites, and will make a meal of almost anything - in lean times the animals turn to carrion, fruit, and in rare cases even soil and stones to sate their voracious appetites.",
			"",
			"Straddling the line between mammal and reptile, maraxes are warm-blooded creatures with resilient bodies. Soft fur covers tough scales across much of a marax's body, while bony knobs protect the head, back, thighs, and tail. A marax's most identifiable feature is its tough dorsal osteoderms that offer protection. They lack forelimbs, and balance instead on a single pair of legs tipped with vicious, scythe-like claws. Their oversized jaws can crush both bone and stone, and larger specimens can even tear through metal armor. A cluster of venomous barbs sprout from the end of a marax's tail, which can inject enough paralytic venom to bring down prey twice the creature's size.",
			"",
			"These statistics represent a typical marax. Various subspecies may be larger or smaller (use the giant creature or young creature simple templates accordingly) and possess a variety of different special abilities. The arctic-dwelling tundrax is smaller, but can hibernate for months beneath the snow and reawaken in moments to pounce upon unsuspecting prey, while females of the bioluminescent ghostback marax possess a resin-producing gland that grants them an ability similar to the web special ability.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Maraxes are found all across Castrovel, but exist primarily in its primeval forests and vast savannas. Dozens of subspecies fill the planet's various ecological niches, and maraxes range from the polar tundra to steaming tropical jungles. Thanks to Castrovel's dramatic tides and powerful weather systems, regular migration is a way of life, and packs can cover hundreds of miles between seasonal hunting grounds. Some subspecies follow staple herds, while others alternate between a variety of environments and diets throughout the year. Most maraxes spend dry seasons stalking small prey in wooded areas or deep in Castrovel's countless hidden valleys, then during wet seasons move onto open savanna to take down larger prey. Wherever they settle for a time, packs use their powerful claws to dig out shallow nests, which shelter a complex ecology of scavengers and opportunistic mammals once the beasts move on.",
			"",
			"Most breeds of maraxes are social animals that form complex hierarchies. They vocalize a variety of chirps, growls, and rasping grunts, and establish relative status with bellowing exchanges that lashunta call \"debates.\" The largest female typically leads the pack, and surrounds herself with the other breeding-age females for hunting and territorial defense. Males and females not of breeding age rely on this matriarch's circle for food, and are expected to groom the hunters and one another for parasites. All members of a pack contribute to marking and defending territory and to scavenging during lean times. The social bonds are knit tight, and packs are more likely to move on to new hunting grounds than drive out members in hard times. An alpha female remains fertile so long as she is well fed, and especially successful matriarchs can grow to enormous sizes and dominate packs of fifty or more, cultivating legends and nicknames among lashunta hunters.",
			"",
			"Non-alpha females breed only two or three litters in a lifetime. Females attract the attention of males using their tail barbs, and engage other females in mock combat to claim the healthiest mates. If a male shows interest, the female bonds her clutch of two to four eggs to his underbelly with a sticky resin. The father becomes incubator and guardian for the next 16 months. Hatchlings are born with soft, flexible back plates, and adults claw and nip at a pup's back to transform the soft cartilage into thick, sturdy osteoderms. The venom both males and females produce in their tails is a complex array of proteins and enzymes that the hatchlings suckle for nourishment during their vulnerable first few days. As one would expect, maraxes are very protective parents; packs will chase kidnappers for miles and tear them apart with an almost gleeful cruelty.",
			"",
			"Thanks to Castrovel's numerous planetary portals, maraxes occasionally migrate to other worlds. A smaller, wheezing variety prowls Akiton's equator, riding the planet's massive dust storms from hunting ground to hunting ground. On Golarion, a few small packs roam Numeria and southern Garund, preying on the megafauna in these locations.",
			"",
			"Among Castrovel's civilizations, capturing or slaying a marax is an impressive achievement. As maraxes' natural weapons can be used to craft vicious daggers, spears, and terbutje, those capable of reliably trapping or hunting the creatures earn impressive fortunes and high prestige.",
			"",
			"Near rural settlements, maraxes stalk domesticated herds for easy meals, and even pick off careless hunters and shepherds without fear. Their hunting tactics are so effective that some lashunta have bred a loyal domesticated subspecies to guard their wilderness settlements from predation. Though ravenous and ill tempered, these tame maraxes are unflaggingly loyal. Druidic sects see the creature as a powerful totem, crafting fetishes from the animal's bones and plates and divining prophecies from packs' seasonal migrations."

			"Natives of Elysium, mederachs are the kind and good counterparts to the bebiliths that lurk in the Abyss and prey upon demonic flesh. Mederachs once spent all of their time on their home plane, serving as healers and teachers to the azatas, angels, titans, and others creatures alongside which they lived; among themselves, mederachs delighted in discussing the nuances of the honest virtues they held in such high esteem, including kindness, charity, and mercy.",
			"",
			"As societies formed on the Material Plane, mederachs heard tales of mortals' changeable morality with interest and concern. Mortals, they came to believe, have souls that are inherently good, but that are also easily corrupted when exposed to prolonged suffering or extraplanar evil forces. During the Age of Darkness, mederachs heard of the various misfortunes and evils that had descended upon the lands of Golarion, including the falling of the Starstone, the collapse of major empires, and the rampages of the nascent demon lord Treerazer. Believing that these events would imperil the souls of all the world's mortals, mederachs began experimenting with plane-shifting; once they honed this ability, they began making regular forays to Golarion to aid good creatures in the fight against overwhelming evil. Now, in addition to embarking on these missions, mederachs also sometimes travel to the source of such evil plots - often the Abyss - and work on mortals' behalf there. However, no matter where their journeys take them, mederachs always keep in mind their belief that most evil can be redeemed, and so they seek to subdue their enemies and turn them toward good whenever possible instead of destroying them outright.",
			"",
			"Mederachs are typically 10 feet tall and weigh about 2,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"On Elysium, mederachs still occasionally serve as teachers and mentors for their native neighbors. In recent millennia, however, they've spent their time at home honing their hunting skills, for their experiences working with virtuous partners on the Material Plane has taught them they must be skilled hunters and combatants if they wish to effectively fight evil. They find plenty of creatures on Elysium willing to participate as the prey in mock hunts. Mederachs rarely remain in Elysium for extended periods, preferring to put their skills to use on the Material Plane or even in the Abyss once they feel comfortable doing so.",
			"",
			"To their credit, mederachs use peaceful methods to subdue their targets whenever they can. However, they have an instinctive, burning hatred for evil arachnid creatures, reserving the greatest enmity for bebiliths, whose malevolence mederachs believe is a mockery of the good they themselves try so ardently to accomplish. They also have no qualms about destroying unintelligent evil creatures, especially mindless undead, reasoning that these monsters serve as mere shells for the forces of evil and deserve no quarter.",
			"",
			"Mederachs hunt like typical web-spinning spiders, leaving a nigh-invisible web in the path of potential targets. They often elect to deal nonlethal damage to foes they think they can reach through dialog. During combat with such foes, they relate grand tales of supposedly irredeemable tyrants who saw the error of their ways and became benign rulers.",
			"",
			"Mederachs acquired the ability to change their appearance, which they use when they travel among those who might fear their true forms, or who might mistake them for evil bebiliths. Although they can change shape into many types of animals, they tend to choose familiar forms, such as horses with golden manes or riding dogs with golden coats. Their arachnid nature subtly manifests while they're in alternate forms, usually represented by eight toes on each paw, or scarlet dots on their heads representing extra eyes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Around others of their kind, mederachs are especially conversational and friendly; a convening of mederachs is often a talkative and somewhat disorderly, if polite, affair. They enjoy relating tales of their journeys to other planes and of creatures they have turned from evil or, regrettably, destroyed. Mederachs also enjoy discussing intricate web patterns based on designs they have witnessed in the stars or on other planes. They establish no formal hierarchy among themselves and regard each other as equals.",
			"",
			"Mederachs' egalitarianism extends to their fellow good-aligned outsiders. Of course, they have their own biases and preferences regarding such creatures. They view many lawful good outsiders, especially archons, as too rigid in their pursuit of righteousness. Archons, on the other hand, view mederachs as powerful but overly idealistic and optimistic fighters. The lawful good celestials still seek alliances with mederachs, however, when doing so would benefit their plans. Mederachs are usually open to such offers, but these collaborations tend to dissolve quickly once the creatures achieve their mutual goal.",
			"",
			"Mederachs find many neutral good outsiders to be eminently helpful when the need arises; in their own pursuit of good, agathions in particular are open to assisting mederachs with non-violent plans. When agathions embark on ambassadorial missions to other planes, mederachs often accompany them, both to further their own schemes and to cement the friendships they often have with their allies. Mederachs also frequently work with angels, although when they do, it usually involves the angels intimidating the powerful evil creatures mederachs hope to turn to good. Of course, their angel allies tend to have their own inscrutable aims in mind when they go along with mederachs' plans, which can sometimes lead to minor discord between the celestials.",
			"",
			"Of all the other good outsiders, mederachs have the most in common with azatas, who are also natives of Elysium. While azatas can be aimless in their pursuit of championing good wherever they tread, mederachs are more focused architects of such plans, and so the two make excellent partners in many situations. In such relationships, the strong-willed azatas may insist on taking the lead when carrying out plans or suddenly change their minds about the best ways to achieve the partnership's collective goals. Yet they are surprisingly willing to admit their errors in judgment or personality flaws, leading to friendships and partnerships that rarely truly sour despite minor setbacks. Beyond threatening one of their own, the best way to truly rile mederachs is to harm their azata companions."

Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conflicts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.",

Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings.",
			"",
			"All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner - at least until she grows tired of his company."

			"",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In a world with powerful spells, silent monsters, and a long history that can often affect the present in unexpected ways, death - even mass death - can sometimes come as a surprise. While souls may move on, the sudden feelings of loss and confusion can be left in the world as psychic imprints, and if enough of those feelings exist in one place, they can combine into a melacage. A melacage stays near the place where it formed, trying to transfer its crippling depression to a living creature so that it can become corporeal and investigate the cause of its death.",
			"",
			"An average melacage is around 2 feet in diameter, with four to five humanoid faces on the outside of its body.",
			"",
			"Melacages are usually created in the aftermath of a great, tragic event. This could be anything from the collateral damage of a wizard's duel to a group of subterranean monsters causing lethal tremors and a sudden sinkhole. Whatever that event, it often has these two qualities: it affected a large group of people at once, and that group of people had little to no warning that it was coming.",
			"",
			"Because a melacage is created by lingering emotions and not souls, the number of deaths that it takes to create one of these creatures can vary from one melacage to another. Sometimes the psychic imprint of an entire village will come together to form one melacage, while other times it takes only two or three sudden deaths. A major factor in the creation of melacages comes from the victims' outlook on life while they were alive; a group of happy-go-lucky, optimistic people might be devastated by their sudden deaths and form many melacages, whereas a group of down-on-their-luck folk who were barely scraping by might barely form one. [Gnomes](race/gnome) in particular are vulnerable to forming melacages, as their whimsical nature and vivacious lifestyles can make their unexpected deaths all the more traumatic, though gnomes who have survived the Bleaching almost never form part of a melacage.",
			"",
			"The fact that melacages are formed from lingering emotions and not souls also causes trouble for necromancers who try to create them. Since most spells focus on a corpse or a soul, it is hard to find a spell that targets the essences required to create a melacage; while it can be hard to covertly find the appropriate corpses necessary for casting {spell/animate dead}, it can be even harder to quietly kill a large number of people in an unexpected and sudden way. These circumstances mean that academic work on creating melacages is severely lacking and advanced only by unscrupulous professors' side projects.",
			"",
			"The faces of a melacage reflect those who provided the emotions that formed it, although in the case of a melacage created by the confusion and sorrow of a large number of people, the faces are often amalgams of the originals. Bits and pieces of the original creatures' memories remain, mostly having to do with what the creatures were doing when they died. When accessing an individual person's memories, the melacage rotates so this particular face is showing, which can lead to a dizzying discussion if the melacage tries to access multiple different memories at once.",
			"",
			"A melacage that becomes corporeal falls onto the ground with a sickening splat as it simultaneously loses the ability to fly and gains real skin. Such a melacage is reduced to rolling around on the ground to move, and it must attack with its mouths instead of using its incorporeal essence to drain the vitality from other creatures. Despite being brought to the ground, melacages maintain much of the speed they had in their incorporeal forms, and they are able to quickly roll after any victims who try to escape.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Melacages are only as common as the events that create them, which means they tend to be fairly rare. Melacages can show up anywhere, but they form mostly in urban environments. Due to their connections with great tragedies, often the places where they reside are ruined and abandoned.",
			"",
			"Melacages cannot recall the events that lead to their creation, and they cannot rest until they know the reason for their being, yet they are often prevented from investigating their deaths by their own melancholy and despair. This means that their first priority is to find something or someone else to host their overpowering emotions. This has the dual benefits of allowing them to mentally focus on their investigations and allowing them to become corporeal and therefore able to move physical objects in their quests. However, the necessary proximity to the new host of their depression and the damage their emotions inflict upon that creature can lead to misunderstandings of the melacage's intentions, so such attempts often end in violence.",
			"",
			"While a melacage doesn't mind working with people who are investigating its death, its tumultuous and misery-stricken mind can often cause it to become confused as to who is actually helping and who is causing it harm. If a melacage is able to transfer its misery to someone else, the melacage usually becomes easier to reason with. Removing a melacage's anguish can also help people who have figured out the cause of its deaths and are trying to convince it they have discovered the truth, as the emotional shock of discovery makes it difficult for the melacage to make sense of what anyone tells it, and it often denies that such stories could possibly be true.",
			"",
			"Due to their tendency to live in isolated areas, melacages are only rarely reported, usually after adventurers have already removed them. There have been some strange rumors coming out of Nirmathas, however, of a village where melacages seem to be forming for no reason. Given the villagers' preparations for Molthuni aggression, they've so far been able to take care of the melacages with minimal harm to themselves, but they remain flummoxed as to why the undead creatures are being created in the first place. The village is offering a sizable reward for anyone who can figure out the cause and deal with the situation permanently. Current theories point to an underground city that befell tragedy, but no one has been able to locate it."

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the Melfesh Monster while it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, feystricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories.",
			"",
			"The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror.",
			"",
			"Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby [Hellknights](rule/aff_lawknights)) to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster - usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns.",
			"",
			"To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identified (just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inflated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster.",
			"",
			"Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster - or even the monster itself - has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past."

A creature that takes any amount of Intelligence damage from a merlucent polyp can breathe while underwater, but loses the ability to breathe air. If a humanoid creature takes ability damage in excess of its Intelligence score, it transforms into a new merlucent, losing all abilities or class levels it previously possessed. The polyp can be destroyed by any effect that removes disease, but the inability to breathe air persists until a creature's Intelligence damage is healed.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Merlucents are strange creatures formed from the fusion of human and jellyfish. As a species, they are simple-minded ascetics. Individual clans claim small stretches of coastline where they hunt fish and shellfish, and scratch strange glyphs into coral, coaxing it to grow in unnatural though beautiful formations. Naturally sensitive to arcane energy, they settle in locations rife with ambient magic, such as along ley lines or near schools of magic built on islands or coasts. Local communities generally consider merlucents to be pests for stripping fishing grounds bare, but the aberrations also keep more aggressive aquatic threats away. This small blessing turns bane every 2 to 5 years when merlucents enter their mating phase and become extremely aggressive.",
			"",
			"To reproduce, each merlucent spawns dozens of ant-sized polyps, each of which must mature inside the skull of a humanoid host. Depending on the host, it can take anywhere from days to weeks for the tiny parasite to take over its host's mind and convert the bony, flesh-covered body into its own adult form. To support their children, merlucents conduct fanatical crusades, kidnapping surface dwellers to act as incubators. Relying on its members' stealth and paralytic poison, a single clan may snatch dozens of unwary sailors or coastal residents in a single season.",
			"",
			"Merlucents range from 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh around 180 pounds, though smaller or larger specimens may be spawned depending on the size of the host.",
			"",
			"A merlucent's natural ability to sniff out and reproduce arcane magic - as well as its dependence on humanoids to reproduce - is suggestive of unnatural origins, though none of Golarion's usual culprits known for creating grotesque hybrids have ever been associated with the jellyfish-folk. Merlucents prefer kidnapping arcane spellcasters to host their young, even though they can spawn in any humanoid and their young rarely inherit a host's spellcasting ability. They also show little interest in the flavor of magic their targets wield. Merlucents were likely an accidental creation, spawned at some unknown point in the past - a grim reminder that magic remains a powerful force beyond any creature's complete control, and its use may produce unexpected consequences.",
			"",
			"Merlucents are carnivores, eating fish, shellfish, and the occasional seabird-with their translucent skin exposing the digestive process for any to see. They have no need for sleep; instead, they tend to drift with the currents, waiting for small fish to swim into their tentacles. They can wait weeks between meals, and ride the tides for hundreds of miles in a state of torpor. However, they can also become ravenous and deplete entire coves in a matter of days.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Merlucents have little in the way of religion or philosophy, and focus primarily on eating and creating art until the mating frenzy consumes them. Long-established colonies may shape coral reefs into elaborate cave systems over generations, complete with air pockets where they keep captives until the colony is ready to implant them with polyps. While merlucents understand other humanoids to be intelligent, they see them as alien and needlessly complex: more akin to termites than neighbors. On rare occasions, merlucents trade with surface dwellers, offering fish, reconnaissance, and scavenged goods in exchange for magic baubles. They rarely use these acquired treasures, instead working them into their ever-expanding coral formations. Merlucents can eventually come to see long-time surface neighbors as beloved pets or a private herd, and show affection by nurturing barnacles to grow on docks and boats to keep the waters clean, or dragging the bloated carcasses of large sea animals to shore for their pets to eat.",
			"",
			"To merlucents' alien senses, magical auras twinkle like soft music or pleasant lights. They treasure potions or wands as humans might treasure music boxes or other delicate trinkets, and they see arcane spellcasters as itinerant performers. Thanks to merlucents' fascination with magic, several clans may follow or worship particularly powerful aquatic wizards and sorcerers, but such aggregations rarely outlast the group's leader.",
			"",
			"After a merlucent rears an indeterminate number of young, a strange new instinct takes over its mind, calling it down into the deepest ocean trenches. These elders form large colonies-sometimes a hundred strong-around thermal vents on the ocean floor. Here, they rear massive schools of jellyfish and cultivate farms of tube worms in vast, swirling formations. Elder merlucents show little interest in eating their livestock, but aggressively defend their colonies against intruders. They become especially aggressive toward deep merfolk, with whom they fight constantly for control of the richest vents. Rather than implanting their young into captive merfolk, merlucents instead hurl their unfortunate enemies into the sea floor's boiling fissures, cooking them alive."

			"**Morphic Body (Su)** As a standard action, a mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtype: the body assumed must be solid). This ability affects only the mezlan's outward image. Its creature type doesn't change in this new form; it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities, and it retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. This is a polymorph effect.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Weapons (Su)** A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage. Morphic weapons deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its morphic weapons. A mezlan can also attack with a morphic weapon by hurling a portion of its body as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 60 feet (the mezlan swiftly regrows thrown portions of its body after using this attack, while the hurled portion melts away into slime after dealing damage to a target).",
			"",
			"**Skill Pool (Ex)** A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus to any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in and skills that can only be used trained. A mezlan can use any skill, even those that would normally require it to be trained.",
			"",
			"**Store Spells (Sp)** A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the same casting time as the original spell, and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use arcane, divine, and psychic spells, and can carry spells from any number of casters at a given time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan as if storing a spell in an item like a ring of spell storing. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell, choose to lower its spell resistance, and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells can't be absorbed. If a mezlan already holds 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more spells, and any spell of a level exceeding a mezlan's available spell level is not absorbed and affects the mezlan normally. Once a spell is absorbed in this manner, the mezlan can use the spell as its own.",
			"",
			"**Versatile Speech (Ex)** A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Built by ancient arcanists and engineers to serve as spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of those ancient civilizations, close to 1,500 mezlans were created. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day.",
			"",
			"Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even more strange by the fact that they have unique, previously human personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract agreeing to serve as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didn't take, resulting in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Indications of these flaws didn't always reveal themselves before the creatures were deployed, and many such mezlans abandoned their missions to pursue their own mysterious agendas.",
			"",
			"Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them had martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an amorphous form and near immortality.",
			"",
			"Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 negative levels. These negative levels are removed at a rate of 1 per month.",
			"",
			"Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from their previous incorporation, and others never fully recall their previous selves. A mezlan that retains its living memories typically has several class levels, although it should be noted that not all skills and abilities humanoids have in life translate directly to life as a shapeshifting ooze. One notable exception is a mezlan's morphic weapons. While these attacks are natural weapons and a mezlan thus cannot gain iterative attacks, a mezlan who has feats or class abilities that bolster specific weapons can apply the effects of those feats or abilities to its morphic weapons, provided the weapons are of the right shape. For example, a mezlan with {feat/Weapon Focus} (longsword) would gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with its morphic weapon attacks when they are in the shape of a longsword. This limits the damage type dealt by the morphic weapon to a damage type appropriate to the weapon being duplicated.",
			"",
			"From all appearances, mezlans seem to get along well with each other; however, to normal, living creatures, they often appear strange and unnatural in both form and behavior. They are very observant creatures that study everything they encounter, especially animals and humanoids - a frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use it as a default. Others keep dozens of regular guises and take on the ones most appropriate for particular duties they need to complete, using appearances and personalities as tools throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different shapes.",
			"",
			"### Becoming a Mezlan",
			"",
			"Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings-each is a marriage of transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, rather than any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands more of them. The sheer volume of rare metals needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth. The complex and expensive method for creating a mezlan has long been lost, but rumors hold that one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its kind. Other tales suggest that the ritual of creation survives to this day in a long-lost repository of ancient knowledge hidden deep under the ocean."

Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deific curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet.",
			"",
			"The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baffle and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.",

Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master.",

This loyalty, coupled with vile rituals whispered by their patrons, bound the guardians' souls to the iron of their armor and resurrected them as twisted, ageless defenders. The same sense of commitment that enabled the guardians' transformation also shackles them to their labyrinthine territories. This stunts the guardians' dreams of expansion, limiting them to steadily adding on to their sprawling, confusing complexes. Over time, the legend of an ancient labyrinth guardian often exceeds that of the maze's original treasure.",

			"**Bronze Mask (Su)** A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.",
			"",
			"**Natural Cunning (Ex)** Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.",
			"",
			"**Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex)** A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet. They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive, tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent guardians of Baphomet's bewildering maze of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth. Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs resemble their mortal counterparts, as each has the form of a massive, burly humanoid with thick fur on the chest and legs and a horned, bovine head. The hairless skin of a labyrinth minotaur's head is thin and stretched so tightly over the bone that the beast appears to have just a skull atop its neck. This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets.",
			"",
			"Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, \"How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye\"?).",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation: each is mystically connected to its mask.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.",
			"",
			"When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare - even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind."

Marauders also skirmish with other monstrous inhabitants of their rocky badlands - especially harpies and centaurs, for whom they hold a legendary hatred - to claim the best land, lairs, and water sources.",

			"",
			"Marauders show a keener mind for tactics than do many of their kin. While they still prefer to finish enemies off with a gorespattering axe blow, they see nothing wrong with first softening up opponents from a distance with a bow or a few well-placed traps. They can control their aggression well enough to benefit from hit-and-run tactics, charging an overwhelming force before falling back to lure their enemy into an ambush, a rockslide, or - in the case of flying pests like harpies - nets. Thanks to their varied responsibilities and opponents, marauders train until they achieve incredible skill with both axes and bows. They make the most of the labyrinthine caverns and twisting canyons of their domains to confuse and separate foolish enemies who press into their lands.",

			"Weaker than many of their brutish kin, tangle tenders instead apply their racial cunning and understanding of complex systems to mechanical devices, constructing ingenious traps that whittle away those lost in the labyrinths with little or no direct danger to themselves. They build and reset traps, alter or conceal carefully whatever trails their victims attempt to leave, and strike from the shadows only once their victims are desperate, exhausted, and at each others' throats. Their tactics aren't motivated by cowardice; rather, these cruel creators love to inflict misery by outwitting their enemies rather than out-muscling them. Tangle tenders belong to the maze; they are intimately familiar with every twist and turn, and are keen to introduce interlopers to each in turn. Among minotaur tribes, tangle tenders hold a strange position, both necessary and loathed. They never shy away from bragging about their genius, and their kin recognize the value of a tangle tender's devices for trapping prey. But minotaurs respect strength, courage, and aggression first and foremost, and these clever rogues excel at none of those qualities-most thus see these trapsmiths as socially stunted, needlessly sadistic (even by minotaur standards), and physically weak to the point of embarrassment. Few voice these opinions, however, as those who do frequently face tragic accidents deep within the maze."

			"**Ley-Line Dependent (Su)** Deep nagas draw their power from ley lines deep underground. While attuned to a ley line, a deep naga gains an additional +1 bonus to its effective caster level, increasing the maximum bonus possible from a ley line to +6. If the deep naga is more than 100 feet from its attuned ley line or its attunement is broken for any reason, the deep naga takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level of the ley line, cannot use its breath weapon, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) in order to cast spells until it attunes itself to a new ley line or its attunement to its previous ley line is restored.",
			"",
			"**Magical Disruption (Su)** A deep naga's bite and breath weapon have powerful dispelling effects. A creature that takes damage from either attack has any ongoing spell effects on it disrupted as though targeted by a dispel magic spell (CL 11th).",
			"",
			"**Spell Siphon (Su)** A deep naga draws magical energy from its surroundings. Any spell that fails to penetrate the naga's spell resistance is absorbed. Once per round, as an immediate action while absorbing a spell in such a manner, the deep naga can decrease the time until it can use its breath weapon by 1 round, attempt a new saving throw against an ongoing magical effect, or regain a spell slot of a level equal to or lower than the level of the absorbed spell.",
			"",
			"**Spells (Sp)** A deep naga casts spells as per an 11th-level sorcerer and can cast spells from the druid list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Druid spells are considered arcane spells for a deep naga.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"More bestial than their surface cousins, deep nagas jealously guard their lairs in the lightless depths of the Darklands. Deep nagas live near ley lines and other places of power because they hunger for magical energy, which they are able to siphon from their surroundings. Their volatile natures make them dangerous to deal with, but creatures who manage to appease them can earn safety within their territory. Most deep nagas measure 40 feet in length and weigh 1,800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Some deep nagas are infused from birth with energy native to another plane of existence. These variant deep nagas replace their breath weapon damage with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or negative energy. They set up lairs in places where the borders between planes are thin rather than along ley lines, and their appearances often reflect the influence of those elemental planes.",
			"",
			"The chitinous scales that cover deep nagas' serpentine bodies are reminiscent of the dark purple plates that protect purple worms. Their heads resemble those of giant, androgynous humanoids, with wide mouths filled with multiple rows of sharp fangs. Though deep nagas enjoy eating flesh, they are obsessed with the magical energy they absorb. They are able to sustain themselves in hibernation on nothing but magical energy when sources of meat are sparse, but deep nagas have a fixation on magic that goes beyond mere survival and is more akin to an addiction. What deep nagas lack in sophistication compared to the innate magic of their surface cousins, they make up for in raw power.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas that reside in places of great magical power are able to extend their lifespans to centuries and beyond, and even their reproduction cycles are tied to magical energy. Once adult deep nagas have found a place with a steady flow of magic, they are able reproduce asexually, laying anywhere from one to three large eggs every few years.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Naga}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Deep nagas can be found throughout the Darklands, from the deepest Vaults of Orv to the uppermost reaches of Nar-Voth. Wherever magical energy runs strongest along ancient ley lines, deep nagas make their isolated lairs and protect them with a fervor unmatched by other naga species. Deep nagas tend to be solitary creatures in the upper layers of the Darklands, where they are rarer and surrounded by races like the dark folk, derros, drow, and duergar. These nagas even drive out their progeny as soon they can fend for themselves, so that the offspring won't wrest the lair from their parent as they grow in power. Deep nagas of Orv form nests in ancient sites of power, with the founding deep naga lording over several generations of her progeny, the number depending on her age - though even in Orv, the strong drive out the weak if the number of deep nagas grows too high for the lair to sustain.",
			"",
			"Solitary deep nagas and smaller nests are more likely to allow tribes of troglodytes, skum, or degenerate serpentfolk to live in their territory for mutual benefit. These tribes tend to treat deep nagas as fickle, godlike creatures who are dangerous but offer protection to those that placate them, for the nagas are extremely hostile toward intruders within their territory. Treating with deep nagas usually falls to the shamans of the tribes, and some tribes have even formed cults that worship the creatures. These tribes bring offerings of flesh and magic to deep nagas who share their territory with the tribe. The nagas especially enjoy the flesh of magic users, which makes dealing with them even more dangerous for the shamans. If a naga is in a bad mood, the head shaman might be tempted to send an apprentice in his place because - as the tribal lore teaches - a great serpent that has feasted is easier to deal with. Ever paranoid, a deep naga is never too far from turning on a tribe that worships her if given a reason, imagined or real. If creatures of another race aren't useful to the deep naga, they are treated as food or threats to be extinguished.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas are very particular about and protective of their lairs. They exert a substantial effort to find one that suits their needs, so they don't give them up without a fight. Unless the source of magic depletes or they are driven out by a more powerful deep naga, they rarely abandon their lairs. However, if a deep naga learns of an even more potent magical site, she might try to conquer this new lair for herself. Deep nagas do not usually care what tribes that serve them do, as long as the offerings keep coming, but they might push the tribes to conquer a superior place for a lair."

Even after these dreamers awaken, the sight of these beautiful creatures remains ingrained in their minds. Many cultures consider seeing a dream naga a sign of a special destiny. But when a dreaming creature gains the full attention of a dream naga, it is no mere chance encounter. For convoluted and arcane reasons that only they truly understand, dream nagas enter dreams and interact with the sleepers-sometimes relaying knowledge to the sleepers, and other times tormenting them. Such dream encounters often don't make sense to the dreaming creature until some point far in the future, if ever.",

A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries.

Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.",
			"",
			"As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs - usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes - often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.",

			"**Construction Points (Ex)** Necrocrafts have a number of Construction Points (CP) used to purchase abilities and defenses. A Medium necrocraft has 2 CP; differently sized necrocrafts have CP totals as detailed on the size chart below. If a necrocraft is built with more CP than its size category would allow, its CR increases by 1 (minimum of +1) for every 2 additional CP spent. Unless otherwise stated, each of these abilities can be purchased only once. The stats presented here are for a Medium necrocraft (with 2 CP spent on additional movement [fly] and extra attack [bite]).",
			"",
			"- Additional Movement (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains a new mode of movement (burrow, climb, fly [clumsy], or swim) at a speed equal to its base speed.",
			"- All-Around Vision (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has an additional head facing in the opposite direction from its main head, or has extra eyes grafted at various points around its body. The necrocraft gains all-around vision.",
			"- Blade Fists (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's claw attacks are replaced with sharpened bones or metal blades. These attacks deal 1d4 points of bleed damage. This ability can be selected multiple times, applying it to more claw attacks.",
			"- Bone Armor (Ex, 1 CP): Fortified with extra bone (perhaps including bones fused to its outer surface like armor), the necrocraft increases its natural armor bonus by 2. This ability can be selected up to three times.",
			"- Cannibalize (Ex, 1 CP): If the necrocraft is left near the corpse of a Medium or larger creature with discernible anatomy, it eats the corpse or tears off parts to repair its own substance. An undead creature consumed in this fashion heals the necrocraft 5 hit points plus 5 hit points per size category above Medium; any other type of creature restores only 1/5 this amount. Feeding takes 1 hour; any interruption (such as combat) requires it to start again.",
			"- Constrict (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's claw attacks gain the constrict ability. It must have grab before this ability can be selected.",
			"- Disease (Su, 1 CP): One of the necrocraft's natural attacks is grafted with ghoul mouthparts, exposing a creature it hits to ghoul fever. *Ghoul Fever: Bite, claw, or slam-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Con damage and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.* The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects. A humanoid of 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.",
			"",
			"- Extra Attack (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains an additional bite attack or claw attack. This ability can be selected multiple times.",
			"- Extra Legs (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains two more legs, increasing its base speed by 5 feet and increasing its CMD against overrun and trip attempts by 4. This ability can be selected multiple times.",
			"- Extra Strength (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's Strength increases by 2 but its Dexterity decreases by 2. This ability can be selected twice.",
			"- Faster (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft's base, burrow, climb, fly, or swim speed increases by 10 ft.",
			"- Grab (Ex, 1 CP): The necrocraft gains the grab ability with its natural attacks.",
			"- Metal Armor (Ex, 2 CP): Metal plates are bolted to or fused with the necrocraft, serving as armor and granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC.",
			"- Mostly Skeletons (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from undead skeletons. The necrocraft gains DR 5/bludgeoning and resist cold 5. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly zombies ability.",
			"- Mostly Zombies (Ex, 1 CP): Most of the necrocraft's parts come from zombies. The necrocraft gains DR 5/slashing and 5 additional hit points. This ability can't be added to a necrocraft with the mostly skeletons ability.",
			"- Paralysis (Su, 2 CP): Up to three of necrocraft's natural attacks gain the paralysis ability (1d4+1 rounds, DC 13, elves are immune to this effect). This graft requires the body of at least 1 ghoul. For an additional Construction Point, the paralysis ability can affect elves.",
			"- Reach Attacks (Ex, 1 CP): Up to two of the necrocraft's natural attacks increase their natural reach by 5 feet. This ability can be selected multiple times.",
			"- Rending Claws (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the rend ability, activating when both claws hit and dealing additional damage equal to the damage dice for one claw plus 1-1/2 times the necrocraft's Strength bonus.",
			"- Rotting Flesh (Ex, 2 CP): Two of the necrocraft's bite or claw attacks are poisonous. *Poison: bite or claw-injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d3 Constitution damage; cure 1 save.*",
			"- Stench (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft has the {umr/stench} ability (10-foot radius, Fort DC 15 negates, sickened for 1d6+4 minutes). This graft requires the body of at least one ghoul.",
			"- Trample (Ex, 2 CP): The necrocraft gains the {umr/trample} universal monster ability as a special attack.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A necrocraft is a medley of undead body parts and corpses grafted together with dark magic to create a single animated undead creature with abilities based on its component pieces and the surgical and necromantic talents of its creator. Necrocrafts are better suited for brute force than delicate manipulation, and most creators build larger hulks rather than smaller, more agile (and fragile) necrocrafts. Though necrocrafts can be of virtually any size and can be made up of undead bodies or parts of any size, a typical Medium specimen is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"The details of the ritual to create a necrocraft vary greatly, and depend on the particular undead parts used and the intended size of the resulting creature. The final anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master's artistry, creativity, and personal preferences - as well as any specific goals it has in mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft's \"teeth\" could actually be dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its chest rather than in a distinct head.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"In order to create a necrocraft, a spellcaster must use at least five undead creatures (or their corpses), all of which must be under the creator's control, helpless, or slain. A larger undead or corpse can be used in place of two that are one size smaller. The creator must stitch, glue, or otherwise bind the parts together in the desired configuration, then cast animate dead and make whole to complete the construction (the material component cost of animate dead is 50 gp per Hit Die of the final necrocraft). The creator can't create a necrocraft with more Hit Dice than her caster level. As with animate dead, the necrocraft is under the creator's control when created. Note that creating a necrocraft requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor.",

In certain areas, the necrophidius is commonly employed as an assassin, able to disable its quarries with its dance of death or paralyzing bite before disposing of them in a gruesome manner - as long as the assassination doesn't require any particular intelligence to carry out. Particularly macabre creators might even construct the creature from the skull of a friend or loved one of the intended victim in order to magnify the horror of the assassination, leaving much of the flesh on the skull so the victim can recognize its source. This flesh rots eventually-only freshly crafted necrophidiuses have this grisly feature (although regular applications of gentle repose spells can keep such a morbid decoration fresh for a much longer period of time).",
