In areas without such features to hide among, a roper can compress its body into a much more squat, boulder-like shape. The strands it extrudes are not flesh but a thick, semi-liquid material similar to partially melted wax but with the strength of an iron chain and the ability to numb flesh and sap strength. The roper can manipulate these strands with great finesse, and can fling them as far as 50 feet to snatch objects that attract its attention.",

Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the finer points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, a roper's appetite always wins out over its intellectual curiosity - especially in cases where pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper's wits and patience.",

			"Rot grubs are nauseating parasites that feed on flesh and use corpses as nests in which to grow. While a rot grub can derive nourishment from dead flesh, its true hunger is for the flesh of the living-live flesh greatly accelerates a rot grub's growth to adulthood. A grub with only a corpse to feed on can take weeks to complete its transformation into the short-lived, skittering, yellow-orange arachnid that is its adult form, but a grub that finds living prey gnaws its way through the body and gorges on live flesh, then nests in the resulting corpse and grows to adulthood in a matter of hours. An adult rot grub lives for only a few hours-long enough for it to lay dozens of eggs within the body of its old host before it dies. The new grubs that hatch grow slowly unless a new host wanders by.",

When this occurs - after the grubs have finally skeletonized their host - they erupt and seethe across the ground, a hideous carpet of pale flesh that, unlike smaller groups of rot grubs, actively seeks out living flesh to consume. Once formed, a rot grub swarm is self-sustaining; the vermin quickly devour creatures they slay and move on. When individual grubs mature in a swarm, they are quickly eaten by those grubs yet to achieve adulthood.",

			"Swarms of rot grubs are single-minded in their purpose, and know only hunger. They are voracious, and never stop moving or pursuing flesh that can be eaten. As long as consumable flesh exists, they replenish their numbers at a speed such that they never need to stop to rest. Swarms of rot grubs have been known to cross vast expanses of land like flesh-eating floods, consuming all living creatures that they happen to encounter. These menaces arise most frequently in warm, moist environs, but prove tenacious and might be found in nearly any unfrozen clime.",

Since the creatures spend most of their time buried underground, their pale, nearly transparent skin is cool and clammy to the touch. Shalkeshkas feed on whatever creatures are unfortunate enough to tread the ground above them while they nest in the earth below. When fighting, a shalkeshka viciously grapples its victim with its mandibles, shredding its prey to pieces with its claws.",

This serves the creatures well in the lands of northern Garund, where desert travelers are few and far between and the harsh sun and unforgiving terrain keep roaming fauna to a minimum. While burrowed, a shalkeshka can enter a state of hibernation wherein it can sustain itself by absorbing minerals from the soil. A shalkeshka absorbs nutrients through the tufts of hair distributed across its long body, each of which is capable of leeching valuable sustenance from the very ground. This method of feeding can sustain a shalkeshka for extended periods of time-anywhere from a few hours to weeks, or even years-without the need to hunt. A shalkeshka breaks its hibernation only when it senses prey or during the rare times it succumbs to the urge to reproduce.",

Its compound eyes provide it with excellent vision, and the third eye on the center of its forehead enables it to see in even the darkest of lighting conditions. Its enhanced senses ensure that a shalkeshka remains a constant threat to those who intrude on its territory, regardless of time of day or whether its prey is above or below ground.",

When it encounters groups of prey while hunting, a shalkeshka burrows beneath the ground to stealthily follow them until a member splits off from the group. The shalkeshka then emerges, grabs the straggler, and dives back into the sand to devour its newly acquired meal. If unable to snag its target, a shalkeshka remains above ground until it has subdued or slain its prey. They are powerful creatures, but lack the intelligence to make strong tactical decisions when it comes to engaging a target. However, if the tide of battle turns against a shalkeshka, it doesn't hesitate to burrow away to safety.",

Shalkeshkas experience periods of fertility only a few times in their lives, during which they lay their eggs in hidden tunnels in the desert. Shalkeshkas stay near their eggs during the yearlong incubation period, sometimes even letting prey pass by untouched in order to conceal the eggs' location. In rare circumstances, however, a pair of shalkeshkas that are both about to lay their eggs will tolerate each other's presence, instinctually recognizing the need for extra defense during the process. Such mutual defenses are dangerous for other intruders in the region, as the two shalkeshkas can then work together to bring down larger prey.",
			"",
			"Once the young hatch, they emerge from their leathery eggs in a larval stage that lasts for a year, culminating in a cocoon stage. During their larva stage, shalkeshkas subsist solely on nutrients in the soil as their mature mouthparts have yet to form. Shalkeshkas feel little kinship with their broodmates and soon begin splitting off from the group. As the cocoon stage nears, the parent shalkeshkas leave the area, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Any shalkeshkas still living in close proximity to their broodmates when they reach adulthood often cannibalize their siblings in great burrowing clashes until only one or two shalkeshkas hunt in the immediate vicinity.",

			"Many wandering shalkeshkas travel throughout the great deserts of Osirion, stopping only once they have claimed a lush territory for themselves. Though they can live in the deepest desert, shalkeshkas prefer territory with a source of water, for prey is more plentiful there, and while lying in wait enjoy the abundant nutrients in the soil; the creatures are notorious for setting ambushes near riverbanks or in oases. A single small oasis can sustain a shalkeshka for its entire life.",
			"",
			"When adult shalkeshkas encounter each other, violence soon follows. A shalkeshka that has claimed a territory defends it to the death against intruding shalkeshkas seeking to claim it; these vicious fights often leave both opponents injured. Shalkeshkas also frequently battle ankhegs, as they often share similar environments. Many a caravan has had to alter its path after happening upon a clash between these two burrowing beasts.",
			"",
			"These are not the only times a desert caravan must be watchful of shalkeshkas. The creatures grow most aggressive when far from fertile soil, and a train of packed camels and their riders driving across the desert serves as an enticing meal for shalkeshkas in nutrientpoor lands. These attacks inspired the Osirian saying \"claimed by the shalkeshka,\" which is used to describe someone who has gone suddenly missing or a caravan contract that never pans out."

It then uses the intense cold generated from this heat absorption to trap its prey. A shasalqu is 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs about 40 pounds.",

This could account for shasalqus' ability to sap heat from their surroundings even after they die. Because of their sandy environs and the drops of water that melt off their icy ridges, shasalqus' bodies are often caked in a layer of gritty mud. Motionless shasalqus are often mistaken for rocks or small muddy clumps from a distance - a mistake desert travelers quickly come to regret.",
			"",
			"Shasalqus who settle near oases make their lairs far enough away to escape immediate notice, allowing them to sneak up on drinking or bathing creatures and then retreat to their lairs with little risk. Shasalqus that find a trade route within their territory also digs lairs far enough away to prey on travelers without betraying their presence.",
			"",
			"Regardless of their locations, shasalqu lairs are often extremely damp since the desert's heat melts the accumulated ice that crusts on the creatures' hides. This makes shasalqu lairs breeding grounds for a variety of mosses and plants, especially those that can withstand colder temperatures. These tiny oases rapidly become too mossy and cool for shasalqus, forcing them to leave in search of new dens. Shasalqus frequently keep multiple dens within their territory and rotate between them."

These constructs often serve aboleths, skum, faceless stalkers, and cults of dominated humanoids as guardians, particularly of captured prisoners or other living victims. Unlike constructs whose traditions are mired in humanoid magical tradition, the typical shell sentinel appears more like a streamlined froglike creature with flippers instead of feet and a set of four talons on stalks in place of a head. A shell sentinel is composed entirely of razor-sharp shells, and the binding matrix that holds its form together and gives it its rudimentary but foultempered intelligence is a slithery black sludge distilled from the rotted flesh of unwanted slaves. The methods of extracting and preparing this slime requires living victims, and the decidedly painful and vile rendering process not only poisons the resulting construct's personality with an appetite for misery and cruelty, but also imbues poison into its form. Contact with this toxin, which runs throughout a shell sentinel's form, causes intense pain and clouds the minds of living creatures unfortunate enough to be subjected to it.",
			"",

			"The veiled masters of the aboleths built the first shell sentinels, but the method of their creation has been hard to keep secret because of the common practice of teaching the formulas to talented slaves. When such slaves are rescued, they often craft shell sentinels for others. As a result, it's not uncommon to find shell sentinels serving tribes of gillmen or merfolk-while these constructs are petty and vile in temperament, their inability to harm those who share the race of their creators makes them unusual but safe guardians for many tribes.",
			"",
			"Shell sentinels can easily cross between marine and freshwater environments, and given proper protections can even endure in hostile liquid environments such as acid. Out of the water, shell sentinels can function, yet they lose their ability to create poison clouds and can move about only with an awkward flopping motion - as a result, they tend to stay submerged at all times.",
			"",
			"Sometimes shell sentinels lose their original purpose following many years of inactivity. Typically, this is the fate of shell sentinels that happen to outlive their creators. After several decades of idleness, the constructs might abandon their assigned tasks and begin to wander, staking out their own territories and attacking any creatures that enter these arbitrary domains. Especially talented spellcasters can attempt to gain control over these rogue constructs if they have the {feat/Craft Construct} feat, but doing so requires the targeted shell sentinel to be restrained (or to otherwise be made a willing participant) for the 1d4 days it takes to imprint a new \"creator\" into the construct's primitive mind. This process requires the expenditure of 2,000 gp in resources and, at the end of the 1d4 days, a successful DC 20 Spellcraft check. If the spellcaster fails this check, she can attempt it once more, provided she spends the time and resources again.",

The shells must then be laid out in a pattern roughly corresponding to the creature's final shape, and then anointed with a thick and vile necromantic reduction from the living flesh of a creature afflicted with the slime of an aboleth or of a veiled master. Other rarer alchemical reagents can be substituted for this reduction (such substitutes are required if the creator wishes the final construct to be nonevil).

A shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds."

The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain.",

Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard - though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets.",

Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain.",

			"**Container (Ex)** A shipmind dwells within an immobile container of partially organic material grown by its Dominion masters. This container functions somewhat like a suit of armor for the shipmind. A shipmind container has hardness 10 and 240 hit points, and can be damaged by sunder attempts. A shipmind container that gains the broken quality grants only a +5 armor bonus to the shipmind within, and does not allow the shipmind to heal negative levels gained during a prolonged period outside of the container (see Limited Mobility). The partially crystalline nature of a shipmind container makes it vulnerable to shatter spells, and sonic damage bypasses the container's hardness and inflicts full damage.",
			"",
			"**Immerse (Ex)** When a shipmind in its container successfully grabs a Large or smaller target with one of its slam attacks, it can attempt to drag that target into its body as a swift action. To immerse a creature, the shipmind must attempt a combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, the prey is pulled into the container with the shipmind and immediately takes 6d6 points of plasma damage (half of which is electricity and half of which is fire) and 1d4 points of Intelligence damage - a successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the plasma damage and negates the Intelligence damage. A creature that remains immersed takes this damage again every following round at the start of the shipmind's turn. In addition, an immersed creature is in danger of suffocating. A creature can attempt to escape immersion by making a successful combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check, as if it were attempting to escape a pin. If the shipmind's container has the broken condition, attempts to escape in this manner gain a +8 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Limited Mobility (Ex)** Unlike most oozes, a shipmind cannot exist outside of the partially organic container it was originally created in-this container serves the shipmind as its \"skin.\" While inside its container, a shipmind has a speed of 0 feet. When it leaves its container, it gains a speed of 10 feet, but loses its armor bonus to AC. A shipmind can exist outside of its container for 1 hour without consequences, but at the start of each subsequent hour it gains 1 negative level as its body starts to dissolve. These negative levels cannot be restored by any means save by returning to an appropriate shipmind container, at which point they are removed at a rate of 1 level per hour.",
			"",
			"**Plasma Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, a shipmind can fire a bolt of plasma at a target within 300 feet (no range increment). On a hit, a blast of plasma deals 10d6 damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.",
			"",
			"**Ship Interface (Ex)** As long as a shipmind is interfaced with a Dominion vessel, it can observe events within the ship or within 90 feet of its exterior hull as if via clairaudience/clairvoyance for as long as the shipmind concentrates. While concentrating on an area, the shipmind can activate traps or other ship systems in the area as a swift action; it can even converse with creatures in the area by vibrating the metal and strange membranes in the walls.",
			"",
			"**Thought Disruption (Su)** The substance that makes up a shipmind ooze is charged with alien psychic energy that is toxic to the minds of most life forms. A creature who willfully touches an ooze (via a touch attack, natural weapon attack, or unarmed strike) or is struck by its slam attack must make a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",

			"",
			"The enigmatic shipminds are painstakingly engineered creations of Dominion fleshfarms, molded and formed over the course of years to pilot the massive organic spacecraft the aliens use to navigate the Dark Tapestry.",
			"",
			"Intimately bound to their vessels, shipminds oversee the health and function of the ships they control. They maintain this single-minded task for as long as a thousand years before they must be recycled and rebuilt.",
			"",
			"A shipmind resides within a specially designed containers on a craft, connected to the ship's greater workings via varying forms of physical interface. These oozes generally follow orders from superiors stationed on their spacecraft, though coaxing is sometimes necessary in order to get these strange creatures to follow direct orders. This is due in part to the fact that these engineered creatures are fanatically devoted to the Dominion's inscrutable faith, with rigid beliefs regarding orthodoxy. Rumors persist of especially radical shipmind oozes going beyond defiance and actually slaying their passengers, a task made frightfully easy due to the mastery each ooze has over every aspect of its spacecraft's function (such as life support and internal security appendages and creatures). Some have been known to plunge their vessel into a star or black hole in moments of defiance or religious ecstasy, leaving the rest of the ship's crew helpless and unable to convince the shipmind to abandon its actions.",
			"",
			"As a shipmind reaches more advanced age, it becomes increasingly pedantic and difficult to control. Such oozes often demand small offerings, sacrifices of lesser creatures, or the powering down of ship's systems they deem superfluous or \"unpure.\" At a certain point, the shipmind is recycled, poured from its container into vats to serve as nutrients for the cultivation of a replacement. Fragments of the previous shipmind's intellect and skills carry over into the newly created ooze, ensuring that a sort of entrenched memory and institutional knowledge persist through the generations.",
			"",
			"### Deteriorating Shipmind (CR -1)",
			"",
			"In cases where a shipmind isn't recycled in time, as often happens in abandoned ships or in cases where a Dominion crew neglects the shipmind for too long, a shipmind can begin to deteriorate while still within its container. Deteriorated shipminds are sometimes encountered on Dominion drop ships after the vessel has landed on a planet and been left to rot. In such cases, the shipmind slowly goes insane, serving almost as a sort of living haunt within the decaying ship and bringing madness and pain to any creatures exploring its decks. Most deteriorating shipminds survive for only a few years, or a decade at most - in the majority of cases, the Dominion drop ship decays into filth and sludge long before then.",
			"",
			"A shipmind that is deteriorating has slightly different statistics than the typical shipmind. You can create stats for one of these shipminds by applying the deteriorating shipmind simple template to the statistics above. The quick rules and rebuild rules for a deteriorating shipmind are the same.",
			"",
			"Quick/Rebuild Rules: -2 on all rolls (including damage rolls) and to special ability DCs. The shipmind's container is broken and has only 120 hit points. A deteriorating shipmind can only use its plasma bolt once every other round, and gains negative levels at a rate of 1 per round immediately after it leaves its container."

To maintain order and security in their settlements, Castrovel's native lashunta required steeds with power, speed, and an instinctive knack for traversing the planet's thick jungles. No creature met these requirements better than the shotalashu, large reptilian creatures that maintained a relatively high place in their ecosystem's food chain and yet were strangely receptive to the lashunta's initial friendly overtures. Once incorporated into lashunta society, the shotalashu and their riders quickly became iconic symbols of lashunta culture.",

Once linked, a shotalashu carries out the will of its rider effortlessly, often seeming to anticipate her desires and directions before she conveys them.",

			"While it's common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashu throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount for life. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashu who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years. Though they might accept other riders for short periods of time, the bereaved creatures don't seem to communicate as well until they have ceased grieving and bonded with a new rider, and might even be withdrawn and uncommunicative with other shotalashu during their grieving period.",

Among these wretched creations are the spider-like {monster/shriezyx}, which remain a constant threat to explorers venturing into the heart of Hollow Mountain, the ruins of Xin-Bakrakhan at the mountain's base, and the Irespan in the nearby city of Magnimar. While shriezyx made excellent soldiers and guardians, they made poor servants, in part because of their unnatural fear of fire (a particular problem for Alaznist's armies and devotees, who relied heavily on evocation magic). The same immunity to mental control that defended them against enchantments from the rival realm of Eurythnia also made them impossible to magically control by their own general. To solve this problem, Alaznist's skilled fleshwarpers created a superior version of the shriezyx - a queen that could serve as commander to lesser shriezyx and ensure complete loyalty among the verminous minions.",

Rather than existing to grow the hive, a shriezyx queen was instead created to control, command, and - when necessary - overpower lesser shriezyx. A shriezyx queen exudes a strong supernatural pheromone that calms her subjects, especially around fire. A shriezyx queen is also singularly capable of using mind-affecting effects on other shriezyx, to work them into a frenzy before a battle or to ensure their obedience.",

			"Shriezyx queens are inveterate schemers, with intellects far superior to those of standard shriezyx. Although shriezyx queens use this intellect to protect their hive, they also work to obscure knowledge of their existence. Only the most learned Thassilonian scholars know that a queen caste exists above the common shriezyx. While dozens of shriezyx hives exist throughout western Varisia - most known to locals for the threat they pose - only the queen of the hive living at the base of Hollow Mountains has ever revealed herself to civilized peoples.",

A queen replicates herself via asexual reproduction in the same manner a standard shriezyx does-with an unfertilized egg that produces an identical spawn - but she often keeps her dormant egg in a secure place deep in the heart of the hive's lair for centuries before it hatches. Thus, the number of shriezyx queens in existence at any time remains fairly static. Upon a queen's death, her hive generally turns feral or breaks up entirely before her replacement hatches from its well-hidden egg. The newly hatched queen retains some of the memories of her predecessor in the form of racial instincts to cultivate a hive, but she must spend the first dozen or more years of her life reuniting the remnants of her predecessor's brood. When a predecessor's hive has been entirely eradicated - such as in the wake of Earthfall or another cataclysm - the new queen instead seeks out all the dormant eggs she can find to revive the shriezyx from the brink of extinction.",

			"Larger and stronger than the average shriezyx, a queen requires more food and thus often sends her brood to hunt for her. All shriezyx have preternaturally variable metabolisms, which provide them rapid regeneration from wounds and also the ability to go long stretches with very little sustenance. A queen's appetite is as much a function of her role within the hive as it is her physiology, and even the smallest shriezyx queen appears corpulent when compared to her smaller minions.",

			"Despite their influential role within hive society, shriezyx queens live solitary lives, forever unique among their kin. Two shriezyx queens rarely meet one another, each tasked by their design with managing disparate hives. Shriezyx queens limit contact with underlings, except to issue orders or to orchestrate attacks during times of open conflict with the hive's enemies. A queen spends her solitary hours stewing on her plots for returning her hive - or herself - to a position of prominence in the region, but she invariably produces convoluted, overwrought plans that she never finds the opportunity to act on.",
			"",
			"A queen that does interact with members of another species - whether they're allies of fallen Bakrakhan (normally demons, giants, or {monster/sinspawn}) or members of modern societies now living in or near the shriezyx's ruined lair - is likely to be quite verbose. After centuries of loneliness, most queens are overwhelmed by the idea of conversing with an intellectual equal, and they see such opportunities as a rare chances to implement long-delayed plans. Humanoids often find such conversations off-putting, both because the shriezyx are such horrific works of arcane mutation and because few adventurers would ever expect to encounter chatty monstrosities when exploring millennia-old ruins."

A worm's victim realizes its error only in time to feel the worm's grasping tentacles lifting it toward the terrible spines along the creature's back.",

Their mouths are small and poorly adapted to chewing through skin and bone, so they impale their prey on their back spines and wait for it to decompose and soften. This can take some time, particularly as creatures may not die immediately upon being impaled - but the shrike worm is capable of going without food for long stretches of time and does not mind waiting for its dinner to ripen. Even when more palatable food is available, shrike worms prefer to hunt hardier creatures, for they savor the suffering that comes with the creatures' prolonged and painful deaths.",

Their fondness for company may be a matter of hygiene, as groups of shrike worms preen each other, picking pieces of bone and rotting flesh from the gaps in their carapaces. In this way, shrike worms display their social hierarchy, with the oldest and strongest worms being the recipients of the most attention from their peers.",
			"",
			"Shrike worms lair in remote places, often seeking out areas exposed to powerful or long-lasting illusions. For example, permanent hallucinatory terrain or large illusory wall effects attract shrike worms like moths to a flame. Shrike worms are also often found in areas afflicted by legacies of madness, such as abandoned insane asylums or villages destroyed by plagues of mental illness. Some believe that shrike worms are actually responsible for such bouts of insanity, claiming that repeated exposure to the sight of the impossible worms can shatter minds and drive people mad.",
			"",
			"While shrike worms enjoy each other's company a great deal, they treat almost all other creatures as mere food. They understand Aklo and are willing to deal with wicked fey or other powerful tricksters, but they never offer their services to such creatures for free. Those who wish to employ a shrike worm's abilities must pay, usually by providing the worm a steady supply of victims.",
			"",
			"Derros are an exception to this trend. As creatures of madness, derros attract shrike worms whenever they dwell in one place for too long or build large communities. While some shrike worms simply devour the derros en masse, cleverer worms take advantage of their ability to dominate the smaller creatures and instate themselves as false gods among the derros. These shrike worms use their illusory magic to answer their subjects' prayers and to relay their commands, and they tend to grow fat and lazy as the derros supply live sacrifices to placate their strange and impossible gods."

Unfortunately, given the dangers inherent in many primeval forests, such an outlook can be dangerous. When a woodland gnome's fanciful tree-climbing expeditions or unprepared sylvan explorations lead to disaster, sometimes her soul becomes heavy with melancholy and bitterness, and she arises again as a waldgeist. If a gnome's death can be blamed on an intruder-perhaps she was tracking an interloper when her fatal accident occurred-this undead fate is nearly assured.",

			"Because of the highly specific circumstances required for their formation, waldgeists are rare and found only in large, old-growth forests, where the trees grow tall enough to block out the sun. Even more rarely, a tragedy of unthinkable proportions happens to a group of gnomes, and multiple waldgeists arise simultaneously. When this happens, the spirits often drift away from one another to haunt separate areas of the forest. Waldgeists are solitary creatures, hiding their presences from the other creatures of the woods, especially fey such as dryads. Although both creatures exhibit a certain protective possessiveness over nature, dryads see the undead waldgeists' capacity for violence as terribly brutish.  ",
			"",
			"While waldgeists tend to shun forest natives, they hate and hunt down creatures they see as intruders in their woods. In reality, such individuals might be innocent travelers simply passing through the forest, or they may be loggers who pose a legitimate threat to the natural surroundings. To waldgeists, such distinctions are non-existent; they view any creatures not native to their homes as enemies. In battle, waldgeists are cunning. If a waldgeist faces a group of enemies, it tends to use its magic to enhance the surrounding foliage, entangling creatures with the plants that heed its call. While its enemies are distracted, the waldgeist then possesses the nearest tree and uses its branches to wreak havoc on any within its reach.  ",
			"",
			"Luckily for most adventurers, though, these wicked creatures can be easily distracted. Waldgeists are attracted to sound of knocking on wood, as it reminds them of the possibilities of interesting visitors, opening doors, or other things that once intrigued them in life. A waldgeist that fails to resist the temptation of this noise ceases its current actions in order to \"greet\" the knocker, even going as far as abandoning the tree it had been possessing. Usually, this allows the other individual whom the waldgeist was previously harassing a chance to escape. In rural communities near forests haunted by waldgeists, the practice of knocking on wood for luck arises from ancient tales of waldgeist encounters.  ",

A 5th-level chaotic neutral spellcaster with the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat can gain a sprite as a familiar."

Most of those sent forth never return, having run afoul of the sprites' protective instincts, but occasionally the sprites allow someone they deem not a threat to live-quite independently of their actual guilt or innocence."

The source of these dangerous rituals is unclear, for it is unlike the alien mind of a star vampire to conceive of such tactics.

			"",
			"Some star vampires grow mightier than the typical specimen presented here, gaining size and Hit Dice with no apparent limit - although when they grow particularly large, they are invariably hunted down and destroyed by great heroes on the worlds they infest. Other star vampires gain class levels to become more powerful, preferring to focus on classes such as oracle, psychic, and rogue, eschewing classes that place too much emphasis on the use of gear or the acquisition of companions. Star vampires with class levels tend to pose more of a threat than those that merely grow in size, for the former often develop all-too-human goals and desires beyond simply feeding. These creatures are fond of forming cults and playing the role of gods to primitive societies or fanatics who are incapable of discerning the monster from a divine sending. It is rare for a star vampire to worship a deity, but those that do tend to venerate Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, or Yog-Sothoth.",

			"The creatures known now as \"star vampires\" were named such by Sandy Petersen in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and they've gone on to drink the blood of countless inquisitive investigators and hapless heroes. The first star vampire noted in print lacked its name, appearing in Robert Bloch's short story, \"The Shambler from the Stars,\" which the author dedicated to H. P. Lovecraft-after receiving written permission to put Lovecraft into the story and have a monster eat him. Lovecraft returned the favor by having an equally grisly fate await a Bloch-inspired character in the short story, \"star vampires\""

Unlike full starflight (like that of the {monster/mi-go}), a star-spawn of Cthulhu's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusual speeds. When it wishes to fly to another world, the creature relies entirely upon its immortality and patience to complete the journey. When speed is required, it instead uses its gate ability to make the journey quickly.",
			"",
			"**Overwhelming Mind (Ex)** A star-spawn of Cthulhu's mind is overwhelming in its power and alien structure. The first time a creature other than an outsider (excluding native outsiders) or aberration makes mental contact with a star-spawn of Cthulhu, it must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is merely staggered for 1 round. This effect can occur whether the star-spawn of Cthulhu initiates mental contact (such as via a demand, dream, nightmare, or sending spell-like ability, or once per round merely by telepathic communication) or another creature attempts to do so (such as via detect thoughts or dominate monster).

The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Of all the strange and malefic denizens of the void between the stars, few cause the same terror as this titanic race. They hail from a mad star whose light cannot be seen by conventional telescopes, and the smallest of these behemoths stand nearly 30 feet in height. Humanoid in shape, their immense bodies have rubbery flesh that seems to wriggle and seethe like a half-solidified ooze. Tremendous draconic wings, murderous taloned hands, and a tentacled visage that evokes the alien gaze of an octopus complete the being's monstrous shape. This malevolent race has a name, yet it is no name known to the sane. Among mortal scholars, they are known merely by the name of their greatest priest - they are the starspawn of Cthulhu.",
			"",
			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu have a strange, mutable anatomy - their form is not fixed. They can absorb parts of their bodies or enlarge others at will, a trait they often use on their claws or tentacles to dramatically extend their reach in combat beyond what might normally be possible for a creature of the same shape and size. Despite this mutable shape, the star-spawn's forms generally don't deviate far from that of an octopus-headed, winged humanoid, likely because of the powerful links their otherworldly minds have to their overlord and master, who lies dead but dreaming in the lost city of R-lyeh.",
			"",
			"Although they typically appear as immense humanoid creatures with rubbery hides and octopoid heads, the star-spawn of Cthulhu are not any more aquatic in nature than they are terrestrial-that they're often associated with a planet's oceans lies more in the simple fact that oceans often cover the majority of a planet's surface. The creatures themselves, being equally at home on land, at sea, or in the depths of space, make no real distinction between such regions, choosing them as the sites of their cities and temples for purposes only they can know. Servants of the alien gods of the void, they work upon the worlds they invade to wipe them clean of indigenous life in preparation for the eventual time when the deep void expands to replace all that exists with its strange realities.",
			"",
			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu hold little malice toward indigenous life - they simply can't proceed with their plans for a world while such life exists. Just as a human might move into a house thinking it to be abandoned, only to discover colonies of ants dwelling within the building's walls, the star-spawn work to eradicate indigenous infestations. Their methods seldom vary from world to world - those whose intellects they can influence via dreams and nightmares they besiege as the victims sleep, seeding the growth of destructive cults and societies. These groups in turn further the star-spawn's agenda, preparing the world and bringing it to the brink of destruction. When such worlds are poised to tear themselves apart from within through unrest, civil war, excessive pollution, or genocide, the star-spawn mobilize their cults to end all things. The only reward such cults may receive for their (sometimes unwitting) aid is the dubious honor of being among the final few to be eradicated, for the star-spawn have no interest in and feel no responsibility toward their pawns.",
			"",
			"The fact that the star-spawn's plans to bring about the eradication of life span centuries or even millennia should not be mistaken for sloth or lassitude - the star-spawn are inhumanly patient, and the preparation of the universe's worlds must precisely follow an unknowable schedule, for only when the exact cosmic convergences are in place and the stars are right can they make their final moves to end all things. This time frame does give some worlds a chance to discover the star-spawn's influence and to delay or even defeat their world's starspawned doom, but such tales of triumph are rare in the face of the void's relentless tides.",
			"",
			"The star-spawn of Cthulhu war with many other strange races out of time and space, including {monster/elder thing/s} and the servitors of other {subtype/Great Old One/s}. They have also been known to use these creatures - and other races such as the mi-go - as pawns, slaves, or minions to promote their immortal agenda.",
			"",
			"Though the star-spawn themselves hail from a distant world deep in the void and can be found on countless other realms as gods and monsters, their lord {monster/Cthulhu} dwells upon a distant planet far removed from any commonly visited world. Yet while Cthulhu lies imprisoned in the corpse-city of R-lyeh deep under a great ocean, his dreams resonate still in the minds of his starspawn, and from there touch upon the dreams of many slumbering poets and philosophers on countless worlds. Guided by their knowledge of their master's great plan, and updated by his far-reaching dreams, the star-spawn of Cthulhu proceed inevitably toward their goals."

They are fond of hiding near watering holes and waiting for travelers to drop their guard, then swooping out to attach and drink their fill by thrusting their long feeding tubes into unprotected veins. After feeding they flap heavily off into the mud and reeds to lay their eggs and rest until hunger drives them to hunt again.",

			"Stirges are usually 1 foot long, with a wingspan of twice that, and weigh just under a pound. Their coloration is rust-red or reddish-brown with a dirty yellow underbelly, though stirges that have not fed in some time are often pale pink, their color deepening as they gorge."

			"Stampeding across the sky in booming herds, storm aurochs resemble nothing so much as vast and powerful thunderstorms bearing down across Golarion. Storm and cloud giants value these magnificent beasts not only for their meat and hides, but also as symbols of mystic power and divine strength. Though ostensibly domesticated centuries ago by storm giants, storm aurochs remain among the most fearsome and dangerous of the creatures that pass through Golarion's skies. A storm aurochs is roughly twice the size of a normal aurochs, growing up to 20 feet long and standing 15 feet tall at the shoulder. Storm aurochs weigh on average anywhere from 5 to 7 tons, with females being noticeably smaller and slimmer than males. Both males and females bear prodigious horns atop their heads that crackle with electrical energy, though the female's horns are slightly smaller.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Storm aurochs behave much as their more mundane cousins do. They are gregarious, herbivorous creatures that travel in herds of up to several dozen extended family members. These untamed herds are nomadic, and their migratory patterns mirror Golarion's natural weather patterns. Herds are fiercely territorial, with weather fronts forming the natural boundary between two herds' territories. Territorial disputes are common, though rarely lethal, and are often accompanied by terrific natural and magical storms.",
			"",
			"In addition to more traditional fodder, storm aurochs also graze on clouds. It is unclear whether or not this provides them any real nourishment, and it may be that they do so purely out of enjoyment. This can be a blessing and a curse for areas frequented by herds of storm aurochs; these areas soon become cloudless and sunny. Overgrazing can prevent much needed rain from reaching the ground, eventually leading to periods of drought and famine for those living nearby. For this reason, farmers often see herds of storm aurochs as pests. Aside from the dangers inherent in facing a storm aurochs, slaying one often comes with the added danger of drawing the ire of its storm giant owner, and so most communities prefer to relocate an aurochs herd as gently as possible, or perhaps even negotiate with the owner, rather than trying to slay the aurochs.",
			"",
			"Domesticated storm aurochs tolerate the presence and activities of storm or cloud giants with little hostility. This doesn't always hold for other races, and how a storm aurochs reacts to the presence of an adventuring party often depends on the temperament of the individual aurochs and the circumstances of the meeting. Storm aurochs are canny enough to recognize weapons, however, and usually respond to the approach of armed individuals of any species with extreme aggression.",
			"",

			"Storm aurochs are most commonly found in the possession of storm giants, where the animals spend their days grazing on the giants' expansive coastal estates. Storm giants keep aurochs for their meat, their hides, and their ability to influence the weather. The giants rarely use the creatures as beasts of burden, as unlike normal domesticated cattle or oxen, storm aurochs do not tolerate being placed in a yoke. A storm giant can use this fact to test the strength or patience of members of lesser races who come seeking the giant's aid. The giant first requires the petitioner to harness the giant's bull and plow his field. If the appellant accomplishes this task, either through cunning or brute strength, the giant is willing to hear her request. Those who give up the task or harm the aurochs in the effort, are banished from the giant's presence or slain outright.",
			"",
			"Cloud giants also keep herds of storm aurochs, though less commonly than storm giants. Cloud giants particularly favor the taste of storm aurochs meat, which they serve at feasts and gatherings of great importance, or to honor particularly noteworthy guests. Cloud giants also make use of storm aurochs in one of their more idiosyncratic pastimes; bull-leaping. Young cloud giants, newly come of age, take turns leaping over a charging storm aurochs, sometimes even boosting themselves off the auroch's horns to gain extra height and momentum. Leapers perform feats of acrobatics as they pass over the bull, each seeking to impress her fellows with her daring and prowess. Bull-leaping has fallen out of favor among younger cloud giants, who increasingly turn their attentions toward more philosophical pursuits, but it's still commonly practiced by more traditional, rural cloud giant families.",
			"",
			"Storm aurochs hold a deep spiritual significance for both storm and cloud giants. Cloud giants believe that the aurochs are gifts from Ioz-om, their version of Gozreh in his sky-father aspect, as a reward for their dutiful worship and piety. Storm giants also connect storm aurochs to Gozreh, through their sky-father incarnation, Hyjarth. Though most believe much as the cloud giants do, a few take their worship of the storm aurochs further. They claim that Hyjarth sacrificed the first storm aurochs to create the world itself, building the land from its bones and filling the seas with its blood. These storm giants gather in mystery cults across Golarion to reenact this ritual sacrifice, slaying a captive storm aurochs in order to honor Hyjarth and ensure that their lands and seas remain fruitful.",

			"### Skyshaping Stampede",
			"",
			"When storm aurochs gather in one place, they can have a profound impact on the weather. Such a gathering is known as a skyshaping stampede.",
			"",
			"Whenever three storm aurochs are within 10 feet of one another, all three of them can work together to use any of the following spell-like abilities: control weather, control winds (DC 16), fog cloud, sirocco (DC 17), or sleet storm.",
			"",
			"To take part in a skyshaping stampede, all three storm aurochs must take a full-round action to move through the area to be affected, usually by circling the spell's point of origin or tracing the path they desire winds to take. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. These spell-like abilities function at CL 12th (or at a caster level equal to the Hit Dice of the most powerful aurochs involved). The save DCs are Charisma-based, and function as if the herd has a Charisma score of 12, unless one of the aurochs has a higher Charisma score, in which case the spell-like ability DCs are adjusted by that aurochs's Charisma modifier."

Its attacks, including avalanches it creates, deal 2d6 fewer points of bludgeoning damage, but deal an additional 2d6 fire damage plus burn (2d6, DC 30). A pyroclastic sturzstromer can use its landslide ability after taking either cold or sonic damage. It speaks Ignan in addition to Terran."

			"**Gem Eye (Su)** Stygiras possess a special connection with gemstones. While holding or otherwise in contact with a gemstone of at least the size of a human eye, a stygira can see through the gemstone like a magical eye, viewing her surroundings as if her blindsense extended to 120 feet and she were under the effects of true seeing, which grants her a +4 bonus on Perception checks.",

			"",
			"**Stone Curse (Su)** Any creature struck by a stygira's claws must make a DC 18 Will save or be affected by a curse that gradually drains it of color, stiffens its joints, and finally turns the victim to stone. This curse proves frighteningly unpredictable, forcing another save against its effects every 1d3 hours. Any creature that is drained to 0 Dexterity or fails three saves against the curse is permanently petrified. Even if a creature is petrified and then restored to flesh, it is still affected by the curse and is petrified again upon failing its next save against the curse. A stone curse can only be removed in one of two ways: by casting remove curse or by spending a full hour in unobstructed natural sunlight. Magical radiance like daylight does not affect a stone curse, and remove curse does not return a petrified creature to flesh. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Withered hermits wrapped in tattered black rags, these scarred, eyeless crones slip through the dark crevasses of both earth and time. Degenerate inheritors of the half-remembered, collapsed cyclops civilizations, the stygiras - or stone witches, as they are often called - command strange secrets of the earth and interpret the fateful energies of the depths. Ages of communion with the darkness and reliance upon alien magics have corrupted the stygiras from the primitive human witches their ancestors were countless ages ago, transforming them into a terrifying, debased breed infused with magics not their own. In many a savage land, these crones were once or are still worshiped as seers and demigods, weaving magic and communing with the earth to manipulate their servants into obeying their selfish and grotesque whims. In other realms, they haunt the night, prowling from their caves to feed upon the unwary or make alliances with those cruel and ambitious enough to believe their perverse counsel. Yet for all their perverse blasphemies and primitive desires, their powers to see what none should and reduce life to brittle stone proves enough to inspire dread and superstitious belief in nearly all who hear of the harsh stone witches.",

			"",
			"The cultic lore passed down from stygira to stygira tells of the existence of rare gems of might that grant special powers to the stone witch who bears them. In rare cases, stygiras have been encountered clutching ancient and frighteningly sculpted stones exhibiting weird powers; in even more extraordinary cases, they have borne a veritable arsenal of crystals. While all gemstones of significant size allow a stygira to make use of her gem eye and gem gaze abilities, a few rare gems alter the crones' gaze abilities. These added abilities do not increase a stygira's CR.",
			"",
			"The adjacent list of stones and abilities merely represent those few stones whose use has been documented after encounters with stygiras, and it is likely not all-inclusive. These effects function only for stygiras. Except where noted, new effects replace an ability's typical effect. Treat a stygira as an 8th-level caster for effects granting spell-like abilities. Also listed are the common values of crude, eye-sized gems of the following types.",
