Regardless of the plant's apparent gender, it is itself asexual and reproduces (typically once or twice per decade) by budding a single offspring over the course of a spring season.",

			"Despite their appearance, alraunes are quite mobile (capable of walking almost like a spider upon their numerous long roots and thorny vines). They hunt by using {spell/commune with nature} to locate potential prey, preferring humanoid flesh over all others. When an alraune needs prey, it uses its mind-affecting abilities to convince foes to dig their own graves and bury themselves - once a foe is helplessly buried in the soil, the alraune can feed from it via its flesh-burrowing roots, converting the victim's blood and memories into the strange nutrients it so craves."

Those who seek to improve their hunting techniques after these harrowing encounters earn the amaroks' approval, and amaroks are excellent, if harsh, instructors of stalking, tracking, and wrestling techniques. They are also implacable foes of those who commit the one act they cannot forgive - a foolish person who slays an amarok's pups faces a swift and brutal death at the amarok's jaws.",

A creature can attempt a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw at the end of the hour-long process to avoid being preserved; if successful, it remains entangled, but the ambergrim must start the process anew to preserve the creature. Dead and nonliving materials are preserved as if under the effects of an unguent of timelessness. Living creatures are held in stasis, unable to move and no longer needing to eat, drink, or breathe. A living creature can survive in this state for 1 day for each point of Constitution it has, after which it suffocates but remains preserved indefinitely as if by a gentle repose spell. Each day, a preserved creature can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) to break free of the amber shell. The shell has hardness 8 and 20 hit points; submerging it in strong alcohol for 1 hour can also dissolve the shell.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** An ambergrim can use its swallow whole ability to swallow a creature of its own size category (usually Medium) or smaller. A swallowed creature is entangled, but instead of the Dexterity penalty normally imposed by the entangled condition, it takes a cumulative -1d6 penalty to its Dexterity score each round as the ambergrim coats it in thick resin. If this penalty exceeds the creature's Dexterity score, it is paralyzed until the resin is removed. An ambergrim normally spits out paralyzed prey so it can target a new creature. A paralyzed creature outside the ambergrim that is not affected by its preserve ability can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) each round to free itself, but the entangled condition remains as long as any Dexterity penalty persists. The Dexterity penalty decreases by 1 every hour as the resin becomes brittle, or vanishes completely in 1d4 rounds if the resin is doused in strong alcohol.",

			"Creeping masses of honey-colored slime, ambergrims are scavengers and collectors of the forest, rolling up unwanted bits of undergrowth and unsuspecting animals to preserve for later in timeless stockpiles hidden throughout their domains. Little more than aggressive, human-sized globs of sap and resin, they hunt by the twin graces of surprise and their incredibly sticky bodies, which naturally adhere to other creatures and draw them deeper into the ambergrims' bulk. The oozes' name describes both their rich, warm coloration as well as their ability to immobilize their prey within soft, amber-like capsules, which they can harden into tough cocoons to preserve food for later. Anything from rabbits to unwary human travelers is fit fodder for these oozes' endless hunger.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims vary immensely in size and coloration depending on their environment and parentage, but the most common are roughly 4 feet across and weigh around 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims are aberrations born from a relatively common blight that infects a variety of temperate and arctic trees. The fungus creates large, resinous bulges in the trunk, but upon infecting a treant or similar ambulatory plant, the growth inherits some measure of its parent's mobility and eventually hatches into a newborn ambergrim. Already full-grown and hungry, it wanders away - often ignored by its relieved, erstwhile parent - to begin hunting immediately.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims do not reproduce, making them rare except in cases when blight-obsessed druids cultivate them or groves of treants grow them as guard beasts. Each ooze is effectively immortal, living and hunting until it is destroyed or slowly starves to death.",
			"",
			"With every movement, ambergrims leave a film behind, slightly diminishing themselves with every undulating motion. To make up for this continual loss, they are ravenous, feeding slowly on twigs, leaves, and insects as they creep through the underbrush, but they prefer larger prey. They digest what they can, but in times of plenty they eagerly engulf and preserve additional creatures to store for leaner periods. This hoarding leads many to assume ambergrims possess some rudimentary intellect; however, much like squirrels, the oozes simply stockpile as much food as possible, increasing their odds of coming across a cache months or years later. Desperate wanderers in the forest may be blessed to stumble into an ambergrim's territory and discover its ample stores of food - providing they can escape the notice of the hunter.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims' bodies are made of a sticky, sap-like substance, making them natural grapplers. In quiet times, they hunt passively by sitting motionless and attracting insects and small animals to the sweet scent they exude, trapping such creatures in their adhesive mass. These oozes' cytoplasm hardens into an especially dense crystal, allowing them to coat prey in an impenetrable shell for later consumption. Bits of an ambergrim's surface harden from ordinary exposure to the air when the ooze remains still, forming tough crystalline protuberances that stud its surface. Ambergrims use these as rudimentary teeth to \"bite\" and hold prey as they attempt to engulf it. These same gems also focus light, forming simple eyes that grant the ambergrim unsophisticated vision rarely possessed by other oozes. Able to identify colors and movement, they are among the few oozes that actively hunt, attacking sleeping or otherwise motionless prey that would be invisible to predators that rely wholly on blindsense to locate and target potential meals.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Treants show a variety of reactions to an ambergrim infection, though most are as repulsed by them as any human might be by a parasite. Many attempt to remove the warty growths before they burst open, but this is a painful process that creates deep and easily infected scars. Rare groves of treants instead form a symbiotic relationship with ambergrims, letting the oozes reproduce in their bodies and using them to keep the treants' forest homes clear of smaller parasites and predators. These groves are then free to engage in to long periods of quiet introspection akin to hibernation, depending on their ambergrim pets to defend their territory as the treants quietly muse and communicate with one another and the trees around them.",
			"",
			"Ambergrims are unintelligent and solitary creatures born by circumstance, but they attract strange attendants. A variety of scavengers follow in their wake, preying on the preserved leftovers the oozes stash in their gemlike cases. Human scavengers flock to ambergrim territory as well, selling the creature's preserved sap as true amber - though it has none of the magical or alchemical properties of true amber - or harvesting those preservative cysts as a valuable ingredient in tanglefoot bags and alchemical glue. Some scholars find use for the ambergrim's preservative powers, either using captive subjects to preserve valuables or else extracting humors from the creatures to mix elixirs and poultices to extend life. On rare occasions, sickly or aging druids or fey actively seek out an ambergrim, hoping its preservative cocoons can sustain them in hibernation to offset their inevitable demise. Though a creature preserved in an ambergrim's preservative gems typically suffocates within a few weeks, the safety of the gem preserves its remains well enough for the creature to be easily resurrected - provided the ambergrim does not return later to make a meal of it."

If that tactic fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach.

No live specimen has ever been caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the creature's body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an ammut's body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls. Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.",
			"",
			"Because ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it's likely that many more encounters ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated, based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts, that there are perhaps twenty to thirty of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.",
			"",
			"The origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it's thought that they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the souls of the dead - a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conflict, scholars argue about the creatures' true origin.",
			"",
			"Though it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils, while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly lends to this hypothesis.",

Additionally, amphipteres can attempt a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if under the effects of feather fall.

They're also longer and much leaner than wyverns, and instead of a wyvern's poisonous stinger, an amphiptere has a broad, arrow-shaped spur at the end of its long tail. Capable of piercing armor and shattering bone, an amphiptere's tail skewers prey much like a fisher might spear a fish.",

While they prefer smaller prey, they have been known to hunt gnomes, halflings, and other Small humanoids, and will sometimes attack larger foes if they're starving or preparing to shed.",

Their personalities take on aspects of the winds they guide, and such councils often end in duels of winds, though such duels are always nonlethal due to the anemoi's regeneration.",
			"",
			"Anemoi are particularly fond of music, particularly that of wind instruments, and each can perform as a full wind ensemble with its own winds simultaneously. They appreciate musical talent in their followers, allowing sirens and other creatures with musical skills to join their courts. Despite anemoi's aloofness, skilled mortal musicians can earn their way into the creatures' good graces, and romance between anemoi and mortals, while extraordinarily rare, is not impossible.",
			"",
			"Though they are beings of air, anemoi usually choose to appear in humanoid form. Many sylphs, sorcerers with an air elemental bloodline, and aerokineticists make grandiose claims about anemos descent, but only a handful have the pedigree to support those claims, and they tend to become notable heroes and villains in their own right.",
			"",
			"### Elder Anemoi",
			"",
			"While all anemoi are ancient beings with incredible abilities, elder anemoi are closer in power to true gods. Rather than serving as members of councils that control the winds on a world in the Material Plane, the elder anemoi each control notable regions on the Elemental Plane of Air with powerful wind features, such as the Living Hurricane and the Foreverstorm.",
			"",
			"Anemoi typically become elder anemoi only after tending a world's winds from that world's infancy to its destruction, which would make elder anemoi older than most mortals can fathom. Elder anemoi possess all the powers of a typical anemos as well as 10 mythic ranks and several powerful abilities unique to each individual elder anemos.",
			"",
			"### Cardinal Wind Abilities",
			"",
			"An anemos who is assigned to guide one of a world's winds gains an additional special ability tied to that wind.",
			"",
			"Austral: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the south winds can whip them into a frenzied dust storm. The storm encompasses a cylinder with a 30-foot radius centered on the anemos, and is 60 feet high. It deals 20d6 points of fire damage to other creatures within the cylinder, blinds them for 1d4 rounds, and knocks them prone. A successful DC 31 Fortitude save halves the damages and negates the other effects.",
			"",
			"Boreal: Once per day, as a swift action, an anemos who guides the north winds can send forth a blast of ice slivers from its hand in a 30-foot line. This shredding blast deals 20d6 points of cold damage to anything in its path, as well as 2d4 points of Dexterity damage, and a damaged creature moves at half speed for 1d4 rounds as the ice infuses its limbs. A successful DC 31 Reflex save halves the cold damage and negates the other effects.",
			"",
			"Eural: Once per day, an anemos who guides the eastern winds can use them to bring misfortune to any creatures they touch. Creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt a DC 31 Will save to avoid suffering bad luck. If a creature succeeds, its close brush with disaster leaves it shaken for 1d6 rounds. If it fails, for the next 6 rounds, anytime it attempts an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result.",
			"",
			"Zephyr: Once per day, an anemos who guides the western winds can soothe the spirits of any creature touched by its gentle breezes. For 1 minute, creatures within 60 feet of the anemos must attempt DC 31 Will saves each time they attempt to attack or take aggressive actions toward another creature. If a creature succeeds, it can attack as normal. If it fails, it can't attack and is staggered for 1 minute."

			">*Paragon of the Sword (Sp, Su):* The paragon's blade is fueled by honor.

The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.",
			"",
			"**Shining Mount (Su)** As a standard action, an erelim can conjure forth a quasi-real mount made of pure light. This functions as per phantom steed (CL 8th), conjuring a mount with an Armor Class of 18, 15 hit points, a speed of 100 feet, and the ability to run or charge over sandy, muddy, or marshy terrain without penalty. The mount glows with a brightness equivalent to a daylight spell. Only the erelim who conjured it can ride the mount, and the erelim must be astride the mount to use celestial charge and inspiring presence. An erelim can dismiss the mount as a free action.",

			"Erelims arise from the souls of valiant mortals who fell honorably in battle, or who died defending the weak against insurmountable evils. Many paladins, cavaliers, and other crusaders find themselves among this legion after death, but even a humble peasant may find herself among the knights of Heaven so long as she stood up to evil while others backed down. The appearances of the angels may vary greatly from the mortal forms they once inhabited, and many erelims arise from the celestial planes spontaneously - from wisps of soulstuff collected from a dozen or more brave petitioners - rather than emerging from a single, courageous warrior. They may present a huge variety of racial features in one stunningly beautiful and athletic form.",

They depend heavily on their shining mounts' projections of their own radiant souls - as their wings are smaller and weaker than most of the angelic host. Most guard the borders of Heaven, or ride across the yawning planes of Elysium on constant patrol for protean intruders. They serve as the cavalry for celestial forays into the evil Outer Planes, but lack the cunning and restraint to act as covert agents. Despite their zeal, erelims are careful to avoid civilian injuries or destruction, and work to steer conflicts away from unaffiliated settlements.",
			"",
			"Very rarely, erelims take mortal form on the Material Plane to act as knights or field marshals for armies they deem righteous. These erelims are fair but uncreative strategists, relying heavily on straightforward tactics and superior numbers to win the day. While erelims see any resulting casualties as a failure of their leadership, they tolerate the deaths so long as an important objective is won in the process. Erelims on the Material Plane attempt to disguise their celestial nature, only reverting to their true forms in times of desperation. Once danger has passed, such revealed erelims return to the Outer Planes.",
			"",
			"The concept of relaxation is alien to erelims. Their free time is filled with endless drills, jousts, patrols, and short breaks to maintain their weapons or strategize with other angels. Such a warlike existence leaves them suited for little else. Even in times of peace, most erelims find it difficult to lay their duty aside and embrace simple pleasures; without some measure of routine, many become anxious and reactionary, seeking conflict even when engaged in the most mundane activities.",
			"",
			"Erelims who serve together in a celestial formation share a camaraderie akin to that of many mortal armies. Members of an erelim formation learn to act in harmony, and grow as close as siblings, able to coordinate and work together without speaking a word. Multiple formations brought together into a single host often develop friendly rivalries, becoming especially competitive in battle, to the point of recklessness. Celestial commanders frown upon this divergence in the ranks, but can rarely discourage the boisterous angels for long.",
			"",
			"### Calling an Erelim",
			"",
			"Erelims can be called with planar ally, and the payment they require depends on the boldness of the request. These angels belittle any tasks that don't test their mettle or call for incredible heroism, and demand to be presented with extravagant weapons or for large sums to be donated to an appropriate church. Conversely, they exuberantly agree to requests that put them in direct conflict with powerful evil beings, and often ask no more of the callers than to fight alongside them as equals. Erelims do not accept obviously suicidal tasks, but sometimes vastly underestimate the threat mortal dangers can pose."

Energetic, enthusiastic, impulsive, and outgoing, it constantly looks for ways to aid the forces of righteousness in the wars against fiends and villainy. As a being of pure righteous spirit in a burning physical form, an iophanite is often confused for an exotic form of harbinger or lantern archon. Its form is slightly mutable, and it can deform itself into an oval curved like a shield, or manifest simple tendrils to manipulate objects or lash out at opponents.

Of the lawful angels, they tend to be the most creative in terms of working around rules and the most forgiving of others' failures.

			"",
			"**Lesser Protective Aura (Su)** A kuribu has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack with the resistance bonus from the kuribu's ox countenance). This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of sacred places such as churches and blessed bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take flight and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a flight of kuribus sacrifice themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.",
			"",
			"Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and innocence. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel's dense, stonelike flesh.",
			"",
			"Kuribus are fashioned from the souls of good mortals who died protecting a treasured place or ideal. As these spirits traverse the River of Souls, they undergo several metamorphoses, gaining the qualities that eventually become their blessed aspects. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions, and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist. However, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church, appearing as innocent-looking statues with wide eyes and plump cheeks.",
			"",
			"Kuribus have a remarkable amount of patience and tolerance for boredom, as they may be assigned to watch over particular locations for years. Mortal generations pass swiftly for kuribus, with years blurring in much the same way days might for mortals. However, their senses are always alert, and the slightest destructive act against their charges can cause them to spring into action. While this self-defensiveness certainly extends to vandals and evil beasts, kuribus have boundless patience for the birds and small mammals that sometimes make homes upon their bodies or shelter beneath their wings. While kuribus would never let a terrible crime transpire before their eyes just to protect a pigeon's comfort, there have been instances of these angels revealing themselves only after their avian residents have migrated away for the season. This has more to do with kuribus' otherworldly sense of urgency and time than any particular affinity for animals.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Angel}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As kuribus protect sacred areas, they are witness to, but rarely interact with, many different types of good-aligned outsiders. Unless these outsiders seek to cause harm, the kuribus see no reason to interrupt them on their business. As such, other angels tend to consider kuribus to be more decoration than fellow animate beings. Kuribus think nothing of this prejudice, as they are confident in the importance of their duties.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, an angel important enough to employ a flight of kuribus to safeguard their own sanctum will develop a certain fondness for the smaller outsiders. The overseer angel speaks pleasantly with the kuribus, keeping them informed of the important events of the Outer Sphere, not expecting responses. In turn, the kuribus grow fiercely loyal to the more powerful angel. Eventually, this relationship blossoms into something more familial and playful, the kuribus trying to move from their positions without the other angel noticing. In times of crisis, however, this whimsy is immediately dropped in favor of the defense of the holy sanctum.",
			"",
			"On the other hand, kuribus rarely form close relationships with other kuribus. When part of a flight that protects a single location, kuribus work together well, but solely as professional associates and nothing more. If, for some reason, a single kuribu has different ideas than the rest of the flight about the best way to defend their charge, that angel quickly falls in line with the others. Kuribus hold their duties above their pride.",
			"",
			"In rare cases, kuribus might find themselves lingering in areas that were once holy but have been abandoned or despoiled. In such cases, a kuribu often stoically waits for goodly folk to return, whether as a congregation restoring the site or heroes who might help cast out a lingering evil.",
			"",
			"### Calling a Kuribu",
			"",
			"The payment requested by a kuribu called with lesser planar ally is often a donation that helps to rebuild or refurbish a church or other holy site. As a kuribu considers these places to be very important to the appropriate deity, the angel will halve any payment required if asked to guard such a location. A few kuribus even accept long-term, open-ended requests to protect a piece of sacred ground from a worthy caller. A small number of cathedrals on the Material Plane are home to kuribus selected for such a service decades ago, and whose original callers have long since passed away."

Some of these virtuous spirits, however, have not always been so: some lived mortal lives of startling wickedness before repenting of their evil ways and joining the ranks of Heaven. Although the archons do not fault each other for mortal wrongs, a rare few archons dwell on their own dimly remembered misdeeds. These transgressions vex their thoughts like splinters. Eventually, some of these archons decide that redeeming other mortal wrongdoers is a higher calling than the service of Heaven's hierarchies; when such archons advance, they slip from the usual ranks and are reborn as ninkondas.

Their very existence is only a rumor, kept a closely guarded secret by an elite group of veiled masters known as the Fifth Dictum. These individuals coexist with enisysians in an asymmetrical physical and psychic symbiosis. In exchange for their protection, the much weaker enisysians grant their veiled master hosts not only increased mental capacity but also the ability to use their powers to influence other alghollthus. This relationship is far from equal, however, as the enisysians have been bred to be subservient to their masters for thousands of years, directly in opposition to the second dictum of their people: an alghollthu is to control. It should therefore never be controlled. Members of the Fifth Dictum rightly fear that should it become known that they created a race of alghollthu slaves, their kind would quickly turn against them.",

These veiled masters had been vocal opponents of the human experiment (as they called the Azlanti civilization) from the beginning, believing that the humanoids were too free willed and unpredictable to be of lasting use. The destruction that Earthfall caused not only to the surface races but also to the alghollthu civilization at the time confirmed their worst fears. In the ruins of their broken cities, the Fifth Dictum began secretly fleshwarping the enisysians in order to give themselves the power to intervene against their own kin and prevent such a disastrous decision from ever being made again. Over the following millennia, however, members of the Fifth Dictum have grown arrogant, and they now believe themselves to be the true masters of alghollthu culture.",

While on land, four of its tentacles act as legs while two of them are used for defense or to manipulate tools. In the water, the enisysian propels itself with its tentacles like a squid.",

Once the bond between the alghollthus forms, the enisysian disguises its shape to appear as a remora or any other species of suckerfish common in its biome, reverting to its true shape only when it dies.

Genetically bred for dedication and obedience, they communicated telepathically only with their bonded veiled masters, not even acknowledging others of their kind. This has begun to change over the last several centuries, as natural genetic mutations have decreased the enisysians' inbred subservience and enhanced their self-awareness. Individual enisysians have begun to secretly communicate with one another, slowly awakening others of their kind to their enslavement while reaching out to alghollthus beyond their masters' control for support. Although the process of their emancipation has been very slow due to the Fifth Dictum's paranoia and secrecy, knowledge of their existence has begun to spread among the other alghollthu races, and surface-dwelling scholars have even theorized about the existence of the enisysians in certain works."

After its victim has been sufficiently broken, a plizeazoth quickly moves on to its next task, ever eager to please its superiors.",

Other alghollthus look down on the creatures, judging them as primitive and thus unpredictable, keeping their distance merely as a precaution. In general, only its master will approach a plizeazoth, and then only to issue new commands to the servant; commands are generally very basic and easy for the plizeazoth to understand, even if the creature's actions may be part of much larger, more complex plots.",
			"",
			"Plizeazoths are kept as something akin to pets by their masters, and the massive brutes rarely stray far from underwater alghollthu cities unless dispatched on a specific task that sends them farther afield. Plizeazoths don't typically create homes or lairs for themselves, and the creatures are content to simply graze near deep trenches for food until they receive a telepathic command that spurs them into action. Plizeazoths are usually solitary creatures, but if the need arises, the veiled masters have been known to give a pair a mission and instructions to cooperate in carrying it out.",
			"",
			"In their current subservient state, plizeazoths obey their veiled masters without question and pose little threat to creatures they have not been expressly instructed to attack. With years of evolution, however, plizeazoths that gain self-awareness and an increased intellect could become a threat even to other alghollthus. This concern does not distress their mysterious rulers, however, as they already have plans in motion for when that time comes."

Furthermore, the additional sonic damage caused by the tentacles is treated as energy damage when used as part of a melee attack (as per normal) but is treated as additional normal physical damage when used to perform a sunder combat maneuver.

If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries out quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"**Water Manipulation (Su)** A thalassic architect is adept at the telekinetic manipulation of matter, including the waters it inhabits. This at-will ability is a standard action with a duration of concentration + 1 round. The ability functions in two different modes that can be used only one at a time. The architect can force the water around a creature to lock in place and act as a solid, paralyzing the target as per {spell/hold monster} unless the target succeeds at a DC 20 Reflex save. Aside from using effects such as {spell/freedom of movement} or {spell/remove paralysis}, the target can also break free with a DC 20 Strength check. This ability can affect a creature more than once, but each casting grants a new saving throw. Alternatively, it can thicken water to the consistency of gelatin in a 20-foot radius. Creatures with a swim speed treat this area as difficult terrain. Creatures without a swim speed increase the DC for Swim checks to move through the affected area by 10 (for example, calm underwater areas, usually DC 10, become DC 20).

			"Thalassic architect is a human term for a racial subspecies of aboleth, known as uldraaghus in the language of alghollthus. Uldraaghus were engineered and bred by the mysterious entities that rule the alghollthu race from the deepest oceanic trenches. Whereas aboleths and veiled masters are adept at using telepathy and mental domination, thalassic architects use telekinetic powers to manipulate - even create or destroy - physical matter.",
			"",
			"Uldraaghus more closely resemble veiled masters than they do standard aboleths. They're smaller, being about 15 feet long and weighing 2,800 pounds. Furthermore, they have five eyes instead of three; four are set to either side of their head, while a larger fifth eye is set in the center and glows with a brilliant white light. Thalassic architects have four tentacles, two of which end in clawed appendages capable of manipulating objects. Dark bands of scales typically ring their silvery bodies.",
			"",
			"Uldraaghus were bred to manipulate physical matter without deviating from the piscine form common to alghollthus. The rulers of the alghollthus realized that their vast intelligence had stripped their race of the ability to perform certain physical tasks without lesser beings to assist them. Not content to become utterly dependent on skum and other subservient creatures, alghollthus bred a new subspecies to fulfill this societal role. Initially, the uldraaghus could move and shape only earth and stone, while they directed the {monster/ulat-kini} to perform the most tedious labor. Now, given thousands of years of evolution, They've developed the skills to break apart and reassemble matter on a minute level. While other creatures can move dozens of small stones, an uldraaghu can seize control of countless individual water molecules.",
			"",
			"An uldraaghu's brain is fundamentally different from that of an alghollthu. It lacks the ability to overwhelm the consciousness of other creatures, though it can still alter their perceptions. Their powers of illusion are seated in the portion of the brain directly behind the central eye, suggesting the center eye is responsible for snaring enemies' attention.",
			"",
			"The two tentacles that lack claws are more dangerous than its other limbs. Uldraaghus can vibrate these tentacles at a frequency so high that the tips can carve glyphs in solid stone.",

			"",
			"Uldraaghus' place in alghollthu society has shifted over the millennia. Once they were considered little better than odd mutants by baseline aboleths - useful but crippled. Two factors have altered their station. First, their powers have grown considerably. Second, their alghollthu masters have always kept their population low.",
			"",
			"The aboleths have grown accustomed to their alien and cyclopean undersea cities, and skum with mundane implements have limited usefulness without direction. Thus, alghollthus rely on uldraaghus to oversee the creation of new structures. A typical construction crew is led by a thalassic architect assisted by standard aboleths, who direct the workers. When the architecture becomes too complex for skum to build efficiently, the uldraaghu completes the structure itself."

A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.",
			"",
			"Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand.",
			"",
			"Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.",
			"",
			"In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.",
			"",
			"Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities - never without the deity's approval - or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).",
			"",
			"Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.",
			"",
			"Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child - while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.",
			"",
			"All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss.",

			"An attic whisperers haunts shadowy, forgotten places like old buildings and dilapidated institutions, places that were once homes to both young children and subtle evils. Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their lives - often a scant floor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children.",
			"",
			"Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some value."

Adults typically claim the hunting area within a mile of their warrens, ruthlessly driving away other predators.

Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \"golden gorger\" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts.",
			"",
			"In battle, an aurumvorax latches onto its victim with its jaws and gouges savage wounds with its claws. It rarely looses its grip before it or its foe is dead. It typically attacks the nearest living creature regardless of size, and ignores any wounds it suffers at the hands of others until its prey is dead.",
			"",
			"A typical aurumvorax is only 3 feet long but weighs more than 200 pounds, for it is densely packed with muscle and thick, sturdy bones. Its fur is golden, while its claws are black and sharp. Its weight relative to its body size makes it a poor swimmer, and most dislike crossing water, though they can trundle along the bottom of still or slow water if necessary.",
			"",
			"Adult aurumvoraxes are impossible to train, but their offspring are valued for training as guard beasts. A healthy aurumvorax kit can be sold for 5,000 gp or more to a discerning buyer. Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young.",
			"",
			"An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster - in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them."

A champion applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its pincers. If a champion automaton grabs a creature smaller than itself with a pincer, the champion automaton does not gain the grappled condition and can move normally while holding the creature in its pincer. While holding a creature in a pincer, the champion automaton loses access to that pincer attack and gains an additional slam attack. If the champion automaton uses this slam attack against a creature or object while a creature is held in its pincer, the held creature takes damage equal to the slam attack on a hit. The champion automaton must still maintain the grapple every round, but it can do so as a free action. The grappled creature can attempt to break free as normal.",

Although champion automatons were not invincible, most who encountered one, let alone a battalion of them, were quick to face defeat.",
			"",
			"Champion automatons are enormous constructs typically made from a combination of magically treated stone and metal, which allows them to withstand the powerful blows typically encountered in battle. Although these bodies are extremely heavy, the magical energies that power them allow the automatons to move as quickly as most other combatants, if not faster. A typical champion automaton is 14 feet tall and weighs 2 tons, though the Artificer Conclave created some bigger champion automatons to take on the largest enemy genies, with some reaching as much as 40 feet in height.",
			"",
			"The most notable features of a champion automaton are its enormous pincers. The durability of its body and the magical ritual that reinforces the pincers' structure allows a champion automaton to swing its pincer with tremendous force. In combat, these constructs use the pincers to clamp onto particularly pesky enemies. Once a champion has successfully grabbed an enemy, it remains free to keep swinging its pincer, slamming its captive foe into other enemies to damage both creatures.",
			"",
			"The other devastating weapon of a champion automaton is the automaton core itself. The potent core constantly collects planar energy at an impressive rate in order to power the large constructs. A champion automaton can focus excess energy into a deadly beam of force capable of destroying structures or slaying large numbers of foes. Although it takes some time to recharge its energy reserves between blasts, a champion remains formidable. The champion automaton's energy beam is not the only type of energy weapon the Conclave created, but it quickly became the standard across the majority of automatons.",
			"",
			"The Artificer Conclave chose all manner of Jistkan warriors to serve as their champions, from lowly foot soldiers up to the most decorated generals. The bodies of the champion automatons more than made up for a lack in combat prowess, and warriors of great skill found that their new bodies greatly improved their innate abilities, allowing them to make the most of these new construct forms. Of note were the twin champions Kifir and Orla, whose specialized frames allowed them to join together and share their combat instincts to create a fury never before seen on the battlefield. This fury was lost to time, however, as the pair mysteriously vanished after an Osirian ambush.",
			"",
			"Many champion automatons abandoned their posts once the Jistka Imperium's demise was a certainty. Those who remained eventually faced destruction on the battlefield. The rest sought other fights, traveling to the far corners of Golarion - an effort that continues to this day. Historical footnotes mention terrifying constructs jumping into great battles, seemingly without an agenda. These mysterious constructs would fight against whichever side seemed strongest, only to depart as quickly as they arrived once they appeared satisfied with the outcome of the battle. Even today, these champion automatons show up in areas such as the Worldwound, the furthest depths of the Darklands, Iscadero Island in Arcadia, and the Valashmai Jungle in Tian Xia.",

			"Of the champion automatons that left Golarion, most now reside in the city of Axis, finding satisfaction in their existence and taking on more subdued lives in the planar city when not seeking battle on the planes. Occasionally, these automatons join inevitables in their missions, serving as additional muscle when the outsiders need assistance but wish to avoid pulling other inevitables away from their duties. Champion and stalker automatons frequently cross paths in Axis, as their automaton cores have a tendency to subtly pull towards each other, and they often meet up to spar or trade old tales of battles long forgotten by history. One group of champions and stalkers unites once a decade to host a simple tournament on the outskirts of Axis. The tournament invites all combatants within the city to test their prowess against the automatons, with the winner awarded the title of a lost Jistkan hero.",

			"Familiar automatons were the most common of the automatons created within the Jistkan Imperium. The Artificer Conclave found itself overwhelmed with requests to join the group from hundreds of individuals they deemed unworthy of the more powerful automaton frames. Rather than turn these individuals away and risk the ire of so many Jistkans, the Conclave decided instead to transplant the majority of these individuals into familiar automatons. These familiars also served as a way for the Conclave to test new technologies and perfect the creation of automaton cores.",
			"",
			"All interested citizens were accepted to become familiar automatons so long as they could afford their automaton frame and the automaton core, though some were granted free of charge in order to allow further experimentation. As these automatons served as prototypes for a number of different technologies, most of the first few generations of familiars quickly failed and left their cores stranded without a body. The majority of these stranded cores were hidden away or used as parts in further research. Thanks to breakthroughs made with the aid of these cores, future generations of automatons were more stable and had the potential to remain intact indefinitely. A few existing accounts of automaton core creation reference some cores activating before their creation was complete, seemingly activated by the will of an individual lost from an early generation, though no records corroborate these notes.",
			"",
			"The Artificer Conclave experimented with a number of different forms and frames for the familiar automatons. The design of these forms had aesthetics in mind more than function, which led to the construction of especially elaborate familiars. Eventually, they settled on common animal shapes such as birds, dogs, and snakes, though cats quickly became one of the favorites. Wealthy individuals occasionally requested automaton frames modeled after rare creatures such as faerie dragons, imps, or lantern archons. This trend served the Conclave well, as they could charge high prices for more extravagant frames and then use the income they generated to fund the research and construction of more powerful automatons.",
			"",
			"A familiar automaton is usually the same size and twice the weight of the creature after which it is modeled. For the most part, non-feline familiar automatons use the same statistics as the cat-based familiar automaton presented here, but more powerful familiar automatons may have additional abilities better suited for their more unique frames. On rare occasions, a familiar automaton bears spells engraved in markings on its body - usually signature spells of ancient mages, engraved on their forms by request. Some mages today keep these automatons as their personal familiars. A 7th-level lawful spellcaster with the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat can select a familiar automaton as a familiar. These familiars serve well due to their innate ability to understand magic and magical items.",
			"",
			"Although most familiar automatons housed lowerranking citizens and worker-artificers, a number of these familiars housed more notable individuals. A number of judge-artificers and priest-artificers intentionally chose to become familiars rather than taking any of the more powerful automaton forms. The reasons for this varied from humility to a desire to escape from the conflict in which the Jistka Imperium was embroiled. Regardless of the reason, these high familiars, as they came to be known, each had their own powerful abilities. Some high familiars of note include the Judge Lord Valmen, who took on the form of an arbiter inevitable, and Urthilan the Star Priestess, who took a frame resembling a cassisian angel.",
			"",
			"Familiar automatons were not designed for combat but nevertheless feature a number of abilities to assist in fights. The most notable ability is the strange disease that each familiar automaton carries. What was originally a flaw of a familiar's automaton core eventually became a standard feature. Each of these cores leaks a minimal amount of energy that manifests as a disease known as arcane fever, technically a form of radiation sickness brought on by exposure to this planar energy. In a true twist of irony, the disease seems to be most potent against wizards, as they quickly forget how to prepare their spells as they slip further into the symptoms of the potent fever.",
			"",
			"Most familiar automatons do not bother searching for new automaton cores. The nature of a familiar automaton's body generally allows for any core to take dominance of the frame and discard the previous mentality; as such, most familiars tend to stay as far away from other cores as possible, content with their existing nature and unwilling to subject their frames to a new psyche. A rare few familiars have learned to maintain their minds across multiple cores, however, and these often work with other automatons to collect more cores, a practice that allows the familiar to live on far longer than it could on its own.",
			"",
			"As they were the most numerous automatons at the fall of the Jistka Imperium, familiar automatons are the most common variety found throughout Golarion. A familiar automaton's intelligence usually allows it to avoid detection when it likes, though scholars all over the world report sightings of these automatons in a variety of forms. The technological nature of Numeria allows familiar automatons to hide in plain sight, where onlookers believe the constructs to be curiosities or projects of local tinkerers - though a spellcaster who doesn't want to be forcibly separated from her familiar would be careful to keep a familiar automaton out of the eye of the Technic League.",
			"",
			"While most familiar automatons remain on Golarion, a sizable number reside elsewhere throughout the Great Beyond. The city of Axis houses quite a few familiar automatons, relaxing in peace as they go unnoticed among the strange citizens of the Eternal City. They tend to serve as messengers between the city's denizens, especially other automatons, an exception to most who tend to avoid others of their kind. Among champion automatons, familiars serve as chroniclers, recording great battles and sharing them with other champions; among stalkers, familiars usually act as solving to solve feuds or overseeing two hunters staging contests of skill where the familiar automaton serves as an impartial judge.",
			"",
			"The Boneyard also contains a surprising number of familiar automatons. Here, the constructs walk among the souls awaiting judgment, serving as temporary companions for petitioners. The nature of a petitioner's memory means that the petitioner usually does not recognize a familiar automaton but still retains a strong association with a beloved pet from its former life. This association provides comfort for especially distressed petitioners. Thanks to their ability to ease wary souls, a few {monster/catrina/ psychopomps} establish friendships with familiar automatons, the two working in tandem to make the wait for judgment as painless as possible.",

			"**Arcane Hooks (Ex)** A master automaton's hooks are treated as having the {magic-enh/ghost touch} property and as epic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A master automaton applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its hooks. When a master automaton hits with a hook, it can attempt a reposition combat maneuver as a free action. With a successful combat maneuver check, the master automaton can move its target to any square within its reach. If both hook attacks hit the target, the master automaton gains a +5 bonus on the combat maneuver check.",

			"",
			"**Consume Core (Ex)** A master automaton can consume the life energy found within an automaton core as a standard action. Consuming a core in this manner destroys the automaton core and grants the master a +1 bonus to natural armor and on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 24 hours. Consuming a second automaton core within this 24 hour period causes the bonuses to become permanent. A master automaton can never gain more than a +10 bonus by consuming automaton cores. If a master automaton consumes the automaton core of another master automaton, it gains that master automaton's permanent bonuses gained by the consume core ability, if any, and add these bonuses to its own permanent bonuses.",
			"",
			"**Energy Beam (Ex)** A master automaton can focus the energy in its core to fire either a 90-foot line or a 60-foot cone of energy as a standard action. The beam deals 20d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (Reflex DC 30 half). Half of the damage is fire damage and half is force damage. A master automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d3 rounds. A master automaton can use its energy beam when it is grappling or being grappled. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Core (Ex)** A master automaton's automaton core is filled with extremely potent life energy, granting the master an insight bonus to AC and on saving throws equal to the master automaton's Charisma bonus (if any). Additionally, this energy grants the master automaton a number of bonus hit points per Hit Die equal to its Charisma bonus (if any).",
			"",

The master automaton's automaton core uses its energy to rebuild the automaton's body over the span of 1d10 days. If the core is located in Axis, the reconstruction requires only 1d10 hours. Once reconstructed, the master automaton reactivates with full hit points and any bonuses it had gained from the consume core ability. Only destroying a master automaton's automaton core prevents this reconstruction.",

			"Master automatons are the most powerful among their kind.

Most master automatons did not enter combat, instead choosing to serve as strategists and advisors.",
			"",
			"While every master automaton is customized to serve the needs of the Conclave, they all command the same basic abilities. Most notable is their ability to detect and destroy automaton cores, an ability developed in case it became necessary to stop rogue automatons. Each master's frame is created with an arcane resonance that matches that found in automaton cores, allowing a master automaton to destroy and consume a core with ease. An unexpected side effect of this destruction process, however, is that a master absorbs the destroyed core's energy, which empowers the master.",
			"",
			"This knowledge soon led to an arms race among the masters as they sought more automatons that they deemed as deserving of destruction. A large number of automatons were destroyed and consumed before this arms race eventually reached a deadlock, when the masters intentionally destroyed the means of creating new automaton cores in an attempt to cut off their rivals. This marked the end of the Artificer Conclave, and the masters soon went into hiding.",

			"Today, the masters hide among the planes, mostly in especially remote or dangerous areas. Very few masters remain on Golarion. These masters resurface only when they find leads on a large collection of automaton cores or a particularly powerful automaton, biding their time until the perfect moment to strike. A few masters did not fall prey to avarice, though, and instead serve as advisors to particularly powerful beings, such as great rulers or powerful mages, hoping to steer them away from Jistka's past mistakes. Others still continue their search for knowledge, exploring the multiverse at their leisure to collect new knowledge and meet new personalities. Of particular note is the master automaton Anquira, who makes it very public that she is on a quest to speak with the other masters in the hopes of piecing together the lost knowledge of automaton creation to help restore the automatons to their original forms.",

Each member of the council was transplanted into a personalized master automaton with abilities far beyond those of the rest of the Conclave.

If it uses a full-round action, the size of the area increases to a 50-foot radius. It makes a single attack roll against all creatures in the area using its highest base attack bonus at a -4 penalty. Each creature struck takes 6d8 points of damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage. The sharpshooter automaton can use this attack once every 1d4 rounds as it must regenerate its ammunition, but it can continue to use its automated crossbow as normal during this time.",
			"",

The beam deals 15d6 points of damage on a hit; half of this damage is fire damage and half is force damage. Upon striking its target, the energy beam explodes in a 10-foot-radius burst. Creatures in the explosion area, including the original target, take 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 24 half). The sharpshooter automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Sharpshooter's Sense (Ex)** A sharpshooter automaton's core is instilled with a knack for combat awareness, granting it all-around vision. Additionally, it adds its Wisdom modifier as a bonus on Reflex saves.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",

			"Sharpshooter automatons contain the minds of the best archers and crossbow specialists known throughout the Jistka Imperium, who competed in tournaments to earn the right to an automaton body. They served as the artillery of the automatons, attacking enemies with such precision and at such a great distance that many targets fell long before they were aware of an imminent attack.",
			"",
			"Efficiency was the key of the sharpshooter automaton's design. Their frames are just large enough to house the components necessary to power the construct alongside their magical weapons. Though the frames followed a similar pattern of design across these automatons, many sharpshooters chose to embellish their forms with intricate runic patterns or fearsome designs reminiscent of tattoos. A sharpshooter automaton is typically 4 feet tall and weighs 215 pounds. The largest sharpshooter automatons, however, housed extremely large ranged weapons or even siege weapons, such as ballistae capable of destroying a keep's walls.",
			"",
			"A sharpshooter automaton's automaton core directs a considerable amount of its power to the arcane propulsion that allows the construct to fly. This energy appears invisible to the naked eye, but creatures capable of detecting magical auras perceive it as something resembling a magical flame. This propulsion constantly releases excess energy capable of burning creatures too close to the sharpshooter.",
			"",
			"The technology that fuels a sharpshooter's flight similarly powers its weapon. The crossbow built into most sharpshooters siphons planar energy from the automaton core and reconstitutes it to create the large bolts its weapon requires. These bolts allow a sharpshooter automaton to fire enormous volleys without ever lacking ammunition. Once a bolt leaves the automaton's reserve, it becomes relatively unstable, however, and generally dissipates in minutes, returning to the parts of the Great Beyond from which it was drawn.",
			"",
			"Although most sharpshooter automatons use crossbows as their weapon of choice, archers of all kinds volunteered to become the new constructs, as the automaton's expert construction allowed for perfection of an archer's skill. The first sharpshooter automatons took to the skies in early combat, raining death on their enemies, but they soon found that sandstorms and other magical protections rendered an aerial approach ineffective. In time, they eventually learned to overcome such defenses, but as a whole they were too few to shift battles in favor of the Jistka Imperium. Among the most notable of these heroes was Khimar of the High Watch, whose volleys were said to resemble torrential downpours.",
			"",
			"Since the fall of Jistka, the sharpshooter automatons scattered to the winds, intent on finding their own purpose in a world without a land or people they could call their own. Even with their planar abilities, some sharpshooter automatons remained on Golarion. Leveraging the freedom granted by their flight, these automatons can be found around the world, seemingly as wanderers. A number of them act as itinerant saviors, slaying large creatures on the verge of attacking villages or rescuing travelers caught in tough spots. Occasional tales crop up among travelers claiming that they were saved from peril by a rain of bolts, but that when they returned to the site of the rescue hours later, they found nothing. Other sharpshooter automatons keep watch in the skies, hovering thousands of feet in the air over important structures and locations throughout Golarion. While the locations appear random to a modern observer, most of these are places important to the individual automaton or of significance in Jistkan history, such as locations mentioned in the Poleiheira.",
			"",
			"Now, besides those few on the Material Plane, most sharpshooter automatons reside in Axis with others of their kind. However, a few visit the Maelstrom on a regular basis, pushed toward the chaotic uncertainty of these planar depths by some sort of melancholy. These automatons tend to avoid other creatures and keep to themselves, and most proteans know that even in that chaotic realm, the constructs remain quite powerful, and thus keep their distance. Although the automatons in the Maelstrom are few, they are generally quite familiar with their favored region of the plane, and their powerful sight allows them to keep track of the chaos for miles in every direction. Most notable among these self-exiled sharpshooter automatons is Alvara the All-Seer. Those who know of her claim that the millennia through which she has stayed in the Maelstrom allows her to accurately understand and even predict the nature of the chaotic seas in which she resides.",

These creatures served as a basis for the strength and design of the bodies, but members of the Artificer Conclave took it upon themselves to improve upon what they found lacking in nature. A stalker automaton is typically 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds, but the oldest of their kind remember the construction of larger stalker frames, including those that resemble creatures such as bears and drakes.",
			"",
			"A stalker's automaton core uses a combination of illusion and transmutation magic to physically alter the makeup of its body to better blend into its surroundings, altering features like color and texture. Although the stalker's frame consists mostly of metal, its planar-powered camouflage is capable of extraordinary adaptive feats, such as including creating the appearance of moss or leaves when appropriate. This effect is mostly an illusion, however, and those capable of seeing past such images can see the automaton for what it is.",
			"",
			"A number of hunters jumped at the chance to become more animal-like in their new automaton bodies. The new bodies afforded these hunters enhanced instincts, which allowed them to connect with their quarries on a more primal level. While stalker automatons initially used their new bodies to hunt Jistka's enemies, they quickly took to using their new skills for their own purposes, setting off on their own to seek out the hunts they longed for. Soon, stalker automatons were seen throughout the Inner Sea region, chasing after quarries that even the bravest monster hunters dared not approach.",
			"",
			"The boldest stalkers took to hunting beyond the Material Plane and sought their next targets across the Great Beyond. These stalkers chase dangerous prey throughout the multiverse, hunting outsiders of all kinds, including elementals and genies as well as angels and demons. Most of these stalkers are content with just shadowing these more elusive targets, satisfied in the fact that they can trail them unnoticed for days or weeks. Only the most brazen or most foolish stalkers dare attack these creatures, especially on the creatures' home planes. Rare are the stalkers that attack outsiders and remain intact, but a notable exception is one of the first stalkers, known simply as Mulvara the Quarry-bound. Rumors abound of her hunts, but the most consistent thread in these tales is her ability to consume part of the quintessence of her quarries, granting her untold powers.",

			"In combat, stalker automatons are a subtle force unrivaled by even the most cunning rogues or deadly assassins. Stalkers are capable of stepping between planar boundaries and reaching the Astral Plane instantly. This ability allows them to appear between different parts of the battlefield in the blink of an eye, not through typical planar travel but instead utilizing a kind of planar overlap similar in nature to {spell/ethereal jaunt}.",
			"",
			"While pursuing a target, a stalker automaton will first trail its quarry long enough to understand the creature's tactics so that it can strike strategically at a later time. Due to their innate sense of honor, many stalkers prefer to make themselves known before an encounter or at least strike when the target is aware and ready. Stalkers see striking a creature while that target is at its strongest as the only way to prove their combat superiority. The automatons do understand their own limitations, however, and against targets they deem truly fearsome or powerful, they attack with every advantage possible. If it fails to overcome a target, or the target proves itself a worthy opponent, a stalker retreats, content with the outcome and leaving its opponent in peace.",
			"",
			"Though stalker automatons typically live secluded lives, it is not uncommon for them to create tight-knit packs, especially after bonding during a successful combat or hunt. These packs take on group names that match their hunting style or the previous success such as Those of the Cliff and the Titan Slayers. The packs rarely have a true leader, instead rotating leadership among its members. The current leader locates the next hunt and the pack follows. Once the hunt is complete, another member finds the next hunt she deems worthy.",
			"",
			"Today, stalker automatons remain interspersed throughout the planes and the Inner Sea region, with most residing either in Axis or among the remnants of Jistkan ruins. Those within Axis tend to live more subdued lives, seeking out the inevitables and axiomites of the city to learn their ways, though most stalkers eventually grow disinterested in the outsiders' rigid manners and make their own way in Axis. They often go on to serve as guides for those seeking information about the planes and their denizens, or even as teachers, sharing their hunting prowess with other skilled trackers.",
			"",
			"The few stalker automatons that remain on Golarion seem intent on recovering as many remaining automaton cores as they can. The rarity of these artifacts makes for a hunt as worthy as any creature. These automatons tend to be more solitary in fear of other stalkers or master automatons seeking them out to claim their caches of cores. Stalker automatons also see themselves as the guardians of Jistkan ruins, attacking creatures that might stumble upon lost technology too powerful for the modern age or those few surviving creatures still housing remnants of the Night Plague.",

When an Avernus razorback devours a body that has been dead for no more than 24 hours, it also consumes the soul or spirit of the creature. The creature can't be brought back to life by any means short of a miracle or wish spell. It takes a single Avernus razorback 10 minutes to devour a Medium or smaller creature plus an additional 10 minutes for every size category above Medium the creature is. The feeding time can be reduced by 10 minutes for each additional Avernus razorback joining in the feast (minimum 10 minutes).",
			"",
			"**Infernal Ferocity (Su)** An Avernus razorback remains conscious and continues to fight even when reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The razorback is staggered, but instead of losing 1 hit point per round, it gains regeneration 5 (cold) until it has 1 or more hit point. An Avernus razorback loses this ability if it has not eaten at least one Small or larger fresh corpse in the past month. It regains the ability as soon as it finishes consuming such a corpse that has died within 24 hours.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Infernal scholars have long debated the origin of the Avernus razorback. Some claim the beasts came into being fully formed as a manifestation of the malice and hate birthed by the unforgiving landscape of Hell's first layer. Others theorize an infernal duke or archdevil once led a massive herd of daeodons to Avernus from the Material Plane to drink from the River Styx and feed on the foul reeds growing amid the waters of Eridanos; over countless generations, these fell influences infused the survivors with the essence of Hell.",
			"",
			"Whatever the genesis of these beasts, they now roam Avernus in huge packs that even most devils avoid. Powerful and fierce, they are territorial animals with a ravenous hunger for both plant and animal life. Their strange Hell-empowered digestion not only devours the body, but also obliterates the soul, ripping a creature's very life essence out of the multiverse entirely - a fate that scares even the denizens of Hell.",
			"",
			"Avernus razorbacks are the most versatile of omnivores, and will eat all manner of grasses, scrubs, and meat, no matter the condition they're in. The beasts prefer the fresh corpses of living creatures (sentient beings most of all), as it not only nourishes their bodies but also empowers their magical nature. Razorbacks that don't eat a fresh corpse on a regular basis lose their infernal ferocity ability. But these aggressive creatures don't wait to happen upon a corpse; they actively hunt their prey, with a viciousness more akin to that of wolves than swine.",
			"",
			"Mating within a herd or a plague happens nearly constantly on Avernus and the other layers of Hell, and gestation is a mere 4 months. The spawn, once birthed, have to fend for themselves, though mature females try to protect the young creatures from males in the grouping, which are quick to scoop up the babies as a quick but unsatisfying snack. Thus do only the strongest and meanest of young razorbacks survive their first year of life. While boars and daeodons nurse their young, female Avernus razorbacks lack the anatomy to do so. In order for spawn to grow up strong and fierce, they must hunt and feed upon fresh corpses. This magical energy sustains the spawn like mother's milk would a terrestrial mammal, and without it, the spawn weakens and is abandoned, trampled, or devoured by the adult males.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once native to Avernus alone, the razorbacks have expanded their territories to the other layers of Hell, though not as deep as Nessus, due in part to Asmodeus's strategic use of Nessian warhounds to guard his borders, as the Prince of Lies sees razorbacks as a blight and refuses to let them linger for long in his domain. Strangely, razorbacks typically do not fare well outside of Hell. While they can survive for a time elsewhere, their prodigious breeding activity is greatly diminished when they are away from Hell's infernal energies. The Pit's greatest minds postulate the razorbacks need the waters of either the marshy ocean of Eridanos or the lethargic run of the River Styx to trigger their breeding cycle, though a handful of breeders on other planes have cast some doubt on such a theory, claiming an alchemical formula can replicate the catalyst throughout the multiverse.",
			"",
			"Razorback groupings are ruled by the largest and meanest female. She has to be strong enough to cow the other females into obedience, and to keep the far more aggressive but typically smaller males in check. The females of a group wage a constant war for dominance, with older, weaker females quickly supplanted by younger, stronger candidates for leadership. On the rare occasions when a male claims dominance over a group, its days are inevitably numbered - a male alpha will eventually tear the group apart through its own aggressive nature and unthinking hunger.",
			"",
			"Domesticated Avernus razorbacks are sparse outside of Avernus itself, in part because the savage boars often turn on their masters. In Cheliax and other mortal realms where people are used to treating with the forces of Hell, some brave or foolhardy souls keep Avernus razorbacks to assist them in getting rid of their political enemies without leaving any physical evidence or chance of resurrection in their wakes.",
			"",
			"Among those who know about these secret razorback farms, rumors circulate that some of the infernal livestock have escaped and begun breeding in the Chelish wilderness. Skilled hunters have attempted to track the beasts to verify the rumors and hopefully end the threat they pose, but no evidence of razorback plagues in the wild has yet come to light. That the beasts' victims have no corpses to discover leads many to believe no evidence is to be found.",
			"",
			"### Byproducts",

			"The strange gastric peculiarities of Avernus razorbacks aside, these animals are coveted for a number of byproducts particular to the species. The blood, meat, and tusks can all be harvested for special use, as detailed below.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Blood:** The fresh blood of the Avernus razorback seems to keep some of the strange soul energies of the digested for a period of time. As long as a razorback has feasted on a sentient creature within the last month, it can be slaughtered and its blood harvested in place of a blood sacrifice of a sentient and even innocent creature, for up to 1 week after the slaughter occurs.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Tusks:** The tusks of the largest razorback can be fashioned into vicious daggers, and count as 151 gp worth of raw materials needed in the creation of a masterwork dagger. A successful DC 26 Craft (weapons) check and 1d3 days of work are required to create a masterwork dagger from such a tusk.",
			"",
			"**Avernus Razorback Meat:** Though it may seem strange given the beasts' diverse, often disgusting, and sometimes morbid eating habits, the meat of the Avernus razorback is a delicacy craved throughout Cheliax, especially in Egorian. Connoisseurs of the infernal flesh say that you can taste the hate of the beast, which adds to its delectable flavor. Not only that, the meat acts as a mild narcotic.

Axe beaks are relatively social creatures, forming small groups in which both males and females hunt together.

It is unclear whether Axial monitors are created by axiomites, are created from axiomites, or are incarnations formed by Axis itself to maintain its mathematically perfect conceptions of peace and order. Axial monitors do not seem to be a distinct species because they do not procreate or age. Axial monitors have never been observed to eat, drink, or sleep, and some speculate that their fortified dispatch stations must be where the creatures rest. The only non-monitors allowed inside these dispatch stations are criminals and rare axiomite specialists, but they are restricted to chambers near a station's arched entrance.
