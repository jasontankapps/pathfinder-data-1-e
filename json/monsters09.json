If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check as it crawls out of the hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole. A dwiergeth can continue to use swallow whole even after a creature cuts its way out. A creature casting any teleportation spell or spell-like ability while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or the effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of dimensional anchor or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions normally. If a dwiergeth dies, the extradimensional space contracts, disgorging any swallowed creature into the corpse's space. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.",

Surefooted dwiergeths leap and sprint along vertical surfaces with disturbing ease, and often cling to cliff sides for hours or even days, waiting for prey to approach from either above or below. They have a supernatural mastery over the wind as well, and make use of their spell-like abilities to cause climbers to fall from cliffs or flying creatures to be dashed against rocky walls - it's easier to eat bleeding, broken meat, after all.",
			"",
			"A dwiergeth's anatomy is often difficult for humanoids to comprehend. Trembling bristles protruding from the creature's flesh act as eyes, allowing it to see in all directions at once. Although dissection of a slain dwiergeth reveals a single coiling digestive tract winding from one of its mouths through its bulbous body to the other mouth, the entrails of a living dwiergeth actually extend into other strange dimensions generated by the monster's Abyssal heritage."

Like a ghost, it lingers on in the mortal world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great failure that has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the torment it is condemned to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew."

Although native to warm waters, echeneises sometimes follow trade vessels elsewhere. Because echeneises prefer murky shallows, sailors rarely notice one before it begins to slow a vessel. The sharp and sturdy spines atop the creatures' backs scrape the hulls of ships to which they are attached, so sailors lament both the short-term inconvenience and the long-term damage caused by these pests. Old boats with hundreds of scrape marks on their bottoms garner reputations as cursed, and their captains face a serious stigma when trying to recruit crews. It is true that some ships draw echeneises more than others, but apart from the ship's size there is no indication as to what else might attract the creatures.",

In combat, echeneises attach themselves to enemies to slow them down while flailing with their tails against anyone attempting to remove them. If badly injured while attached, an echeneis releases its victim and uses the speed it has stolen to quickly escape.",

If the number of members in the cult mind drops below half of the number of Hit Dice possessed by the egregore, the egregore must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer from confusion. The egregore can attempt a new save at the start of each round to regain its senses. As long as the remaining number of members is less than half the egregore's Hit Dice, the egregore must attempt a new save each time a member of its cult mind is slain or leaves the cult mind. If the last member of the cult is slain or leaves the cult mind, the egregore dissipates harmlessly in 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Oscillation (Sp)** As a standard action, an egregore can weave a hypnotic pattern using its bands of light in a 10-foot radius around itself. Members of its cult mind are immune and don't count towards the spell's Hit Die limit, but otherwise this ability functions as the spell.",
			"",
			"**Light Tentacles (Su)** An egregore produces bands of light powered by its concentrated mental energy. It can cause these bands to become solid and lash out as tentacles. These tentacles follow all the normal rules for tentacles, except that they function as though they had the brilliant energy weapon special ability.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Conduit (Ex)** Any member of a cult mind can channel any psychic spells it casts through the egregore, as long as the cultist is within 30 feet of the egregore. If a cultist casts spells in this way, treat the egregore as if it were the spellcaster for purposes of the spell's range, point of origin, and other functions that depend on the caster's location. The creature casting the spell still provokes any attacks of opportunity or other negative consequences of casting a spell. The egregore takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per level of spell cast through it in this way as the energy cuts its way out of the creature, though its damage reduction applies. (A 0-level spell channeled through the egregore deals no damage to it.)",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When an especially powerful psychic leads a community of like-minded individuals, that group can pool its collective will together to create an egregore. The egregore is a powerful defender and a focal point for the psychic talents of every member of the group, granting them access to additional magical powers and a communal link.",
			"",
			"Though egregores' appearances vary, they typically have a core that resembles a mass of brains, discernible by practitioners of phrenology as bearing characteristics of the brains of those who make up its cult mind. This core projects an image that reflects the ideals for which the egregore was formed - an unblinking eye to represent vigilance, a heraldic shield for protection, or some other stylized emblem to reflect the goals of the group. From this bizarre hovering mass emerges a number of pulsating arcs of light that move in a strange unison, forming an almost mesmerizing pattern with their cadence.",
			"",
			"The synchronized synaptic pulses that emit from the egregore's cranial core manifest as elegant arcs of light leaping from one brain-shape to another in a rhythmic dance. The egregore can divert an arc outward, transforming it into a semi-solid band of light it can use to strike its foes. These bands normally pass through objects, but by concentrating more fully, the egregore can transform an arc into an even more solid form capable of manipulating objects.",
			"",
			"Typically, the sort of cult that creates an egregore is formed of a small association of individuals under the guidance of a strong-willed psychic leader, who directs the weaker-minded followers in a ritual that combines their latent psychic energy into the creation of a powerful entity to support the goals of the organization.",
			"",
			"The egregore itself is a totally separate creature, akin to the eidolons of summoners, though it seems to be a genuine living being of the Material Plane and not a true outsider. Creating an egregore requires a cult of 13 - one leader and a dozen followers. Larger cults are capable of creating more powerful egregores, with stories circulating of doomsday cults with hundreds of members working together to create an abomination, but subsequently losing control and facing annihilation from their own creation. The egregore exists only as long as the cult that created it, fading back into the psychic ether from which it spawned once the cult is no more.",
			"",
			"An egregore is 12 feet across, though the bands of light that extend out from it cause it to fluctuate between an effective size of 13 feet to 15 feet. It weighs only 300 pounds despite its vast size. The brains that make up the egregore's body aren't constructed like human brains, and are far less dense; they seem to take the form of brains only because of the conceptual link they represent. Likewise, the egregore's staring eye and bands of light are more metaphorical than physical.",
			"",
			"### Egregore Master",
			"",
			"When a larger cult creates an egregore, it is often considerably more dangerous than standard egregores. Use the following guidelines when creating an egregore master. An egregore master is created by combining the will of a powerful cult leader and his followers. While the minimum number of cultists required for the creation of a normal egregore is 13, the more members willing to surrender to the cult mind and the stronger their belief in the ideals of the leader, the more powerful the resultant being.",
			"",
			"**Hit Dice:** An egregore master always has more Hit Dice than a normal egregore, though after 13 Hit Dice, increasing its Hit Dice by 1 typically requires adding two or more cult members. An egregore master can have a cult of any size (minimum 15).",
			"",
			"**Challenge Rating:** For every 2 Hit Dice over 13 an egregore master possesses, increase its CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Size:** Once an egregore master reaches 15 Hit Dice, its size increases to Huge; at 20 Hit Dice it becomes Gargantuan, and at 25 or more Hit Dice it becomes Colossal.",
			"",
			"**Armor Class:** An egregore master has a natural armor bonus equal to half its Hit Dice.",
			"",
			"**Attacks:** For every 3 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses beyond 13, it gains one additional light tentacle attack.",
			"",
			"**Caster Level:** An egregore master has a caster level equal to its HD or the caster level of the cult leader, whichever is lower.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Magic:** For every 2 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses above 13, it adds one spell to those it can cast using psychic magic, and its maximum PE increases by an amount equal to the spell's level. An egregore master can choose a spell from any spell list, but it can't choose a spell with a level equal to more than half its Hit Dice. Egregore masters typically choose spells that enhance the powers of their cult minds or protect their members. It is very rare for an egregore master to choose offensive spells."

			"An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally, however, this link between eidolon and summoner is unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing runes that once represented their bonds burning painful scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own.",

An elder thing can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes' while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed. When awakening at a set time in this manner, an elder thing needs only 1d3 rounds to rouse itself, with no Will saving throw necessary.",
			"",
			"**Limited Starflight (Ex)** An elder thing can survive in the void of outer space, and its wings allow it to use its fly speed in that environment despite the lack of air. Unlike creatures with full starflight, an elder thing's ability to fly in outer space does not allow it to reach unusually high speeds - an elder thing that wishes to travel from one planet to another typically calculates the distance and then hibernates for the majority of the journey, relying on its momentum and inertia to carry it to its destination while it slumbers along the way.",

			"Known by various names on various worlds, but most often as \"elder things\" or \"old ones,\" these alien creatures are interested in creating lasting works of art, architecture, and even life (such as the dreaded shoggoths). They possess a boundless capacity for war and egotism.",
			"",
			"A typical elder thing is 6 feet tall from head to foot, with a 7-foot wingspan. Surprisingly heavy for its size, an elder thing generally weighs about 450 pounds."

			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Each of an elder wyrm's heads can expel a breath weapon, each of which can be used once every 1d4 rounds. The first breath weapon is a 500-foot line of lighting that deals 20d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 36 half). The second is a 250-foot cone of caustic gas that deals 20d10 points of acid damage (Fortitude DC 36 half). If an elder wyrm uses both breath weapons simultaneously - such as by readying an action with its impossible coordination ability - the electrical charge causes the gas to explode; rather than dealing acid or electricity damage, the explosion instead deals 40d10 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 250-foot cone (Reflex DC 36 half) and causes damaged creatures to catch fire, taking 6d10 points of fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a second DC 36 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Godslayer (Ex)** An elder wyrm's natural attacks overcome damage reduction and regeneration as per epic and magic weapons. As a swift action, the elder wyrm can grant its natural weapons one alignment property and one material property for this purpose. These secondary properties last for 1 hour or until the elder wyrm uses this ability again to select new properties.",
			"",
			"**Impossible Coordination (Ex)** An elder wyrm can plan and execute a vast number of schemes in a short time. When an encounter starts, an elder wyrm rolls twice for initiative. Once per minute, it can act on both initiative counts and can use the delay or ready actions independently at each initiative. On other rounds, it uses the higher initiative count.",
			"",
			"**Myth-Drinker (Su)** An elder wyrm's bite and rend attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage to creatures with mythic tiers or the mythic subtype. When an elder wyrm confirms a critical hit with its bite attack against such a target, the target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. For each use of mythic power lost, the elder wyrm either regains 2d10 hit points or can attempt a saving throw against one ongoing effect; on a successful save, the effect ends immediately. At the GM's discretion, this ability could apply to mighty albeit non-mythic divine creations, such as behemoths, demodands, titans, and outsiders whose CR is 20 or higher; in this case the elder wyrm benefits as though the target had lost two uses of mythic power.",
			"",
			"**Spells (Sp)** An elder wyrm casts spells as per a 20th-level sorcerer.",
			"",
			"**Swift Tail (Ex)** An elder worm can strike twice in a round with its tail slap when it makes a full attack.",
			"",
			"**Synchronized Strike (Ex)** An elder wyrm's two heads work in perfect concert when making attacks, snaking apart to strike targets from opposite directions. Once per round, the elder wyrm can perform two bite attacks as an attack action, such as when performing a charge or making an attack or opportunity. When an elder wyrm uses both bite attacks against a creature that is at least one size category smaller than it is, the elder wyrm is treated as if both heads were flanking the target for the purposes of resolving the attacks.",
			"",
			"**Tail Snap (Su)** As a full-round action, an elder wyrm can make two tail slap attacks against a single creature it can reach. If one tail slap hits, the target must also succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If both hit, the tail's impact causes a 10-foot-radius burst of concussive force centered on the target, dealing 10d10 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stunning them for 1 round (Fortitude DC 36 negates the stunned effect). The elder wyrm is unharmed by this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Over the eons, gods and would-be divinities have unleashed countless monstrosities on the multiverse in vain attempts to create worshipers or punish oath breakers, or just out of spite. Many such beasts outlive their usefulness and run amok, defying their creators' commands to stand down.",
			"",
			"Elder wyrms were once divine avengers, granted life in order to seek and destroy rogue agents of the gods and other such abominations. After annihilating several condemned species, the dragons broke free from the gods' control. Despite this, elder wyrms have a flexible but insistent sense of justice instilled in them by their divine mandate, and acting as the judge, jury, and executioner of mighty foes scratches an existential itch. The few elder wyrms that live on a given planet spend much of their time dozing in secluded places, waking occasionally to hunt or seek out injustices to punish based on their individual interests and moods. This cycle of inactivity leaves most elder wyrms woefully ill-informed of current events, though once they have cause to pay attention, their keen intellects and powerful divinations allow them to gather and process several centuries of news in short order.",
			"",
			"Because they wake so rarely, elder wyrms often become centerpieces of local legends and cautionary tales. Especially convincing or foolhardy heroes might even seek out an elder wyrm in order to direct its vengeful wrath against a specific target, though the wyrm is just as likely to determine that the heroes are more worthy of destruction than their targets. Having two heads does, after all, make elder wyrms better equipped to see both sides of an issue and render judgment. Each head can think independently and seamlessly share control of the body, allowing the dragon to perform dizzying acts of synchronicity. Often the two heads' personalities diverge, leading to good-natured bickering and debate between the two, much to the dread of anxious onlookers.",

Few of these creatures exist, and those that do are found where alchemy is widely practiced or where mummification of pets and guardians is a part of funereal tradition. Embalming bears are often created to guard over precious treasures, but some serve less significant functions, and are merely trophies preserved by taxidermists and animated to decorate macabre halls or guard remote locations.",
			"",
			"An embalming bear is different from other animated objects in that the process of its creation includes a step that turns the chemicals that preserve the taxidermic animal into a weapon. This especially powerful embalming fluid is a deadly poison when injected into the injuries of living enemies. The main purpose of the liquid, though, is to provide the bear with a semi-fluid mobility normally not afforded to animated objects.",
			"",
			"Many embalming bears (such as the one described here) have armor plates bolted onto their bodies, typically disguised as pieces of ceremonial armor to make the creature look as if it had been used in battle.

A typical embalming bear is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.",

The ooze takes an equal amount of damage if it fails a saving throw against an effect that specifically counters its corresponding emotion (for instance, remove fear for fear or good hope for despair).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Truly bizarre and alien creatures, emotion oozes are made of ectoplasm that has somehow been granted the spark of life. Though they can't be categorized as intelligent, emotion oozes have a unique emotional empathy, allowing them not only to respond and react to the emotions of nearby creatures, but also to psychically shape and alter the emotions of others.",
			"",
			"Though they are carnivorous, emotion oozes prefer to seek out victims with strong emotions, on which they also feed. As a part of their unnatural biology, they gain a physiological benefit from being exposed to strong emotions. Each emotion ooze is attuned to a specific emotion, and the cause of this connection is unclear. The most commonly accepted theory is that the oozes imprint on the first strong emotion that they are exposed to or that the emotion is imprinted in the ectoplasm, though others believe that the creatures have some control over this bond, and can even change the emotion they're attuned to given enough time. In addition to their coloration reflecting their attuned emotions, emotion ooze takes on forms that befit the emotion to which they are tied, making it fairly easy for those with knowledge of the creatures to determine each one's particular emotional attunement on first glance.",
			"",
			"Creatures that encounter an emotion ooze find that it mimics their expressions and movements in an unnerving manner, sometimes even duplicating the facial features of the creature as it mimics a smile or growl. The ooze's reactions get more extreme when creatures around it express the type of emotion to which the ooze is attuned. The ooze begins to noticeably ripple, pulsing in a sympathetic rhythm and reshaping itself more rapidly than it does when it is on the search for emotional creatures. An anger-attuned ooze might form its pseudopods to look more like jagged spikes, and a despair ooze might reach out fitfully like a creature struggling to escape from a pool of quicksand.",
			"",
			"Most animals and unintelligent life forms find an emotion ooze's imitation and emotional echoes terrifying and flee as quickly as possible. Though some sentient creatures have this same reaction, others find the phenomenon fascinating, and attempt to either experiment with or capture emotion oozes, putting themselves within reach of the hungry oozes' grasp. These intelligent creatures are the most common victims of emotion ooze attacks.",
			"",
			"Pitched battles draw the attentions of emotion oozes attuned to anger, fear, hatred, or zeal. Such an ooze might join a nearby battle it senses so it can feed off the emotions generated there. The desire to continue causing and absorbing such strong feelings causes the ooze to try to prolong the battle, spreading out its attacks among multiple targets and paying little attention to creatures that aren't affected by its ability to compel emotion. In the end, the ooze's hunger might actually be its downfall.",
			"",
			"Emotion oozes often dwell in places where strong emotions were felt in the past, suggesting the creatures might have latent psychometric ability. Hatred oozes might live at the sites of massacres, zeal oozes in old temples or political offices, despair oozes in ancient prisons, and so on. If stuck in one place or deprived of emotional connections for a long time, an emotion ooze begins to lose its coloration, becoming a dull white, and eventually hardens and cracks into pieces.",
			"",
			"The typical emotion ooze has about the same volume as a human, but its composition makes it significantly lighter, weighing only around 50 pounds."

			"Both male and female specimens of the emperor stag exhibit the same glorious white horns, representing the quintessential game for those in Taldan high society who fancy themselves hunters. Bred for not just their impressive antlers but also their extraordinary endurance, these golden-furred deer can run for days on end through the roughest terrains, easily outpacing even the finest horses. Despite their impressive physiques, emperor stags are more cautious and timid than other deer, rarely gathering in herds, and while the emperor stags are formidable fighters when cornered, their true gifts are keen senses, speed, stealth, and steady footing.",
			"",
			"Since the emperor stags are generally too alert to fall prey to ambushes, popular myth suggests that the only true way to capture one is to match its legendary endurance, chasing it for days or weeks through forests, across rivers, and up rocky slopes, until the deer or the hunter finally succumbs to exhaustion. More commonly, nobles rotate packs of dogs to herd and exhaust the elusive creatures while following leisurely on horseback, later spinning fictions of their own harrowing endurance."

When the waters recede and Alboras disappears below the horizon again, the estuarine worms retreat as well. During shemu, the dry season, they enter a semi-torpid state and lie buried beneath the dry soil for protection.",

At night, the tiny, flickering light might be mistaken for a star low on the horizon. When the dry season comes, the estuarine worm contracts to become half as long and half as wide. Its skin, once soft and spongy like wet mud, becomes as hard as stone.",
			"",
			"Estuarine worms are most active when the River Sphinx is at its highest levels and crests its banks. Though the farmers leave when their lands flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.",

For the rest of the year, they live off fat and water stored during the wet season. The worms' flesh contracts, becoming denser in the process. It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season.

When multiple worms are found together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.",

The cultists seek out the worms during the season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used as weapons against the cult's enemies."

			"**Absorb Essence (Ex)** Whenever a creature that has been petrified is destroyed within 60 feet of a euryale, the euryale gains the effects of a cure serious wounds spell and a restoration spell (both at CL 20th).",
			"",
			"**Gaze (Su)** The euryale's gaze attack has a range of 30 feet and turns the target to stone permanently (Fortitude DC 32 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Irresistible Poison (Ex)** A creature must roll twice and take the lower result on all saving throws against a euryale's poison effects. If the creature would normally be immune to poison, the immunity doesn't apply, but it only needs to roll its save once. Delay poison doesn't delay her poison effects; they still occur immediately. A euryale gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against neutralize poison cast against her to negate her venomous attacks.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Snake bite, viper fangs, or viper rod-injury; save Fort DC 32; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex damage, 1d4 Con damage, and vulnerable to sonic for 1 minute; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Profane Visions (Ex)** A euryale's prophetic visions allow her to avoid misfortune. She gains a profane bonus to Armor Class equal to her Charisma bonus, and whenever she would be forced to reroll a d20 or to roll a d20 twice and take the lower result, she takes the higher result of the two rolls instead.",
			"",
			"**Shattering Shriek (Su)** Whenever a euryale uses one of her sonic spell-like abilities, any sonic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1 point per die. In addition, sonic damage from her spell-like abilities bypasses the hardness of a petrified creature, and the damage is not halved when applied to petrified creatures. (A typical Medium petrified creature has 30 hit points.) A petrified creature that is destroyed by the effects of a euryale's shattering shriek explodes into a 20-foot burst of jagged stone shards, dealing 4d6 points of slashing damage to any creatures in that area (Reflex DC 30 half); this explosion heals the euryale as detailed in absorb essence above. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Snake Independence (Ex)** A euryale's snakes are independently intelligent and can attack even when she doesn't. No matter what action the euryale takes, she can still always make all six snake bite attacks on her turn. Even when she doesn't attack with any other weapons that round, her snake bites always count as secondary attacks.",
			"",
			"**Spells (Sp)** A euryale casts spells as an 18th-level oracle.",
			"",
			"**Statue Control (Su)** A euryale can control the statues of any creatures she petrifies via her spells or special abilities as long as they remain within 120 feet of her. Petrified creatures are treated as animated stone objects. While the typical Medium animated object is almost insignificant in a CR 20 encounter, the euryale often commands these statues to move so as to provide her cover or to place them in areas where she can shatter them to deal the most damage to foes (see the Shattering Shriek ability). The euryale's control over these statues is a purely mental act that takes no action. A euryale can control a number of statues at once equal to her Charisma modifier (10 for the typical euryale).",
			"",
			"**Viper Rod (Su)** Any blunt weapon or object a euryale holds becomes a rod of the viper with a +5 enhancement bonus that uses her poison instead of its usual poison. She can flick the snake head of her viper rod to fire poisoned fangs as a ranged attack. Treat these attacks as if she fired arrows from a +5 longbow; fangs launched in this manner deliver her poison",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Euryales are powerful medusa matriarchs and among the most favored agents of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. Long ago, Lamashtu tricked these medusa forebears with a gift that tainted and empowered them into becoming beings of madness and evil, twisting them into forms even more monstrous than their medusa sisters. Euryales delight in destroying their foes in ways they find particularly cruel, such as transforming one of a pair of lovers into a statue and then commanding the statue to destroy the still-living lover. Because of the oracular powers of these creatures, there are tales of desperate folk who seek out euryales for answers, but these tales invariably end poorly - those few petitioners who receive the answers they seek find they would have been better off never knowing. In most cases, an encounter with a euryale is destined for disaster. However, they are endlessly fascinated by poisons, so a creature that can satisfy a euryale's curiosity by teaching it new poison lore (a daunting task in its own right) can likely avoid destruction in a chance meeting. Euryales find themselves distant from medusa society, unless they hold together a cult of fawning medusas by force. While they occasionally form triumvirates among themselves, they are more likely to find companionship among like-minded zealots of other races, particularly lamia matriarchs or mariliths.",
			"",
			"Most euryales willingly embrace the taint of madness and lovingly serve the Mother of Monsters, but there are some who seek to eschew it, whether simply to be free of Lamashtu's influence and live an evil life more like that of a normal medusa, or to follow a path of redemption. These rare heretical euryales have alignments other than chaotic evil as well as additional powers gained through their struggle to control their own destinies. Typically they advance by Hit Dice, although it's also fairly common for them to take up to 2 oracle levels to improve their oracle spellcasting and to represent the curse the Mother of Monsters inflicted upon them for daring to cross her.",
			"",
			"A euryale is 7 feet tall and weighs 460 pounds."

This spit attack is equally effective above or below water, creating a 40-foot line that inflicts 10d6 points of nonlethal damage to all creatures in the area of effect. In addition, creatures that take damage from this jet of water are stunned for 1 round. A DC 25 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. Once a spitting eurypterid uses this ability, it cannot use it again until it takes a full-round action while completely submerged to draw more water into its body. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Known to some as sea scorpions, eurypterids are aquatic crustaceans that blur the line between their terrestrial cousins and lobsters. Primeval and voracious, these vermin range in size from relatively harmless ochre eurypterids the size of a dog up to the truly immense spitting eurypterids. There are even rumors of yet larger beasts, called whale-eating eurypterids by sailors. Regardless of their size, all share one thing in common - an aggressive attitude. Eurypterids lash out at anything that might be food, and once they've tasted prey, are single-minded in their pursuit. Although quite at home in the open sea, most eurypterids are capable of scuttling around on land and can exist out of water indefinitely. Unlike rats, eurypterids don't spread disease or cause much damage to most cargos-traits that have led some captains to experiment with seeding colonies of ochre eurypterids in their holds to keep rodent populations under control. Alas, one can often tell the ships that use this tactic by the unusually high number of crewmen with missing fingers.",

An exiled shade that can see such a symbol is sickened for as long as the symbol remains visible.

Instead, the target ceases to take penalties from its Intelligence damage and falls under the control of the exiled shade, as per dominate person. Creatures so dominated cannot attempt new saving throws to escape the shade's control until their Intelligence damage no longer equals or exceeds their actual Intelligence score. An exiled shade can control only a single creature in this manner. If an exiled shade deals enough Intelligence damage to a second creature to activate this ability, the first creature is relinquished from its control (though it might immediately fall unconscious if its Intelligence damage equals or exceeds its actual Intelligence score).",

			"",
			"**Ritual of Atonement (Su)** An ez-azael can perform a ritual of atonement for a group of willing participants upon some high precipice. As a full-round action, it can unravel the scarlet thread from around its horns, allowing the thread to be grasped by up to 8 Medium or Small creatures (or 4 Large creatures or 16 Tiny creatures). Once the participants have all grasped the woolen strand, the ez-azael flings itself from the precipice to its death as a move action while the participants continue to hang on to the thread. The fall is always fatal to the ez-azael, and it cannot be saved by any means, magical or mundane. As the ez-azael falls, the thread breaks and the portion remaining in the participants' hands changes from scarlet to pure white. Those participants of a nonevil alignment who are holding the thread immediately receive the benefits of an atonement, a greater restoration, and a bless spell (with a duration of 24 hours). ",
			"",
			"As an additional benefit of the atonement ritual, if the participants who grasp the thread are officially appointed representatives of a specific population (such as city leaders, high priests, heads of families, etc.), all members of the group they represent within a quarter mile of where the ritual occurs receive the above benefits. ",
			"",
			"The effects granted by an ez-azael through this ritual never requires an expenditure of incense or other monetary offerings. The sacrifice of the ez-azael itself satisfies any such requirements.",
			"",
			"**Sacrificial Wound (Su)** Once per day as an immediate action, an ez-azael can convert hit point damage it takes from any single attack into a boost for its allies. The ez-azael takes the full amount of damage (even if such damage would kill the ez-azael), but any allies within 60 feet receive a number of temporary hit points equal to half of the amount of damage the ez-azael sustained (rounded down). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. The number of temporary hit points a recipient gains through the use of this ability can't exceed double its normal maximum hit points.",
			"",
			"**Smiting Absolution (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, an ez-azael can cause its golden eyes to flash with an almost blinding light that affects all evil creatures within a 40-foot radius centered on the ez-azael. The purifying rays of this light affect evil creatures differently according to their alignments if they fail a DC 23 Will saving throw. Chaotic evil creatures that fail the save are paralyzed for 1d10 rounds, neutral evil creatures are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and lawful evil creatures are confused for 1d4 rounds. Sinspawn are destroyed on a failed save. The save DC is Charisma-based with a +2 bonus from Ability Focus.",
			"",
			"**True Resurrection (Su)** An ez-azael can, as a standard action, give up its own life in order to cast a true resurrection spell on one target of its choice. Alternately, an ez-azael can use this ability to cast destruction on one evil target within 60 feet. This use of the spell deals 160 points of damage to the target unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw, in which case it deals only 10d6 points of damage. In either use of this ability, the ez-azael is utterly destroyed, having fulfilled its purpose for existence. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The ways of Heaven are often unknown or opaque in purpose and meaning to mortals, and the ritual of the ez-azael is no exception. In the eternal battle between the powers of good and evil, powerful angelic beings occasionally capture a type of goat-like demon called a schir and subject it to a powerful cleansing ritual in which it is used as an offering of atonement for some mortal population to relieve them of both the physical and spiritual burdens of their sins or other acts of moral error they have committed. Upon the ritual's completion, the mortal population receives absolution and the schir is released to wander free with its new burden of forgiven mortal sin. Almost invariably, these demons die from the trauma of being used as a vessel for divine mercy. However, sometimes the ritual of clemency changes the schir in a fundamental way, in which case it transforms into an ez-azael.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"An ez-azael is a rare creature occasionally created from a specific type of demon through a redemptive ritual conducted by powerful celestial beings. Though of extraplanar origin, its new existence is bound to the pardon of mortal sins, which creates a strong affinity to the mortal world. An ez-azael is always found on the Material Plane and has the native subtype. As a being formed of mortal atonement, an ez-azael's reason for existence is to continue this role and use its special status to further free goodly mortals from their bondage to iniquity - especially the bonds imposed on them through the manipulation or temptations of evil outsiders. An ez-azael lives to die in this endeavor and has no qualms about doing so.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"An ez-azael wanders desolate areas where it can have the most impact on a needful mortal individual or community. It always travels alone, and it is entirely possible that only one ez-azael exists at a time, and that when it is slain, it simply reincarnates after another schir is ritually cleansed. The very existence of an ez-azael is anathema to demons, and the presence of one of these celestial creatures draws an ever-escalating series of attacks when demons become aware of its presence in a region. An ez-azael knows its days are numbered and always seeks to find mortals in need of redemption in the limited time it has.",
			"",
			"### Ez-azael in Ancient Literature",
			"",
			"The ez-azael is loosely based on the concept of the sacrificial goat offering mentioned in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Torah (Leviticus 16:8-10). The meaning of the phrase used there is uncertain, and it has been the subject of debate for theologians and religious scholars for centuries. One possible meaning is: \"the goat [ez] that was sent away [azal].\" It is this interpretation that was used by William Tyndale when he coined the term (e)scapegoat in his 1530 English translation of the Bible. Interpretations over the centuries of who or what Azazel is have ranged from a demon to an angel to a precipitous fall. This monster is, perhaps, the first version that interprets it to mean \"all of the above.\" Given its inspiration, we have specifically not tied the ez-azael to any of the faiths or deities in the Pathfinder campaign setting, so GMs can use them as they best see fit."
