If a swallowed creature successfully cuts its way out of a dwiergeth, it must attempt a DC 15 Intelligence check as it crawls out of the hole. If the victim is successful, it escapes the creature, but on a failure, the victim merely crawls from one extradimensional intestine to another and must endure another round of being swallowed whole.

A creature casting any teleportation spell or spell-like ability while within 5 feet of a dwiergeth must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or the effect instead sends the target into the dwiergeth's forever gullet. When a dwiergeth is under the effects of dimensional anchor or in an area that prohibits extradimensional travel, it loses the abilities of its forever gullet, but its swallow whole ability functions normally. If a dwiergeth dies, the extradimensional space contracts, disgorging any swallowed creature into the corpse's space. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus.",

Surefooted dwiergeths leap and sprint along vertical surfaces with disturbing ease, and often cling to cliff sides for hours or even days, waiting for prey to approach from either above or below. They have a supernatural mastery over the wind as well, and make use of their spell-like abilities to cause climbers to fall from cliffs or flying creatures to be dashed against rocky walls - it's easier to eat bleeding, broken meat, after all.",
			"",
			"A dwiergeth's anatomy is often difficult for humanoids to comprehend. Trembling bristles protruding from the creature's flesh act as eyes, allowing it to see in all directions at once. Although dissection of a slain dwiergeth reveals a single coiling digestive tract winding from one of its mouths through its bulbous body to the other mouth, the entrails of a living dwiergeth actually extend into other strange dimensions generated by the monster's Abyssal heritage."

Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew."

Extraplanar energies warp and twist the mortal souls of those claimed in these disasters, and this eventually animates their bloated corpses as horrid mockeries of life. Eaisges resemble their living forms, but with bloated bodies that drip rancid water and their skin pruned into repulsive folds. They weigh twice what they did in life thanks to this saturation.",

Although native to warm waters, echeneises sometimes follow trade vessels elsewhere. Because echeneises prefer murky shallows, sailors rarely notice one before it begins to slow a vessel. The sharp and sturdy spines atop the creatures' backs scrape the hulls of ships to which they are attached, so sailors lament both the short-term inconvenience and the long-term damage caused by these pests. Old boats with hundreds of scrape marks on their bottoms garner reputations as cursed, and their captains face a serious stigma when trying to recruit crews. It is true that some ships draw echeneises more than others, but apart from the ship's size there is no indication as to what else might attract the creatures.",

Each member must be an intelligent, living creature. These cultists pour their collective psychic consciousness into the collaborative creation of the egregore, granting each member a number of advantages. Creating an egregore involves a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp per Hit Die of the egregore. New creatures can be added to the cult mind only if previous members die or depart (see below). Adding a new member to the cult mind requires a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp. All the other members who are still a part of the cult mind must be present during this ritual or it fails. ",
			"",
			"As long as a member of the cult mind is within 1 mile of the egregore, the egregore can use any of its spell-like abilities on that member, regardless of the spell's range. If a member of the cult mind is targeted by a mind-affecting spell, the egregore can attempt a Will save as well, and the cult member uses the better of the two results. If the cult member still fails, another member of the cult mind can choose to be affected instead. ",
			"",
			"In addition, the members of the cult mind share a limited form of telepathy: they are able to send and receive simple messages and emotions, much like the empathic link between a wizard and his familiar. ",
			"",
			"If a member of the cult mind is slain or travels more than 1 mile from the egregore, its link to the cult mind is severed, and every other member must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. If the number of members in the cult mind drops below half of the number of Hit Dice possessed by the egregore, the egregore must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer from confusion. The egregore can attempt a new save at the start of each round to regain its senses. As long as the remaining number of members is less than half the egregore's Hit Dice, the egregore must attempt a new save each time a member of its cult mind is slain or leaves the cult mind. If the last member of the cult is slain or leaves the cult mind, the egregore dissipates harmlessly in 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Oscillation (Sp)** As a standard action, an egregore can weave a {spell/hypnotic pattern} using its bands of light in a 10-foot radius around itself. Members of its cult mind are immune and don't count towards the spell's Hit Die limit, but otherwise this ability functions as the spell.",
			"",
			"**Light Tentacles (Su)** An egregore produces bands of light powered by its concentrated mental energy. It can cause these bands to become solid and lash out as tentacles. These tentacles follow all the normal rules for tentacles, except that they function as though they had the brilliant energy weapon special ability.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Conduit (Ex)** Any member of a cult mind can channel any psychic spells it casts through the egregore, as long as the cultist is within 30 feet of the egregore. If a cultist casts spells in this way, treat the egregore as if it were the spellcaster for purposes of the spell's range, point of origin, and other functions that depend on the caster's location. The creature casting the spell still provokes any attacks of opportunity or other negative consequences of casting a spell. The egregore takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per level of spell cast through it in this way as the energy cuts its way out of the creature, though its damage reduction applies. (A 0-level spell channeled through the egregore deals no damage to it.)",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"When an especially powerful psychic leads a community of like-minded individuals, that group can pool its collective will together to create an egregore. The egregore is a powerful defender and a focal point for the psychic talents of every member of the group, granting them access to additional magical powers and a communal link.",
			"",
			"Though egregores' appearances vary, they typically have a core that resembles a mass of brains, discernible by practitioners of phrenology as bearing characteristics of the brains of those who make up its cult mind. This core projects an image that reflects the ideals for which the egregore was formed - an unblinking eye to represent vigilance, a heraldic shield for protection, or some other stylized emblem to reflect the goals of the group. From this bizarre hovering mass emerges a number of pulsating arcs of light that move in a strange unison, forming an almost mesmerizing pattern with their cadence.",
			"",
			"The synchronized synaptic pulses that emit from the egregore's cranial core manifest as elegant arcs of light leaping from one brain-shape to another in a rhythmic dance. The egregore can divert an arc outward, transforming it into a semi-solid band of light it can use to strike its foes. These bands normally pass through objects, but by concentrating more fully, the egregore can transform an arc into an even more solid form capable of manipulating objects.",
			"",
			"Typically, the sort of cult that creates an egregore is formed of a small association of individuals under the guidance of a strong-willed psychic leader, who directs the weaker-minded followers in a ritual that combines their latent psychic energy into the creation of a powerful entity to support the goals of the organization.",
			"",
			"The egregore itself is a totally separate creature, akin to the eidolons of summoners, though it seems to be a genuine living being of the Material Plane and not a true outsider. Creating an egregore requires a cult of 13 - one leader and a dozen followers. Larger cults are capable of creating more powerful egregores, with stories circulating of doomsday cults with hundreds of members working together to create an abomination, but subsequently losing control and facing annihilation from their own creation. The egregore exists only as long as the cult that created it, fading back into the psychic ether from which it spawned once the cult is no more.",
			"",
			"An egregore is 12 feet across, though the bands of light that extend out from it cause it to fluctuate between an effective size of 13 feet to 15 feet. It weighs only 300 pounds despite its vast size. The brains that make up the egregore's body aren't constructed like human brains, and are far less dense; they seem to take the form of brains only because of the conceptual link they represent. Likewise, the egregore's staring eye and bands of light are more metaphorical than physical.",
			"",
			"### Egregore Master",
			"",
			"When a larger cult creates an egregore, it is often considerably more dangerous than standard egregores. Use the following guidelines when creating an egregore master. An egregore master is created by combining the will of a powerful cult leader and his followers. While the minimum number of cultists required for the creation of a normal egregore is 13, the more members willing to surrender to the cult mind and the stronger their belief in the ideals of the leader, the more powerful the resultant being.",
			"",
			"**Hit Dice:** An egregore master always has more Hit Dice than a normal egregore, though after 13 Hit Dice, increasing its Hit Dice by 1 typically requires adding two or more cult members. An egregore master can have a cult of any size (minimum 15).",
			"",
			"**Challenge Rating:** For every 2 Hit Dice over 13 an egregore master possesses, increase its CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Size:** Once an egregore master reaches 15 Hit Dice, its size increases to Huge; at 20 Hit Dice it becomes Gargantuan, and at 25 or more Hit Dice it becomes Colossal.",
			"",
			"**Armor Class:** An egregore master has a natural armor bonus equal to half its Hit Dice.",
			"",
			"**Attacks:** For every 3 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses beyond 13, it gains one additional light tentacle attack.",
			"",
			"**Caster Level:** An egregore master has a caster level equal to its HD or the caster level of the cult leader, whichever is lower.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Magic:** For every 2 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses above 13, it adds one spell to those it can cast using psychic magic, and its maximum PE increases by an amount equal to the spell's level. An egregore master can choose a spell from any spell list, but it can't choose a spell with a level equal to more than half its Hit Dice. Egregore masters typically choose spells that enhance the powers of their cult minds or protect their members. It is very rare for an egregore master to choose offensive spells."

			"An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally, however, this link between eidolon and summoner is unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing runes that once represented their bonds burning painful scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own.",

An elder thing can remain in hibernation for as long as it wishes' while in this state, it does not need to eat or drink, nor does it age. Time effectively stands still for a hibernating elder thing. If it is jostled or damaged while hibernating, an elder thing can attempt a DC 20 Will save. If it succeeds, it awakens in 2d4 rounds. Otherwise, it takes 1d4 days to awaken from hibernation. An elder thing can set the length of its hibernation when it first enters this state, so that it can awaken after a set amount of time has passed.

The first breath weapon is a 500-foot line of lighting that deals 20d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 36 half). The second is a 250-foot cone of caustic gas that deals 20d10 points of acid damage (Fortitude DC 36 half). If an elder wyrm uses both breath weapons simultaneously - such as by readying an action with its impossible coordination ability - the electrical charge causes the gas to explode; rather than dealing acid or electricity damage, the explosion instead deals 40d10 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 250-foot cone (Reflex DC 36 half) and causes damaged creatures to catch fire, taking 6d10 points of fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a second DC 36 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Godslayer (Ex)** An elder wyrm's natural attacks overcome damage reduction and regeneration as per epic and magic weapons.

Once per minute, it can act on both initiative counts and can use the delay or ready actions independently at each initiative. On other rounds, it uses the higher initiative count.",
			"",
			"**Myth-Drinker (Su)** An elder wyrm's bite and rend attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage to creatures with mythic tiers or the mythic subtype. When an elder wyrm confirms a critical hit with its bite attack against such a target, the target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. For each use of mythic power lost, the elder wyrm either regains 2d10 hit points or can attempt a saving throw against one ongoing effect; on a successful save, the effect ends immediately. At the GM's discretion, this ability could apply to mighty albeit non-mythic divine creations, such as behemoths, demodands, titans, and outsiders whose CR is 20 or higher; in this case the elder wyrm benefits as though the target had lost two uses of mythic power.",

Once per round, the elder wyrm can perform two bite attacks as an attack action, such as when performing a charge or making an attack or opportunity. When an elder wyrm uses both bite attacks against a creature that is at least one size category smaller than it is, the elder wyrm is treated as if both heads were flanking the target for the purposes of resolving the attacks.",
			"",
			"**Tail Snap (Su)** As a full-round action, an elder wyrm can make two tail slap attacks against a single creature it can reach. If one tail slap hits, the target must also succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If both hit, the tail's impact causes a 10-foot-radius burst of concussive force centered on the target, dealing 10d10 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stunning them for 1 round (Fortitude DC 36 negates the stunned effect).

			"",
			"Elder wyrms were once divine avengers, granted life in order to seek and destroy rogue agents of the gods and other such abominations. After annihilating several condemned species, the dragons broke free from the gods' control. Despite this, elder wyrms have a flexible but insistent sense of justice instilled in them by their divine mandate, and acting as the judge, jury, and executioner of mighty foes scratches an existential itch. The few elder wyrms that live on a given planet spend much of their time dozing in secluded places, waking occasionally to hunt or seek out injustices to punish based on their individual interests and moods. This cycle of inactivity leaves most elder wyrms woefully ill-informed of current events, though once they have cause to pay attention, their keen intellects and powerful divinations allow them to gather and process several centuries of news in short order.",
			"",
			"Because they wake so rarely, elder wyrms often become centerpieces of local legends and cautionary tales. Especially convincing or foolhardy heroes might even seek out an elder wyrm in order to direct its vengeful wrath against a specific target, though the wyrm is just as likely to determine that the heroes are more worthy of destruction than their targets. Having two heads does, after all, make elder wyrms better equipped to see both sides of an issue and render judgment. Each head can think independently and seamlessly share control of the body, allowing the dragon to perform dizzying acts of synchronicity. Often the two heads' personalities diverge, leading to good-natured bickering and debate between the two, much to the dread of anxious onlookers.",
