During these conjunctions, the xanthos can use its teleport spell-like ability as interplanetary teleport to reach any other world in its current solar system, or as plane shift to reach any known plane.

Xanthoi are omnivores but can survive on vegetable matter.",
			"",

In its travels, it may seek out powerful adventurers to form a mutual alliance of curiosity and friendship, and continue its explorations in their company. Each xanthos has a specific interest, and its desire to examine and catalog might be inconvenient or irrelevant to an adventurer's desires.",
			"",
			"Xanthoi avoid using their abilities to interfere or help with wars, planar invasions, and natural disasters, as they believe doing so violates an ancient code limiting their actions to observation and memorization rather than influencing events. They are more likely to flee than to fight unless fleeing would leave their friends stranded or in danger.",
			"",
			"A xanthos is 13 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 15,000 pounds. Its sloping, armored back is not particularly comfortable for humanoids to sit on, but is well suited for bearing a howdah that can hold up to four Medium or Small creatures. It may accept a howdah, but doesn't tolerate being treated as a beast of burden."

Xenopterids can be encountered nearly anywhere they can find food, quickly adapting their mimicry to resemble whatever humanoids are most common in a particular region. They can bend their wings to form cowls and cloaks, and they can fold their limbs to imitate humanoids' weapons and armor. A xenopterid's eeriest feature is its mouth - a crude chitinous beak that, when closed, resembles a human face. Up close, the xenopterid's unsettling nature is obvious, but from a distance or in dim light, the creature easily passes for its prey. Because their mimicking abilities require concealment, xenopterids commonly hunt their prey at night. Once a xenopterid captures and kills a victim, it liquefies the creature's remains in order to bring the putrid slurry back to the hive where it stuffs this substance into small spherical capsules the creatures use as food. Some evil races prize these capsules, and make gruesome liquors by fermenting the contents.",

A colony typically consists of 19 to 28 sterile drones and a fertile hive king and hive queen (xenopterids with the advanced creature simple template). Each colony has only one fertile male, so xenopterids reproduce slowly. Still, the only way to destroy a xenopterid colony is to kill both the king and the queen, and neither one of them ever leaves the safety of the hive. Xenopterid drones become fiercely aggressive when defending the hive against invaders.",

A juvenile xiao begins flying within 6 weeks of hatching, and hangs from the fur on its mother's chest until that time. Those born in captivity latch on to suitably friendly and patient humanoids as surrogate mothers during development.

When feeling sociable, they chat with local animals and discuss matters of weather and migrations with members of Gozreh's faith and respectful druids of other religions. They grow outraged with mortals who poison or pollute water and even those who befoul the air with bad smells (such as by burning garbage, casting stinking cloud, or running a tannery). Although they don't need to eat, they sometimes choose to do so for pleasure, enjoying the sort of food that a carnivorous fish or bird would consume.",

While far less intimidating and wise than true phoenixes, yhohms prove far more carefree, as though a great weight has been lifted from their souls. Despite that, many yhohms also harbor a deep sadness, as though they have left some great work undone.",

Even those who are forced to exchange their minds with yithians can, if well-behaved, learn a great deal about their hosts' culture, which is strictly organized, largely free of crime, and almost entirely focused on the exploration of science and art, though yithians possess a bizarre aesthetic in keeping with their alien natures and nearly unlimited knowledge.",

Yuki-onnas hardly ever make their presences known in rural areas with larger populations, and they prefer inhabiting the countryside and wilderness.",

To accomplish this, they haunt the people and places they knew in life in search of fresh victims for their painful grasp. Regardless of whether she received a proper burial or not, a yurei always appears dressed in the remnants of funereal clothing, with her face obscured by long black hair. Often, the restless spirit seems to be dripping wet or caked with mud or filth, or displays other distressing signs of neglect. Her body can also appear contorted or disjointed, reflecting the pain that twists her very existence. When a yurei uses nightmare, she typically creates dreams wherein the target is placed in the role of her murderer, so it may suffer her vengeance from beyond the grave."

When in this pose, zarxorins feel a peaceful connection to the energy sources that flow deep within the earth, restoring their energy. Once the zarxorin can draw no more energy - often after decades - it rises up to find a new resting place.",

When zarxorins encounter one another, they share stories of their travels slowly, over many days, and then depart peacefully. Zarxorins are not particularly bright, and might be convinced to ally with another creature in exchange for directions to a magic-rich place to rest. They are generally too powerful to fear any other creatures, but great elemental rulers have been known to bully zarxorins into temporary service, creating an army of towering hills."

			"Some zhyen are unfortunate enough to be enslaved by cruel, malicious genies or exploitive mortal masters, usually for the purpose of humiliating pranks or jester-like performances. Over time this weighs on a zhyen's spirit, corrupting it from within until the zhyen's body undergoes a physical transformation that reflects this inner suffering. The zhyen grows legs where its elemental half used to be and goes completely bald, and its skin assumes a duller, more human-like color and texture. The resulting creature is a petty genie-creature called a jocta. The change frees the jocta from whatever binding spells enslaved its as a zhyen; most immediately flee before they are bound again. Most jocta are chaotic neutral or neutral evil.",
			"",
			"A jocta retains all of its zhyen abilities and can change from Tiny to Small size or back at will as a free action (this is a supernatural ability). A jocta may be summoned like a zhyen or even bound as a familiar, but it is sullen and uncooperative, enjoying nothing more than returning to a former \"master\" and snatching a few items of value or sentiment from him before slipping off once again."

The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie.",
