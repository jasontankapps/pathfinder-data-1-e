If the dragon expends one use of mythic power when poisoning a creature, the dragon's breath weapon and poison overcome any poison immunity the target has.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Security (Su)** A guardian dragon is alerted whenever a Tiny or larger creature enters its aura (as a mental alarm spell). If its dimensional lock spell-like ability is dispelled or destroyed, it may expend two uses of mythic power to cast it again.

The dragon must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the amount the target creature's CR increases. The creature isn't under the dragon's control, but won't willingly attack the dragon unless magically forced to do so. Alternatively, the dragon can expend one use of mythic power to create difficult terrain in a 100-foot-radius burst; the type of difficult terrain is appropriate to the area (mud in plains, rubble in mountains, and so on).

The demiplane is approximately a 500-foot-diameter sphere, and the dragon usually fills it with a maze of corridors (most of which are large enough for the Gargantuan dragon to move through) to confuse and delay invaders intent on stealing its treasure. The demiplane's portal is connected to a spot in the dragon's hidden lair, and over time the dragon usually brings guardian creatures from the Material Plane to add to the demiplane's defenses. The dragon can have only one demiplane active at a time, and the demiplane dissolves 10d10 minutes after the dragon leaves, so the dragon leaves only for a few minutes at a time or if its treasure has been stolen.",
			"",
			"**Vengeful Seeker (Ex)** A guardian dragon gains the swift tracker and quarry abilities of a ranger when tracking or hunting any creature that has confirmed a critical hit against it, penetrated its spell resistance, or taken any amount of its treasure.

			"",
			"Over time, the guardian dragon enhances the defenses around its lair. As most guardian dragons have been protecting the same item for decades or centuries, a typical guardian dragon's lair is full of natural hazards and stocked with a variety of lesser mythic and non-mythic opponents that add to the lair's defenses.",
			"",
			"A mortal hero might brave the dangers of such a lair, seeking the dragon's prize, but the guardian's thirst for vengeance when recovering its charge is unending. The dragon considers any theft of its possessions an affront to its honor, and takes such an offense personally. With magic that allows it to find any creature at any distance, the dragon is relentless in pursuit of its lost items. Many enterprising thieves have escaped with a treasure, only to be located days or weeks later, killed, and dragged back to the dragon's lair with the stolen items.",
			"",
			"Because of its many victories over thieves and dragonslayers, a guardian dragon is usually in possession of a large collection of magic items, and it doesn't hesitate to make use of rings, scrolls, wands, and other items to protect itself or fortify its lair - or for instructing its lesser guardians on how to use these items. A guardian dragon might be willing to trade items it can't use for something more suitable, as long as the other party makes no attempt to take anything without permission (especially its charge, but it considers any theft reprehensible).",

			"Nearly perfect in form, action, and thought, solar pitris are revered as godlike creatures, and possess souls on fire with the radiance of creation and reincarnation. Solar pitris are in some ways alien to mortal reality, yet strongly in tune with it by way of the cycle of reincarnation. Each solar pitri is the embodiment of a soul that lived thousands - if not millions - of incarnations in at least one other multiverse that existed prior to the creation of the current one. Final expressions of enlightenment, these incredibly powerful entities have guided the development of all life for countless eons. Solar pitris possess singular focus on the development of the entire multiverse and all its creatures - some say even of deities themselves - guiding events down a course that leads like a descending spiral to another cycle of reincarnation at the eventual end of the current multiverse and creation of the next.",
			"",
			"Some occult scholars contend that there are only seven solar pitris, and that they are the seven kumaras. Others believe that the numbers of these creatures range in the hundreds, thousands, or even millions, but that the majority of the solar pitris rest in still and silent meditation at the heart of the Positive Energy Plane, never venturing out into the vastness of the Astral Plane or other corners of the multiverse. Such sages insist that the intensity of their contemplation and meditation is the underlying fuel for the progression of souls, the expansion of space, and the flow of time. Some even go so far as to credit the solar pitris with the creation of the Cosmic Fire in the first place, though like all theories about the manasaputras in general and the kumaras in particular, the details are the subjects of heated debate and very little concrete evidence.",
			"",
			"All the various camps of esoteric thought agree that seven of these creatures are known as the kumaras, and that they are the only solar pitris who have interacted with creatures that are not other manasaputras. Scholars generally believe that the solar pitris serve as masters to a number of twilight pitris, and sometimes even various manus, but the exact relationships seem to have a degree of fluidity - as some esoteric texts insist that this group of manasaputras serve Ksathras, the Dominion, while others claim the same group or members of that group serve Ameuritati, the First Immortal. Many of these contradictions stem from transcription mistakes in ancient texts or issues with the variety of spellings or even names by which some kumaras are known, but others can be explained only by shifts in the structure of the manasaputra caste system over the eons.",
			"",
			"The lore regarding the relationship between the solar pitris and mortal races is less muddled. Most stories relate that at the dawn of creation, solar pitris took pity on misguided mortals, who were confused by the teachings and guidance given to them by the twilight pitris. The twilight pitris' nurturing led to overly rational mortals who lacked the compassion and empathy necessary for true enlightenment. The solar pitris intervened, and granted those wayward mortals a favored place in the cycle of cosmic reincarnation. Scholars speculate that this act on the part of the solar pitris was the first step that led to the evolution of samsarans, though many samsarans deny this story, instead insisting that they are early forms of what will later become the next wave of manasaputras.",
			"",
			"Because of their unfathomably ancient minds and far-reaching plans, solar pitris rarely interact with other creatures. They must restrain their power, lest their very presence prove deadly to other living beings. Solar pitris are creatures of fire, and even witnessing a solar pitri shifting from corporeality to incorporeality from afar can blind mortals. Creatures that come close to a solar pitri are scorched by the outsider's boundless, radiant energies. Adherents of some cults attempt such approaches regardless of the danger, believing that even if they burn to death, their souls will be purified by the solar pitri's presence. Most of what is known about solar pitris comes from the teachings handed down to mortals by lesser manasaputras, the traditions of those samsarans who believe that they are connected to manasaputras (or even that they are some early form of manu), the often wild and fanciful speculation of occult thinkers, the feverish dreams of eccentric mystics, and the few legitimate historical accounts of the various kumaras leaving their contemplation within the Cosmic Fire and interacting with mortals. But even then, only monumental events such as mass extinctions of whole worlds, the death of gods, the eradication of an entire intelligent species, or other reality-shaking events draw solar pitris' attention. Otherwise, their time is spent pondering unknowable truths and guiding other manasaputras from deep within the heart of the Positive Energy Plane.",

The ritual fails if the portunus is not in its harbor or if it has an attitude of unfriendly or hostile to the supplicant. If the ritual is a success, the character can call upon this boon once within the next 24 hours to roll twice on a skill check and take the better result.

Granting a boon requires no action by the portunus, and there is no limit on the number of boons it can grant.",

The DC of this check is 25 or equal to the result of the boat captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the portunus, the portunus takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check. The portunus can spend points of mythic power (as part of this action) to reduce the penalty by 10 for each point of mythic power spent.",
			"",
			"**Liquid Form (Sp)** As a standard action, a portunus can turn into a mobile pool of water.

Humanoids who live along bays inhabited by portunuses often revere them as genii loci, and they may give prayers and offerings to the elementals in hopes that their ship will come in - whether literally or figuratively. A portunus is naturally invisible underwater, but when it chooses to be seen, it resembles a translucent, statuesque humanoid with four arms and two faces. The portunus's faces can be the same or different genders. They move about the elemental's head independently, sometimes facing in opposite directions and at other times cheek to cheek. The portunus can sense and speak from either or both faces, though it has a single mind.",
			"",
			"When standing, a portunus towers nearly 24 feet tall and weighs around 12,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Portunuses are rarely seen, even by those who live along the harbors where they dwell. A portunus shows its approval by granting its boon and by using its spell-like abilities to provide unseen aid. If humanoids don't give the proper respect to its harbor, a portunus shows its displeasure with subtle acts of sabotage, such as causing small leaks in ships or rusting away anchor chains. Only if these hints are ignored does the portunus resort to more destructive magic. A portunus revealing its true form is a sign that momentous events are occurring. The portunus may do so to punish a spellcaster who offends the gods or to defend its harbor - and its pious residents - from a disaster or invasion. Rarely, a portunus may reveal itself to a fellow servant of nature or fate in order to provide information or assistance.",
			"",
			"Portunuses are pious creatures who revere deities of the sea and weather and deities of luck and fate. Indeed, many portunuses consider themselves agents of these gods, even if they are not part of any formal structure. Portunuses of the Inner Sea region point to Gozreh's two faces or Pharasma's affinity for the element of water as proof of their divine connections. Portunuses consider it their duty to keep watch over those who employ magic to alter tides, winds, or luck to ensure they use their powers judiciously and with humility. A spellcaster who abuses or becomes reliant on such magic risks being attacked by a portunus for his hubris. Particularly strong magic may even draw portunuses from their harbors to investigate.",
			"",
			"Portunuses do not actively seek out treasure, but over the years, they may accumulate a hoard from the offerings tossed into their harbor by supplicants and the lost cargo of ships that sink nearby. Even so, those who attempt to salvage a portunus's treasure find their efforts stymied by the unseen elemental. Yet, a portunus is sometimes willing to give some of its treasure to those in need. Such recipients may never know who their benefactor is, as these gifts appear to be merely washed up on the beach.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"On their native plane, portunuses are most often found where the Plane of Water borders other planes, playing among the storms where it meets the Plane of Air or hiding within the chasms where it meets the Plane of Earth. Large chunks of other elements floating in the endless sea might also contain hollows where portunuses dwell. On the Material Plane, each portunus is bound to a specific natural harbor, which serves as a link to its home plane. A portunus can leave its bonded harbor, but these excursions are infrequent and usually short. Though they might be found along any coast, portunuses are most common in regions with many inlets, especially the sunken continent of Azlant, the many islands of Iblydos, and the fjords of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings.",
			"",
			"Portunuses serve as protectors of their harbors and the creatures that live there. While they may be initially wary of humanoids making use of their harbors, most portunuses come to view them as just another part of the bay's ecosystem, as long as the humanoids are respectful of nature.",

Such transgressions can seem random: eating a swallow (a shen's favorite food), trespassing in a shen's hunting grounds on special ceremonial days, and committing acts of petty vandalism can all draw a shen's wrath. For this reason, some philosophers suggest shen are creatures of balance seeking to maintain the natural order. They bring about an early thaw to a harsh winter or destroy creatures preying on local villages to return everything to a state of balance. Regardless of what their motivations are, most people fear and respect them. More often than not, unusual good or bad fortune is attributed to shen.",

			"",
			"As with most dragons, shen accumulate great hoards of treasure, most often from offerings given as thanks for some great deed, but also plunder from those who have angered them or monsters they have vanquished. In spite of their otherwise gregarious nature, a shen is unforgiving of creatures that steal or even disturb its treasure and goes to great lengths to restore even trivial items removed from its hoard.",
			"",
			"To protect their treasures, shen create immense mirage castles on or in the bodies of water they call home. These castles are often huge, encompassing dozens of empty rooms bedecked in illusory silks and gold, opulent dining halls outfitted with phantasmal furniture, and massive antechambers illuminated by simulated chandeliers. No one understands exactly why these creatures choose to model their mirage homes after human dwellings, and often the surface resemblance only serves to further confuse and befuddle visitors.",
			"",
			"Despite being solitary creatures, shen socialize more often than many other types of dragons, and on occasion conspire along with fellow shen to accomplish some great task or deed. Though such groups rarely interfere with the more ephemeral races, they are known to show pity in times of great need and have delivered much needed rains during drought or rid the areas neighboring their homes of some particularly bothersome creatures. Because of this and out of fear for the great beasts, local peoples give shen considerable reverence, and pay the dragons tribute with sacrifices or treasure.",

			"Chained for eons beneath the deepest waves of the endless seas, danavas are the eldest and first of the great outsiders collectively known as titans. Conceived originally at the foundation of reality to govern and regulate the mercurial forces that shaped the cosmos, danavas ultimately proved too harsh, too rigid, and too unflinching for their mission. Finally, when the danavas went to war with their chaotic and less powerful brethren, the gods interceded before creation was rent asunder, placing their elder children in stasis beneath the waves, buried at the cruxes of many worlds.",
			"",
			"Danavas resemble thick - even rotund - but extremely muscular humans of incredible size. Reaching heights of 75 to 100 feet, danavas can weigh up to 200 tons. Their ancient ornamentations cover most of their red-brown skin, and their helmets always reveal their wagon-wheel-sized, pupilless eyes.",
			"",
			"Since the time of their imprisonment, the danavas have seldom emerged from beneath the waves. When freed from its sequestration, a danava surfaces in an attempt to restore balance to the world, whether through the raising of an elder god, perhaps devastating a race of humanoids on the brink of a destructive discovery or crushing the unchecked hubris of their own lesser kin. And although danavas focus singularly on their targets, they coldly and ruthlessly dispatch enemies attempting to thwart that goal, raining down lightning and laying waste to entire cities, wreaking fearsome havoc that becomes the stuff of legends. In combat, the titans typically use their massive brawn in conjunction with its mythic resilience to outlast enemies, saving their spell-like abilities for specific targets that pose a greater danger.",
			"",
			"While the forces that release danavas into the world are mysterious, the great outsiders function with autonomy. If a danava's fury is successfully checked or resisted, the creature can be reasoned with. Typically, the titan divulges its charge and purpose, and explains the need for its actions, but without looking for pardon or expressing remorse. Danavas see the absolutes of the universe and rarely appreciate complexity or nuance. While danavas are usually lawful neutral, some lawful good and lawful evil danavas do exist. Lawful good danavas endeavor to cause the minimum necessary destruction to achieve their goals. Once they have righted whatever imbalance they were released to fix, danavas return to the fathomless depths until again no living memory of them remains.",
			"",
			"### Danava Pillar",
			"",
			"Certain danavas have, over the eons, merged with the cruxes of the universe they oversee. These danava pillars are more powerful than normal, and destroying one would be a step toward unraveling reality itself, so they are targets for creatures like the hundun, who wish to destroy entire dimensions. Danava pillars are always 10th mythic rank, and they vary from CR 25 to 30. This increase comes from templates like the advanced simple template, class levels, or both. Each danava pillar gains a unique ability from its connection to the fundamental linchpins of the universe, including (but not limited to) the following.",
			"",
			">*Akashic Guru (Ex):* The danava pillar is connected to the Akashic Record. It gains a +20 racial bonus on all Knowledge checks, and it can expend 1 point of mythic power to recall its previous self from the Akashic Record without spending an action. If it does so, it is restored to full hit points, regains all uses of its spell-like abilities, and loses all conditions and spells currently affecting it (beneficial or detrimental); it does not regain any uses of mythic power. Since the ability does not require an action, the danava pillar can use this ability even when it can't take actions, as the universe itself attempts to prevent the threatened destruction of the pillar.",
			">",
			">*Temporal Lord (Ex):* The danava pillar is connected to the Dimension of Time, and its multidimensional existence doesn't connect or relate to time in the same way as a typical creature's. Each round, just before its normal actions, the danava pillar benefits from effects identical to those of the spell time stop (though this isn't a spell effect). It doesn't spend an action to do so-this is simply a natural consequence of its non-linear experience of time.",
			">",
			">*Yin and Yang (Ex):* The danava pillar is connected to the Positive and Negative Energy Planes and the transmigration of souls. Both positive and negative energy heal the pillar (whether channeled to heal or to harm), and it can channel positive and negative energy at will once per round each as a free action. The channeled energy's effect is as a 20th-level cleric's. The danava pillar gains Selective Channeling as a bonus feat. Finally, a creature reduced to 0 hit points or below by any of the danava pillar's attacks is instantly reincarnated into its next life. Unlike the spell reincarnate, this transforms the creature into an infant with no class levels and little or no memory of its former life. Restoring the original creature from its new incarnation requires a miracle, a wish, or similar magic, and as doing so simultaneously eliminates the new incarnation, it could have profound moral or ethical implications for the restorer."

			"**Command Stone (Sp)** This functions as dominate monster but affects only creatures with the earth subtype or stone constructs. When used against a construct, this ability overcomes spell resistance, but the effects last for only 1 round per level.",
			"",
			"**Crystal Burst (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a Vault Builder can create an explosion of razor-sharp crystals at a range of up to 120 feet. These crystals fill a 30-foot-radius burst and deal 20d6 points of piercing and slashing damage (Reflex DC 26 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Crystallization (Su)** A creature struck by a Vault Builder's claw must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or take 2 points of Dexterity drain. On a critical hit, a target that fails its save instead takes 4 points of Dexterity drain. As long as a creature suffers this drain, portions of its body appear as living green crystal and it gains the earth creature subtype. A creature whose Dexterity score is drained to 0 in this manner transforms into a green crystal statue, as if affected by flesh to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Item Mastery (Ex)** A Vault Builder can always activate spell trigger and spell completion items as if the spell were on its class list.",
			"",
			"**Item Shaper (Ex)** For the purposes of crafting magic items or constructs, a Vault Builder is treated as though it had all item creation feats. It requires only 1 hour of work per 1,000 gp of the item's base cost, instead of 8 hours. For items made primarily of crystal, stone, or earth, it requires only 30 minutes, and the item's base cost is halved.",
			"",
			"**Secret of the Vault Seeds (Su)** A Vault Builder has an innate understanding of Vault Seeds-magic-rich artifacts that create the vaults found on many Material Plane worlds. This process includes finding the raw crystals the seeds are formed from on the Plane of Earth, faceting the gem and using magic to grow it into its shape, and nurturing the seed with the proper spells once it's planted in the raw earth from which the vault will grow. A Vault Builder gains regeneration 10 while in a vault it created or directly helped create. No attack type causes this regeneration to stop functioning; a Vault Builder can be killed by hit point damage only if it is removed from its vault first.",
			"",
			"**Xiomorn Spellcasting (Su)** This ability functions as simple arcane spellcasting, except the Vault Builder can change its spells each morning as though preparing spells, choosing a number of spells with a combined level equal to twice its CR. Each Vault Builder knows a number of spells with a combined level equal to three times its CR, choosing from the spells listed above, as well as create demiplane, mythic move earth, and terraform.",

			"Xiomorns comprise two castes: the four-legged mythic Vault Builders and the two-legged non-mythic {monster/Vault Keeper/s}. Both are among the most ancient forms of life-primeval elemental beings who travel to raw, new worlds upon the Material Plane, pursuing strange ecological investigations into the nature of life. The worlds these enigmatic beings have visited feature strange ruins in remote regions and immense, vault-like caverns deep underground where ecologies that shouldn't exist flourish. Xiomorns have little interest in protecting a world's indigenous life, except as necessary for their experiments' goals, and wage war against such races when native empires encroach upon the xiomorns' experimental realms."
