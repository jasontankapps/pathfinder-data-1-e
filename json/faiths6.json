If it must use Acrobatics to avoid an attack of opportunity during this movement, your double uses your bonus.

Anyone attacking your double or otherwise physically interacting with it can attempt a Will save (DC 25) to recognize the double as an illusion. The double has your AC, and if any hit would deal damage to it, the double dissipates. An opponent who recognizes your double as an illusion can't be flanked by it.

Always seeking to recover these lost fragments, Ceyannan gathers wayward souls - the lost, the stolen, and the stubborn - and returns them to the Boneyard. Rumor holds that when the last mortal dies and the Shepherd is whole, Ceyannan will finally embrace death themself. Until that peace comes, Ceyannan relentlessly hunts missing souls, reserving a special hatred for those who would destroy souls or pervert them into undeath. As the patron of lost souls, they are also responsible for containing those souls that pose an existential threat to the cosmos.",

They claim no realm, instead wandering the Material Plane and the River of Souls in search of their lost portions."

Mortals whisper that, of all the Four, he alone is one of the original Horsemen: the first - and only - Lord of Death. Yet Charon's title obfuscates his true focus. Charon holds dominion not simply over death as a whole, which is the purview of all daemons, but specifically over death by old age. Even the heartiest mortals eventually succumb to that looming specter, and so it's not surprising that many consider the Boatman the most powerful of the Four. The legendary force of Charon's patience echoes the certainty of mortality's inevitable end, and he is more willing than any other Horseman to sacrifice immediate gains for a guaranteed eventual victory. Charon is also the most secretive of his kind, holding knowledge of many things forgotten before his kindred were even living mortals. Despite his age, Charon has not been challenged since he rose to power in Abaddon's earliest days; or if he has, no one speaks of it.",

			"Daemons in Charon's service rove far and wide across Abaddon, often riding the Styx to other reaches of the cosmos, hunting souls in his name. Unlike servitors of the other Horsemen, his own often act in understated and subtle ways, yet they harvest just as many souls. It is said Charon operates alongside his servitors, fishing for souls in the exact same way, and that any daemon looking upon one of the thanadaemons might in fact be looking into the face of Charon himself. True or not, the rumor hangs over other daemons' every interaction with Charon's chosen."

For thousands of millennia, Chaugnar Faugn has dwelled, dormant and immobile, in a shallow cave lost within the depths of a desolate stretch of rugged hill country. This is how the Great Old One gained his appellation as the Horror from the Hills, and most of his more ardent worshipers are those who dwell in such backcountry. Yet he has no particular affinity to the slopes and vales that hide him; they are merely where he has waited for the past unknown eons.",

Many times, the cultists' enemies have believed them to have been exterminated after a brutal conflict, but each and every time, this was a misconception. The worshipers of the Horror from the Hills were merely content to wait for a proper chance at revenge. In those rare occasions when Chaugnar Faugn does wake, though, worship does nothing to deter his hunger; he feeds on zealots and unbelievers with equal disdain.",

As the empire grew, so did the number of her faithful, but even during this time, she was still only a minor deity.

			"Once, the Pale Horse rode the Astral Plane and poached souls without remorse from the River of Souls, gorging on suffering; accounts conflict if this abominable entity were a daemonic harbinger or a Horseman. Yet as the Pale Horse grew fat off mortal suffering, he also grew discontent. The pressures of freedom, the burden of leadership, and the weight of every choice shackled his heart and soured his meals. In a moment of weakness, he faltered in his daemonic nature and sought service. Pharasma offered the Pale Horse respite until he saved half again as many souls as he had damned. The Pale Horse prostrated himself before the Lady of Graves and wept in joy, freed now from his burden of choice.",
			"",
			"The Pale Horse has since become Pharasma's avenging angel, hunting those who steal from the River of Souls as he once did. He luxuriates in his duties and obeys the tenants set forth by Pharasma, and his soldiers likewise obey without question. He represents both the pain and the bounty in servitude, guiding both those who die in service and those who die unattended and alone thanks to their own miserable choices. His wrath is legendary, especially in regard to {family/daemon/s}, and Abaddon long ago struck the Lash and the Plough's true name from its monuments and libraries. Despite his apparent loyalty, some among the psychopomps worry the Pale Horse remains a daemon at his core, and that upon completion of his sentence he will visit an equally terrible vengeance upon the Boneyard.",
			"",
			"The Pale Horse appears as a powerful white stallion, missing its head save for a disembodied skull and a floating crown of flames, though he sometimes appears as a silent rider on a white horse. His home, Abatory, is a desolate stretch of the Graveyard of Souls that resembles the perpetual gloom of Abaddon, save that silent vanths that lurk above the walls and hills."

			"The Monad is less a being than an ancient design that touches upon and is reflected in all corners of existence. It is intrinsically without form, operating almost exclusively through the host of aeons for which it is the guiding force, originating spirit, and nexus of thought. In fact, due to the way the Monad creates, reabsorbs, and reshapes the aeons' quintessence, it behaves as much like a plane as a deity, seeming to exist and act outside even the cycle of souls. To aeons, the Monad isn't merely an expression of the void that predated the cosmos, creation itself, the future infinity, and the truth that binds existence: it actually is all of those things.",
			"",
			"The Monad's goals appear fixated on the cosmic status quo. On one hand, the entity seems content so long as the planes are in balance with each other. On the other hand, countless aeons seem to police the multiverse and sustain it based on some inscrutable model that most other beings describe as slightly out of sync with the gods' designs. Some have speculated that the Monad isn't simply reality's figurative immune system but rather is from a previous existence that it aims to recreate with subtle nudges that interact with the present reality's needs in alien ways.",

			"The Monad is an unlikely divine patron. Without approaching the level of detachment and selflessness of an aeon, a mortal worshipper cannot hope to connect with the Monad on anything more than a philosophical level. However, a rare few can tap into the Condition of All, experiencing flashes of insight and wordless directives as if these contemplatives were fledgling aeons. It is unclear if the Monad is even cognizant of its worshippers, though as long as a priest remains centered, honors its vague orders, and works to maintain balance, she can draw upon her patron for spellcasting and even greater boons."

			"In ancient times, Mordiggian was the god of ghouls, yet as these undead spread throughout the countless worlds, many of them lost their way and fell into decadence. These ghouls have forgotten the Charnel God, and only pockets of those from Leng who have not degenerated maintain the ancient rites today.",
			"",
			"Mordiggian's primary worshipers in the modern era are humans who venerate him as a death god, yet to the untrained eye, these men and women are little more than ghouls themselves. Using vile rituals and surgical practices, they transform their limbs and visages into ghoulish countenances. In cities where such grotesqueries would cause incident, his worshipers wear heavy cloaks and silver masks to hide their shapes. Mordiggian's temples are grand mausoleum-cathedrals placed in positions of prominence in their cities. Cities that host such temples have no graveyards of their own, for the priests of Mordiggian collect the bodies of the dead and place them, free of charge, into their sacred vaults for \"disposal.\" As such, undead and corpse-borne disease are rare contagions in cities under Mordiggian's care, yet sometimes his priests are too eager in gathering the \"dead,\" and have been known to take away those in comas or deathlike trances from which they could have recovered.",
			"",
			"Mordiggian is a living cloud of darkness, capable of congealing and coalescing all or portions of his form within the inky depths to serve his needs, whether he's manifesting a long, grasping limb to pluck a ripened morsel from a coffin-platter, or visiting his wrath upon those who dare to tread upon halls where only the dead may walk. The Charnel God's favored form is that of an immense worm with a set of grasping tentacles arrayed around a central maw; this fanged maw appears often in the god's symbology"

Mother Vulture reflects the duality of rot: the creation and new life that arises from destruction. She is a merciless and unrepentant killer, but also a thoughtful mother, embracing newborns and blessing midwives with long lives and eager students. With her two heads - masked save for her cavernous mouths - Mother Vulture devours the bodies of Pharasma's enemies to birth neutral-aligned outsiders to serve the Boneyard. Her gruesome feasts leave fertile soil and renewed potential in her wake, and as matron of transformation, she also measures those seeking redemption in life.",

She wooed the soldier's soul, and through him she came to understand the emotions of the living. Death's Consort is a being of strong passions - a commodity often in short supply in the Boneyard - and embraces the souls of those who died in the grips of extreme emotion. He is the usher of soldiers and murder victims, but also those who die of suicide, and Mrtyu feels the rising of each {template/ghost}, {monster/wight}, and other malcontent undead as the pang of personal failure. As much a fighter as a lover, the usher also commands Pharasma's defenses, often working alongside the {faith/Pale Horse} to hunt those few who would make an enemy of the Gray Lady.",

He maintains his realm, the Garden Anima, among Pharasma's Court as a quiet refuge for souls who need time to reflect and talk after particularly traumatic deaths. While he can occasionally be found at Pharasma's side, the usher's intimate connection with the goddess is more an emotional one than a physical one."

			"A composite entity, Narakaas is born from the untold pieces of souls cleaved off as mortals grew and discarded parts of themselves. They reflect personal choices, sacrifice of self, and countless little deaths that come before a soul finally arrives in the Boneyard. They understand that a broken thing - especially one repaired - is not less valuable but simply different, and sometimes even more precious for the history it now embodies. In mortals, such personal change is difficult and almost always accompanied by physical and emotional pain, and many souls wind up straddling two extremes or failing to complete their transformation before they die. The Cleansing Sentence offers such souls the option to endure terrible pain or perform onerous tasks to prove their commitment to redemption or damnation. They are also the psychopomp who judges good mortals driven to terrible deeds by their beliefs and convictions and tests their mettle to see where their souls truly belong.",

Shockingly optimistic given their purview, Narakaas believes in the power of redemption, and they have turned a number of kytons to the Boneyard's cause. The Cleansing Sentence manifests as an androgynous, humanoid form with stag-like legs, assembled from thousands of smaller pieces held together by a golden light. Nothing beyond simple, expressionless eyes and tear-stained streaks mar their otherwise featureless face. Their divine realm, Menagerel, is likewise patchwork, assembled from a thousand painful memories of home."
