Little can convince a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted riddle that might impress one.

Those who intrude upon the realm of a cynosphinx and fail to offer a tribute of secret knowledge provoke the beast to savage anger. Whereas androsphinxes barter information for the sake of achieving enlightenment, cynosphinxes strive to learn secrets to gain power over others. Often, a cynosphinx enters a parley hoping to secretly learn clandestine information with its ability to read its target's thoughts, steering the conversation toward such topics with leading questions. Quick to anger, the cynosphinx kills those it feels are inferior, knowing that it still has the opportunity to converse with the trespasser after its death. If the knowledge it seeks is relayed during clever, amusing conversation, the sphinx rewards the provider with invaluable clues to a desired object or location, or simply safe passage through its territory, though the cynosphinx rarely shares any of its own secrets willingly. A cynosphinx stands 12 feet tall at its powerful shoulders. Built of muscular flesh and sinew, a cynosphinx weighs roughly 1,200 pounds.",

			"Rare even among sphinxes, a cynosphinx is a terror of the desert. Were it not for its fixation on secrets, it would be a scourge to all who dwell among the sands. Its canine head grants it a sense of smell superior to that of other sphinxes, giving it the ability to stalk prey in conditions of poor visibility. Though it possesses massive wings, a cynosphinx is an ungainly flier. In addition to hit-and-run attacks from above, one of its favored tactics is to hover over an enemy and whip up a cloud of dust and debris to blind its prey.",
			"",
			"Like all sphinxes, a cynosphinx is long-lived, but it has a particularly selfish desire to cling to its lengthy existence, making it a careful combatant who will flee rather than perish. This obsession usually leads a cynosphinx to search out the secrets of longevity and immortality, not just for its own use, but also because it knows the value mortals place on such secrets.",
			"",
			"A cynosphinx requires little sustenance and even prefers to feed on carrion, finding rotting flesh more palatable. Because of this, an area with a few hundred gravesites can sustain a cynosphinx for several millennia. Even when a cynosphinx makes a fresh kill, the creature lets it rot for several days before devouring the carcass. Its diet mainly consists of the decaying corpses found abandoned within its lair, with bone marrow being a particular treat. Due to its affinity with the dead, and its obsessive need to learn secrets, a cynosphinx always interacts with its exhumed morsels, speaking with the dead and learning what it can before fully consuming the body. Like a scholar devouring knowledge from a book, a cynosphinx pores over both the physical and intellectual particulars of its strange corpse diet.",
			"",
			"When a cynosphinx it sees fit to mate - usually once its will to live ends - it needs a gynosphinx, just like other sphinxes do. However, due to the cynosphinx's disdain for mating, not to mention gynosphinxes' utter disgust toward cynosphinxes, this type of union is rare. In nearly every case, the resulting offspring from such a pairing is a cynosphinx. Gynosphinxes want nothing to do with such offspring, and offer no protest when the cynosphinx takes the progeny away. Before it dies, the new father brings the child to its lair, leaving its progeny a carcass to learn from and feed upon.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Cynosphinxes dwell among the abandoned burial sites of civilized folk. Due to their obsession with lost secrets and their steady diet of carrion, a cynosphinx's ideal lair is a graveyard, tomb, or necropolis. When a cynosphinx takes up residence at such a site, the otherwise contemplative creature defends its territory with tenacity. However, if a visitor approaches a cynosphinx's territory with the promise of divulging secret lore, the sphinx may grant an audience. In such an instance, if the promise of lore fails to satisfy the cynosphinx, the intruder finds herself quickly under attack. Fortunately, many tombs and necropolises have tight nooks and narrow crannies far too small for a cynosphinx to maneuver in. If a clever traveler offers to explore these regions for the obsessive cynosphinx, she may find this arrangement to be just the bartering chip she needs to leave the sphinx's territory alive.",
			"",
			"Solitary by nature, a cynosphinx truly feels comfortable only among the dead, and leaves its lair only for brief, localized patrols or when a longer journey promises to unearth lost knowledge. Cynosphinxes are always male and treat other sphinxes as inferior, save for androsphinxes. Cynosphinxes ignore criosphinxes, subjugate hieracosphinxes, and only associate with gynosphinxes for the purpose of mating - an act cynosphinxes find revolting. If a cynosphinx finds its only recourse to extend its legacy is through mating, this is usually done through blackmailing a gynosphinx or resorting to other forms of coercion or subterfuge. In fact, a cynosphinx would rather discover a means of extending its own lifespan than sire an offspring - as they view even their own progeny as threats to their well-guarded store of knowledge. Toward the androsphinx, the cynosphinx harbors a seething jealousy. Envious of the androsphinx's superior intellect, wisdom, and guile, a cynosphinx will plot to murder any androsphinx it discovers. Cynosphinxes believe they can extract a wealth of knowledge and learn powerful secrets from the carcass of a slaughtered androsphinx using their speak with dead ability. If a cynosphinx's food supply is abundant, the one category of creatures with whom it will ally is the undead. It is common for a cynosphinx to take a place at the head of an undead menace or even to serve a greater power such as a graveknight or a lich.",
			"",
			"### Cynosphinxes as Mounts",
			"",
			"Although they have the physical ability to carry a rider, cynosphinxes cannot be trained as mounts. They are intelligent beings who choose for themselves whether to accept a rider. A worthy rider is usually a powerful undead creature of evil alignment with whom the cynosphinx has an obsession, or who has promised eldritch secrets in return for service. Often, a creature petitioning a cynosphinx for this arrangement must provide such knowledge regularly for the cynosphinx to continue to grant its consent as a steed. A cynosphinx is considered a special cohort, not a normal mount."

The elder sphinx is aware of its surroundings and it can use astral projection at will when in this form. Anytime an elder sphinx's body takes damage while using astral projection, its astral form immediately becomes aware that it is in danger and can, as a free action, end the astral projection and begin reverting back to its natural form (though the process still takes 1 minute).

These ancient creatures exist solely to seek out new information and to understand the great mysteries of the universe while their stony physical remains sit idle as time passes them by. In time, these elder sphinxes come to be seen as monuments, and sometimes humanoid cultures gather around them and worship them as idols. Infrequently, elder sphinxes can be coaxed to trade ancient knowledge for more current information or for arcane secrets they have yet to divine from the planes. Finding knowledge or information beyond an elder sphinx's experiences, however, is as monumental a task as locating one of their kind.",

			"Although there are many different species of sphinx, the one certain scholars refer to as the \"gynosphinx\" (a name many sphinxes find insulting) is a wise and majestic creature that is nevertheless terrifying when angered. Less moralistic than their male counterparts (the \"androsphinx\" - a different creature entirely than the sphinx presented here), sphinxes are careful and methodical in their decision-making, and pride themselves on their cold logic and impartiality. They have little patience for the lesser sphinx variants, seeing them as little better than animals. Sphinxes love riddles and complicated dilemmas, and treasure strange facts and arcane trivia far more than gold or gems",
			"",
			"While not great scholars in any traditional sense, sphinxes' great appreciation of puzzles leads them to research shallowly in a wide variety of subjects, and they can often be invaluable sources of information, especially when making use of their magical abilities. They are usually happy to barter with other races, and regularly trade material goods for information or new and interesting quandaries. They make excellent guardians for temples, tombs, and other important locations, so long as they are kept adequately entertained. Sphinxes place great value on politeness, but can be dangerously temperamental-while they may decide to share their latest riddles with travelers out of altruism, they think little of devouring those who don't give their dilemmas adequate attention or provide useful insight.",
			"",
			"Sphinxes are typically 10 feet long and about 800 pounds. While their wings are capable of holding them aloft for long periods of time, they are poor fliers, and prefer to land before engaging foes, lashing out with their powerful claws. Though fiercely territorial, they tend to give intruders plenty of warning before attacking.",

Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage.

The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight.",

They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them.",

Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to more powerful riders, though they still inflict their foul tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb.",

This condition lasts until the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis in 1d6 rounds.

Unfortunately for other creatures, when a spider eater is denied its preferred prey, it seeks out any living creature it can find to serve as a host for its ravenous young.",

			"Most members of this avian race balk at the idea of blending in with humans, but that is exactly the goal of strix infiltrators. Their magnificent plumage is clipped and stuffed under bulky garments in their efforts to pass as humans, and they learn the clumsy speech and blunt gestures of their enemies to better walk among foes and learn their secrets. Few succeed perfectly without the aid of magic, though, so infiltrators also study the ancient concoctions used by their people for years, turning the arts of hunting and healing to deception and murder.",
			"",
			"Hearing the droning voices of humanity, seeing their featherless, leathery flesh, and dealing with their smell wears on any strix, but being unable to stretch one's wings and take flight when instinct calls for it is a chronic torture infiltrators must endure. Despite this discomfort, these quiet spies understand that of all the campaigns launched against the human settlements that encroach upon their territory, none is more important to maintaining the strix way of life than theirs. Posing as a friend and sometimes more to their despised foes, infiltrators keep a close and personal eye on their neighbors and position themselves for success in espionage and sabotage. The occasional assassination mission provides a small reward for their pain."

Draped in the mysterious regalia of the ancients, the newcomers supposedly hail from the Island of the Gods, a place of legend known only to the oldest rokoa. They entertain and inspire the curious locals who crowd around the roost with tales of their mythical homeland and promises of a return to glory. Most voyagers' tales describe strix ancestors sitting as equals beside a lost race of men and powerful elves, but then facing a mysterious exile on the winds of a green storm.

			"Hidden away in deep caverns or under the shade of mangroves in isolated swamps, sump stewards hum songs while they dutifully tend to verdant colonies of mushrooms and fungi. Vaguely humanoid in form, sump stewards carry old tree trunks, rotting logs, or other large tools to help them tend and protect these colonies while they make their rounds. As they work, they sing low, thrumming tunes that echo throughout their domain. Sump stewards-who, despite their intelligence, have no name for themselves and only indifferently acknowledge the names given by other races-have long, spindly limbs that possess great strength. Their form consists of mosses and lichens, with vines wrapping their bodies and holding them together. Mushrooms sprout all over the sump steward's form, although two red mushrooms glow where eyes would be. Some sump stewards grow long beards made of interwoven moss or grass.",
			"",
			"A sump steward stands almost 15 feet tall, though they are frequently hunched over and seem shorter. They weigh approximately 1,400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards begin life as a pair of red mushrooms. These rare mushrooms often grow in fungal colonies tended by older sump stewards, who keep the new sump stewards sheltered and well-fed. Any creatures that invade the colony are quickly and firmly escorted away by the attendant sump stewards. By the time the red mushrooms are ready to sprout, an attendant sump steward has usually prepared a pile of twigs, leaves, moss, and other organic debris nearby. When the mushrooms sprout, they send shoots out to wrap around the offerings and form a body; the original red mushrooms serve as the new sump steward's eyes. Sump stewards that grow unattended form bodies from whatever debris is near and might seem mismatched as a result: some of these unattended sump stewards might walk with a limp, bear additional limbs, or have forms that incorporate bones or rocks.",
			"",
			"While sump stewards' bodies can look rather hodgepodge, they are resilient and strong. The vines that wrap their bodies regrow quickly and knit a sump steward back together with remarkable speed. While not inherently violent, sump stewards don't hesitate to use their strength to protect their domain, encouraging local plants to restrain and delay intruders. If lethal force is required, they can use their oversized farming implements as greatclubs and expel clouds of poisonous spores that functions as the cloudkill spell. Goblins and other underground races tend to avoid sump steward colonies, venturing into them only under dire circumstances.",
			"",
			"Arcano-botanists posit that all sump stewards are biological duplicates of one original organism, spreading asexually via their spores for thousands or millions of years all across Golarion. It is unknown how long an individual sump steward lives, but an elven explorer reported meeting the same sump steward 800 years apart. It's even possible that the original sump steward is still alive, tending to some remote colony to this day.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sump stewards are social creatures; a group of sump stewards is called a choir because they sing together. Every sump steward in a choir sings its own unique song, and when the voices come together, the subtly different melodies build upon one another in a haunting music that echoes throughout their domain. Sump stewards' social structures are intensely hierarchical. The eldest in a choir speaks for - and makes binding decisions for - every sump steward in the choir.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards live primarily underground or deep in primeval forests and swamps, although they can be found anywhere they can manage to grow their colonies. While a single sump steward might tend to a relatively small colony, a choir of sump stewards might have a domain that encompasses many square miles. These fungal forests have their own unique ecology: various slimes, jellies, and oozes make their home among the stalks of giant mushrooms, while large packs of fungal crawlers scamper along the floor. Giant slugs sometimes live within a colony, as they are attracted to and pacified by sump steward songs.",
			"",
			"Sump stewards have a longstanding but puzzling rivalry with treants. Entire choirs have been observed to travel far from their colonies to attack a treant grove, leaving their treasures and young sump stewards unguarded as they wage these attacks. Treants don't share this violent animosity, but they think poorly of sump stewards, likening them to parasites or blights on nature. The source of this intense enmity isn't clear; sump stewards and treants rarely inhabit the same areas, so they don't typically compete for resources. Sump stewards don't take much stock in what other creatures think of them, so it's unlikely that treants' dismissive attitude toward sump stewards is sufficient to generate this ire. Whatever the reason, sump stewards and treants never cooperate, and they usually come to blows if they encounter one another.",

			"",
			"Kaer Maga: One of the most notable colonies of sump stewards is located under Kaer Maga, in the deep and mysterious chasm called Nursery Trench. This chasm is so choked with fungal growth that it is nearly impassable, although the form of an overgrown cathedral is barely visible at the chasm's lowest point. The choir of sump stewards in Nursery Trench is headed by a steward called Calando Mosswort. It's said that the cathedral Calando's choir guards holds secrets from before Earthfall.",
			"",
			"Mindspin Mountains: A sump steward known as Lichenback leads a choir in eastern Varisia. Dwarven traders occasionally pass through Lichenback's large colony in the Mindspin Mountains. Lichenback lets travelers pass if they give up a token, which the sump steward adds to an impressive collection of mementos in a collapsed tower choked with fungus.",
			"",
			"Fangwood: Fluge Darkwood leads an exceptionally large choir in the Fangwood Forest, near the strange blight that pervades the forest's heart. It's unknown if Fluge's choir has been corrupted by Arlantia, or if they simply find the blight more hospitable for rampant fungal growth. Rumors persist that the sump stewards' songs echoing through the Fangwood are paeans to the horrid god Cyth-V-sug."

			"Sun falcons are birds of omen in Osirion, with a reputation that goes back to the days of the nation's most ancient gods. In many myths and stories, sun falcons act as the eyes of many deities, though most commonly for Ra, who considers these birds to be among his holy creatures on Golarion. Sun falcons seem to watch over important people and oversee noteworthy events-sometimes from far enough away to be mistaken as a star visible during the day, sometimes from close enough to appear as a second sun. Today, the ancient gods are largely forgotten, but sun falcons still gravitate toward Osirion's heroes and pharaohs, suggesting that these abandoned gods are not so distant.",
			"",
			"A typical full-grown sun falcon weighs 2 to 3 pounds and measures 18 inches from beak to tail, with a wingspan approaching 5 feet.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that the brilliant plumage of sun falcons wasn't a natural or even a magical evolution so much as it was divine gift, granted by Ra in the first days of these favored birds' existence. Ancient papyrus scrolls and carvings found in ruins claim the ancient gods of Osirion desired a way to inform mortals they were being observed, and so Ra created the first sun falcons from common desert falcons, imbuing them with his power to shine as bright as the desert sun so as to be seen across the land. This divine gift suffuses every feather on their bodies. Individual lost or stolen feathers shed light as a candle for up to 7 days after being detached, and are often in high demand to accent elegant attire for the upper class.",
			"",
			"Despite being creatures blessed with the heat of the sun, sun falcons are mortal and require normal sustenance to survive. To avoid reducing their captured prey to unpalatable ash, sun falcons vent gouts of fire from within, slowly lowering their body in temperature to a level that allows them to consume their meals without first incinerating them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Sun falcons live deep within the deserts of Osirion, though they aren't unknown in Thuvia or even as far west as Rahadoum. They build nests atop rocky outcroppings from gravel, pebbles, and shards of metal capable of withstanding their natural heat, but often abandon their nests only months after creation. How long a particular nest has been inhabited can be identified by the darkness of the rocks it is made from. The stones from particularly well-used nests may even have begun to fuse together from the heat, and are typically lined with crude glass formed from melted desert sand. Some enterprising folk collect these abandoned nests wherever they can be found, and sell them in bazaars throughout the desert lands. But as a typical sun falcon may build dozens if not hundreds of these nests over the course of its life, only the most heavily used or otherwise impressive nests have any real value.",
			"",
			"So long as a sun falcon remains in a particular nest, it ranges for hundreds of miles in search of prey, primarily desert rodents and other small birds, though they have occasionally been known to attack much larger prey. When fighting anything larger than itself, it begins the attack by making several passes close overhead, relying on its inborn radiance to scorch and exhaust its prey before diving in for the killing blow.",
			"",
			"Sun falcons are only aggressive when hunting or provoked. Most often, this provocation comes from opportunistic profiteers searching for abandoned nests or molted feathers. An aggravated sun falcon takes to the sky, and over the course of several days it might attack everything it sees-stranding travelers, setting caravans ablaze, and even drying up oases in its rage. When fighting, a sun falcon usually opens combat with its blinding flash ability to confound its victim's senses. Following this initial attack, the sun falcon keeps its distance and uses its breath weapon. It then uses Flyby Attack to strafe its target and remain out of the creature's grasp. If its fiery attacks don't seem to affect its victim, the sun falcon disengages from the fight and moves on.",

			"Sun falcons have few natural predators, and they are canny enough to easily avoid most mundane hunters. Their ability to fly protects them from most desert predators, and their natural talents with heat and fire help them fend off any other foolish creatures. The biggest threat to sun falcons comes from efreet who walk the deserts of northern Garund. Immune to many of the sun falcons' attacks, efreet hunt sun falcons for sport as if they were common pheasants, dining on the creatures and using their radiant plumage as decorations on their clothing and armor.",
			"",
			"The mating habits of sun falcons have long confounded scholars, as every member of the species ever examined has been a mature female, carrying a single already fertilized egg. Because of the birds' association with Ra, some postulate that these eggs are divinely fertilized, though sun falcons are capable of breeding with males of other falcon species, and the result of these unions is always a baby sun falcon. This method of reproduction creates slight variations in the appearance of offspring, but the creatures' abilities are the same.",
			"",
			"A sun falcon lays these eggs on an annual cycle, and each bird has its own cycle. It takes approximately a month for an egg to hatch once it has been laid, and a chick reaches full maturity after only 2 months. Sun falcons are often born already capable of flight. Until the chick matures, it hunts alongside its mother as she teaches the fledgling vital skills. After reaching maturity, the young sun falcon departs into the desert to build its first nest and begin its own cycle.",
			"",
			"The only exceptions to this rule are when a sun falcon bonds to another creature. The subject of this bond is typically a humanoid who is suspected to have some great destiny in store. A sun falcon doesn't live with its bonded creature or even have much direct contact, but it keeps nearby, flying above the village or city the person lives in or trailing the person in her travels if she happens to be a desert nomad or leaves her native lands. This bonding process has proven flawed as often as not in the current Age of Lost Omens - though the falcon follows this creature for the remainder of its life, the bonded person is no more likely to have a great future in store for him then might any other. While some skeptics claim that those who believe this legend grant such chosen individuals more chances than they would otherwise receive, artificially inflating their chance of success, others' beliefs also result in unrealistic expectations that these \"blessed\" individuals constantly fail to meet, which can lead them to instead despair or be rejected by the public."

They are among the most populous denizens of the upper reaches of the endless caverns of the underworld, equally at home raiding the settlements of those who dwell above or below ground, yet for all their race's fecundity and sprawl, as a whole they represent only a minor threat. At times, great leaders can draw legions of troglodytes to their command to create vast and deadly armies, but left to their own devices, troglodyte tribes are content to keep each other under control with numerous feuds, cannibalistic raids, and bitter civil wars.",
			"",
			"The troglodyte is one of the oldest of intelligent races, and ruins found in some remote caverns testify to the fact that their empire was once among the largest in the world. At the dawn of time, the troglodyte civilization was generations ahead of other humanoid races-while those races hid in caves and worshiped fire, the troglodytes raised vast cities of stone ziggurats and twisting canals, kept other races as slaves, and worshiped ancient and inhuman gods and demons. Yet as the other races evolved and grew increasingly civilized, they outstripped their one-time troglodyte oppressors. Today, the roles have changed-now it is the troglodyte that hides in caves and lives the life of a feral savage.",

A troglodyte chieftain is not always a cleric or druid, but those who do not have divine power are usually mere mouthpieces and puppet lords that answer to the beck and call of the local seer or shaman. Troglodytes generally worship one of the countless demon lords, particularly those of a reptilian or primeval shape and form or those whose Abyssal domains most closely resemble the tangled caverns troglodytes prefer. Troglodyte druids are usually neutral evil if they dwell with their own kind (and are universally feared and respected for the eerie command they have over beasts).",

These ancient troglodytes went into hiding in the deep places of the world, and though many of them perished, fled to other planes, or retreated into lichdom, a few sought refuge in magical stasis. Over the long centuries, troglodyte paragons have from time to time awakened from their magical slumber. Though some have sought out modern troglodytes in an effort to elevate them and reclaim the glory of their lost civilization, most troglodyte paragons despise their degenerate descendants. Distinguished from common troglodytes by their glowing, emerald eyes and goldtinged scales, troglodyte paragons are long-lived, with maximum lifespans averaging 400 years.

This stops, however, at getting a warmer position for their eggs. A leader who tries to destroy a rival's eggs by pressuring or bribing a warren guard almost invariably draws that guard's wrath. These hulking, savage troglodytes fight with only tooth and claw. They're devoted to guarding the egg clutches, and leave their warrens only if all of the eggs have been destroyed.

All trolls spend most of their time hunting for food, as they must consume vast amounts each day or face starvation.

These injuries rarely set properly, leaving most canopy trolls in constant pain, worsening their already vicious attitudes.

Rather than the vestigial tails most trolls sport, theirs are long and flexible, allowing a canopy troll to hang from a branch, and the tail sports a sharp claw on the end capable of delivering the troll's unusual venom.",

They are omnivores and survive on fruit, leaves, and insects during lean times; like all trolls, though, they vastly prefer fresh meat to help fuel their legendary regeneration. Left unchecked, a troop can strip a forest valley of animal life within a few months - or depopulate a small town - before moving on.",
			"",
			"Female canopy trolls give birth to twins after a 3-month pregnancy and select the stronger of the pair within the first few days, eating the second to ensure they provide ample nutrition for the remaining, nursing child. Young cling to their mother's back for the first 6 months of life, after which they are fast and coordinated enough to keep up with the rest of the troop as they swing through the trees. Canopy troll cannibalism isn't limited to newborns; the creatures' preferred method of dealing with old or sickly members of the troop is to fall upon them and feast on the regenerating morsels.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Troll}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Canopy trolls are strictly arboreal, living in the thick branches high above the forest floor. Like the similar moss troll, they rarely set foot on solid ground; many canopy trolls exhibit a mild phobia of the surface, retreating to the trees if knocked groundward in a fight. Their similarities to moss trolls end at their shared terrain, however, as the smaller brutes lack the cunning and innate magic of their larger kin. Though somewhat common west of Lake Encarthan, canopy trolls are rare beyond the Fangwood Forest and smaller woods in the immediate vicinity. They are sensitive to both heat and cold, and quickly fall ill in drier climes. Some rangers insist the creatures hail from the First World, but nearly all strange happenings in the Fangwood are attributed to the mysterious fey realm, and canopy trolls are simply highly specialized for their very specific environment. Rumors place a similar breed of small, arboreal trolls - chimney trolls - in Ustalav, and a more robust cousin of the canopy trolls, called vavanis, terrorizes the jungles of Vudra.",
			"",
			"Despite their barest semblance of intellect, canopy trolls show unusual curiosity, and love to pull things apart - animals and humanoids included - to see what may be inside. They find mechanisms and musical instruments especially fascinating, and an entire troop may take to fighting with each other over a newly discovered harp or horn. They also like to adorn themselves with finery, though any treasures they gather rarely last long as the creatures swing through the branches and pile into their filthy nests. Generally, only magical treasures and small pieces of jewelry retain any value after more than a day in the hands of a canopy troll. This same curiosity makes the creatures especially vulnerable to so-called monkey traps, as once they take hold of a valuable, they rarely willingly let go; clever hunters can snare the monsters simply by dropping shiny coins into a hole just large enough to slide a troll hand into - and too small to pull a coin-filled fist back through. They speak a pidgin of Giant, composed largely of insults and vulgarities, as well as a number of words for food.",
			"",
			"Canopy trolls are simpleminded even compared to average trolls, living more like animals than humanoids in ape-like troops. A troop selects the largest tree in its territory as a nest site, building rough nests of leaves and grasses and dangling ugly dolls tied from animal bones into the branches. Canopy trolls have little concern for one another, flocking together simply because their preferred hunting tactic - piling onto a single creature until the poor beast can barely move or breathe under the weight - requires large numbers. They hash out a rough pecking order through constant bullying, and after large meals the troop generally falls to infighting to more formally determine the leader for the next few days. Affection and compassion are alien concepts, with each member of the group constantly sniffing out weaknesses to exploit in its neighbors. Troops sometimes gather around an outsider - usually a larger troll but occasionally another large predator - deferring to that individual as temporary leader until they grow restless, hungry, or bored, whereupon they turn their provisional leader into a meal.",

			"Flood trolls are the mutated runts of scrag broods, cast out by their mothers and destined to haunt the lonely valleys and river basins beneath Avistan's frosty peaks. They lurk amid the craggy hills of Belkzen, Varisia, and other wildlands of northern Avistan, and serve as a menace to orc raiders and human adventurers alike. While smaller and less organized than true scrags, flood trolls' solitary nature and desperation for food often drives them to commit atrocities upon unsuspecting humanoid populations-atrocities that almost invariably end with the flood trolls' eventual capture and execution.",
			"",
			"Flood trolls average 7-1/2 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Flood trolls are not actual trolls in the truest sense of the word. Although flood trolls-like their scrag parents' are distantly related to mountain trolls, the species are distinct. Most humanoid societies, however, are content to simply refer to both scrags and trolls using the umbrella term \"troll,\" linking the species because of overlapping myths and their similar regenerative abilities.",
			"",
			"Scrag mothers birth anywhere from two to six younglings in a single brood, and every brood has a small chance of including what the scrags call an aruktaii - half-scrag in the Giant tongue - known to many civilized peoples as a flood troll. Scrags with larger broods have a higher chance of producing flood trolls among their young. These runts are invariably smaller and more frail than true scrag younglings, and their growth rate is significantly slower than their non-mutated kin. This makes them undesirable to their scrag mothers and more likely to be eaten by their stronger siblings. Those flood trolls who aren't simply abandoned to the wilds by their mothers are raised as lesser beings, and live in the shadows of their scrag brothers and sisters. Most flood trolls flee their aggressive broodmates before coming of age, preferring to fend for themselves in the terrors of the wilderness rather than deal with their cruel, savage family members.",
			"",
			"The mutation that results in a flood troll stymies many of the racial abilities typical to scrags. For one, flood trolls lack the amphibious special quality, making them much less suited to hunting underwater. Unfortunately for them, flood trolls still rely on exposure to water to enable their regenerative properties, meaning they must dwell near water but never wholly within it. Not just any water will do, either-only water that is continually refreshed with minerals and oxygen can regenerate flood trolls. Stagnant or relatively still waters such as small lakes and ponds cannot provide the nutrients flood troll regeneration requires, which means these monsters tend to stay near active waterways and areas with high precipitation where they can find the flowing water and rainfall that helps them to survive.",
			"",
			"The mutation that results in a flood troll also affects the creature's reproductive organs, rendering it sterile. Because they cannot reproduce, flood trolls rarely seek out mates or even partners to aid in the hunt. Instead, they lead solitary existences steeped in ire for all living things; they are born amid hatred and rejection, and expect to die the same way.",
			"",
			"In rare instances, a scrag mother may produce flood troll twins. In keeping with their primitive superstitions, scrags believe the arrival of two flood trolls is a dire omen that signals the coming of storms and floods, and cannot be dealt with by simply tossing the younglings away. Instead, the scrags believe, in order to appease the dread deities that they believe control the weather and the flow of rivers into their aquatic homes, the scrags must raise aruk-taii twins, aruk-taikii, as they would raise their true scrag offspring. The scrag mother-along with the other female scrags in her group-raises and nurtures the twins as best as she is able, albeit with grudging reluctance. In fact, the association between aruk-taikii and inclement weather in these old scrag myths is what originally inspired human adventurers to name the beasts flood trolls.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Troll}",

			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Flood trolls are monstrous nomads-wandering hunters who follow the herds of game and pay close attention to humanoids' travel patterns as they journey between the distant settlements of northern Avistan. They are cunning by necessity, since they are smaller than their brethren and must often surprise their prey to earn their meals. While not afraid to pounce on their victims once they can catch them, most flood trolls prefer to use stealth tactics and crude traps to put prospective victims in hazardous situations before attempting an ambush.",
			"",
			"Scrag mothers eject their flood troll spawn from the brood as soon as the youngling's hormonal mutation makes itself known, which typically occurs a couple of years after the brood is born. Abandoned aruk-taii younglings survive in the wilds by sticking close to a river or freshwater source, and those who fail to find fresh water typically fall prey to wolves or other predators. Solitary by circumstance, flood trolls are seen in pairs only rarely, and usually because the two are twins. Because flood troll twins are pampered and treated with care by their scrag mother (rather than being abused and ostracized), these specimens tend to be more intelligent and creative than their solitary kin. Some flood trolls even learn how to wield arms or poison daggers; woe betide anyone who feels the sting of an aruk-taii rogue's dirk - if not for the blade, then for the savage claws that come afterward.",
			"",
			"Because they can survive in arid environments for longer periods, flood trolls are much more common in Belkzen than their scrag forebears. The orcs of Belkzen claim that flood trolls wander over the Mindspin and Kodar mountain ranges, fleeing their scrag families in the Mushfens and Varisia's other wetlands. In the frigid Lands of the Linnorm Kings and Irrisen, scrags dwelling along the coast of the Arcadian Ocean and in Glacier Lake drive their flood troll offspring south along the Marbleflow River or east toward the Gullik River. While they are most commonly encountered in Avistan, flood trolls may be found around the world, wherever scrags carry the aruk-taii mutation, though their physical features vary somewhat depending on where they originate. The Zenj tribes of the Mwangi Expanse speak of blueskinned, humanoid horrors-jeburo in the Polyglot tongue-that stalk the jungle's riverbeds during the dry season and boldly attack villages as the storm season approaches. A number of these flood trolls make their way into the Sodden Lands. Never lacking for the rain that allows for their regeneration, these flood trolls terrorize the few remaining enclaves of humanity in that drenched land."

			"Moss trolls not only hunt from the trees, but also live, breed, and hide their treasure among the branches. Their weirdly long arms allow them to attack foes on the ground without ever needing to set foot on the earth themselves. Young moss trolls are adept at climbing and acrobatics, as much as they are at eating and killing. Like other trolls, adult moss trolls often drive juveniles away after training them to hunt and fight. Gangs and troops of moss trolls exist only where food is plentiful. While moss trolls can digest almost any organic material, they prefer fresh meat - particularly when said meat is served still alive and squirming after a particularly invigorating session of stalking and torture.",

They are quick to forge alliances with fey, and while they see smaller trolls as sadists, they nonetheless feel a sort of familial responsibility.

Because of the crystalline nature of their skin, however, rock trolls prove more susceptible to sonic damage than other trolls, but they are able to regenerate even wounds dealt by fire.

Instead, these minerals supplement the trolls' diet, strengthening their skin, teeth, and claws. Deposits of certain crystals seem especially tasty to rock trolls, and a rock troll who finds such a collection will often gorge himself on the crystalline delicacies.",

While sewer trolls are common in some of the immense caves deep underground, their name derives from their lairs under the cities of the surface world. A major city often hosts dozens of the creatures, living in small family groups or lairing on their own. They rarely leave the sewers because of their light blindness, but they have been known to hide just below sewer grates and snatch children who walk too close. In times of desperate hunger, sewer trolls may leave the sewers, invariably at night. They stick to the shadows and ambush lone walkers, or sneak through windows to snatch babies from their cribs. Sewer trolls outside of their native environment are easily scared, but woe to the unprepared foe who follows them back into the sewers.",
			"",
			"Sewer trolls sometimes join groups of normal trolls or, being semi-aquatic, groups of scrags, to benefit from safety in numbers. Their smaller size and weakness mean they're often bullied by their more dangerous cousins, but many sewer trolls accept this as inevitable.

			"A troll elder matron serves her tribe as the fount of all magical knowledge. She is both her tribemates' fiercest protector and their harshest critic, doling out punishments to those who fail to achieve the (sometimes cryptic) goals she sets for them. Female trolls benefit from a matron's teachings almost exclusively, though she might set a promising young male on the path toward becoming a ranger. The matron often lives or travels with females nearing adulthood who are struggling with their studies; those she rejects as unworthy rejoin their sisters and never speak of the strange things they experienced while apprenticed to the matron. Even a troll monarch listens to an elder matron's counsel, for she has outlived many monarchs and watched generations of trolls be born, grow, and die.",

			"Thriae blend the physical features of graceful humanoid women with those of giant bees. For the most part, they are a wise, knowledgeable, and spiritual race. But unlike others of their kind, thriae constructors are not philosophers or seers; they are mindless laborers that react by pure instinct. Despite their lack of intelligence, however, these enormous creatures possess an even more complex sense of architecture and structure than bees, and in some ways, their architectural instincts surpass even the greatest designs a human mind could imagine. Other thriae, particularly those of high rank, are adept at directing thriae constructors to focus on those jobs that will most benefit the community and herding them to their work. In times of peace, thriae constructors labor to build, expand, and renovate hives and enhance its fortifications. When a thriae hive is threatened, the constructors quickly descend upon their foes, encasing these enemies in the same secretion of adhesive wax they normally use as a material to build the hive, and assailing resilient enemies with numerous attacks and a vicious poison.",

Viewed by her children as a benevolent matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer should the colony's population meet a devastating blow, whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive, those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured by her beauty and grace, and many would follow her if only to be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's company are few, and those few are carefully selected from among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as well as loyal.",

Thriae queens are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous duties around the hive are analogous to those of any other ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination as only a queen can provide.",
			"",
			"When not divining or performing governmental tasks, a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber, where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they are constantly within extremely close proximity to the queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but nonetheless often prefers to avoid conflicts with would-be assassins or burglars.",
			"",
			"A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy, golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through several stages of growth before becoming fully formed thriae - the longest stage of development is the larval stage, which is a crucial point in determining the formation of a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a special substance secreted from her merope gland called royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen.",
			"",
			"The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then faces a choice - either remaining in the colony she was born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does the latter, the remaining queen must birth another successor, which is not considered so much a bother as it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look upon successors who leave as deserting daughters, instead viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road.",
			"",

			"",
			"Larvae who are fed regular merope become soldiers, seers, or other contributing members of thriae society. While more susceptible to harm in the larval stage, thriae larvae still pose a threat to unwary intruders who find themselves among the cells of numerous unhatched thriae. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check or Knowledge (nature) check notice larvae embedded in the hive's waxy walls. Unhatched thriae larvae can detect disturbances outside their cell walls, and burst from the cells in order to prey upon the nutritious intruders. Any creature within 5 feet of a larval cell must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid becoming infested with the larvae. A creature that becomes infested must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking 1d2 points of Constitution damage and falling asleep-additional Constitution damage from feeding larvae does not wake sleeping victims. Feeding larvae can be detached from the creature they cling to by cutting them off with a slashing weapon (which requires a DC 20 Heal check that deals 1d4 points of damage per larva attached) or by dealing cold damage to the larvae at any time, which also deals half damage to the creature the larvae are covering. Remove disease or a similar effect kills any thriae larvae on the host.",

A giant tick drains blood quickly, but once it has caused 6 points of Constitution damage, it drops off, sated, to crawl away to digest. A giant tick is 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds."

			"**Driftwood-Dependent (Su)** A tidewretch is mystically bonded to a single piece of driftwood originating from the tree to which she was bonded in life. The tidewretch can never stray more than 300 yards from this piece of driftwood. A tidewretch who moves more than 300 yards beyond her bonded driftwood immediately becomes staggered and takes a -2 penalty on her attack and damage rolls and ability and skill checks and to the save DCs of her special abilities (including spell-like abilities). Every hour thereafter, she must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or these penalties increase by 2 (increases are cumulative). A tidewretch that is out of range of her bonded driftwood for 24 hours gains 1 negative level, which becomes permanent 24 hours thereafter, at which time she gains another negative level. Eventually, this separation destroys the tidewretch. Unlike a dryad, a tidewretch can't forge a new bond with another piece of driftwood, though many tidewretches find that they can carry their driftwood with them, as it is not rooted to the ground like a living tree.",
			"",
			"**Parasites (Ex)** The first time each round a tidewretch hits a target with a melee attack, a swarm of small parasites issues forth from the rotting wood that makes up her body, covering the target and causing discomfort and distraction. The target becomes staggered, but it can spend a standard action to brush the parasites off its body and end the effect.",
			"",
			"**Vermin Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, except a tidewretch can use this ability only on vermin. A tidewretch gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Vermin empathy treats swarms as one creature having a single mind; a tidewretch can thus use this ability to influence and direct swarms with relative ease.",
			"",
			"::sh[Description]",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are undead dryads whose trees have died and become waterlogged driftwood. The dead state of the tree to which a tidewretch is bound is reflected in her disfigured appearance, especially her wrinkled and cracked wooden skin. Bits and pieces of the tidewretch have completely rotted away, leaving nothing but scar-like holes in her decomposing flesh. A tidewretch's fingers have sharpened into claws, and her eyes have become cold and dark. Tidewretches are home to hosts of parasites, and small insects can be seen skittering in and out of their cracked skin. When alone, tidewretches regularly weep tears of dirty water in lament for their fallen trees.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are usually around 5 feet tall and weigh about 90 pounds.",
			"",
			"When a dryad's tree dies and falls into a body of water, the dryad inhabiting it sometimes survives to become a twisted, vengeful tidewretch. Such a creature follows the largest section of the remains of her dead tree down the currents of whatever body of water it travels, having little control over where it might end up. Along the way, the undead fey slowly begins to rot, quickly collecting parasites and fungi that survive on the nutrients in the driftwood and in the tidewretch herself.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are viewed as unnatural by regular dryads and other fey. Animals are easily spooked by their presence, and water-dwelling creatures give them a wide berth. However, a tidewretch's quick movement through lakes and rivers makes her difficult to keep track of and predict. Tidewretches stalk riverbanks and shorelines for unsuspecting creatures to torment and destroy before moving on. They leave their victims in a particularly grotesque state: their victims' bodies are drained of all natural fluids, which are replaced to the point of overflowing with filthy, brackish water.",
			"",
			"Despite their love of killing, tidewretches have no need to eat flesh to survive, and they continue their undead existence as long as their bonded driftwood remains intact. Because their survival depends on the security of their driftwood, many tidewretches hide their bonded driftwood among large piles of detritus or bind their driftwood with chains or sturdy seaweed ropes to the bottom of a body of water, floating like haunted buoys deep beneath the surface. Occasionally, a tidewretch may drag her driftwood inland and carve it into a piece of furniture, an idol, or a totem, or she might even use it as part of the construction of a makeshift structure. In any case, the tidewretch works to ensure her driftwood is either hidden or obscured so that her greatest weakness does not bring about her undoing.",
			"",
			"A tidewretch is considered a menace to nature, and she is a highly sought-after target for druids and protector fey. Tidewretches take trophies from hunters who fail to destroy them, as reminders of both the warmth of life and their undying desire to survive no matter the cost. This leads to them collecting treasures that they store in the crevasses of their driftwood trees. These large stashes of treasure often lead more hunters and adventurers to seek the riches that ancient tidewretches carry.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tidewretches' constantly traveling, mobile homes make for many potential habitats. Usually, a tidewretch is either moving with a current or settled on a still body of water. Tidewretches most often originate along the sides of forest rivers, and as such they encounter plenty of living victims as they travel along those rivers to their eventual resting places. While tidewretches who keep moving with the water tend to survive longer than those who remain in one spot - becoming the subjects of legend as their victims pile up - many of them try to stay in the same place for long periods of time if they can guide themselves to still water. Stationary tidewretches prefer to live in environments that resemble those where their trees used to grow. Such tidewretches seek to emulate living dryads, even burying their tree's roots and draping any branch-fragments with greenery.",
			"",
			"Tidewretches are solitary creatures by both nature and circumstance. They arise rarely and can end up in many different locales. They do not get along with creatures other than the vermin that occupy their trees and bodies, and they permit the company of others of their kind only out of a shared sense of survival. Most groupings of tidewretches (called tangles) last only briefly, collapsing when their respective members turn on one another and try to destroy each others' driftwood to ensure dominance, or else parting ways quickly to avoid such a fate.",
			"",
			"There are rare circumstances in which pairs of tidewretches settle in the same still water for extended periods of time. Usually the two choose to join forces to hunt and continue their tortured existences together. Such tidewretch \"sisters\" maintain a tenuous balance of power, and they are most often equals, sharing a single ambition rather than scrabbling to claim authority. In many cases, such pairs were dryads from the same grove who maintain a connection to one another in undeath, even while their instinct is otherwise to isolate themselves from anything they cannot destroy."

In the event of egregious disruptions, several time dimensionals may work together in perfect synchronicity to preserve the timestream.",

Time dimensionals have appeared during seemingly mundane events, such as the report of a dozen time dimensionals appearing to a group of miners in Brevoy in the summer of 4284 ar. More confounding are events that appear to be an obvious call to time dimensionals, such as the appearance of the legendary Scepter of Ages, but that the dimensionals seem to ignore.",

There are reports of exceptionally rare time dimensionals with greater abilities - such as the ability to erase a creature from time entirely - though the Dimension of Time dispatches such dimensionals only to deal with the most calamitous of situations.",

A {spell/gate} spell could, in theory, beckon one of these creatures to serve, but even then the act of drawing a time dimensional out of the demiplane of Time might be enough to pull more of their kind to investigate - and likely punish - the conjurer.

			"",
			"Some speculate that there is, in fact, only a single time dimensional, and appearances of multiple ones arise from sightings of the same creature crossing and recrossing its own temporal path, meeting later or earlier incarnations of itself. In this theory, the Dimension of Time created the first and only time dimensional at the birth of time and dispatches the same one to deal with all temporal disruptions, and therefore rumors of time dimensionals with more powerful abilities are sightings of an older or advanced version of the same creature. Too much research into this model appears to be dangerous, however, as chronomancers and temporal scholars who investigate the most advanced time dimensionals often disappear entirely. The esoteric calculations these scholars leave behind hint that, after a certain point, the single time dimensional becomes so powerful that it breaks free of the Dimension of Time and pursues its own independent agenda, with indescribably catastrophic results for the multiverse."

			"**Swallow Whole (Su)** A taotieh can expand its jaws to swallow Large or smaller creatures. When swallowed, a victim is transported to its own lightless pocket dimension - a stone prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls-hardness 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension, it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces. A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.",

			"::sh[Description]",

			"Symbols of power but also of gluttony, taotiehs are guardian constructs formed of stone and built around a pocket of extradimensional space. Taotiehs are used to ward sacred or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their semblance to tigers extends even to the animal's abilities in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks. The extradimensional space at the core of a taotieh allows the construct to swallow opponents of its own size and then shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A creature capable of existing without air could well spend an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn't smash its way out or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must wait for outside forces to slay its captor. Tales abound of great treasures and even greater dangers being unleashed upon a taotieh's destruction.",
