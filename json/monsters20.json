In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality - a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities.",

Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also very much creatures of the Material Plane, and many believe the first rakshasas chose this exile over some other role offered them by a long-forgotten god. Although they usually work alone, it isn't unheard of to find extended families of rakshasas working together to ruin a mortal civilization from the inside out over the course of many generations.

The basest among them might tempt any mortal into lives of depravity, but the eldest, most experienced amanusyas seek to lure the most pure-hearted souls into debauchery and apostasy. They consider themselves keen observers and connoisseurs of mortal vice. Amanusyas might watch worthy victims for months before engaging them. When they do, though, their approaches are subtle and their promises calculated. They use guarantees of fame, wealth, pleasure, and a better life as tools to poison mortal minds with grand ambitions, endlessly assuring them that one more contrivance, one more broken vow, one more heist, or one more blasphemy will secure true greatness that, of course, never comes.",

They see most mortals as food and playthings, though according to an old Vudran folktale, once in a millennia, an amanusya actually falls in love with a mortal. These unions never end well, however.",

This physical reminder of corruption often pushes the mortal parents over the edge - they succumb to whatever heinous temptations are offered by both their lovers and their offspring. The most powerful amanusyas are born from unions with devout followers of good deities. Most amanusyas are female, but one in a dozen is male.",

A flap of taut, leathery flesh covers the face of every avatarana. While not a part of the rakshasa's body, the covering can't be removed - some grotesque magic fuses it to the creature's body. Indistinct shapes are visible behind this featureless mask. Many who glimpse an avatarana get the unsettling impression that their own features lie beneath this veil, making the rakshasa's appearance all the more unnerving. Those few grimly zealous investigators who have cut away an avatarana's facial covering find nothing below but hollow, uneven cavities. The shapes beneath never seem to correspond with what the covering suggests.",

They strive to mimic the day-to-day actions of those they possess to keep up their disguises, but their viciousness increasingly shows. Only when others turn against their victims do avataranas release their control, leaving their prey to deal with the ramifications of the rakshasa's acts.",

			"All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas - those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear.",
			"",
			"A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and influence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century.",
			"",
			"So great is a maharaja's power and influence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors - often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders - lounging in opulence.",
			"",
			"The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants.",
			"",
			"A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.",

			"",
			"Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment, and illusion. Other maharajas master various other techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja - a king of kings.",
			"",
			"Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower than CR 21-most have additional racial Hit Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each additional racial Hit Die granted increases the rakshasa's CR by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja.",
			"",
			"The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers.",
			"",
			">*Reincarnate (Su):* Once per day as a standard action, a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via {spell/true resurrection} in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be any form within one size category of the dead creature's original size - the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.",

			"- *Dispelling Strikes:* By expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a zalyakavat can disrupt magic with an urumi it wields, causing any creature struck by the zalyakavat's urumi to be the subject of a targeted dispel magic with a caster level equal to the zalyakavat's caster level plus the level of the spell slot expended. A creature can be the subject of only one such targeted dispel per use of this ability, but if the urumi strikes more than one creature, each creature struck is subject to the dispelling effect.",

The zalyakavat's reach with the weapon increases by 5 feet, and the zalyakavat can attempt to strike and strangle a single target as a standard action. The zalyakavat makes a melee attack at its highest bonus. On a successful hit, the attack deals damage as normal, and the zalyakavat can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target's CMD as a free action. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the maneuver succeeds, the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage plus the zalyakavat's Strength modifier and must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds. This ability works only on creatures that breathe and have a discernible neck. The save DC is Strength-based.",

Their lairs are less opulent than those of many rakshasas, though still lavish by most humanoid standards. Individual zalyakavats have different and sometimes eccentric proclivities when it comes to selecting opponents, and they plan their guises accordingly. For example, a zalyakavat who prefers to victimize haughty nobles might operate as a silk merchant or purveyor of fine jewelry, while one who favors dueling with seasoned veterans might pose as a traveling noble to employ such men-at-arms as unsuspecting caravan guards. After slaying an opponent, a zalyakavat often plucks a valuable or gruesome trinket from the corpse to serve as a reminder of the encounter and as a decoration for one of its lairs.",
			"",
			"Zalyakavats rarely interact with other types of rakshasas. When convenient or unavoidable, they might serve maharajas or rakshasa immortals as warriors or bodyguards, but a zalyakavat remains forever preoccupied with its desire for melee combat and is thus an unreliable soldier. On rare occasions, zalyakavats gather to participate in prearranged contests of arms. Zalyakavats almost never fight each other in these events, instead coercing or tricking unfortunate mortals into their hidden arenas to serve as opponents. From plush divans surrounding the arena, zalyakavats watch each other take turns fighting the unlucky souls as entertainment."

Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both fear and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards.

Despite their cowardice, redkind are extremely protective of these seasoned victims - some going so far as to label these unfortunates as their \"only real friends.\" They are especially common in the long shadows and broken dreams of Taldor, where misery is seen as just another facet of life's cruelty."

			"Reptoids are bipedal reptiles from another planet, or perhaps even another plane - they refuse to reveal their origins to humanoids, even under duress. Disguised as members of others races, the reptoids seek positions of power in order to secretly prepare for an invasion from their homeworld. Even those who are aware of reptoids in their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment and psychic magic, which they use to cover the tracks of their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even collusion of their soon-to-be thralls."

They do so to observe and document the behavioral patterns of such creatures from afar, studying viable specimens for days until they eventually isolate and retrieve the studied prey again for further examination in the controlled laboratories of the robots' masters.",
			"",

They tend to react swiftly to movement and perceived threats to their physical security, either emitting loud tones or alarms as a preemptive warning, or flying upward to gain altitude before assessing a given situation and potentially opening fire in defense of itself. Some collector robots grow more lax in their analysis protocols over time, giving way to a state similar to paranoia if left in the field for too long. This corrupted logic inevitably leads them to interpret even the most innocuous actions as proof of hostile intent. Other collectors become fixated on their directive to retrieve specimens without undue damage, interpreting it as a need to protect their targets from all possible sources of harm.",

			"Collector robots have no defined ecology, as they are built by others and gifted with a unique purpose and skill set. Most often, they emerge from automated factories, engineering shops, and scrap heaps under the direction of a controlling authority that activates them and assigns their missions. Thereafter, the power cores of collector robots last indefinitely. Most collector robots have fusion generators, but some have the ability to derive power from the sun, making them capable of recharging several weeks' worth of operating power with solar energy in a single daytime \"sleep\" cycle. During prolonged missions, collector robots often support one another in the absence of their masters, dragging damaged units back to repair facilities and cooperating to achieve any mutual goals. Collector robots have a similar protectiveness toward other robots of various types, treating them almost like siblings.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Collector robots have little in the way of organized society, but do array themselves in a rigid hierarchy as designated by their controlling authority. Individual collectors may carry a higher rank than other robots, and thus are capable of commanding lesser machines they encounter or even overriding their programming with new directives as they commandeer aid in carrying out their assigned missions. This often leads to symbiotic relationships with servant robots capable of repairing and assisting with their upkeep.",
			"",
			"Collector robots first appeared in Numeria, but some have since wandered further afield, slaves to their dedicated programming as they go about cataloging, tagging, and occasionally tracking various life forms' sentient or otherwise. Some rogue collector robots kidnap people and creatures, and secret them away in remote caves. Others cascaded from the starship Divinity during its original descent, falling to Golarion as newly deployed probes far outside the range of Unity's control, thus free to pursue individual interests. A few enterprising Technic League wizards and alchemists have managed to control some of these automatons, taming and reprogramming them to suit their purposes. New directives for these automatons typically involve the abduction or assassination of targets that their overseers program into them.",
			"",
			"### Variants",
			"",
			"The chassis developed for collector robots has proven exceptionally versatile over the years, giving rise to multiple configurations and alternate capabilities. These are less likely to be encountered than a typical collector robot. Some of the models include:",
			"",
			"**Aquatic Collector Robots (CR +0):** Adapted for use in marine environments, aquatic collector robots abandon flight for a swim speed of 30 ft. Their integrated stun guns still function underwater, though they are based on frequencies designed to work more efficiently in aquatic environments.",
			"",
			"**Extermination Robots (CR +1):** Newly encountered life forms can sometimes threaten the safety of landing parties or the ecological balance of controlled environments. Extermination robots serve a more specialized role than collectors, programming themselves to track and annihilate a single type of creature. This ability grants a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class ability) against a single creature type chosen from the ranger favored enemies table. The robot also comes equipped with a longer-range arc rifle.",
			"",
			"**Trapper Robots (CR +1):** Some robots cover a wider range of territory by deploying traps rather than hunting creatures individually. Designed to capture specimens for retrieval and sedation, they have gravity-based snares which function similar to the snare spell. They can deploy up to five of these devices and remain linked to them via tracker chips and an integrated chipfinder. When a snare is sprung, it sends an alert to the trapper robot, which then hurries to retrieve its quarry."

			"Androffans, the race responsible for the presence of robots on Golarion, were a spacefaring people who visited dozens of worlds. Masters of engineering, they created robots that could perform a wide array of tasks, even trusting their creations to perform complex surgeries on the Androffans' own organic forms. In the course of their interplanetary explorations, the Androffans quickly learned that not every world was ready to comprehend the awesome experience of leaving one's home planet to visit others. Not wanting to risk valuable crew members, the Androffans created evaluator robots as an alternative to sending a shuttle mission to alien planets and interacting in person. When sensors aboard Androffan ships orbiting foreign worlds discovered other humanoid species, evaluator robots would be dispatched to assess the planets' alien cultures.",
			"",
			"Taking forms designed to be recognizable to a planet's general populace, evaluator robots would drop from orbiting surveillance ships onto alien worlds to collect data so that their masters could determine the readiness of the planets' inhabitants to accept the existence of creatures from other worlds. Androffans also used evaluator robots to determine how violent or superstitious the indigenous populations were so that they could carefully plan direct contact. Evaluator robots were fashioned into pleasing and majestic forms to command respect and admiration from the humanoids they interacted with, and were usually made slightly taller than the planet's primary race so as to seem properly impressive. These robots' advanced construction utilizes sophisticated lightweight materials, making their durable frames weigh in under 400 pounds. The model presented here is the most common design - a radiant humanoid angel with gleaming feathers of brushed metal.",
			"",
			"### Design",
			"",
			"The engineers who designed evaluator robots created each one to serve specific purposes tailored to the world it was intended to observe. These thematic designs were tested through trial and error by the evaluators themselves, who paid close attention to the religions encountered on each planet. They discovered that reverence for angelic beings was common on many worlds populated by sentient humanoids, so the engineers built the majority of evaluator robots in this form.",
			"",
			"Although some evaluators were designed for use on worlds that used advanced technology, evaluators were rarely used to observe cultures that had already reached space on their own or that were otherwise accustomed to dealing with beings from other worlds. In some cases, Androffan engineers designed evaluator robots to mimic the form of beings iconic to the populace, gathering information about these individuals from intercepted communication signals. This was often judged too risky, however, as it was found that cultures rarely responded well to the eventual revelation that their resurrected heroes and messiahs were actually alien robots.",
			"",
			"Even though redesigning an evaluator robot's outward form was simple, their complex programming required a vast amount of collected data. If the robot couldn't reply in a convincing manner, or if its memory-modifying nanites took no hold on the alien humanoids it encountered, then the evaluator's mission was quickly compromised. The robot's creators then had to hope that the interaction would be interpreted as a fluke supernatural experience, or that the witness would be disbelieved and derided by its community.",
			"",
			"Evaluator robots are universally curious, their programming filling them with an endless need to learn about living creatures. These robots take every opportunity to ask questions of intelligent organic life forms, especially humanoids. An evaluator robot compares these answers to profiles of existing cultures, either installed when it was created or assembled from previous interactions. Complex algorithms capable of parsing the nuances of myriad humanoid societies allow the robot to quickly evaluate and categorize the nature of a particular society using these hundreds or thousands of profiles. Once an evaluator has thoroughly assessed a planet's cultures, its Androffan masters use this information to plan a landing expedition to make direct contact.",

			"",
			"As robots, evaluators have no society outside of their programming, and their habitat is wherever they happen to be deployed. In the Inner Sea region, nearly all evaluator robots encountered to date have been found in Silver Mount.",
			"",
			"Since they were designed to interact with sentient organic beings, evaluator robots don't regularly associate with other robots unless tasked with a project requiring such interaction, and instead keep the company of humanoids (though their cold robotic presence isn't always comforting).",
			"",
			"Crafts that split from Divinity during its crash and fell to other parts of Numeria contained two other known evaluator robots. A tribe of Ghost Wolves destroyed one of these evaluators - designed to resemble a horned, red-skinned fiend - when it appeared before the Kellid barbarians in the Sellen Hills. The robot fought with wicked claws, and after it was destroyed, it exploded in a blast that killed dozens of the barbarians. The other evaluator, reportedly appearing as a six-armed, three-faced woman with bronze skin, was spotted briefly by griffon riders at Castle Urion before it headed south into the River Kingdoms, and hasn't been seen since."

Spectators, however, love the bluster and braggadocio of a gladiator robot, often waiting after a match in hopes of meeting it. In Oppara, this tradition is taken even further, with young children running up to a victorious gladiator robot with two rags: a clean one to wipe away blood and grime, and an oiled one to shine its armor to brilliance. They then sell these rags to wealthy nobles for a few gold pieces each.",

These robots are likely the source of rumors about out-of-control \"kill bots\" that view killing as pleasure.",

An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video. An observer robot's communications can be keyed to a commset or other similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced with a signal booster. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting functions like a scrying sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill. This ability doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess them.",

Because they're intelligent and able to make their own decisions, observer robots are suited for exploring without supervision, recording their observations so that they can relay the images and sounds to their creators. The outer hull of an observer robot and its wings are covered in a network of tiny screens that can display images of the robots' surroundings, which grants the observer robot a form of camouflage that allows it to clandestinely observe its subjects.",

When observer robot swarms attack, the screens on their outer hulls flicker with disorienting colors that leave their enemies nauseated. They can also organize themselves into a matrix to display composite images across the screens on their collective shells. Treating their individual screens like pixels, observer robot swarms can form moving images of things that they have recorded such as displaying the terrorstricken face of their last victim. These robot swarms even cleverly use this technique to disguise themselves as churning clouds, flickering fires, or even other swarms such as bats or wasps.",

A reclamation robot can make an attack with its integrated laser rifle against one creature it is grappling as a swift action - when it attacks in this way, the robot has a threat range of 18-20 for critical hits with the laser rifle.",
			"",
			"**Item Creation (Ex)** Reclamation robots are known for their startling creativity in repairing damaged technology. A reclamation robot ignores all of the item creation feat requirements for creating a technological item, but must have access to a sufficient amount of scrap metal and spare parts in order to create or repair an item (the robot must still expend materials equal to the item's cost).",
			"",
			"A reclamation robot can attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to restore a timeworn technological item to full functionality - the DC of this check is equal to the item's Craft DC + 5, and requires an expenditure of technological components worth a total amount of money equal to the timeworn item's cost (half the cost of the object in its pristine condition). Failure results in the destruction of the item. When a reclamation robot restores a technological item to full functionality in this manner, if the robot exceeds its DC by a result of 10 or more, it improves the item in some way-choose one of the following improvements or determine one randomly.",
			"",
			"- The item's capacity permanently increases by 50%.",
			"- If the item is a weapon or armor, it becomes masterwork.",
			"- The item becomes hardened (increase its hardness by 2).",
			"- The item becomes fortified (increase its hit points by 50%).",
			"- The item becomes lightweight (weight is divided in half).",
			"",
			"**Force Field (Ex)** A reclamation robot is sheathed in a thin layer of shimmering energy that grants it 50 bonus hit points. All damage dealt to a reclamation robot with an active force field is deducted from these hit points first. As long as the force field is active, the reclamation robot is immune to critical hits. A reclamation robot's force field has fast healing 10, but once these hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Integrated Laser Rifle (Ex)** A reclamation robot has a built-in laser rifle in its chest. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 2d6 points of fire damage on a hit. The weapon can fire once per round as a ranged touch attack. A laser attack can pass through force fields and force effects, such as a wall of force, to strike a foe beyond without damaging that field. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers don't provide cover from lasers, but unlike force barriers, a transparent physical barrier still takes damage when a laser passes through it. Invisible creatures and objects are immune to damage from lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide {rule/cover} in addition to {rule/concealment} from laser attacks. Darkness (magical or otherwise) has no effect on lasers other than providing concealment.",
			"",
			"**Salvage (Ex)** A reclamation robot is designed specifically to salvage technology for further use. All Craft skills are class skills for reclamation robots, and they gain a +4 racial bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks and gain Technologist as a bonus feat. A reclamation robot can repair 2d6 points of damage to a robot within reach (including itself) as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Scaling (Ex)** Reclamation robots are expected to work at great heights or while clinging to immense ships. They gain a +4 racial bonus on Climb checks. Once every 1d4 rounds, a reclamation robot can increase its climb speed to 40 feet as a swift action for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerable to Critical Hits (Ex)** Like all robots, reclamation robots are vulnerable to critical hits. In addition, when a critical hit is confirmed against a reclamation robot, roll a d8. On a roll of 1, instead of suffering additional damage from the critical hit, the robot suffers damage to essential processing units and memory modules that it cannot itself repair (although another reclamation robot could repair this damage). While such damage is not readily apparent on the exterior - and the robot itself is essentially unaware of it - this kind of injury can have a number of different effects. When such an injury occurs, roll d% and consult the following chart to determine the nature of the damage.",
			"",
			"| d% | Result |",
			"| --- | --- |",
			"| 01-20 | The robot takes a -4 penalty on all skill checks. |",
			"| 21-30 | The robot's integrated laser rifle now glitches each time it is fired as if it were timeworn. |",
			"| 31-40 | The robot loses its scaling ability (including its bonus on Climb checks). |",
			"| 41-60 | When it attempts to repair damage to a robot via salvage, it only repairs 1d4 points of damage. |",
			"| 61-70 | Movement is reduced by 10 feet. |",
			"| 71-95 | One of the robot's claw attacks becomes non-functional. |",
			"| 96-100 | The robot goes berserk, functioning as if under the simultaneous effects of a {spell/confusion} spell and a {spell/rage} spell. |",

			"Reclamation robots, or \"reclamators,\" are masters of salvage and construction. These robots were originally designed to build structures and repair all manner of technology with speed and precision. Construction of these robots was difficult and time consuming, but they often repaid those spent resources swiftly with their ability to rebuild and repair other robots or technological items. Their truly remarkable programing surprised even those who originally developed them, as these machines can salvage items thought to be far beyond hope of repair.",
			"",
			"Over time it's not uncommon for a reclamation robot to develop a unique personality akin to that of an artist, with something that almost approaches pride in its work. On some occasions, reclamation robots have even been known to make improvements to items and constructs that they repair.",
			"",
			"Though a reclamation robot is generally quite adept at repairing damage to itself as well, injury to certain processors and memory modules deep within the robot can cause significant problems. Some of the resulting malfunctions can be quite noticeable (see the table above), while others are subtler, such as a tendency to add baroque and unnecessary embellishments to constructions and repairs. Reclamation robots with this type of damage are largely unaware of their condition and actively resist efforts to repair them, requiring intervention with a robojack or the like. There are even recorded incidents of damaged reclamators going rogue and setting off on their own to build whatever outlandish structures their flawed processors dictate. Though they were originally designed to create things for humanoids, such rogue robots typically design structures and devices of no apparent use to organic beings... which isn't to say that these creations don't have a place in some unknowable automaton agenda.",

Despite such alternate uses, these intelligent constructs have a hardwired directive that Technic League agents have failed to deactivate: an obsessive drive to perfect their craft. Surgeon robots continually attempt to study humanoid physiology. They require new subject matter to study with some regularity, and if denied such opportunities, they take it upon themselves to collect specimens and perform experiments on them-sometimes claiming the same Technic League agents who tried to cow them.",

The weapon can fire once per round and does so in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as {feat/Vital Strike}.

			"",
			"**Harvest Thoughts (Ex)** A thought harvester that hits a living creature with one of its integrated nanite injectors can selectively duplicate certain memories the target possesses. Each time the harvester uses this ability, it can copy one significant event (such as the events of a combat or a birthday party), or it can sift through the victim's memories as part of an interrogation that allows it to effectively ask and receive truthful answers to six questions. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of this ability; mindless creatures or creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 are immune to it. Each time a creature's memories are copied through the use of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. A creature's Intelligence score can't be drained below 1 in this way.",

This ability can be used on creatures that have been dead for less than 24 hours, but their brain must be mostly intact and only 1d4 memories can be harvested postmortem.

			"Thought harvesters are specialized robots designed to forcibly extract memories from a living creature or corpse. Built to survive battlefields and other hazardous environments, thought harvesters are outfitted with thick armor plating and a durable force field. Giving the thought harvester robot its name, two prehensile tendrils extend from the creature's sides, each tipped with a wickedly barbed syringe through which the creature injects sophisticated nanites into its target. These nanites immediately duplicate portions of the target's brain and return through the syringe into the thought harvester's central core. There, the target's memories are swiftly categorized and stored in one of an array of crystalline spheres located along the robot's spine. When performed on a living target, the process is painful and can cause severe damage to the subject's cognitive reasoning capabilities. A thought harvester's head has a single glowing eye in the center, and two weapons hang beneath it. These weapons allow the thought harvester to fire bursts of sonic energy at any targets that react in an aggressive manner. A thought harvester rarely speaks, but when it does it speaks in short, monosyllabic words, and is always direct and to the point. Thought harvesters are 6 feet long and 4 feet tall. They are densely built, and weigh 1,600 lbs. A thought harvester draws energy from an efficient internal power source and continually recycles and repairs its internal store of specialized nanites.",

			"A thought harvester is a militarized application of specialized thought-recovery technology. Nanites able to affect a target's thoughts or memories are used in weapons such as the id rifle or mindrender, but the nanites used in those devices become inert after performing their function. When they're instead directly injected and immediately recovered, the nanites duplicate a creature's thoughts and store them for review. The thought harvester's nimble frame and armored shell ensure effective frontline deployment of this technology.",
			"",
			"Dozens of egg-sized crystalline spheres line the creature's spine, each solidly nestled within a socket in the creature's armored back. These spheres are normally clear, but when the robot recovers a creature's thoughts, a sphere fills with a cloudy, gray haze. A thought harvester might fill all of its crystal spheres after a dozen missions. Regular maintenance includes transferring harvested thoughts into specialized computers, but the technology to do so is lost on Golarion. Instead, the stolen thoughts within the spheres simply dissipate when a sphere is destroyed or incorrectly removed.",

			"Thought harvesters are deployed in a variety of military situations in which specific intelligence must be recovered or eliminated, but bodily recovery of the target is unnecessary or unwise. A thought harvester can grab and carry a human in its claw, but these robots are rarely used to capture living humanoids. A thought harvester might be assigned to invade an enemy stronghold to remove key orders from an opposing commander, or invade a prison to copy sensitive information from the mind of a spy captured by the enemy. Thought harvester robots are often used to recover critical intelligence from soldiers killed in the middle of a raging battle or that fell in irradiated environments. Thought harvesters are deployed only when overt force is acceptable, as they're neither stealthy nor subtle.",
			"",
			"These robots show little individual personality as they go about their work of harvesting memories. Unlike other robots, which are generally content to stand perfectly motionless when not in use, thought harvesters tend to fidget, scanning for danger and waving their syringetipped tendrils in the air. A thought harvester cannot itself access any of the thoughts stored within the crystalline spheres, though it does retain some general idea of the memories it has previously collected. To the thought harvester, these memories are simply cargo to be recovered and brought back to its superiors."

A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80-foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc.",

While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3-5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest.",
			"",
			"Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged. A roc can be trained as well as any other animal, but its great size makes this a daunting task for most would-be trainers of human size. The same isn't true for giants - particularly cloud and storm giants, who often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most prestigious of giants.",
			"",
			"Rocs taken as animal companions by druids or rangers are typically newly hatched birds - a baby roc is the size of a person and ready for flight and hunting within minutes of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc is limited to Large size - still large enough for a Medium druid or ranger to use the flying beast as a mount."

			"A magical compound of pitch and alchemist's fire, roiling oil is a volatile and dangerous ooze. It hunts in subterranean tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for animal and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous, and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, roiling oil moves slowly across flat surfaces and up walls to find prey it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of roiling oil attacks, the process of stretching and shifting its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and rancid fat. A roiling oil's strikes slather its targets in an equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims with nausea. A roiling oil prefers to fully coat its prey in this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to burn away a roiling oil only make it more lethal. Even the smallest spark or flame can turn this voracious ooze into a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind act as any protection. The ooze itself feels no pain from the flames and isn't impeded by them, but such attempts can result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area."

Roofgardens have since come to thrive on the broad, unobstructed, elevated surfaces of their namesake, providing the territorial plants with plenty of birds, sunlight, water, and even human victims.",

A rope dragon reserves its other main use of its shapeshifting talents-setting up pranks and traps-for those who attempt to seek out or capture it, usually after the dragon has had its way with their pantries. Those who offer food willingly to a rope dragon, or at least don't mind the dragon's pilfering ways, are rarely the victims of the dragon's whimsy, and may find that when their lives or livelihoods are truly threatened, their small draconic ally uses its tricks and traps to protect them.",

The carrier of a rope dragon is in for a real surprise when she gets into a fight that she can't win on her own and her rope comes to life to assist in fending off the monster. Rope dragons dislike it when other creatures become aware of their existence, however, so a rope dragon abandons such an adventurer at the first opportunity."
