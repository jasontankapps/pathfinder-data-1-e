			"Legendary hunters and skilled warriors, centaurs are part man and part horse. Typically found on the fringes of civilization, these stoic people vary widely in appearance, their skin tones typically appearing deeply tanned but similar to the humans who occupy nearby regions, while their lower bodies borrow the colorations of local equines. Centaur hair and eyes trend toward darker colors and their features tend to be broad, while the overall bulk of their bodies is influenced by the size of the horses their lower quarters resemble. Thus, while an average centaur stands over 7 feet tall and weights upward of 2,000 pounds, there are vast regional variations - from lean plains-runners to burly mountain hunters. Centaurs typically live to be about 60 years old.",
			"",
			"Aloof with other races and at odds even with their own kind, the centaurs are an old race only slowly coming to accept the modern world. While the majority of centaurs still live in tribes roaming vast plains or the fringes of eldritch forests, many have abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to walk among the more cosmopolitan cities of the world. Often such free-spirited centaurs are considered outcasts and are shunned by their own tribes, making the decision to leave a heavy one. In some rare cases, however, whole tribes under progressive leaders have come to trade or make alliances with other humanoid communities - typically elves, but sometimes gnomes, and rarely humans or dwarves. Many races remain wary of centaurs, though, largely due to legends of territorial beastmen and the regular, violent encounters the centaurs have with stubborn settlers and expansionist countries."

			"Inside the hallowed reaches of centaur realms, foragers watch for signs of intruders and prowl their domains looking for game to feed their kin. These centaurs patrol their borders, keeping constant vigil to drive away unwelcome beasts and travelers alike with displays of force, grim warnings, and eventually violence.",
			"",
			"Foragers bring down dangerous beasts and deliver their carcasses to the tribe, providing furs and leather for clothing, bones and sinew for tools, rendered fat for lard and tallow, and a feast if their prey pleases the palate. Keenly aware of their peoples' dependance on the world around them, foragers aim for quick, clean kills and take only enough to satisfy their people's immediate needs. Their preferred prey are creatures disrupting the order they depend on, whether rampaging monsters or human poachers - any creature that takes more than it needs to live calls down the wrath of these silent hunters.",
			"",
			"When responding to sentient intruders, a forager's approach varies widely based on her past experiences with the intruder's kind and the trespassers' attitude and actions. They rarely offer aggressive races, such as goblins and orcs, a chance to parley and instead shoot them down from afar. More approachable races, especially elves and gnomes, are sometimes welcomed into centaur territory. Races that have mixed reputations, such as humans, are met on a cautious case-by-case basis. All too often, the honeyed promises that drip from the mouths of humans fall short of their final treatment of centaurs, and this tarnished relationship has left many tribes bitter toward all of humanity. Those enemies who cannot be warned off or killed are instead avoided, and a forager's secondary role is to scout out lush new pastures for her people to relocate to should enemies endanger their home.",
			"",
			"When travelers respectfully petition centaurs for safe passage through their territory and convince them that no alternative route is available, a tribe may reluctantly grant the strangers' request. However, in exchange for permission, centaurs often demand a toll in the form of a task or favor performed on the tribe's behalf. They most often ask for metal tools and magic that their divine-leaning society can't produce reliably, but may instead request that adventurers destroy a local threat. Even with tribal approval to enter centaur lands, outsiders can expect their every step to be watched by the tribe's foragers' whether the interlopers can see their centaur observers or not."

Here tribes celebrate weddings, harvests, and births under the sun's warm glow, and perform rites of adulthood, rituals to bring luck before a battle, and homages to the tribe's ancestors under the sparse light of the moon and stars. Of these celebrations, centaurs revere none more than the death rites their greenspeakers provide for fallen clan members. When the sun sets, the greenspeakers light a great pyre to release the deceased's spirit from her mortal flesh. After the pyre burns through the night and the sun's first rays crest the horizon, the fallen centaur's kin collect the ashes and fertilize the fields with them so that the dead may serve the world anew.",

			"Horrifying amalgams driven by an insatiable desire to kill living things and collect their bones, centianimas exemplify the ravenous, ugly evil of the undead. These animalistic collections of bones typically form from the remains of numerous animals that died in terrible agony. The dark forces and suffering that animates these remains typically cause these horrors to form in ominous, multilimbed shapes vaguely reminiscent of macabre centipedes. Although they look merely like heaps of bones when at rest, they can hardly be mistaken as such when on the move. Centianimas are possessed of a dark, predatory cunning that makes them particularly efficient hunters.",
			"",
			"A centianima measures 12 feet long and weighs approximately 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"The flexible body of a centianima consists of 15 or more leg-bearing segments made from fused-together bones. Centianimas require no sustenance, but they sometimes carry their dead or unconscious victims back to their lairs in their hollow interiors. Their pointy-tipped legs are exceptionally flexible, allowing them to rapidly change the direction of their movement or even skitter sideways in an undulating motion. Each of a centianima's two heads consists of one or more animal skulls fused together and sports a pair of long, jointed antennae. Their eye sockets each bear a dark violet necromantic membrane that functions much like the eyes of a spider.",
			"",
			"Centianimas sometimes form spontaneously in places where animals have died in great numbers and no one has buried, burned, or eaten the bones, such as abandoned slaughterhouses and the charnel pits of greater monsters. When a centianima's body starts forming, it first develops a skeletal segment and grows a pair of twitching legs. This process repeats until the body has at least 15 segments. The final stage of this horrible genesis involves forming a head segment on each end. The heads do not form simultaneously, however, and for a brief period, the centianima has only one head.",
			"",
			"As undead creatures, centianimas do not need rest and thus remain active day and night. However, their behavior changes markedly with the time of the day. At night, they hunt vertebrates of all sizes, from mice to horses. During the day, they skitter over the bodies they have captured, skinning them and stripping them of flesh. A centianimas's daytime activities also include patrolling its lair and environs, organizing its bone collection, and moving loose rocks to places where they might hinder intruders but not the centianima itself. Centianimas that live underground exhibit similar behaviors, though they adapt their daily cycles to hunt when prey is most vulnerable, regardless of the time of the day.",
			"",

			"",
			"Centianimas usually inhabit ruined buildings where there are many places to hide. They are excellent climbers and, thanks to their flexible exoskeletons, they can crawl through very narrow spaces. They use these abilities to great effect against invaders, ambushing unwelcome visitors in places where less agile beings are at a disadvantage.",
			"",
			"The lair of a centianima usually contains one or more piles of bones collected from its victims. The bones may be meticulously organized according to animal or bone type, or they may be a disorganized mess. Somewhere in the lair, usually a good distance from the bone piles, there is also a rotting mound of discarded flesh, skin, tendon, and other soft tissue.",
			"",
			"Centianimas are solitary and territorial, and when one encounters boneless creatures, other undead monsters, or anything that looks too dangerous to attack, it emits an unpleasant chitter that sounds like grinding teeth. If the sound is not enough to warn the intruders away, the centianima attacks or retreats depending on the size and number of the intruders.",

			"The rotting mounds of flesh usually present in a centianima's lair attract all kinds of vermin, and it is not uncommon for swarms of cockroaches, spiders, centipedes, or flesh-eating worms to share a centianima's lair. The undead creature largely ignores these vermin because they neither have bones nor pose a threat.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"Centianimas are often created by wicked spellcasters who either seek a free-roaming guardian to defend an area or have a grudge against nature. A centianima can be produced through the use of the spell create undead by any caster of 13th-level or higher. However, rather than casting the spell on one corpse, the creator must cast it on a heap of bones comprising the skeletons of no fewer than three Medium or Large animals. Smaller skeletons can be used, but at least double the number is required.",
			"",
			"Upon being created, an uncontrolled centianima searches the surrounding area for a lair. After finding a suitable dark, preferably claustrophobic space, the creature begins hunting in a territory within a 1 mile radius of its lair. In a region with an average amount of wildlife, it takes little more than 2 weeks for a centianima to fill its lair with a dense carpet of bones.",
			"",
			"### Centianima Variants",
			"",
			"The circumstances under which a centianima forms greatly affect its abilities. The following are the most common variants.",
			"",
			"**Aquatic (CR +0):** These centianimas arise from the bones of aquatic animals. They usually inhabit sunken ships and ruins claimed by the sea. Aquatic centianimas gain the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 40 feet.",
			"",
			"**Burrowing (CR +0):** This underground variant usually arises from the dry bones of many burrowing creatures. Burrowing centianimas gain a burrow speed of 20 feet.",
			"",
			"**Chittering (CR +1):** This variant centianima can emit a bone-rattling chitter as a standard action. Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against the effect is immune to that centianima's chitter for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Jumping (CR +0):** This desert-dwelling variant gains a +12 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump and it treats any Acrobatics skill check to jump, as if it had a running start. It doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity while jumping. A jumping centianima uses this ability to position itself amid its enemies so it can better attack with both of its heads.",
			"",
			"**One-Headed (CR -1):** This rare variant occurs when the formation of a centianima is interrupted before the second head has formed. One-headed centianimas have only 3 Hit Dice, and they don't gain all-around vision or the dual threat special ability.",
			"",
			"**Paralytic (CR +1):** These centianimas arise from the bones of venomous animals. Any creature that takes damage from the centianima's bite attack must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Symbiotic (CR +1):** These centianimas have formed a close symbiotic relationship with the vermin that feed on the rotting flesh in their lairs. Three times per day, the centianima can vomit up a spider swarm as a standard action. This swarm attacks the nearest living creature, but is otherwise not controlled by the centianima."

			"**Chain Spirit (Su)** As a standard action once per day, a chained spirit can attempt to chain any evil-aligned corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that it can detect via spiritsense; it need not have line of sight or line of effect to such a creature. The targeted evil creature to must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or take 1d8 points of Charisma drain. On each successful attack, the chained spirit gains 5 temporary hit points. Any creature targeted by this ability is immediately aware of some malevolence attempting to take control of it. If a creature's Charisma score is drained to 0 by this attack, its fate depends on its Hit Dice. If the victim has half the Hit Dice or fewer of the chained spirit (8 Hit Dice for most chained spirits), it is slain by the attack. If the victim has more than 8 Hit Dice, it becomes a spirit anchor linked to the chained spirit (see below). Even though a chained spirit can use this ability once per day, it can create only one spirit anchor per week. In addition, a chained spirit can use this ability only if it currently has three or fewer spirit anchors, and it can never have more than four spirit anchors. A creature with more than half the chained spirit's Hit Dice whose Charisma score is drained to 0 by this attack and who doesn't become a spirit anchor is merely driven unconscious, as per normal for catastrophic Charisma drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. Numerous chains extend from a chained spirit. A number of these (one for every spirit anchor currently tethered to the chained spirit) are corporeal and can make melee attacks. These corporeal chains are treated as evil, magical, {magic-enh/ghost touch} weapons and deal bludgeoning damage in addition to Charisma drain. Each chain is treated as if wielded one-handed by a creature with a Strength score of 25. A sundered chain automatically reforms 1 round later.",

			"",
			"**Spectral Bindings (Su)** A chained spirit is extremely mobile, with only one major hindrance: no matter how far it moves on its turn, as long as it has at least one spirit anchor, it automatically returns to its starting place when its turn ends. This immediate return does not count as an action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, as the spirit simply reappears back in its original position. In essence, the chained spirit is eternally confined to a single square throughout its existence except the distance it can travel in a single round before returning to its starting position. If another creature occupies the space it has left, that creature is shunted to the closest available square. If a solid object occupies its starting square, the spirit's incorporeal nature allows it to return regardless. Even a force effect cannot thwart it as it simply reappears within the square, though if that square is surrounded by a force effect with no exit, the chained spirit is effectively trapped.",
			"",
			"**Spectral Sight (Su)** A chained spirit can see and hear through the senses of any of its spirit anchors whenever it wishes, just as if it were using both effects of clairaudience/clairvoyance.",
			"",
			"**Spiritsense (Su)** A chained spirit can detect both the living and the undead. It can detect living creatures within 100 feet, just as if it had {umr/blindsight}. It can also sense the dead, as per {spell/detect undead}, to a range of 500 feet.",

Reaching out with these chains, these tormented undead claim allies, binding other unwilling sentinels to the same charge with which they are eternally cursed.",
			"",
			"Among the rarest known manifestations of undead, the chained spirit can exist only in an area of extreme misery combined with a potent source of necromantic energy. In the case of Scarwall, the castle's history of violence, combined with the vengeful attention of Zon-Kuthon, made the castle the perfect cradle for the generation of a chained spirit. Others may well exist on Golarion, or could yet come to manifest, but at this point, the chained spirit of Scarwall may be the only one of its kind.",

These benefits stack as appropriate, so a chained spirit with four spirit anchors (the maximum) gains a +8 profane bonus to AC, fast healing 20, four chain attacks, immunity to positive energy, and spectral sight. As long as at least one of its spirit anchors exists, the chained spirit itself cannot be destroyed. If reduced to 0 hit points, the chained spirit reappears with full hit points 1 minute later. A chained spirit can have up to four spirit anchors at any one time. The stats presented above represent a chain spirit with four spirit anchors and include all the associated benefits.",
			"",
			"Losing a Spirit Anchor: If a spirit anchor is destroyed or released, a chained spirit's benefits are reduced as appropriate: its AC is reduced by 2, its fast healing is reduced by 5, and it loses one of its chain attacks. If all of a chained spirit's spirit anchors are destroyed, it gains no profane bonus to AC, has no fast healing, has no chain attacks, can be harmed by positive energy, and loses its spectral sight. It does gain one benefit - when it has no spirit anchors, it is no longer restricted as much by its spectral bindings, and can move throughout the area in which it is bound (up to a radius of 1 mile) without being returned to its starting point at the end of a round. Each time a spirit anchor is destroyed or killed, the chained spirit loses its chain spirit ability for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"Spirit Anchor Effects: A creature that becomes a spirit anchor instantly regains any Charisma drained by the chained spirit to which it is tethered. It is also bound to the location it was at when it was reduced to 0 Charisma by the chained spirit. Spirit anchors typically cannot move farther than 100 feet from this spot, but in the cases of creatures that require wider mobility to fulfill their physical needs, a chained spirit can relax its grip, allowing them to range farther afield. However, the chained spirit can employ a compulsion similar to {spell/geas//quest} at will, forcing such a spirit anchor to return to its anchor spot. A spirit anchor that ignores the compulsion takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage per day until it returns. The death of the spirit anchor, or the spells {spell/dispel evil}, {spell/dispel law}, {spell/freedom}, {spell/miracle}, or {spell/wish}, can release a spirit anchor. Beyond this restraint, a chained spirit holds no special control over its spirit anchors."

So close is this relationship that the name of a particular chalkost is often passed down from priest to priest and family to family, so that some of these divine beings have aided clans for generations. Chalkosts have a close relationship with dwarven paladins and other noble dwarven warriors, and it is considered a special honor for mortal dwarves to ride a boar-form chalkost into battle.",
			"",
			"A chalkost looks like an attractive, copper-haired dwarf wearing an open-faced helm with stylized boar tusks and armed with a hammer-tipped cestus. Male chalkosts have long beards, while females have long braids. The gender of a chalkost associated with a given dwarven clan generally matches the gender of the clan's leaders.",
			"",
			"Chalkosts stand just over 5 feet tall and weigh about 230 pounds."

Slaves who show a knack for distracting prey may even become favored pets, fed well and beaten less than most.

In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets - the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices' nests and consume their eggs - appear to be completely immune to the effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one."

It can attempt to feed on a region once per week, and upon a living creature at will (but only once per day per living creature). Feeding on a region of plant life is automatically successful, blighting that region of plant life as if by a diminish plants spell used to stunt growth. ",

A colour's arrival upon a world is typically via a small meteorite strike - the colour itself infuses a meteoroid, and shortly after the falling star's arrival, the rock crumbles away to expose the semi-solid mass of a larval colour that seeps into the surrounding landscape. Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-floating, eerie radiance. Natural sunlight doesn't particularly harm colours out of space, but they prefer to dwell in darkened areas like deep caves or abandoned wells where their own radiance is the only light.",

When a colour has absorbed enough life to grow to full maturity (usually signified by reaching 25 to 30 Hit Dice), it gathers its strength and erupts from its den, coruscating into the sky as it launches the majority of itself back into space. Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again. Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable, not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but also by the presence of those the colour has fed on. These unfortunate, deformed individuals, known as colour-blighted creatures, never live for long, but while they do, their madness often drives them to violent behavior, be they people or beasts.",

A Charisma score drained to 0 by a colour out of space's feed attack is raised to 1; otherwise, its ability scores are not altered by this template. In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one only has to restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or crumble into fine, white ash - such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, the only chance at escape from a life filled with pain."

			"**Deific (Su)** Conqueror worms can grant divine spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on a conqueror worm's behalf. Conqueror worms grant access to the domains of Charm, Evil, Nobility, and Trickery, and their favored weapon varies but is always a simple weapon (daggers and sickles being the most common choices). Each conqueror worm has its own unique holy symbol, although typically it resembles a ring of eyes.",
			"",
			"**Mental Invader (Su)** A conqueror worm infects the minds of others from afar, allowing it to control its puppets without leaving the safety of the earth's depths. When a conqueror worm communicates with a creature mentally, such as by using telepathy or spells such as dream, it can attempt to form a lasting mental connection with that creature. The target can resist this connection with a successful DC 33 Will save. A target that succeeds at this save is immune to that conqueror worm's mental invader ability forever. Once a connection is formed, the worm can communicate with the bonded creature using telepathy over any distance, and can target the bonded creature with mind-affecting spells and effects regardless of range. A worm can form bonds with a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence modifier (10 for the typical conqueror worm). If a new bond would exceed this limit, the worm must choose to break one of its previous connections. The effects of a bond are suppressed while the worm and the bonded creature are on different planes. A bond can otherwise be broken only via a {spell/break enchantment}, {spell/miracle}, or {spell/wish} spell cast on the bonded creature, or by the worm's death. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Escape (Su)** A conqueror worm can escape death by casting its mind out of its body at the moment of death. Up to once per day, when an attack, spell, or effect would reduce a conqueror worm to 0 or fewer hit points or otherwise kill it instantly, it can transfer its mind to one of the creatures it has formed a connection with using its mental invader ability. The target can attempt a DC 33 Will save to resist being overtaken. If the target succeeds, the conqueror worm can be killed normally. If the target fails, the conqueror worm transfers its soul into the bonded creature's body. This functions as the spell {spell/possession} (CL 21st) except the possession is permanent. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm in this way undergoes terrible changes to its physiology. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. Over time, the host slowly grows more wormlike in appearance, losing body hair, growing obese, and taking on a pale yellow-white coloration. When the host's Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a brand new body as a new conqueror worm that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally). If the host is slain before this transformation completes, the conqueror worm dies as well. The effect can also be ended by any effect that successfully expels the conqueror worm's possessing spirit from the host. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",

			"Though conqueror worms resemble immense vermin, those who mistake them for mindless creatures suffer terribly for their mistake. In truth, conqueror worms are creatures of vast intellect and equal depravity. These monstrous beings exist only to rule \"lesser civilizations\" from the shadows, and revel in the complete control of an unknowing society through the remote manipulation of its supposed leaders.",
			"",
			"A conqueror worm prefers to play with its toys before breaking them. To do so, it burrows its way below a target nation's capital. From there, the conqueror worm makes mental contact with the city's leaders, forming sinister psychic connections with those in power. The worm beguiles some of these leaders with promises of wealth or power. Others, the worm controls outright using the considerable psychic magic at its disposal. Regardless, the end result is the same; without intervention, all end up as puppets dancing to the conqueror worm's whims.",
			"",
			"Once a conqueror worm seizes control of a city or nation, that region's downfall can take years, if not decades - for conqueror worms are surprisingly theatrical. A conqueror worm may direct a kingdom's leader to enact cruel or tyrannical laws, only to then use a second puppet to inflame the populace into revolt. Once the fires of revolution die down, the worm might then expose the rebel leader as a traitor or depraved criminal, causing the rebellion to turn on itself and descend again into violence. All the while, the conqueror worm watches in delight at the madness, sin, and horror it inspires in others.",
			"",
			"Eventually a conqueror worm tires of its games, and plots to destroy its subjects. Often it does this by sending its puppets to war against a nearby nation. The horrors of war devastate not only the worm's own populace, but also those of its neighbors, bringing perverse joy to the worm's many hearts. However, a special fate awaits the worm's favorite servants, who are brought down into its subterranean realm so they can glimpse their master's true form before being impaled on the conqueror worm's goreslick jaws. Its work finally finished, the conqueror worm then seeks out a new realm to subjugate.",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most terrifying and peculiar aspect of the conqueror worm is its ability to form cults. Whether through accumulation of psychic power or some hidden divine spark, conqueror worms are capable of granting spells to creatures that worship them. A conqueror worm exploits this ability to attract cultists, which it uses to further its goals in the civilized world above. Although such cults are absolutely loyal to the conqueror worm, which they worship as an all-knowing and all-powerful god, the conqueror worm usually considers its mortal followers expendable.",

			"Once, the entities that would become known as contemplatives were relatively normal humanoids, notable only for their extreme intelligence. At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as telekinesis. Evolution - whether natural or forced by the contemplatives themselves - made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank.",
			"",

Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities, resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in appearance and demeanor, contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conflict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution.",

			"A typical contemplative weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 4 feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever it's talking to. When it speaks inside another creature's head, its voice is monotone and seems to come from everywhere at once, and when multiple contemplatives are encountered, they almost always use the pronoun \"we\" rather than the individual \"I.\""

Proponents of this theory point to the fact that copsewights understand Sylvan, although they cannot speak any languages. Others claim that they are a byproduct of the Abyssal Darkblight ravaging portions of the Fangwood, but the trees move very slowly and have been encountered in places scattered around the Inner Sea region and beyond, suggesting that the Darkblight is not the only source of these creatures. Whatever their original source, most copsewights now seem to arise spontaneously, especially when diseased trees die within an area contaminated by fell magic.",

They have no natural life cycle and continue to exist until they are discovered and destroyed. Although their rotting fruit contains seeds, nothing grows from them. Only poisoners have any use for the fruit.",

			"Copsewights have been discovered in many of the most infamous forests on Golarion. Rumors suggest that one of the creatures made its way from the Fangwood to the Duskshroud Forest on Molthune's border with Druma, although it seems unlikely one of the trees could travel that far, especially since it would have to cross the Nosam River. Explorers have also reported encountering copsewights in the Whisperwood in Nidal and in the Tanglebriar in Kyonin. The creatures appear in parts of the Mwangi Expanse as well.",
			"",
			"Recent reports from Lastwall indicate that two powerful copsewights have taken up residence in the old courtyard of the Vaishau Ruin, along the river road that runs between Vigil and Gallowspire. The ruin has a reputation as a lure for undead, who seem to be answering a call that only they can hear. The Knights of Ozem dealt with the trees during one of their monthly trips to the ruin, but the renewed undead presence remains a mystery. No one seems to know who or what calls them to the ruin or why these two copsewights were so strong.",

Corbayrants lack eyes, but they perceive their surroundings through a combination of sound and changes in air pressure.",
			"",
			"A corbayrant's spiny forelegs deliver a magical paralytic toxin that causes afflicted victims to sprout barbs that can transmit the paralysis to others. A corbayrant rarely waits for this paralysis to run its course, as it prefers to snatch up paralyzed victims in its large quadrisecting mouth and swallow them whole. The creature's abdomen contains sharp thorns that exude the same paralytic toxin as its spines, which keep its prey immobile while it is being digested.",

During the Age of Anguish, when gnomes fled to Golarion from the First World, the corbayrants followed. History is unclear as to whether the Green Mother dispatched her corbayrants to hunt the fleeing gnomes, or whether the beasts were also refugees. In any case, the Eldest took steps to ensure that her hunters would remain on Golarion to spread chaos, severing their connection to the First World. Corbayrants spread throughout the forests of Avistan - and particularly throughout the vast Verduran Forest - gleefully preying upon travelers and sating their monstrous appetites. Patient and watchful, corbayrants can remain hidden for days or even months, waiting for the perfect time to strike at prey. Despite their exile, corbayrants retain many features that demonstrate their otherworldly origin, including a magical paralytic toxin, a whimsical and cruel demeanor, and a life span so long as to make them essentially ageless.",
			"",
			"The corbayrants' depredations continued until the march of Taldor's First Army of Exploration. Pushing northward through the Verduran Forest, the armies not only annexed humanoid realms but also vanquished monsters that endangered Taldan civilization. Units of elite monster-hunters cornered and killed several corbayrants, driving the most powerful and cunning survivors deep into hiding. As millennia went by, the reclusive beasts became little more than legend, although many still prey upon animals and daring travelers who penetrate their remote forest lairs.",

			"",
			"Corbayrants are incredibly rare, and those few that survived into the modern day are crafty and careful. Daring monster-hunters occasionally venture into their forests to learn whether rumors of surviving corbayrants are true; these brave warriors generally seek the glory from vanquishing such a legendary foe or wish to acquire a corbayrant's rare and valuable toxins. A few druidic cabals know that corbayrants exist, but they give the creatures a wide berth and steer others well away from the monsters' hunting grounds to avoid triggering a corbayrant's capricious wrath.",
			"",
			"Corbayrants dislike the company of others of their kind; they see other corbayrants as competitors and reminders of the days when they were hunted. Corbayrants can't reproduce outside of the First World and therefore can't expand their species, although some corbayrants are independently investigating magical methods of propagation that involve bizarre rituals and bloody sacrifices of fey creatures.",
			"",
			"A corbayrant's strange biology is dramatically impacted by cold environments, making it sluggish and irritable. Cold damage causes its flesh to degenerate with surprising speed, and the touch of even a single snowflake causes it excruciating agony. Although corbayrants are reluctant to relocate from their established hunting grounds, prolonged periods of cold weather usually compel them to seek warmer territory. A rare few corbayrants have adapted to other habitats, lurking in warm, fetid marshes or amid desert oases."

			"Auwaz couatls are a variety of couatl known for helping those who are lost find their way back to safety. They are particularly known for traveling around the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds.",
			"",

			"",
			"Auwaz couatls are the most commonly known couatls across Golarion, at least among those people who live near coasts. An auwaz couatl's scales are a light gray with subtle light blue and green markings. Their feathers are typically blue and green, with hints of light yellow reminiscent of the sun. The coloring resembles the waters of the oceans, and the exact coloring of an auwaz couatl tends to vary depending on which body of water the couatl frequents - each major sea and ocean seems to have its own distinct auwaz markings and colorations. The sound of an auwaz couatl's wings resembles that of a gentle ocean breeze. This makes it hard to detect their approach, and many sailors tend to utter short blessings whenever they encounter a calm, compliant breeze, just in case an auwaz couatl is nearby.",
			"",
			"Each auwaz couatl knows the location of every settlement on the edge of its waters and is happy to share this knowledge with those it views favorably. Those who draw an auwaz couatl's suspicion sometimes receive inaccurate knowledge, ending up at a settlement a few hundred miles away from their intended destination. An auwaz couatl usually gives this misinformation to allow it time to follow the travelers and determine whether they are dangerous, correcting its original directions only if the travelers appear to be good-hearted. When dealing with evil travelers, an auwaz couatl usually points them toward subtle dangers such as troubled waters, reefs, and other oceanic dangers. The creature won't follow these travelers and is content with letting the ocean determine their fates.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls have moderate control over the weather, calling forth winds and storms as they feel necessary. They use this power to aid the travel of those they are guiding home, summoning strong winds to make the journeys of sailing ships shorter. Similarly, if an auwaz couatl encounters a sinking ship, it uses its powers to grant survivors the ability to breathe water and personally guides these victims to safety. This power also allows an auwaz couatl to work against evil travelers, making their journeys difficult and even calling on lightning storms to strike ships when necessary.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls have the shortest lives of all couatls, living only about a century at most, and most have life spans equivalent to those of humans. Due to their flighty nature, they rarely take the time to meet with others of their kind, though they do gather once every few years to reproduce, laying several eggs each. Its uncertain how auwaz couatls know the exact time to gather, though many believe they read a message in the stars left behind by their cousins, the {monster/mix couatl/s}.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls live roving, independent lives that allow them to travel all across Golarion. Although most auwaz couatls live near the seas and oceans of Golarion, some prefer to stay inland and help those lost in forests or mountains. An auwaz couatl typically sticks to its home in its younger years, but it eventually travels the world through its adult life before returning. Auwaz couatls tend to avoid each other and keep out of each other's affairs, except in times of peril. In these cases, an auwaz couatl uses a particular call, perceptible only to other couatls, to warn of danger. During these fraught times, auwaz couatls travel in packs, especially to protect the younger members of their kind.",
			"",
			"As they are generally good-natured and curious, many auwaz couatls take time to speak with any travelers they find, often flying above ships and conversing with those on board. These conversations usually involve current events, as auwaz couatls prefer to keep updated so as to not send travelers to dangerous locales, but they can also include artistic and philosophical discussions. Some auwaz couatls are quite fond of humorous stories and like to spend hours telling such tales, especially if there are children among the travelers. The sight of an auwaz couatl above a ship serves as a signal to others that the ship is protected, so many ships fly kites in the shape of auwaz couatls in hopes of giving marauders pause.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls are particularly fond of children, as they find kinship in their innocence. They are more than happy to comfort distressed children and guide them home. In particularly dire situations, or ones where a child may be too far from home to safely travel, an auwaz couatl will carry the child on its back and fly it to safety. An auwaz couatl typically has a different approach with children who have run away from home; the auwaz couatl takes time to speak with the child and learn her reasons for running away. In some cases, the child seeks to escape a troubled life and the auwaz couatl helps guide the child to a new home. In other cases, the auwaz couatl convinces the child to return home but encourages her to cultivate the wanderlust in her heart. Such children tend to grow into adventurers and travel the world years later.",

In addition, if buried in at least 6 inches of soil and undisturbed for 24 hours, the feather can be used as the material component to cast a {spell/hallow} spell; the spell effect tied to the hallowed site is always the enrichment version of {spell/plant growth}. By using a chicome feather in this way, the caster need not expend the typical payment of gold or other valuables required by the spell.",
			"",
			"A typical chicome is 40 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 5,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Chicomes typically show themselves only in the aftermath of an incredible act of devastation or widespread destruction, such as a massive battle or the razing of a large settlement, and even then only if the couatl deems the area in question worthy of being restored. Their exact criteria for worthy lands are unclear; what is known is that badlands chosen by one of these blessed sky serpents are enormously enriched by the outsider's presence. When a chicome restores the balance of nature to a ruined area, it cleanses the land of any residual toxins and contagions, such as contaminated earth or water, and plants the seeds of new life. If the restoration of healthy biomes is not enough to draw nearby wildlife back to the region- or if all the local fauna has been exhausted - the couatl uses its magic to coax animals from other corners of the world to the fledgling environment.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Chicomes are strictly solitary creatures who dwell in the lands that need their help. While they are purifying a particular region, chicomes periodically take flight to survey the area and determine whether their presence is still justified. The couatls also scout for worthy guardians in the vicinity to take over stewardship - typically a powerful awakened animal, but sometimes a nemophilist in a nearby settlement. These individuals typically become druids who learn their abilities from the chicome, though anyone the couatl deems worthy may serve as a steward of such lands, regardless of the individual's magical prowess. Those who have received a chicome's blessing are sometimes referred to as Children of the Chicome. If ever one such steward is slain while protecting her pocket of wilderness, her host chicome will return its child to life using its powers of reincarnation. The steward is typically reborn as the animal it most identified with in life.",
			"",
			"Though they may serve a range of lawful and good deities, chicomes are typically agents of those gods with an aspect of nature or life, such as {faith/Erastil} or Cihua Couatl, or empyreal lords like {faith/Cernunnos} or {faith/Valani}. Some chicomes may even serve neutral-aligned deities such as {faith/Gozreh} or {faith/Feronia}. Chicomes never serve deities, no matter how noble, whose portfolio includes the destruction of nature or the spread of civilization, such as {faith/Torag}. Many chicomes serve no deities at all and are dedicated only to the primordial forces of nature.",

He is aided in his efforts by his champion, Jua Mfuasi (LG male human paladin of Iomedae 10), who was once a necromancer known as the Corpse-King until he was killed and returned to life by Sun-Warrior, after which he renounced his evil ways and abandoned arcane magic to become a paladin."

They seek out less established tribes and villages and offer their knowledge to help such settlements flourish. A mix couatl can offer a variety of knowledge depending on the nature of the settlement and its people. To some, they offer knowledge of new farming and hunting techniques, while others are taught more esoteric knowledge, like the arcane arts. While nurturing a settlement, a mix couatl typically acts as its protector, keeping at bay any foes that would disrupt the growth of the people. A typical mix couatl is 12 feet long with a wingspan of 15 feet and weighs 1,500 pounds.",

The scales of a mix couatl are dotted with small white and light gray spots that resemble the stars in the sky and red stripes that resemble the final rays of a setting sun. Their feathers range in color from dark blues to deep violets to blacks darker than the night. This coloring resembles the colors of the twilight and helps a mix couatl hide among the stars at night. The flapping of their wings as they fly through the skies is said to resemble the sounds of distant thunder. Many who know of mix couatls or recognize this sound claim that the noise is very calming, as it is both a reminder of relaxing summer rains and of the couatls' protection.",

The mix couatl can bless an individual with this knowledge, even though the couatl itself may not know the full details of the gift it grants. This shared knowledge allows mix couatls to work together and aid each other even if they never meet face to face, a lesson that they also teach to others. Individual mix couatls may have different skills from those listed above, depending on their own experience and expertise.",

Thanks to this knowledge, many see mix couatls as demigods of the hunt. Some claim that mix couatls were present during the early days of Golarion to help guide humanity by providing knowledge of fire and magic. With this knowledge, the first humans were able to learn how to make war, so some humans also consider mix couatls to be demigods of war - a reputation mix couatls have worked hard to escape in the millennia since.",

In the end, most settlements find that these challenges teach great lessons and use this valuable knowledge to improve their settlements in unexpected ways.",

Only on rare occasions does a mix couatl abandon a settlement. This usually happens when the mix couatl recognizes that its attempts to improve the settlement may actually be harmful, whether due to a potential loss of important traditions or when the possibility of growth could expose the settlement to great dangers from the outside world.",

Alternatively, a tletli's feather can be used as an additional material component while casting any damage-dealing spell with the fire descriptor; in this case, the spell gains the benefits of the {feat/Maximize Spell} metamagic feat, and the spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.",

In addition to their worship of righteous deities such as {faith/Sarenrae} and {faith/Torag}, tletlis serve a disproportionate number of empyreal lords, enacting swift justice on behalf of mighty angels and archons like {faith/Ragathiel}, {faith/Olheon}, and {faith/Damerrich}.

Legend tells that tletlis were more prominent on Golarion shortly after Earthfall as they worked to fight the evils that arose during the Age of Darkness.",
			"",
			"If and when a tletli is called upon to obliterate an irredeemable region, the couatl enlists mortals to aid its efforts, typically in the form of envoys and delegates who extend a final chance for redemption to the sinners in question. A tletli's prerogative, however, is punishment, not mercy, and woe be unto any who cavort with the wrong kind of company at the wrong time in a tletli's presence. If there are genuine innocents within a group or settlement on which the tletli has set its sights, the couatl may send an emissary, such as a charmed person, to forewarn the pure of heart, but it otherwise does not hesitate to incinerate the entire locale. Their deific masters understand tletlis' unrivaled propensity for holy retribution all too well, and they typically send other couatls or celestials like angels to accompany the tletlis in case there are a number of individuals in a settlement that should be evacuated or protected during the razing."

			"",
			"Xiuh couatls are a fierce variety of couatl commonly associated with vengeance and retribution. They seek out vile creatures, offering one final opportunity at redemption. Those who do not accept this offer or cannot be redeemed face the xiuh couatl's fearsome and absolute punishment. In cases where its might alone is not enough, a xiuh couatl offers its assistance to a powerful, righteous figure to mete out justice on its behalf. The winged serpents glow with an intense plume of flames, draped in arcing electricity. Their feathers range in color from bright crimson to deep violet, encompassing the shades of the setting sun. A typical xiuh couatl is 20 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet. It weighs 4,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Unlike their cousins, the common quetz couatl and the roving auwaz couatl, xiuh couatls are rarely seen, but are a sight to behold when they make themselves known. The beat of each wing is a brilliant display of terrifying flames and magnificent flashes of lightning that send cacophonous echoes through the sky. The couatls' flight can be heard up to a mile away. As they move through the air, they resemble thunderstorms with flaming rain. These fiery tempests are said to be omens signaling the imminent fall of wickedness or a forthcoming new beginning, born of a purifying inferno.",
			"",
			"A xiuh couatl's snout glows red hot for minutes after spewing forth its elemental breath. This breath, like the xiuh couatl's wings, is a coalescence of fire and electricity - a fearsome ray of powerful energy. The breath is used not only to attack enemies, but also to burn away decayed or corrupted lands with cleansing flame. The couatl's tail ends in a small conflagration that moves and flickers in response to the couatl's moods.",
			"",
			"The mind of a xiuh couatl is powerful and wise, bordering on the transcendent. It uses its extraordinary psychic gifts to track down evil foes, making use of its ability to see into possible futures to quickly find its targets. Once it locates a creature, the xiuh couatl sends portents to the target's dreams to dissuade it from a life of evil. If these visions are not enough, a xiuh couatl visits the creature and offers to share its knowledge of goodness and virtue. The xiuh couatl shows the creature the differences in its life if it continues on a path of evildoing and if it accepts redemption. If these steps fail, the xiuh couatl destroys the creature's body or its mind, whichever is found to be a more fitting punishment, as a last resort.",
			"",
			"Xiuh couatls are extremely long-lived, with some said to have been alive before Earthfall. During its lifetime, a female xiuh couatl lays only a single egg. The egg is as black as ash and hatches anywhere from a single couatl to a litter of eight to 10. As native outsiders, xiuh couatls must eat, and they are known to feed on large wildlife such as bison, deer, or wild horses. Occasionally, they consume larger creatures that pose threats to local civilizations or environments, such as rocs or young dragons.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Unlike their more common cousins, xiuh couatls are seen only during the gravest of times. When not actively seeking foul creatures to redeem, they nest in dangerous, remote places where they are likely to be undisturbed. Volcanic calderas, remote valleys, and high mountaintops wrapped in continual lightning storms are notable locations where xiuh couatl nests have been found. For years after they have been abandoned, the nests are known for their tendency to attract fire and lightning elementals. Xiuh couatls and their nests are extremely rare in Avistan, but are more frequently found in central and southern Garund and the mountains of central Arcadia.",
			"",
			"While solitary creatures, xiuh couatls occasionally form a close bond with a partner with whom they may even mate (should they have not done so previously in their long lifetimes). The closest of these relationships are forged between a couatl and one of the offspring born from its sole egg. While a parent cannot mate again, such a bond is universally platonic and can span centuries, far longer than most similar pairings. While a partnership may last as long as a millennia, nearly all xiuh couatls eventually return to lives of solitude. They can acquire many allies during a crusade for good, but move on as soon as they have vanquished a particular evil.",
			"",
			"Though they tend to rely on their own visions and divinations to seek out evil, xiuh couatls are sometimes called on by the gods to tackle given tasks. Sarenrae, in particular, makes the most of use of all types of couatls, but xiuh couatls can be called upon by Desna, Shelyn, or, in Arcadia, Kazutal, goddess of community, liberty, and safety. As usual, xiuh couatls first attempt to redeem the creatures they are tasked with destroying, but follow with violent retribution if required. Gods may also assign xiuh couatls to aid individuals who require assistance in times of adversity. These individuals are gifted weapons by their divine patrons, and may never know they actually wield xiuh couatls, even after their tasks have been completed."
