			"Combat is more than just knowing how to swing a sword without cutting yourself. To some, it is a means to an end, a regrettable necessity when all other options have failed, and a tool that is to be set down the moment it's not absolutely needed. To others, it is a panacea and a way of life - a means of solving any problem, and of proving one's worth by standing tall against one's fellows and the harsh denizens of an uncaring universe. In the hands of a skilled warrior, a sword is no longer simply a sharpened length of steel, and even a club is more than just a broken branch. These objects become instruments of a serious and sometimes brutal art, one whose practitioners are every bit as skilled in their artistry as the greatest bards. Many such acolytes of battle might say that theirs is the only art worth pursuing, as it's the sole one by which the artist not only inspires respect, but commands it. Combat is civilization's oldest trade and form of expression, and no matter how far we've come since the first days of stones and sticks, it continues to shape the events that define us. A civilized society may claim to abhor bloodshed, but it's that same bloodshed - or its threat - that watches over us and gives us the freedom to maintain such ideals.",

			"Guns are not strangers to fantasy. The earliest authors of fantasy and weird fiction often included guns in their stories. Heroes like Burroughs's John Carter or Howard's Solomon Kane carried pistols alongside their swords, and it's hard to imagine a pirate ship without cannons blazing. These authors likely included guns because they are exciting, but also because the guns they chose were primitive ones - relatively unpredictable weapons, prone to misfire and malfunction. This made firearms excellent storytelling devices. Such weapons could cause hero or villain to falter or triumph, changing the action within the tale in a flash or a fizzle. Still, a firearm remains an ominous and terrible weapon in the hands of a skilled gunman.",
			"",
			"This section presents an anachronistic collection of hand-held black powder weapons. Most of them are singleshot muzzle-loaders with highly inefficient triggering mechanisms - traditional sword and sorcery firearms. More advanced firearms are also presented for those brave enough to mix their fantasy with a technology much closer to that of the Old West than the slow and unstable weapons that gave musketeers their name. If you are interested in letting such weapons in your game, do so with the following warning: Advanced guns can substantially change the assumptions of your game world, in the same way that they changed the face of warfare in the real world. If you like your fantasy to be of the more traditional variety, stand clear. Or, better yet, run for cover."

			"Firearms and gunslingers are not for every campaign, and even if you are excited about introducing firearms into your campaign, you should still make a decision about how commonplace they are. The following are broad categories of firearm rarity and the rules that govern them. Pathfinder's world of Golarion uses the rules for emerging guns, which is also the default category of gun rarity detailed in this Pathfinder RPG supplement.",
			"",
			"***No Guns:*** If you do not want guns in your campaign, simply don't allow the rules that follow. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game plays perfectly well without them.",
			"",
			"***Very Rare Guns:*** Early firearms are rare; advanced firearms, the gunslinger class, the {feat/Amateur Gunslinger} feat, and archetypes that use the firearm rules do not exist in this type of campaign. Firearms are treated more like magic items - things of wonder and mystery - rather than like things that are mass-produced. Few know the strange secrets of firearm creation. Only NPCs can take the {feat/Gunsmithing} feat.",
			"",
			"***Emerging Guns:*** Firearms become more common. They are mass-produced by small guilds, lone gunsmiths, dwarven clans, or maybe even a nation or two - the secret is slipping out, and the occasional rare adventurer uses guns. The baseline gunslinger rules and the prices for ammunition are for this type of campaign. Early firearms are available, but are relatively rare. Adventurers who want to use guns must take the {feat/Gunsmithing} feat just to make them feasible weapons. Advanced firearms may exist, but only as rare and wondrous items - the stuff of high-level treasure troves.",
			"",
			"***Commonplace Guns:*** While still expensive and tricky to wield, early firearms are readily available. Instead of requiring the {feat/Exotic Weapon Proficiency} feat, all firearms are martial weapons. Early firearms and their ammunition cost 25% of the amounts listed, but advanced firearms and their ammunition are still rare and cost the full price to purchase or craft.",
			"",
			"***Guns Everywhere:*** Guns are commonplace. Early firearms are seen as antiques, and advanced firearms are widespread. Firearms are simple weapons, and early firearms, advanced guns, and their ammunition are bought or crafted for 10% of the cost listed. The gunslinger loses the gunsmith class feature and instead gains the gun training class feature at 1st level."

A nonproficient character takes the standard -4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.",
			"",
			"Even though the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms)](feat/exotic_weapon_proficiency) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as {feat/Weapon Focus} or {feat/Rapid Reload}), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.",
			"",
			"All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter's weapon training class feature.",
			"",
			"***Capacity:*** A firearm's capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.",
			"",
			"***Range and Penetration:*** Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.",
			"",
			"***Early Firearms:*** When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as {feat/Deadly Aim}. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.",
			"",
			"***Advanced Firearms:*** Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as {feat/Deadly Aim}. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.",
			"",
			"***Loading a Firearm:*** You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other - you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm. Loading siege firearms requires both hands, and one hand usually manipulates a large ramrod (which can be wielded as a club in combat).",
			"",
			"The {feat/Rapid Reload} feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms, but this feat does not reduce the time it takes to load siege firearms.",
			"",
			"Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.",
			"",
			"***Early Firearms:*** Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm. It takes three full-round actions by one person to load a siege firearm. This can be reduced to two full-round actions if more than one person is loading the cannon.",
			"",
			"***Advanced Firearms:*** Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity. The {feat/Rapid Reload} feat reduces this to a free action.",
			"",
			"***Misfires:*** If the natural result of your attack roll falls within a firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm (see the {class/gunslinger} class). In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.",
			"",
			"***Early Firearms:*** If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the {feat/Gunsmithing} feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square - the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon - a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.",
			"",
			"***Advanced Firearms:*** Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A further misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.",
			"",
			"***Ammunition:*** Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Unlike other types of ammunition, firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used, and has no chance of being retrieved on a miss. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.",
			"",
			"***Concealing Firearms:*** Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.",
			"",
			"***Inappropriately Sized Firearms:*** You cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for you. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between your size and the size of the firearm. If you are not proficient with the firearm, a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands you need to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a -4 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness.",
			"",
			"***Bucklers:*** You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.",
			"",
			"***Fire while Prone:*** Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.",
			"",
			"***Firearms, Black Powder, and Water:*** Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.",
			"",
			"***Deflecting and Snatching Bullets:*** The {feat/Deflect Arrows} feat and the {feat/Snatch Arrows} feat can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon. Neither of these feats can be used to deflect siege firearm attacks."

Other duels last until first blood, first strike, or a number of successful attacks. These latter types of duels are usually intended to settle disputes where a creature's death is not the required end result.",

The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell's caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success.

			"When creating a performance combat, it is important to determine the goals and rules of that combat. The following are the major examples of performance combat, but you should feel free to mix and match some of these general categories to create a performance combat that fits the story of your campaign.",
			"",
			"***Knockout Bout:*** Frequently as brutal but not as bloody as battles to the death, a knockout bout does not end in the death of one side, but still requires a clear and crushing victory. As long as both sides in the performance combat remain standing, the fight continues. Many knockout bout combats require that their participants deal nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"***Staged Combats:*** Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the {feat/Stage Combatant} feat). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a -6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.",
			"",
			"***To a Number of Wounds:*** Not all blood sports end in death. It is often costly to train warriors for arenas big and small, and those who finance such enterprises are protective of their investments. In societies that value life but still love the spectacle of a good fracas, fighting to a number of wounds is an excellent compromise. A fight to first blood or to a certain number of wounds is often enough to appease a crowd.",
			"",
			"***To the Death:*** Only the death of one side ends these bouts. Sometimes the crowd's reaction is secondary to the desperate battle on display, but other times the crowd's reaction can have an effect on the actual outcome of the fight. Some blood sports demand that combatants hold off on the killing blow until the crowd gets a chance to voice its pleasure or displeasure, usually with a roar of applause or with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. A thumbs-up gesture allows the vanquished combatant to live and fight another day; a thumbs-down gesture ends the melee with a grotesque spray of blood.",
			"",
			"***Toward a Goal:*** Often these are elaborate affairs that may reproduce a historical battle, or just pit combatants against terrain and challenges that feature a variety of hazards and traps. These types of battles can be races (maybe mixing them with [the rules for vehicular combat](rule/vehicles_in_combat)), or may present capture-the-flag-like objectives, but all test the ability of the combatants to achieve a predetermined goal."

			"",
			"A crowd's attitude is similar to a non-player character's attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd's starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.",
			"",
			"During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd's attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.",

			"",
			"***Unfriendly:*** While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"***Indifferent:*** The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.",
			"",
			"***Friendly:*** The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"***Helpful:*** The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",

			"",
			"***Proficiency:*** Siege engines are exotic weapons. A creature with the {feat/Siege Engineer} feat is proficient with all siege engines, including siege firearms. A creature that is proficient in firearms is also proficient in siege firearms, but not other siege engines.",
			"",
			"***Crew:*** The sheer size of a siege engine often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the movement of a siege engine; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege engine to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege engine to function.",
			"",
			"The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A ram can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a Gargantuan creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a Colossal creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.",
			"",
			"***Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines:*** Siege engines can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege engine can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege engine applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege engines), and in the case of magical siege engines, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.",
			"",
			"***Defense and Hit Points:*** All siege engines are objects. A siege engine has a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege engine has its own hardness and hit points. Siege engines can be armored - treat the siege engine as a creature of its size to determine the cost of the armor. Masterwork siege engine armor can be enchanted for twice the normal cost to enchant armor. Armored siege engines have an armor bonus equal to that normally granted by the specific armor (shields have no effect on a siege engine), a hardness and hit points equal to that of the armor, and bonus hit points equal to the armor bonus &times; 5.",
			"",
			"***Moving Siege Engines:*** Siege engines have a speed. The speed of a siege engine is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege engines have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the engine must be dissembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege engines that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Attacks:*** Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines do not deal half damage when attacking objects.",
			"",
			"***Critical Hits:*** When a direct-fire siege engine or a close assault siege engine scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire ranged siege engine rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege engine multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier. Unlike normal attacks, siege engines attacks can deal critical hit damage to objects. Siege engines do not gain the benefit of critical feats the crew or the crew leader may have.",
			"",
			"***Mishaps and Misfires:*** Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll or a targeting check made by an indirect-fire ranged siege engine produces a mishap. Usually a mishap applies the broken condition. A non-firearm siege engine with the broken condition takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, targeting checks, and damage rolls. It also moves at half its normal speed.",
			"",
			"If the creature that serves as crew leader has the Siege Engineer feat, that creature does not generate a mishap on a natural 1 when firing the siege engine.",
			"",
			"Firearm siege weapons do not gain a mishap on a natural 1, but instead have a misfire value, like other firearms do. An attack roll or targeting check that falls within the misfire range causes the firearm siege engine to misfire. A misfire always misses, and applies the broken condition to the siege engine firearm. A firearm siege weapon with the broken condition takes all of the penalties and limitations that non-firearm siege engines do, and the misfire range of the firearm siege engine is increased by 4. If the firearm siege engine already has the broken condition when it misfires, it explodes. When a firearm siege engine explodes, it deals its damage to all creatures within a blast range (those within the blast can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage). The normal misfire range of a firearm siege engine and its blast range are given in the individual firearm siege engine description. Crew leaders with the {feat/Siege Engineer} feat do not lower the misfire value of firearm siege engines.",
			"",
			"***Constructing and Repairing Siege Engines:*** A siege engine is a complex device requiring a DC 20 Craft (siege engine) skill check to build or repair.",
			"",
			"***Disabling Siege Engines:*** A siege engine is considered a difficult device to disable, requiring 2d4 rounds of effort and a DC 20 Disable Device check to do so. When a siege engine is disabled, it either doesn't work or is sabotaged and stops working 1d4 minutes after use. Fixing a disabled siege engine requires a DC 20 Craft (siege engine), Disable Device, or Knowledge (engineering) check. It takes 10 minutes to fix the device, and the check can be retried if the fix fails.",
			"",
			"***Assembling Siege Engines:*** Siege engines are broken down for transport and can be reassembled on the battlefield, requiring the time and number of workers noted below. Each assembly worker must make a DC 10 Craft (siege engine) check; if untrained, they may not take 10. Assembly can be performed with at least half the required number of workers by doubling the time required. If fewer than half are available, the weapon cannot be assembled.",

If the engine has a special mode of attack or damage, this space is marked by the words \"see description.\" If the siege engine does not deal any damage, but rather is a tool for getting close to or over fortifications, this entry features a dash (&mdash;). Some ranged siege engines can be loaded with special ammunition that affects or overrides the weapon's typical damage or range.",

Beyond this range, the attack or targeting check takes a cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target.

			"",
			"***Type:*** Like weapons, siege engines that deal damage are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing.

In those cases, the type of energy damage is listed instead.",

			"Ranged siege engines assault structures and people from a distance, by propelling ammunition in some fashion. Siege engines hurl massive projectiles in one of two ways: direct fire or indirect fire. Both take a number of actions to load or aim, and the basic rules are described below.",
			"",
			"***Load Ammunition:*** In order for a ranged siege engine to fire, it needs to be loaded with ammunition. Loading ammunition takes a number of full-round actions depending on the siege engine (this time can be reduced to move actions if the crew leader has the {feat/Master Siege Engineer} feat).",
			"",
			"***Aiming a Siege Engine:*** Ranged siege engines must be aimed in order to attack a desired target (in the case of direct-fire siege engines) or square (in the case of indirect-fire siege engines). Aiming takes a number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the {feat/Master Siege Engineer} feat), with the number depending on the specific siege engine. Aiming a siege engine with a diminished crew doubles the amount of time it takes to aim the siege engine. Each time a new target or square is chosen as the target of a siege engine's attack, that engine must be aimed anew.",
			"",
			"***Direct-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:*** Direct-fire weapons launch their projectiles on a relatively flat trajectory, allowing them to more easily target creatures or pummel barriers directly in front of them.",
			"",
			"A direct-fire weapon uses a normal attack roll, with the normal penalty for nonproficient use. In addition, a direct-fire weapon takes a -2 attack roll penalty per size category that the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. Creatures that have ranks in Knowledge (engineering) are not adversely affected by their size when firing direct-fire ranged siege engines.",
			"",
			"Sheer manpower can also reduce the penalties for size. Increasing the crew of these weapons by 1 or more can reduce the attack roll penalty for creature size: as long as an extra crew member is no smaller than three size categories smaller than the direct-fire weapon, it can reduce the penalty due to the aiming creature's size by 2. For example, a Huge ballista fired by a Medium creature that is part of a crew of two (the creature aiming the ballista and someone to help position it) takes only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.",
			"",
			"***Indirect-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:*** Indirect-fire weapons launch projectiles in high arcs toward their targets. They typically lob heavier missiles and payloads than direct-fire weapons, but they are harder to aim accurately. Indirect weapons can bypass many forms of fortification, delivering their payloads of solid shot, scatter shot, or even disease-ridden offal to targets beyond the walls of castles. They can also be used to batter fortifications where they are most vulnerable, arcing down on towers and walls, crushing them with the weight of stone or raining down smaller projectiles on a wall's defenders.",
			"",
			"Indirect-fire weapons use a targeting mechanic similar to that described for catapults in the Core Rulebook, hereafter referred to as an indirect attack. The following is an update to those rules.",
			"",
			"***Indirect Attack:*** To fire an indirect-fire ranged siege engine, the crew leader makes a targeting check against the DC of the siege engine. This check uses his base attack bonus, his Intelligence modifier (if not trained in Knowledge [engineering]) or Knowledge (engineering) skill modifier (if trained in that skill), any penalty for not being proficient in the siege engine, and the appropriate modifiers from Table 3-12. If the check succeeds, the ammunition of the indirect attack hits the square the siege engine was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage or effect to any object or creature within the area of its attack. Creatures may get a saving throw to limit the effect of the attack; this is typically based on the type of ammunition used.",
			"",
			"If the attack misses the intended square, roll 1d8 to determine in what direction the shot veers. A roll of 1 indicates the ammunition falls short (toward the siege engine), with rolls of 2 through 8 counting squares clockwise around the target square. Roll 1d4 for every range increment at which the attack was made (1d4 if the target square is within the engine's first range increment, 2d4 if the target square is within the second range increment, and so on). The total is the number of squares by which the attack misses, with the direction in which the squares are counted determined by the d8 roll. The ammunition deals its damage and any other effects in the square it lands on.",

			"Anyone can be a spellcaster. If you can crack open a book and knuckle down in your studies, you can probably become a passable wizard. If you can devote yourself in body and soul to a god - and why wouldn't you, when there's such a variety to choose from? - you may find yourself endowed with magical powers simply for having faith in your god's (and your own) righteousness. Oracles are chosen without their consent, far-roving rangers pick up magical tricks and traps, druids channel the will of nature, sorcerers get their abilities as dubious presents from philandering ancestors, and bards find magical inspiration in performance and art. Magic is everywhere in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, and many of the movers and shakers in towns and cities of any significant size have a spell or two up their sleeves.",

			"But those are just ordinary people who have access to magic. Basic hedge wizards may make a fine living crafting glowing swords, and a priest with the ability to heal broken bones is a must for any church that wants to win itself a congregation, but such everyday spellcasters are hardly the stuff of legend. Instead, those magic users who get remembered as heroes and legends - rather than simply magical craftsmen and merchants - take these same techniques and build upon them, seeking out ever-more-elusive knowledge and crafting new spells of magnificent power. It is with these esoteric practices that the greatest make names for themselves; these potent arts set the masters apart from mundane practitioners."

In areas of minor spellblight, each time a spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be affected by a random minor spellblight. In areas of major spellblight, the caster must succeed at a DC 22 saving throw or contract a major spellblight.

Other spells may inflict a specific spellblight or may allow the caster to select any spellblight as part of the spell.

The failed spellcaster must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell's level) or gain a spellblight.

Creating an item with a caster level of 10 or lower gives a random minor spellblight, while creating an item of caster level 11 or higher gives a random major spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Spell Turning:*** When a spellcaster is warded with a {spell/spell turning}, and so is the creature he or she attacks, such occurrences usually create a resonance field as described in the spell's description. Instead, the spellcaster who cast the original effect can choose not to create the resonance field and both spellcasters are affected by a major spellblight. The spell that triggered the resonance field drains away without effect.",
			"",
			"***Teleportation Mishap:*** A spellcaster who casts a teleportation spell that results in a teleportation mishap has a chance of gaining a spellblight. The spellcaster who cast the teleportation spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell level of the teleport) or gain a major spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Use Magic Device:*** When a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 while attempting to use a magic device with the Use Magic Device skill, she can choose to risk gaining a minor spellblight instead of not being able to activate the item for 24 hours (Will negates DC 10 + item's caster level)."

			"",
			"***Caster Blank:*** A spellcaster with caster blank has a hard time focusing her spells or spell-like abilities on the same creature more than once. After targeting a creature with a spell, the caster cannot target that creature again with a spell until caster blank is removed or suppressed. To suppress caster blank, the afflicted spell caster must spend a standard action concentrating, which shakes off all effects of the caster blank until she casts a targeted spell again. Caster blank only affects spells that target creatures, and a spellcaster can still affect the creature with area spells.",
			"",
			"Caster blank can be cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Caster Croak:*** The afflicted spellcaster's throat or mouth is magically constricted. The spellcaster can barely make her words heard, and then only with great effort. A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4. Spell-like abilities are not affected by this spellblight because they lack verbal components. Shouting and screaming is impossible while the creature is affected by this spellblight.",
			"",
			"A {spell/heal} spell or similar effect cures this spellblight, as does casting the {spell/shout} spell, though doing so is still affected by the spellblight's effects.",
			"",
			"***Confounded Casting:*** A spellcaster with confounded casting has a mental disconnect between the spells she intends to cast and the spells she actually casts. The first time on her turn that she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she makes a concentration check with a DC of 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast. If the concentration check fails, the caster must pick another spell or spell-like ability of the same level or lower to cast with the same casting time. If the spellcaster has no other spell or spell-like ability, the action is lost. The spell or spell-like ability she originally picked is not spent and she can attempt to cast that spell again later.",
			"",
			"Confounded casting is cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Disassociation:*** A spellcaster with disassociation lapses into a mild insanity in which she dissociates her identity and starts to perceive herself as someone else. While subject to disassociation, a spellcaster is incapable of using spells or effects with a range of personal or of targeting herself with a spell effect. A spell with an area that includes her but does not need targeted individual creatures functions normally.",
			"",
			"Disassociation can by cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"***Ebon Eyes:*** A spellcaster with ebon eyes develops a jet-black film over her eyes, which inverts her capacity to perceive light and darkness. The creature treats darkness as bright light, dim light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and bright light as darkness. The ebon eyes protect against blinding, dazzling, patterns, or other visual effects, granting a +2 bonus on all saving throws against those effects.",
			"",
			"Ebon eyes can be removed with an effect that removes blindness.",
			"",
			"***Eldritch Ague:*** Eldritch ague manifests itself as a sickness that is debilitating to spellcasters. A spellcaster with this spellblight is sickened until the curse is removed. When the subject of the curse casts a spell, she is overcome with shaking for 1 round, requiring any spellcasting or the use of a spell-like ability during that time to succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the save, the spell and the action to cast it is lost.",
			"",
			"While a curse, eldritch ague acts much like a disease, and creatures with immunity to disease are also immune to eldritch ague. {spell/Remove disease} cures eldritch ague; unlike with most spellblights, using this spell to remove the spellblight does not impose a -5 caster level check penalty.",
			"",
			"***Hemoculysis:*** A spellcaster with hemoculysis bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell. While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided it's greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster's eyes bleeding is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a -4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.",
			"",
			"Hemoculysis can be cured by {spell/heal} or {spell/regenerate}.",
			"",
			"***Lassitude:*** Whenever a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the check, the spellcaster takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level (or 1 point of nonlethal damage when casting a 0-level spell or 1 point per 2 caster levels if using a spell-like ability). This nonlethal damage cannot be reduced in any way so long as the spellcaster suffers from lassitude.",
			"",
			"Lassitude can be cured by {spell/lesser restoration}, {spell/restoration}, or any effect that completely removes exhaustion. Simply resting has no effect. Creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"***Ritualistic Obsession:*** A spellcaster afflicted with ritualistic obsession adds unnecessary gestures to her spellcasting activities. Any spell without a somatic component (even a spell cast with the {feat/Still Spell} feat) now requires one, and any spell that already has a somatic component requires two free hands rather than one. Spell-like abilities now require a somatic component. The extra complexity increases swift action casting times to a standard action, standard action casting times to 1 round, and 1 round casting times to 2 rounds. Other casting times are not increased. The extra focus does serve to increase the efficacy of the caster's spells. All save DCs for spells and spell-like abilities that have their casting time increased with ritualistic obsession are increased by 1.",
			"",
			"Ritualistic obsession is cured by any effect that removes insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to ritualistic obsession.",
			"",
			"***Spell Addiction:*** A spell addict feeds off the elation of wielding magic, but suffers rapid withdrawal once spellcasting ends. After successfully casting a spell, the addict gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws until her next turn. On any round the spell addict does not cast a spell on her turn, however, she goes into withdrawal, and is sickened until her next turn.",

Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a -4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead.",

Reducing the penalty to 0 cures the spellblight.",
			"",
			"Blind creatures and creatures that don't use sight are immune to eldritch cataracts.",

			"***Nameless Dread:*** A caster with nameless dread believes strange beings from far dimensions or the blackness between the stars are hounding her and sapping her sanity. Every time the caster uses a spell or a spell-like ability, she sees a glimpse of her nameless pursuers. She must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level), or become shaken for 1 round per level of the spell. If already shaken, the spellcaster becomes frightened for the duration of the original effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. If she is already frightened, she becomes panicked (and cannot cast) for the duration of the current effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. Each time a spellcaster becomes panicked, there is a 5% chance she will become permanently insane (as the {spell/insanity} spell, or the GM may choose [a form of insanity](rule/sanity_and_madness).",

			"Spells that suppress fear work on nameless dread. Those that remove fear effects suppress the effects of nameless dread (and its benefits to spellcasting) for 1 hour.",

			"***Negated:*** A negated spellcaster has his ability to manipulate magical energies disrupted. He gains spell resistance equal to 10 plus twice the highest spell level he can cast. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. In addition, anytime he casts a spell, he must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against this spell resistance. On a successful check, the spell is completed and the spellcaster's spell resistance is removed until the start of his next turn. Failure indicates he failed to muster up enough magical energy to cast the spell, but the spell is not lost and may be attempted again. Any feats or abilities that aid in bypassing spell resistance help with this check.",

			"{spell/Restoration} suppresses the negated spellblight for one day.",
			"",
			"***Obsessive Fixation:*** A spellcaster with an obsessive fixation develops a tendency toward repetition. This manifests itself differently depending on whether the spellcaster prepares spells, is a spontaneous caster, or uses spell-like abilities. When preparing spells, an afflicted spellcaster must attempt to prepare as many duplicate spells as she can, meaning she prepares two copies of each spell she picks, but cannot exceed her normal number of spell slots to do so. This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect. If the spellcaster is a spontaneous caster or uses spell-like abilities, when that spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must cast that spell again on her next turn, or becomes dazed for 1 round at the end of her turn. Once she casts two copies of the same spell in a row or becomes dazed, the obsessive fixation resets, and she can cast any spell she knows, starting the cycle again.",
			"",
			"Obsessive fixation can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"***Phase Blight:*** A spellcaster afflicted with spellblight fades in and out of existence. Each time she casts a spell, she phases in and out of reality for 1 round per level of the spell cast. While phasing, any physical attacks made against the spellcaster have a 50% miss chance, any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail to affect the caster, and the spellcaster takes only half damage from area attacks. In addition, while actively phasing, all of a spellcaster's physical attacks have a 50% miss chance, all of the caster's spells that target creatures have a 50% chance of affecting the target, and all of the caster's area attacks do 50% of their normal damage. Unlike when casting the {spell/blink} spell, the spellcaster does not become ethereal; she blinks in and out of reality altogether.",
			"",
			"Effects that block planar travel, like {spell/dimensional anchor}, stabilize a phasing creature for the duration of the effect.",
			"",
			"***Spell Burn:*** Each time a spellcaster afflicted with this spellblight casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin feels like it burns, as if she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level cast), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she is staggered for a round. While the caster is staggered by this spellblight, any spell with the fire descriptor that she casts has its saving throw DC increased by 1.",
			"",
			"The burning sensation is a figment of the caster's imagination. Spellcasters that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight, and don't gain the beneficial effect when casting spells with the fire descriptor.",

			"***Spell Sap:*** A spellcaster with spell sap is subject to blackouts when casting spells. She may become mentally locked, distant, or catatonic, or may even slip into unconsciousness. Each time the afflicted spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14 + caster level) or become dazed until the end of her next turn. If she fails the save by 10 or more, she instead falls prone and lapses into unconsciousness for 1d4 rounds.",

			"",
			"Transference block can be cured by spending 1 hour in an {spell/antimagic field}.",

She must succeed at a concentration check (with a DC equal to the 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast). If the spellcaster fails the check, she falls prone, and for 1d4 rounds takes a penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim checks equal to 1 + the level of the spell. While the afflicted spellcaster takes those penalties, she must also succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check in order to stand up from prone.",

Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier).

For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders' true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated.

At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice.

			"This section provides guidelines for those seeking to calculate the costs of crafting their own constructs. As a rough guideline, a construct's price is equal to its challenge rating squared, then multiplied by 500 gp. Constructs with a fractional CR rating base their price on that fraction of 500 gp. For example, a CR 1/2 construct has a price of 250 gp. The cost of magical supplies for the {feat/Craft Construct} feat is half this price, with the construct taking 1 day to create per 1,000 gp of the construct's base price. Some constructs, particularly golems, have additional raw material costs that must be paid in full, regardless of whether the creator possesses the {feat/Craft Construct} feat. Raw materials typically cost somewhere between 5% and 10% of the construct's base price.",
			"",
			"Constructs with multiple special abilities cost more to create. The first special ability is included in the construct's base cost. The next two special abilities increase the calculated price by +1/2 CR per ability. Thereafter, any additional special abilities add +1 CR per ability. Examples of special abilities include having a higher DR value than a typical construct of its CR (above DR 5 for CRs 1-8, above DR 10 for CR 9+), monster statistics that exceed those recommended for the [construct's CR](rule/step_2_target_statistics), the standard golem immunity to magic, DR or hardness that can't be overcome by all adamantine weapons, ability to be fully healed by a single spell, and most special attacks and special qualities.",
			"",
			"Particularly powerful special abilities, such as an iron golem's exceptionally high attack bonus, count as two lesser abilities. Animated objects are a special case - their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points (see the [Animated Object monster entry](monster/animated_object)), since these abilities are already factored into an animated object's CR. In addition, golems and homunculi created with extra Hit Dice, the advanced template, or shield guardian abilities should all be priced as described in the Bestiary, rather than by adjusting pricing for their new CR.",
			"",
			"Abilities that weaken or potentially place a construct at a disadvantage rarely reduce the construct's price. An exception is the berserk ability. Constructs that have a chance of going berserk receive -1 CR adjustment to their calculated price if control can be reestablished (like a flesh golem) or -2 CR adjustment for permanent loss of control (like a clay golem).",
			"",
			"The following is an example of the calculated costs for creating a stone golem (CR 11). A stone golem's special abilities are golem immunity to magic, full healing from {spell/transmute mud to rock}, a high to-hit bonus (+22 vs. the +19 typical for CR 11), and the ability to slow its foes. Further, since its spell vulnerabilities are not tied to common spells or effects, its immunity to magic cost is doubled, giving the stone golem a total of 5 special abilities. The first special ability doesn't affect the cost, the next two increase the cost by +1/2 CR each, and the final two each increase the cost by +1 CR individually, making its effective CR for pricing equal to 14. This produces a calculated price of 98,000 gp, rounded up to an even 100,000 gp.",

When you design a spell, you have to take those power levels into account by comparing the new spell to existing spells in the Core Rulebook - a spell has to fall into the narrow range of power for one of the nine spell levels (plus cantrips or orisons). In contrast, prices for magic items are strongly granular, and are calculated to the gold piece based on precisely what features the item possesses. In other words, if you add more power to a magic item, you just increase its price to compensate, but if you add too much power to a spell, you have to make it a higher-level spell, which means you then have to compare it to a different set of example spells.",

This is because, like the details of creating magic items, the nitty-gritty of what the caster is doing for this research isn't important for the progress of the campaign. Just as it's not necessary to know whether a wizard is using squid ink or ink from a rare plant when crafting a [scroll of burning hands](spell/burning_hands), it's not necessary to know whether he's modifying gestures described in Irulark's Incunabulum or altering the pronunciation of words detailed in Murlost's Great Grimoire to create a new 1st-level attack spell. While it's fine to include these elements for flavor, particularly in a high-narrative campaign, they don't affect the outcome of the item crafting or spell research, both of which largely take place outside of game time. Therefore, this section is about the game mechanics of a player or GM designing a new spell, not the in-world requirements of a character researching a new spell.",

			"Compare your spell to similar spells, and to other spells of its intended level.",
			"",
			"Unlike when pricing magic items, there are no formulae for how to correctly \"price\" a spell. The entire process is a matter of comparing the new spell you're creating to other spells and evaluating whether your spell is weaker, stronger, or about the same as that spell or group of spells. Designing a spell requires a firm understanding of all the game's rules, not just those related to spells. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of some unwritten game assumptions, most of which are discussed throughout this section.",
			"",
			"**Example:** If you look at the spell list in the Core Rulebook, you'll notice that there isn't a 1st-level wizard spell that deals sonic damage. You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after {spell/burning hands}, except dealing sonic damage instead of fire - perhaps you'd call it sonic screech. However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: \"sonic\" as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before \"sonic\" was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, sonic screech will almost always be a better spell than {spell/burning hands}. That means if you introduce sonic screech into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of burning hands. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices - and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this.",

			"### Core is King",

			"When designing a new spell, you should always compare it to the spells in the Core Rulebook to get a sense of whether the spell is strong or weak for its level. You can compare it to spells in other books as well, but you should use the Core Rulebook as a baseline. This is because if a spell in another sourcebook pushes the boundaries of what's acceptable or balanced, even just by a little bit, it's easy to push the boundaries a little more with your new spell, which means that over time, new spells end up more and more powerful compared to those in the Core Rulebook. The Core Rulebook spells are the most playtested, optimal versions of spells in the game - new spells shouldn't be significantly better than them (see also the {rule/Benchmarks} section).",
			"",
			"Remember that it's acceptable to make a spell that isn't as powerful as an existing spell. Just because it's not the best spell of its level doesn't mean it won't get used by adventurers. In fact, that's why easily crafted scrolls are a significant part of the game - to allow parties access to spells they wouldn't normally prepare or learn, but may find useful in some circumstances."

			"One of the easiest ways to measure an offensive spell's power is to look at how much damage it does. Offensive spells are the easiest spells to design in the game, and there are dozens of examples of them in the Core Rulebook. A typical damage spell deals 1 die of damage (typically a d6) per caster level for an arcane spell (for example, {spell/shocking grasp} or {spell/fireball}), or 1 die of damage (typically a d6, but sometimes a d8) per two caster levels for a divine spell (for example, {spell/searing light}).",
			"",
			"### Damage Caps",
			"",
			"Low-level damage spells are not as good as medium- or high-level damage spells - the game is designed so lower-level spells eventually reach a maximum amount of damage they can deal. This is because if low-level spells continued to increase in damage without hitting a maximum amount, they'd rival some higher-level spells for effectiveness, and the game isn't as interesting if casters are using the same spells at 20th level as they were at 1st.",
			"",
			"The maximum damage depends on the level of the spell and whether the spell is arcane or divine. This is because arcane magic is deliberately designed to be better at dealing damage to balance the fact that divine magic is better at healing. A \"single target\" spell only damages one creature (like {spell/shocking grasp}), or divides its damage among several creatures (like {spell/burning hands} or {spell/magic missile}). A \"multiple target\" spell applies its full damage to several creatures (like {spell/fireball}).",
			"",
			"For example, a 1st-level single-target wizard spell like {spell/shocking grasp} can deal a maximum of 5 dice of damage (specifically 5d6). {spell/Magic missile} can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. {spell/Burning hands} initially looks like it doesn't obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.",
			"",
			"When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, {spell/searing light} is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the reduced damage against constructs).",
			"",
			"**Tip:** If your spell does *more* damage than the amount defined on the table, you should reduce the damage or increase the spell's level. If your spell does *less* damage than the amount defined on the table, you should increase the damage or add another effect to the spell. An example of this is {spell/sound burst}, which only deals 1d8 points of damage (this amount never increases), but can stun creatures in the area.",

However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell \"caster-only\" should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they've always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.",

Making those spells caster-only doesn't really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.",

Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like {spell/fireball}), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like {spell/slow}). A burst effect like {spell/fireball} can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your-targets spell like {spell/slow}, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use {spell/slow}. Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many)."

Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster - even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.",

Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat - longer than many tables used for gaming.

Avoid the temptation to invent spells with a casting time of 1 move action, 1 swift action, or 1 immediate action, as that's just a cheesy way for spellcasters to be able to cast two spells in 1 round, and there's already a mechanism for that: the {feat/Quicken Spell} feat. Making combat spells with faster casting times devalues the {feat/Quicken Spell} feat; even if you design the spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4 level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that feat, and your spell would become a common combo for high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level. For example, if you create a 5th-level quickened {spell/magic missile} spell that acts just like a {spell/magic missile} spell with the {feat/Quicken Spell} feat, any 14th-level wizard (who has at least three 5th-level spells available) is going to be tempted to learn this spell just because it allows him to add 5d4+5 extra points of damage to any high-level combat spell he casts, which is a way to get around the spell-damage cap. Furthermore, allowing spellcasters to routinely cast two spells per round means they tend to use up their spells more quickly and push their allies to camp and rest rather than continue exploring.",
			"",
			"Spells that summon creatures to help in combat should have a casting time of 1 round. This is to give a reasonable action cost for a character casting the spell. If the caster could summon a monster using a standard action and have it act that same round, it's like the spell didn't cost him any actions at all.",
			"",
			"Spells that call an outsider to serve for more than a few rounds (such as {spell/planar ally} and {spell/planar binding}) should have a casting time of 10 minutes; more powerful spells may have even longer casting times. Note that {spell/gate} can be used to call creatures and only has a casting time of 1 standard action, but when used this way, it requires a 10,000 gp material component, so that faster casting time doesn't come cheaply."

			"For the most part, a spell's components have very little to do with its overall power level unless it requires a costly focus or material component or has no component at all. Most spells in the Core Rulebook have verbal and somatic components, and new spells should follow this trend.",
			"",
			"The advantage of spells that don't require verbal components is they can be cast in an area of {spell/silence}, and thus there is the temptation to create silent versions of common combat spells. However, doing so devalues the {feat/Silent Spell} feat, just like making swift-action spells devalues {feat/Quicken Spell}, though not to such a great extent (casting two spells per round is a more serious problem than having a backup spell to counteract an unexpected {spell/silence}). If casters decide they'd rather prepare a silent {spell/magic missile} instead of {spell/acid arrow}, or a silent {spell/acid arrow} instead of {spell/fireball}, they've deliberately chosen weaker options, and that's fine.",
			"",
			"The advantage of spells that don't require somatic components is they can be cast when bound, grappled, or when both hands are full or occupied, and arcane spell failure doesn't apply. Just as creating silent versions of spells devalues {feat/Silent Spell}, making non-somatic spells devalues the {feat/Still Spell} feat. The premise of the game is that most spells require words and gestures, and new spells should stick with that unless the theme of the spell suggests it wouldn't require a somatic component, or it was specifically designed to escape bindings or grapples.",
			"",
			"The advantage of spells that don't require material components is they don't require a spell component pouch (and in the rare circumstance in which if you're grappled, you needn't already have your material components in hand to cast the spell). Most material components are part of a spell for flavor rather than to satisfy rules. The guano and sulfur material components of {spell/fireball} are there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material components of {spell/lightning bolt} come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the \"it has whatever I need\" spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat) - they're just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.",
			"",
			"Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as {spell/stoneskin}), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as {spell/augury}, {spell/divination}, and {spell/commune}), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as {spell/raise dead} and {spell/restoration}). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like {spell/augury}, as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it's free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as {spell/glyph of warding} also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving {spell/glyph of warding} a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring - otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).",
			"",
			"Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components - in most cases they're just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it's a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once they've crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it's essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component."

Deciding on the spell's school is really about choosing what best fits the theme and effect of the spell. Spells that deal energy damage to an area are usually conjuration or evocation spells. Spells that call, summon, or create physical objects or creatures are usually conjuration spells, while those that create things made of energy or force are usually evocation spells. Spells that affect minds are usually enchantment spells, unless they cause fear or affect undead, in which case they're necromancy spells.",

			"",
			"***Cold:*** Cold effects deal damage by making the target colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled matter or energy. Cold effects also include those that create ice, sleet, or snow out of nothing. They can cause frostbite, numbness, coordination problems, slowed movement and reactions, stupor, and death.",
			"",
			"***Curse:*** Curses are often permanent effects, and usually cannot be dispelled, but can be removed with a {spell/break enchantment}, {spell/limited wish}, {spell/miracle}, {spell/remove curse}, or {spell/wish}.",
			"",
			"***Darkness:*** Spells that create darkness or reduce the amount of light should have the darkness descriptor. Giving a spell the darkness descriptor indicates whether a spell like daylight is high enough level to counter or dispel it.",
			"",
			"***Death:*** Spells with the death descriptor directly attack a creature's life force to cause immediate death, or to draw on the power of a dead or dying creature. The {spell/death ward} spell protects against death effects, and some creature types are immune to death effects.",
			"",
			"***Disease:*** Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of disease spells.",
			"",
			"***Earth:*** Spells that manipulate earth or conjure creatures from earth-dominant planes or with the earth subtype should have the earth descriptor.",
			"",
			"***Electricity:*** Electricity effects involve the presence and flow of electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.",
			"",
			"***Emotion:*** Spells with this descriptor create emotions or manipulate the target's existing emotions. Most emotion spells are enchantments, except for fear spells, which are usually necromancy.",

Fire effects can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"***Force:*** Spells with the force descriptor create or manipulate magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal creatures normally (as if they were corporeal creatures).",
			"",
			"***Good:*** Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness or conjure creatures from good-aligned planes or with the good subtype should have the good descriptor.",
			"",
			"***Language-Dependent:*** A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or hear what the caster of a language-dependent spell says, the spell has no effect, even if the target fails its saving throw.",

			"***Mind-Affecting:*** Mindless creatures (those with an Intelligence score of ---) and undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"***Pain:*** Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to pain effects.",
			"",
			"***Poison:*** Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).",

			"",
			"***Sonic:*** Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.",

If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see {spell/binding} for an example).",

This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as {spell/astral projection}, {spell/gentle repose}, and {spell/undeath to death}). People who read your spell description may not know your intent, and using flavorful language can trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.",

			"Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a particular character or class in mind, most spells are going to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form - you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.",

			"When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets affected, and so on) are equal.",
			"",
			"***Control:*** A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are {spell/charm monster}, {spell/charm person}, {spell/confusion}, {spell/dominate monster}, and {spell/dominate person}.",
			"",
			"***Kill:*** A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target's depletable statistics, typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with {spell/dispel magic}). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are {spell/disintegrate}, {spell/finger of death}, {spell/phantasmal killer}, {spell/power word kill}, {spell/slay living}, and {spell/wail of the banshee}.",
			"",
			"***Incapacitate:*** An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target's condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are {spell/fear}, {spell/flesh to stone}, {spell/hold monster}, {spell/hold person}, {spell/power word stun}, and {spell/sleep}.",
			"",
			"***Damage:*** A damage spell reduces the target's depletable statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster's fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they'll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it's possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are {spell/cone of cold}, {spell/fireball}, {spell/lightning bolt}, {spell/magic missile}, {spell/poison}, and {spell/sound burst}.",
			"",
			"***Penalize:*** A penalize spell gives the target some penalty not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can't kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don't stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are {spell/bane}, [blindness/deafness](spell/blindness_deafness), {spell/ray of enfeeblement}, and {spell/slow}.",
			"",
			"There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster's allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster's allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than {spell/speak with dead}).",
			"",
			"Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results - a {spell/confusion} spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it's a control spell. Likewise, a [summon monster](spell/summon_monster_1) spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it's just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage."

Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics - a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target's depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target.",

Similarly, a fighter with a -10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a -10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties.",

			"\"Depletable statistic\" isn't an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells - attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties."

If your spell is better than the benchmark spell, you should reduce its power or increase its spell level. The following is a list of benchmark spells by sorcerer/wizard spell level, with explanations of why they are benchmarks. If you create a spell and it's better than a comparable benchmark spell, your spell is too powerful.",
			"",
			"### 1st Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Burning Hands}: This is the benchmark for 1st-level area attack spells. It is even better than sleep because it can affect up to six squares (sleep only affects 4 Hit Dice, which means up to 4 creatures) and affects mindless creatures and undead.",
			"",
			"{spell/Magic Missile}: Perhaps the best 1st-level spell in the game, {spell/magic missile} may not do a lot of damage, but it requires no attack roll, has a medium range, needs no saving throw, and harms incorporeal creatures. Even if {spell/magic missile} were 2nd-level, smart casters would still learn it.",
			"",
			"### 2nd Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Invisibility}: This is one of the best spells in the game, and is only improved on by {spell/greater invisibility} getting rid of the breaks-on-attack aspect. This spell is great for scouting, great in combat to set up attacks, and great for healers (as healing doesn't end the spell).",
			"",
			"{spell/Resist Energy}: This defensive spell works exactly like monster energy resistances, so it's a perfect example of the power level of this sort of spell. It also scales at higher caster levels, keeping it a viable spell even later in the game.",
			"",
			"{spell/Web}: This is a powerful, nonlethal spell that remains viable even at higher levels (even a lich who makes his save against a web has to deal with the difficult terrain and risks becoming stuck if he moves). It even provides cover, and can be set on fire to damage targets in the area.",
			"",
			"### 3rd Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Dispel Magic}: This spell sets the standard for negating other magic without a specific counter.",
			"",
			"{spell/Displacement}: This short-duration combat spell makes attackers miss 50% of the time, setting the standard for one-target defensive spells.",
			"",
			"{spell/Fireball}: This is the definitive low-level area attack spell. Gaining this spell changes the paradigm of the game, allowing spellcasters to deal a large amount of damage to multiple targets anywhere they can see.",
			"",
			"{spell/Fly}: This is the most important movement spell, usable in combat to great effect and allowing easy maneuverability around the battlefield.",
			"",
			"{spell/Lightning Bolt}: This spell establishes that a line of this range is about the same power level as a 20-foot burst.",
			"",
			"{spell/Stinking Cloud}: Capable of neutralizing many foes at a good range, stinking cloud is the best multiple-target nonlethal spell of its level.",
			"",
			"{spell/Suggestion}: This is the lowest-level spell in which the caster is able to compel the target to act, yet the spell's control is still limited to \"reasonable actions.\"",

			"",
			"{spell/Phantasmal Killer}: This is the lowest-level spell that can directly kill a creature, but allows two saves to resist it.",
			"",
			"### 5th Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Cloudkill}: This spell is key because it automatically kills weak creatures, deals poison damage each round to stronger creatures in the area, persists for several rounds, and moves.",
			"",
			"{spell/Cone of Cold}: This spell is an interesting benchmark because it's actually a weak spell for its level; at the level you gain it, {spell/fireball} does just as much damage and at a longer range, and [cone of cold's](spell/cone_of_cold) damage cap is only 5 dice higher than fireball. If your 5th-level attack spell is weaker than this spell, you should increase its power or consider making it a 4th-level spell.",
			"",
			"{spell/Dominate Person}: This is the lowest-level spell that allows you to utterly control a hostile intelligent creature (with the exception of self-destructive orders).",
			"",
			"{spell/Wall of Stone}: This is the lowest-level spell that creates a large-scale, permanent (instantaneous) object out of nothing (compare as well to {spell/fabricate}, which permanently reshapes raw materials into finished goods).",
			"",
			"### 6th Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Contingency}: This spell lets the caster set up conditions to trigger another spell effect, whether something direct such as a protective spell or something paranoid like an escape-teleport. In many ways it models what an immediate-action {feat/Quicken Spell} feat would be like. Because it lasts 1 day per level, the caster can prepare the contingency on one day and adventure the next day with a full allotment of spells.",
			"",
			"{spell/Guards and Wards}: Although not often used by PCs because they usually don't have permanent residences, this spell is important because it establishes that a large-area defensive spell can use multiple effects to protect a home and befuddle invaders.",
			"",
			"### 7th Level",
			"",
			"{spell/Limited Wish}: This powerful spell lets the caster pick effects from countless available lower-levels spells at the time of casting, even those from different class lists.",

			"",
			"{spell/Irresistible Dance}: While this spell can't kill its target outright, it does prevent the target from taking actions and give the target huge penalties, and (in a way) it does so without allowing a saving throw (while the spell does technically allow a save, even a successful save applies these effects for 1 round).",
			"",
			"{spell/Mind Blank}: This spell is an example of a very narrowly focused defensive spell that is able to block even higher-level spells from affecting the target.",

			"",
			"{spell/Gate}: This powerful spell combines all of the planar ally/planar binding effects and can be used to transport many creatures between planes.",
			"",
			"{spell/Miracle}/{spell/Wish}: The pinnacle of spellcasting, these spells can duplicate almost any weaker spell, obliterate most harmful effects, revive the dead, or even turn back time. If your spell is better than {spell/wish}, you're trying to play god.",

The same energies that can be shaped to create explosive fireballs, raise the dead, divine the future, heal the sick, and summon demons can do that and more without the direction of skilled spellcasters. Normally, this unfocused magical potential does not exist in reality; it lies beyond reality, where it waits to be tapped. Where exactly magic comes from remains a lively debate today, but when magic is unleashed without any attempt to focus it - when it leaks into the world in its raw form - the result is known as primal magic.",
			"",
			"In some realms, particularly in planes like the Maelstrom or the Abyss in the Great Beyond, magic is left to indulge in its raw chaos as it wishes - here, primal magic is often called \"wild magic.\" On the Material Plane, the world feels the touch of primal magic when the laws of reality themselves have been damaged. Here, magic flows in unpredictable tides and currents. At one moment, a region might function normally while at another, magic won't function at all. Usually, though, primal magic holds sway.",
			"",
			"Manifestations of primal magic tend to build up potential before they explode into existence. Just as a thunderstorm doesn't constantly lance the ground below with a constant beam of lightning, these bolts manifest periodically and almost randomly. And just as lightning can be called with lightning rods, primal magic can be purposefully or accidentally drawn out by utilizing magic in areas where such energies are building.",
			"",
			"When primal magic manifests, roll on the sample Primal Magic Events table to determine what occurs. As the primal magic exerts its power, consider crossing off the effect that occurs and designing replacement events and effects. If you want primal magic to play a big role in your campaign, you should try to ensure that no two effects are ever quite the same. One easy way to achieve this is to simply substitute random spell effects with unusual descriptions in place of normal ones, such as a black fireball that smells of roses and deals acid damage.",
			"",
			"Spontaneous primal magic effects can occur as often or as infrequently as you wish, but as a general rule, try to limit the effects to one per combat encounter at most. The majority of primal magic effects should instead occur when creatures activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, or cast spells in such an area (simply carrying a magic item or gaining the benefits of a constant-use item or spell effect isn't enough - it's the actual act of activation or casting that triggers primal magic). When a creature activates a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability in an area infused with primal magic, there's a 50% chance that the spell effect is replaced by a primal magic effect. A spellcaster casting a spell, using a spell-like ability, or activating a spell completion or spell trigger magic item can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect. Creatures activating other kinds of magic items do not have the option of making a spellcraft check to avoid triggering a primal magic effect.",

When the effect occurs, you need to determine the CR of the event. If the event is triggered by a spellcaster or a magic item, the event's CR is equal to the spellcaster's or item's caster level. When an event occurs naturally, you can roll 1d20 to determine the CR. Of course, you should strongly consider lowering primal magic event CRs to match or at least closely approximate the average party level of your PCs. Not all primal magic events are harmful, but it's neither fun nor fair for players to frequently be hit with an effect that's too far beyond their ability to deal with.",

In most of these instances, the primal magic subsides as reality repairs itself, though it might take a matter of weeks, years, or even centuries. In the cases of extreme abuse, an area's magical cohesiveness might never recover, resulting in areas of permanent primal magic. In general, the location of existing areas of primal magic and the creation of new areas is left up to the GM, but should always be the result of magic of extraordinary force or of an arcane catastrophe of epic proportions. Such should be encountered only rarely, allowing such sites to retain their sense of danger and calamitous history.",

These centipedes ignore non-spellcasters and attack only creatures capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities. This encounter should be a mix of centipedes that equals the CR of the primal magic event. The corpses of any slain centipedes pivot until their heads point in the direction of the Pit of Gormuz. |",

The music instills in those who hear it a strong urge to sing or dance along. A creature who does so gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws for the duration of the music. |",

The binding of any book in its possession is reversed, though the text within remains normal and legible. This effect is unusual but has no actual game effect. Reversing this effect is possible via break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, polymorph any object, or wish. |",

Every creature in this area must make a Will save (DC 10 + CR) or be dazed by the shifting colors for 1 round. The colors persist for 1 round per CR.

The event makes a trip combat maneuver check against all available targets, using a CMB of 10 + CR. Any creature tripped by the event has its equipment reorganized and tangled by the mischievous telekinesis.

Those who fail are teleported, as if via dimension door, so that they randomly shift places. If this places a creature in an area too small to accept its space, it instead appears in the closest adjacent space that can contain it. If only one creature is affected, it teleports a number of feet equal to CR &times; 5 in a random direction. |",

			"Barring the use of magic, swimming is the main way to travel in an aquatic adventure. However, the Swim skill was written from the perspective of a primarily land-based campaign.",
			"",
			"### The Basics",
			"",
			"The basics of the [Swim skill](skill/swim) are the same in an aquatic campaign. When a creature uses a move or full-round action to swim, it attempts a Swim check against the appropriate DC based on how calm the water is and other local factors. On a success, it can move up to one quarter of its land speed with a single move, or half its land speed with a double move. On a failure, it doesn't make any progress, and on a failure by 5 or more it goes underwater. This last part, however, doesn't make any sense if the PC is already underwater. Instead, if a PC fails her check by 5 or more while underwater (or doesn't spend any actions to swim, thus not even attempting the check), she sinks or rises based on her {rule/buoyancy}.",
			"",
			"While swimming, a PC can't normally use the run or charge actions or take a 5-foot step. Every hour of swimming requires a successful DC 20 Swim check to avoid fatigue. Even on a success, an hour of swimming is still at least as strenuous as marching for an hour, and extensive swimming eventually requires a PC to attempt checks as per [forced marches](rule/overland_movement). Similarly, continually taking a double move to swim at half land speed counts as hustling. A creature can also walk on the ocean floor, lake bed, or other solid ground underwater as long as its buoyancy is swiftly sinking. When it does so, it moves at half its land speed without needing to attempt a Swim check.",
			"",
			"***Swim Speed:*** Creatures with a swim speed have a variety of advantages underwater. First of all, they can swim through normal water at their full swim speed without needing to attempt a Swim check. They can use the run and charge actions and take 5-foot steps with their swim speed. When they do need to attempt Swim checks to deal with a hazardous situation or perform a special action, they benefit from a sizable +8 racial bonus on their Swim checks. There might be an unusual circumstance where a creature has a swim speed that's actually slower than one-quarter of its land speed (for instance, a monk using the spell {spell/monkey fish} to gain a swim speed of 10 feet). Such a creature can swim at one-quarter of its land speed instead, but it sacrifices the benefits of its swim speed on rounds when it isn't using its swim speed."

			"When a creature fails its Swim check by 5 or more, or when it doesn't spend any actions to swim (whether voluntarily or due to paralysis or similar conditions), it either sinks or rises based on its buoyancy. There are three normal states of buoyancy: sinking, rising, and neutral. If a creature's buoyancy is sinking, it naturally sinks; if its buoyancy is rising, it naturally rises to the surface; and if its buoyancy is neutral, it hangs in place unless it expends effort.",
			"",
			"Land-dwelling creatures generally have a sinking buoyancy unless they are carrying a substantial amount of low-density gear (like wooden items, at least until they become waterlogged) and little or no high-density gear (such as items made from metal or stone). [Air tanks](equipment-misc/air_tank) in particular make it much easier to change your buoyancy to rising. It's also possible to adjust an air tank to hold just enough air to achieve a neutral buoyancy - but once a creature has done so, if it picks up other objects or uses the tank to breathe underwater, it loses its neutral buoyancy until it readjusts (which may require returning to the surface to refill the air tank).",
			"",
			"In addition to these three normal states of buoyancy, there are two extreme states: swiftly sinking and swiftly rising. If a creature is swiftly sinking, it and its gear are so dense that it can walk on the bottom of the body of water, but it also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to swim towards the surface or to stay off the bottom. A creature carrying plenty of dense stone or metal items gains this buoyancy state. If a creature is swiftly rising, it needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to submerge itself and stay submerged; a sizable air tank or other flotation device, or the help of magic, is needed to achieve this state.",
			"",
			"***Aquatic and Water Creatures:*** Most naturally aquatic creatures (those with the aquatic subtype) have some form of air bladder or other organ that allows them to adjust their buoyancy on the fly, enabling them to maintain neutral buoyancy as a free action on their turn (unless they are carrying something large with particularly high or low density), and creatures with the water subtype naturally have the same buoyancy as water.",
			"",
			"***Buoyancy Speed:*** A creature begins to sink or rise at the end of its turn the first time it badly fails (or does not attempt) a Swim check, moving up or down as appropriate at a speed of 10 feet; this speed increases by 10 feet each subsequent round unless the creature is stopped, to a maximum speed of 30 feet after 3 rounds. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. While sinking or rising because of its buoyancy, creatures are considered [off-balance](rule/off_balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"Once per round, a creature sinking or rising because of its buoyancy can stop its momentum by succeeding at a Swim check as a move action. A creature that chooses to continue moving in the direction of its buoyancy under its own power, rather than through uncontrolled rising or sinking, can do so with a successful Swim check without needing to stop first.",
			"",
			"If a creature's buoyancy changes instantly while sinking or rising from buoyancy (such as via jettisoning something it's holding or using magic), its buoyancy speed adjusts by 10 feet in the new direction each round. A creature that fails the DC 20 Swim check to move against its buoyancy while swiftly sinking or swiftly rising moves 30 feet in the appropriate direction immediately.",
			"",
			"***Moving Against Buoyancy:*** Much like flying upwards uses up twice as much of a flying creature's movement, each square of movement swimming in the opposite direction of a creature's buoyancy costs twice as much movement as normal (see {rule/Thinking in Three Dimensions} for more details). Creatures with a neutral buoyancy ignore this hindrance.",
			"",
			"***Drag:*** Sometimes, because a PC might want to alter her buoyancy (or simply because she wants to drag a particularly large piece of treasure back home), she might swim with an item that has significant surface area, like a giant treasure chest. In these cases, her speed is reduced by half (or more, at the GM's discretion). If the object is narrower in one dimension, like a pole, she can avoid drag by turning it so the narrow side faces the direction she wants to move; however, this adjustment requires a move action, so it slows her down if she needs to turn often."

			"While flying creatures can add a third dimension to land-based combat, such creatures are an exception rather than the rule. The main challenge three-dimensional adventuring presents is representing a creature's vertical position during combat. This challenge is tougher than usual because most flying in adventures still involves encounters relatively close to the ground, rather than in the open sky, but plenty of encounters in an underwater adventure may occur in open water, nowhere near the surface or bottom. Typical solutions for flying creatures like using stackable tokens or transparent dice boxes to elevate the flying creature all depend on the main map being a consistent bottom altitude, but in an underwater fight, the combatants could just as easily move farther down.",
			"",
			"One way to avoid physically representing the third dimension is to use your imagination instead of a battlemap, but given that it's even harder to keep track of all three dimensions in your head, it becomes difficult to keep accurate relative distances that way. Another simple way to handle it is to mark a creature's depth relative to its starting depth, either on a small token you move along with the creature or directly on the battle map. This solution doesn't involve as much work as creating a complicated three-dimensional representation of the battle, but it isn't always easy to judge the relative vertical position without looking at the numbers and thinking about them. In the end, use the solution that works best for you whether that's judging distances in your head or crafting elaborate physical representations.",

			"***Flanking:*** All the usual rules for flanking still apply in three dimensions, but now there are far more ways for a target to potentially be flanked. It also means a larger number of weaker creatures can gang up on a stronger creature, since there are 26 valid spaces adjacent to a given square, rather than 8.",
			"",
			"***Flexible Movement:*** In a normal adventure, particularly before magical flight becomes easily accessible, it's easier to predict a character's exact path. For instance, on land, to get to a cave in the woods, the characters have to walk through the woods, and they are likely to use a forest trail that allows them to move quickly, rather than heading off into the deep foliage. Particularly in a dungeon, denizens can place traps with the expectation that characters will step in very particular places, and in all likelihood, a character will do so. However, underwater, all bets are off. If the PCs need to get to a cave in a kelp forest, they can just swim over the kelp forest until they are directly above the cave and then swim down, barely spending any time in the kelp forest at all.",
			"",
			"Even in an underwater dungeon, unless both the ceiling and walls narrow to 5 feet (which could be a giveaway that the characters are being channeled into a trap), the characters have significant more leeway in where they move, which means that dungeon denizens should set proximity traps covering a wider radius, rather than depending on a particular square. The third dimension also makes it harder to blockade or patrol a perimeter, since there are so many more ways to slip past; essentially, defenders are patrolling along the surface of a sphere instead of the perimeter of a circle."

			"One of the most immediately noticeable differences when fighting underwater is that slashing and bludgeoning attacks are made with a -2 penalty and deal half damage, making piercing weapons the best bet for an underwater adventure. If you're off-balance (see {rule/Off-Balance and Prone Underwater}), your attacks with piercing weapons also take a -2 penalty and deal half damage. {spell/Freedom of movement} can negate these penalties entirely and has [a variety of other effects](rule/freedom_of_movement). Additionally, {feat/Aquadynamic Focus} can specifically assist with this situation. Creatures with a natural swim speed from the aquatic or water subtype don't take these penalties with their inherent natural attacks. For instance, a kraken's bludgeoning tentacle attacks don't take penalties, but if it took the ectoplasmatist {class/spiritualist} archetype and gained two slashing ectoplasmic lash attacks, those would still take the penalties. Attacks that deal bludgeoning damage by pushing water, such as a {class/kineticist/'s} water blast, also take no penalty and deal full damage underwater.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Attacks:*** Traditional physical ranged weapon attacks underwater are much more challenging due to the increased drag from the water compared to air. Ranged attacks normally take a -2 penalty for every 5 feet of water, in addition to the normal penalty for range increments. The exceptions are the underwater light crossbow and underwater heavy crossbow, which ignore the penalty for ranged attacks underwater but have a significantly reduced range increment underwater. Thrown attacks don't usually work underwater at all, but if you can move directly above your opponent, you can throw a properly prepared piercing weapon (one made of stone, metal, or another particularly dense material) straight down, counting on its sinking buoyancy to propel it to its target.",
			"",
			"Hypothetically, you could do the reverse with a weapon of extremely low density, but achieving such a low density while still having a shape that allows for throwing and enough mass to damage would generally require an unusual material or magical assistance. At the end of a downward-thrown object's maximum range, it continues to sink, but its trajectory is far too unpredictable to hit anything with its dangerous end.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuvers:*** Most combat maneuvers work underwater, although you take a -2 penalty on {rule/grapple} combat maneuver checks if you don't have a Swim speed (a successful damage action taken as part of a maintained grapple deals full damage, even if your unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage). Even [tripping](rule/trip) is possible underwater with [special rules](rule/off_balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"***Cover from the Surface:*** Due to water's surface tension, creatures attempting to attack through water's surface count its surface as [total cover](rule/cover) (if a creature is partially submerged, it gains proportionally less cover); this applies even to spells that require attack rolls. The exception to this rule is attacks that deal piercing damage: these can penetrate the water's surface but take a -2 penalty to do so. This is a change from the [rule on cover](rule/underwater_combat) from the water's surface in the Core Rulebook, but it allows actions like spearfishing and firing harpoons from whaling ships."

			"***\"Off-balance\"*** is a special state (though not technically a condition) that is listed in the [Combat Adjustments Underwater table](rule/underwater_combat). A creature off-balance in the water loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it, and attacks it makes with piercing weapons are made at a -2 penalty and deal half damage. A creature typically becomes off-balance by failing a Swim check, which makes it off-balance for a round, even if it has a neutral buoyancy and doesn't sink or rise.",
			"",
			"***Tripping Underwater:*** While flying creatures specifically can't be tripped, the Core Rulebook doesn't specify whether the same is true of swimming creatures. Being prone doesn't mean much for a swimming creature, so instead, a successful trip against a swimming creature forces that creature to attempt a Swim check at a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check to trip; failing the Swim check causes the creature to become off-balance. Many aquatic creatures can't be tripped or have a high Swim bonus and thus can always take 10, so this tactic isn't always effective, but when it is, it can make dexterous foes much easier to hit. However, being off-balance doesn't affect most of the target's attack rolls, and the target can regain its balance simply by succeeding at a Swim check to move on its next turn as normal."

Thus, a creature benefitting from freedom of movement can swing weapons without penalties (though objects that leave its possession, like thrown weapons or ammo from ranged weapons, lose this benefit), lift objects without drag, and walk along the bottom at full speed. The creature automatically succeeds at all Swim checks as the water offers no significant resistance to its movement. If the creature has the ability to do so, it can fly or use spells like {spell/air walk} to freely move around as if it were in air. Creatures who need just the movement benefits from freedom of movement without the benefits against grapple, paralysis, and magic effects that hinder movement should consider the lower-level spell {spell/free swim}."

			"While various spells have different effects underwater, the most fundamental hindrance to spellcasting, at least at low levels, is the fact that a creature holding its breath must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast a spell at all, whether or not the spell has a verbal component. If the spell has a verbal component, expelling the air needed to incant the spell reduces the creature's remaining number of rounds of breath by 3 (which stacks with the reduction from performing a standard or full-round action; see the [Drowning section](rule/drowning_aa)), and a creature can't finish the spell if it doesn't have enough breath left. Spells that have verbal components and casting times of swift or immediate actions instead decrease the caster's remaining number of rounds of breath by 1.",
			"",
			"Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater as long as they're stored in watertight containers, and aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use underwater. The Core Rulebook describes the effect of [fire spells underwater](rule/underwater_combat); some other spells exist that function differently.",
			"",
			"***Acid Spells:*** Conjuration (creation) spells that conjure nonmagical acid, like {spell/acid arrow}, don't work properly underwater, as the water dilutes the acid harmlessly. Evocation spells that deal magical acid damage, like a {spell/fireball} affected by the {feat/Elemental Spell} metamagic feat, work normally underwater.",
			"",
			"***Cloud and Weather Spells:*** Cloud spells such as {spell/fog cloud} and {spell/obscuring mist} specifically say that they don't work underwater, though the {feat/Murky Spell} metamagic feat can create equivalent mist spells underwater. Other spells that create weather that would be appropriate only on land, like {spell/ice storm} and {spell/sleet storm}, do not function underwater at all. {spell/Twilight haze}, however, is an illusion and thus works underwater.",
			"",
			"***Cold Spells:*** Spells that deal cold damage but don't normally conjure ice, like {spell/cone of cold}, instead deal half cold damage and half piercing damage, as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater. This has no effect on spells that already create ice, rather than just cold damage.",
			"",
			"***Electricity Spells:*** While normal electricity, such as that from a natural thunderstorm, tends to disperse in all directions underwater, magical electricity spells hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, with one exception: visible and audible lightning bolts and sparks are the result of combusted air, and they don't happen underwater. Because of this, creatures that fail to identify an electricity spell that requires a ranged touch attack are flat-footed against the first such ranged touch attack during a fight, as they don't realize they need to dodge the invisible projectile (unless they otherwise have reason to expect it, like a spellcaster who can cast such spells). This doesn't apply to melee touch spells like {spell/shocking grasp}, since the creature can still see the spellcaster's hand moving towards it.",
			"",
			"***Fire Spells:*** While normal fire (including alchemist's fire) and most supernatural fire can't burn underwater at all, fire spells have a chance to transform into steam instead. Whenever you cast a fire spell underwater, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to channel the heat into the water and create steam, dealing the same amount of fire damage as normal but without secondary effects of fire, like igniting combustibles. A fire spell must be either entirely steam or entirely fire, which means that if it covers an area that would normally extend beyond the water's surface, you must choose whether to affect the region above the water or below, and the surface blocks line of effect for the rest of the spell. A spell or spell-like ability with the fire descriptor that already creates steam (like a {class/kineticist/'s} steam blast) doesn't require the caster level check to create steam; only spells that would normally create an actual fire require the check. The {feat/Steam Spell} metamagic feat makes it easier to cast fire spells underwater.",
			"",
			"***Invisibility:*** Underwater, an invisible creature still displaces water, making it possible to spot and target it as if it had only concealment, as per the description of {spell/invisibility}. The {spell/invisibility bubble} spells hide the displaced water and thus allow effective invisibility underwater.",
			"",
			"***Sonic Spells:*** While sound travels four times faster and farther in water than air, it also takes more energy to do so, so in the end sonic spells have the same results underwater as they do on land. At the GM's discretion, a spellcaster can choose to instead double the range or area, halve the damage, and decrease the DC by 2 for sonic attacks."

		"description": [
			"Drowning is one of the most obvious dangers of underwater adventuring. As creature can typically hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. Whenever a creature takes a standard or full-round action, it expends 1 additional round of breath, so practically speaking, if a creature wants to fight or double move each round, it can do so only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. Intentionally exhaling breath expends 1 to 3 rounds for each exhaling action - generally 1 round for a small exhalation, and 3 rounds for an extended exhalation like singing a song or casting a spell. Certain magic, like the {spell/suffocation} spell, can expel all of a creature's held breath.",
			"",
			"Once a creature has used up these rounds of safety, it lives on a knife's edge between life and death. Each round, the creature must succeed at a Constitution check, with a DC starting at 10 and increasing by 1 each round after the first. Once it fails this check, the creature begins to drown, falling unconscious (and dropping to 0 hit points if it currently had more), dropping to -1 hit points on the next round, and dying on the round after that. At any point, if the creature becomes able to breathe (perhaps because someone dragged it out of the water or cast a spell to assist it), it ceases drowning but doesn't regain any lost hit points. Note that if a creature holds its breath in a situation where it could normally breathe, it won't fall unconscious if it fails its Constitution check.",
			"",
			"Because of the prohibitive limitations of holding one's breath, underwater explorers from the surface use a variety of techniques to extend their ability to breathe underwater. The most common is {spell/water breathing}, which is extremely long-lasting and can protect an entire group with one casting. A simpler, short-term solution is {spell/air bubble}, which can protect a single creature for a few minutes - but not usually enough for an underwater adventure. The most powerful option is {spell/life bubble}; while its duration is half that of water breathing, it also protects against many other underwater hazards such as extreme temperature and pressure. Those who prefer a mundane alternative to ephemeral (and dispellable) magic tend to use [air tanks](equipment-misc/air_tank) to store additional air, but characters hoping to stay underwater find that carrying around more than a few extra breaths of air sets their buoyancy to swiftly rising, almost like wearing a giant life preserver, so this solution is effective only for a strong swimmer or someone with access to magic to alter buoyancy."

			"The ocean is divided into four zones: the sunlight zone (from the surface to 600 feet below), the twilight zone (from 600 feet down to 3,300 feet), the midnight zone (from 3,300 feet down to 13,000 feet - which often reaches the bottom), and the Abyssal zone (from 13,000 feet to the bottom in depths greater than 13,000 feet). Some oceanographers add a fifth zone, the Abaddonian zone, which describes areas 20,000 feet and below in the deepest ocean trenches.",
			"",
			"***Pressure:*** Most aquatic creatures have adapted to depths corresponding roughly to one or more of these zones in particular, and ignore pressure damage while within their native depth range unless they instantaneously transport from one depth to another, as with {spell/dimension door}. [Pressure damage rules are found here.](rule/water_dangers) Surface creatures, on the other hand, treat depths of 0 to 100 feet as their native zone. For every minute spent below their native zone, a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every additional 100 feet beyond the first. The DC is initially 15, and it increases by 1 for every minute after the first. After five successful Fortitude saves (consecutive or not), the creature adapts to the pressure. If a creature is within its native depth range but experiencing pressure dangers due to instantaneous travel, this adaptation to the new pressure happens all at once. If the creature is outside its native range, this adaptation adjusts its native range down or up by 100 feet, as appropriate. A surface dweller swimming downward may adapt to the new depth, but will then experience pressure hazards when it ascends back to the surface.",
			"",
			"For instance, if Valeros swims down 220 feet, he is 120 feet outside his native range of 0 to 100 feet, so he needs to attempt a Fortitude save every minute to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage. If he succeeds at five Fortitude saves, his native range shifts to 100-200 feet, and he must attempt Fortitude saves to avoid taking 1d6 points of damage each minute. After five more successful Fortitude saves, his native range is now 200-300 feet, and he takes no further damage from pressure, but if he ascends back to the surface, he must resume attempting Fortitude saves to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage from the reversing pressure. Because of the dangers of changing pressure, aquatic explorers find it safest to adjust their depth gradually unless they have special means of avoiding pressure hazards. Spells like {spell/freedom of movement} and {spell/life bubble} prevent pressure damage. {spell/Pressure adaptation} and {spell/stabilize pressure} are more focused and lower-level options.",
			"",
			"***Temperature:*** Immersion in water can cause hypothermia in land-dwelling creatures at temperatures that would normally be perfectly safe on land. Generally, creatures in water that is 80&deg; F or higher are safe from hypothermia. Water from 60&deg; to 80&deg; F is equivalent to cold weather (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage; [see here](rule/cold_dangers) for information on determining the DC). Water from 40&deg; to 60&deg; F functions like severe cold (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage). Water from 32&deg; to 40&deg; F acts as extreme cold (dealing an automatic 1d6 points of lethal cold damage each minute). Water below 32&deg; F (which is generally possible only in areas with high levels of salt) deals an automatic 2d6 points of lethal cold damage per minute.",
			"",
			"Sea creatures are adapted to the water temperature in their native zones. The {spell/endure elements} spell protects its target from water as cold as 32&deg; F (rather than -50&deg; F in air), which is generally enough to cover temperature extremes in the ocean. By contrast, water rarely becomes warm enough to provide heat dangers except in the presence of a hazard like a hydrothermal vent, as even the most extreme temperatures in the sunlight zone tend to cap at around 104&deg; F.",
			"",
			"***Sunlight Zone:*** The sunlight zone contains all aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis, so it's home to both phytoplankton and seaweed. It's also the home of most marine mammals, many sharks, some jellyfish, and most of the fish familiar to fisherfolk. The visibility estimates in the {skill/Perception} rules assume sufficient light levels (or a means of seeing in the dark), which are typically present only in the sunlight zone. The water temperature in the sunlight zone varies based on the surface conditions, anywhere from over 100&deg; F to below 30&deg; F.",
			"",
			"***Twilight Zone:*** In the twilight zone, only about 1% of the light from the surface remains: not enough for photosynthesis. This also isn't enough light for a creature with normal vision to see, but creatures with low-light vision can still see to a distance of around 60 feet as though in dim light. Many creatures living in this zone either have darkvision or rely on precise senses other than sight to guide them, while others are bioluminescent. Roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. The temperature in the twilight zone ranges from about 68&deg; F at the top to around 39&deg; F at the bottom, with very few variations at any given depth.",
			"",
			"***Midnight Zone:*** The midnight zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, requiring darkvision or nonvisual senses for any creature that doesn't have its own source of light. Fueled by the detritus that sinks from above, many types of {monster/squid/s} and [octopuses](monster/octopus) and some {monster/kraken/s} live in this zone, along with some large {monster/whale/s} and other creatures of the deep, but it's harder for fish to survive here. The temperature in the midnight zone is generally 39&deg; F throughout. The midnight zone usually extends to the bottom.",
			"",
			"***Abyssal Zone:*** In regions where the ocean floor is more than 13,000 feet below the surface, the Abyssal zone lurks beneath the midnight zone, a region that's dark and cold even compared to the midnight zone, and devoid of even the falling detritus scavenged by midnight zone denizens. Named for {rule/the Abyss}, this zone contains unnatural and horrific creatures mixed in with other fauna. [Giant squids](monster/giant_squid), {monster/kraken/s}, and other tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, despite the 35&deg; to 39&deg; F temperature. Other creatures congregate around the warmth of the zone's hydrothermal vents, gaining nourishment from the vents' expulsions.",
			"",
			"***Abaddonian Zone:*** Some scholars, particularly among deep-sea races, utter dark whispers of a fifth and final zone that exists only in the depths of the deepest ocean trenches, over 20,000 feet below the water's surface. Supposedly, pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface world, combined with low temperatures and ambient magic, create within these trenches a nightmarish tableau that hardly seems it could exist on the Material Plane. Amorphous creatures like jellyfish, sea cucumbers, and tube worms cling to life in this inhospitable environment, eking out a life amidst beings of unfathomable malevolence. While scholars have funded expeditions to gather information on the Abaddonian zone, there are few, if any, survivors to give their accounts of those expeditions, and certainly none who remained sane."

			"Currents in the ocean (or a similarly large body of water) work similarly to [rivers](rule/aquatic_terrain). Each current has a particular speed (measured in feet per round), width, and direction, and at the beginning of a creature's turn, the current pushes it that distance. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to creatures not in the same current. A creature can try to swim against the current's flow on its turn to stay in place, but it's usually a better idea to swim perpendicular to the current to reach the edge and exit the current. Fortunately, while rivers can reach speeds up to 90 feet per round, the fastest natural ocean currents are usually not much faster than 50 feet per round in the sunlight zone, and are slower the deeper one travels. This is because currents are mainly influenced by the weather near the surface and tiny discrepancies in temperature far below the surface, and the effects of the latter are not as strong. Currents always count as at least rough water ({skill/Swim} DC 15), and faster currents count as at least stormy water (Swim DC 20).",

Thus while the spell {spell/locate creature} functions underwater, it rarely extends to its full range, since even an extremely slow current blocks the spell.

Whirlpool movement doesn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity, because no one caught in the current is in a position to make one.",

			"What follow are the basic rules for using vehicles in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. They give an overview of the rules that all vehicles use.",
			"",
			"- ***Drivers:*** Drivers control vehicles. A driver is a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 who is physically able to manipulate a vehicle's driving device and who is both within the driving spaces of a vehicle and actively manipulating the driving device.",
			"- ***Occupants:*** Any creature riding, driving, serving as crew on, or providing propulsion for a vehicle is considered its occupant.",
			"- ***Facing:*** Unlike characters, vehicles have a forward facing. A vehicle moves best when it moves in the direction of its forward facing.",
			"- ***Acceleration/Deceleration:*** Vehicles must accelerate to reach their maximum speed. Each round, with the proper driving action and a successful check, the driver can increase the vehicle's movement by its rate of acceleration, as long that value is no greater than the vehicle's maximum speed. Vehicles must decelerate to slow down and are hard to stop at an exact point.",
			"- ***Initiative:*** A vehicle moves at the start of its driver's turn. If a vehicle has no driver, it moves on the turn of the last creature that was its driver, or on a turn determined by the GM.",
			"- ***Controlling a Vehicle:*** If a vehicle has a driver, before the driver does anything else on her turn, she must determine what drive action she is taking, and take that action. If the driver takes no action, takes some other action instead of driving the vehicle, or delays or readies an action - or if there is no driver - the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action. A driver can only take one action each turn to control a vehicle. Once the driver has selected the action, or takes some other action forcing the vehicle to become uncontrolled, the vehicle moves.",
			"- ***Driving Check:*** When a driver takes a driving action, she must make a driving check to determine the maneuverability and speed of the vehicle that round. The vehicle's propulsion determines what skill is used for the driving check. A driver can always make a Wisdom check in place of a driving check. The base DCs for all driving checks are DC 5 and DC 20. Use the lower DC when the driver is not in combat and the higher DC when the driver is in combat.",
			"- ***In Combat:*** Vehicles, creatures used as propulsion, and crew members do not threaten any area around them, but their drivers and their non-crew occupants do. Vehicles can enter the spaces of objects and creatures smaller than themselves. Vehicles do not have attacks, but they can - and may be required to - make vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, and ramming combat maneuvers."

A ***driver*** is a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more who is physically able to use the vehicle's driving mechanism. In other words, the creature needs to be the correct size and have the correct anatomy to use whatever tool is used to drive the vehicle. Sometimes a driving mechanism may have its own requirements for use. The driver uses that mechanism and her skill (or her Wisdom) to control the vehicle. Without a driver, a vehicle will not move or will continue moving in a straight line, depending on the vehicle's state when it becomes driverless.",

			"{SOURCE Ultimate Combat/171}",
			"",
			"Every vehicle has a method of propulsion. Creatures pull chariots and wagons. Boats and ships are propelled by water currents, wind, muscle, or all three forces. Fantastical airships are held aloft by a variety of propulsion sources, both magical and mundane. The method of propulsion typically affects the speed and maneuverability of a vehicle, but more importantly, a vehicle's propulsion determines the required skill needed to control a vehicle. The following are the general methods of vehicle propulsion, along with what skills are typically needed to drive such vehicles.",
			"",
			"***Alchemical:*** Rarely, an alchemical engine may propel a vehicle. Powered by steam or more volatile gases and reagents, a vehicle with an alchemical engine requires either a Knowledge (arcana) or Craft (alchemy) check to be driven. The base DC to drive an alchemical vehicle is 10 higher than normal. Alchemical engines can be extremely powerful, with the ability to propel vehicles hundreds of times their size. They can also be very fickle when driven by creatures uninitiated in the secrets of alchemy.",
			"",
			"When a driver makes a driving check to control an alchemically propelled vehicle with a Wisdom check or a skill she is not trained in and rolls a natural 1, the vehicle's alchemical engine gains the broken condition. When it gains the broken condition, the vehicle's maximum speed and acceleration are both halved, and if the vehicle is currently moving at a rate faster than its new maximum speed, it immediately slows to that speed.",
			"",
			"***Current:*** From canoes and large ships to winged gliders, vehicles propelled by currents typically manipulate an already existing power source within or outside of nature: an air current, a water current, or more exotic currents, like conduits of magical energy. Usually, manipulating a current-propelled vehicle requires a skill like Fly, Knowledge (nature), Profession (sailor), Survival, or even Acrobatics or Knowledge (arcana), depending on the nature or makeup of the vehicle and the current the vehicle is manipulating.",
			"",
			"***Water Current:*** Vehicles that only rely on currents of water for their propulsion are somewhat limited. These vehicles can only move in the direction and at the speed of a current unless they also employ some other means of propulsion or manipulation, and thus often have an additional form of propulsion, such as muscle in the case of a canoe, and wind in the case of a galley. A current-driven ship such as a river barge with a crew of two or more creatures requires either a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check for the driving check, as ships require precision, discipline, and knowledge of the natural world. Smaller water-current vehicles, like canoes, use the Survival skill as the drive skill, as reading the terrain is a very important aspect of maintaining control over those types of vehicles.",
			"",
			"If it moves with the current, a water-current vehicle's maximum speed depends on the speed of the current (often as high as 120 feet). The acceleration of a water-current vehicle is 30 feet.",
			"",
			"***Air Current:*** Air-current vehicles are rather diverse. They can be sailing ships, airships, land ships, or even gliders. A vehicle propelled by air with a crew of two or more creatures requires a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check as its driving check. Because of their complexity, air-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10. Smaller air-current vehicles, such as gliders and wind sleds, use Acrobatics or Fly instead. Much of their control depends on knowledge of flight or proper movements of the body to control the vehicle.",
			"",
			"Smaller vehicles (size Large or smaller) can move at a speed of 60 feet, can move at twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet. Larger vehicles can move at a speed of 90 feet, or twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"***Weird Current:*** Navigating currents of magical energy, burning magma, or the murky rivers of the Shadow Plane could use a number of skills, but likely use skills similar to those needed to operate water-current and air-current vehicles. Weird-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10, and sometimes by 15 in more exotic locales and conditions.",
			"",
			"Weird-current vehicles typically move at the speed of water or air currents, depending on their nature, but have been known to move twice or even triple those speeds.",
			"",
			"***Magic:*** Magic provides some of the most powerful and easy-to-use methods of propelling a vehicle, such as an elemental-powered juggernaut or an airship with an arcane device at its heart. Often simply identifying the properties of the magic item providing propulsion gives a creature the ability to use it, but sometimes more complicated magical devices require Spellcraft or Use Magic Device to drive properly.",
			"",
			"***Muscle:*** From a chariot to a slave ship filled with captive rowers, moving a vehicle powered by muscle is all about getting a creature or creatures to push, pull, or otherwise propel the vehicle. Based on the type and intelligence of the creatures moving the vehicle, checks for driving muscle-propelled vehicles can use a diverse number of skills, including, but not limited to, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Profession (driver).",
			"",
			"Muscle-propelled vehicles come in two forms: pulled and pushed.",
			"",
			">***Pulled:*** This type of propulsion involves one or more creature pulling a vehicle. Unless the creature pulling the vehicle is intelligent (Intelligence score of 3 or higher), either Handle Animal or Profession (driver) is used for the driving check (driver's choice). Intelligent creatures must be convinced with a Diplomacy check (decrease the driving check by 5 if the creature or creatures have the helpful attitude), or forced with an Intimidate check. Forcing an intelligent creature to pull a vehicle increases the DC by 20.",
			">",
			">A creature can pull a number of vehicle squares equal to the number of squares in the creature's space to a top speed equal to twice the creature's speed. It can accelerate its space in vehicle squares up to its speed. For instance, a single horse takes up 4 squares, and can pull a 4-square cart 100 feet each round with an acceleration of 50 feet.",
			">",
			">***Pushed:*** Pushed vehicles are the exact opposite of pulled vehicles - vehicles that are pushed by muscle, usually using some form of device manipulated by crew members. Aquatic vehicles are the most likely to be pushed. Lines of rowers use their oars to push the vehicle forward, or a pair of cloud giants may churn a propeller at the aft end of a dirigible. Driving checks for pushed vehicles tend to be Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal, depending on the intelligence and attitude of the creatures supplying the muscle for the propulsion.",
			">",
			">For intelligent creatures, use Diplomacy if the creatures providing the propulsion have an attitude of indifferent, friendly, or helpful. Decrease the Diplomacy driving check by 5 if the creatures providing the propulsion are friendly. Intimidate is used for intelligent creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile. Handle Animal is used if the creatures providing the propulsion are not intelligent.",
			">",
			">A creature that is pushing a vehicle with the proper mechanical help can push between 5 times to 20 times its space in vehicle squares.",
			"",
			"The maximum speed and acceleration of a muscle-propelled vehicle depends on the mechanism used to assist the pushing - see the sample vehicle statistics for examples.",
			"",
			"***Mixed Methods of Propulsion:*** Large and complicated vehicles, such as large sailing ships, often use multiple forms of propulsion. Sometimes multiple methods add flexibility, but often they work in concert to create faster movement. A vehicle with multiple methods of propulsion often requires a large crew to get it going and keep it moving. If a vehicle has two methods of propulsion, it uses its fastest speed and acceleration and then adds half the speed and acceleration of the secondfastest propulsion. Nothing is added for a third form of propulsion, except for the flexibility of having a back-up form of propulsion."

			"***Facing:*** Unlike creatures, most vehicles have a forward facing. The facing of the vehicle determines its best path of propulsion. Vehicles are very good at moving in the direction of their forward facing, but it takes time and skill to move them in other directions. A horse-pulled wagon moves forward quickly and with ease, but turning a corner requires proper timing and a crack of the whip. A ship propelled by an air current can take a great deal of effort to stop, especially once it has reached top speed. Vehicle facing represents the effect of inertia on vehicles.",
			"",
			"When driven correctly, vehicles can move straight ahead, diagonally, or a mix of both within the same movement. Skilled drivers can make a vehicle zigzag in a forward direction with ease.",
			"",
			"***Movement:*** Vehicles have a maximum speed and an acceleration listing. The speed is the fastest rate the vehicle can travel. When a creature or creatures pull a vehicle, the vehicle's maximum speed is equal to twice the speed of the creature providing the propulsion, and its acceleration is the creature's speed. (Teams of mixed creature types use the slowest creature's speed.) A vehicle cannot start at its maximum speed, unless it has some form of high-level magic propulsion. Each round, the driver can attempt to accelerate the vehicle or decelerate it by a rate equal to its acceleration (see {rule/Driving Vehicles}). The rate at which a vehicle is currently moving is called its current speed."

			"Controlling a vehicle takes common sense, awareness, intuition, and often some amount of skill in its method of propulsion. In the case of muscle propulsion, it is about guiding the creatures to move the vehicle. In the case of current propulsion, it is about using the current and tools like sails, oars, or a rudder to move the vehicle. With magic, it is typically about understanding the magic device that powers the propulsion and using the device properly.",
			"",
			"***Driving Actions:*** A driver can, at the start of her turn, before taking any other action, take any of the following actions (except the \"uncontrolled\" action) to control a vehicle. If the driver does not take an action, takes another action, or delays or readies an action, she loses control of the vehicle and the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action.",
			"",
			">***Accelerate (standard action):*** With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed increases up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet), but no higher than its maximum speed. The vehicle can move forward or forward diagonally. In other words, each time a vehicle enters a new 5-foot square, it can choose any of its forward-facing squares - the ones directly in front or either of the squares directly forward and diagonal. This allows the vehicle to swerve. A driver who fails her driving check can only move into squares directly in front of the vehicle's forward facing.",
			">",
			">***Decelerate (standard action):*** With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed decreases by a rate up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet). On a failed check, the vehicle does not decelerate. Either way, the vehicle can move forward diagonally. If deceleration reduces a vehicle's speed to 0, some amount of inertia will continue to move the vehicle forward. The vehicle moves forward (either directly forward or forward diagonally) 1d4 &times; 5 feet before coming to a complete stop. Having the {feat/Expert Driver} feat reduces this distance by 10 feet (minimum 0 feet).",
			">",
			">***Keep It Going (move action):*** With a successful driving check, the driver can move the vehicle forward on its current facing at its current speed, and it can move forward diagonally. Failing the check keeps the speed constant, but you cannot move the vehicle forward diagonally.",
			">",
			">***Reverse (standard action):*** A vehicle may only be moved in reverse if it is at a full stop (movement of 0 feet). On a successful driving check, a vehicle can move backward at half its acceleration, moving either directly backward (the reverse of its forward facing) or backward diagonally. On a failed check, it does not move backward.",
			">",
			">***Turn (standard action):*** The driver takes this action to turn a vehicle's forward facing 90 degrees. The vehicle moves its current speed. If a vehicle's current speed is twice its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 5. If a vehicle's movement is three times its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 10. If it is four or more times its acceleration, the DC increases by 20. With a successful driving check, the vehicle changes its facing either left or right by 90 degrees at any point during its movement. Do this by pivoting the vehicle so that the left rear or right rear side of the vehicle takes the place of the vehicle's former forward facing side. On a failed check, the vehicle does not turn, but can be moved forward diagonally during its movement.",
			">",
			">***Uncontrolled (no action):*** When the driver does nothing or there is no driver, the vehicle is uncontrolled. An uncontrolled vehicle moves forward only (it cannot move forward diagonally). If a vehicle has muscle propulsion, it decelerates at a rate equal to its acceleration. If a vehicle is powered by an air current, water current, or some form of weird current, it slows by 10 feet. These decelerations are cumulative. If a vehicle does nothing, it cannot perform vehicular bull rushes, but can still perform a vehicular overrun or a ramming maneuver (see [Vehicle Combat Maneuvers](rule/vic_vehicle_combat_maneuvers)).",
			">",
			"***Driving a Vehicle Outside of Combat:*** Since driving a vehicle outside of combat is easily accomplished by taking 10 on the skill check, driving checks are not normally needed. Almost every character can do it with relative ease; the DCs are given only to adjudicate special situations that may come up in your game.",
			"",
			"***Driving a Vehicle with Magic Propulsion:*** Typically, a vehicle with magic propulsion requires actions but no driving checks in order to drive it. When driving a vehicle with magic propulsion, treat every action as though the driver succeeded at the driving check.",
			"",
			"***Driving a Vehicle without the Proper Skill:*** If a driver lacks the proper skill to drive a vehicle, the driver can always make a Wisdom ability check instead of the appropriate skill check. The driver can even take 10 or gain the benefits of aid another when using Wisdom instead of the vehicle's normal driving skill.",
			"",
			"***Vehicle Crews:*** Some vehicles require a crew. A vehicle with a full crew complement is as easy to control as any other vehicle. A vehicle without a full crew complement, but with at least half its crew, increases all driving check DCs by 10. A vehicle needs at least half its crew complement in order to be driven at all. Crew members can take no action while the vehicle is in motion except to aid in that vehicle's movement. A crew member does not threaten an area."

If this simple system involves too much abstraction, you can have vehicles make wide turns.",
			"",
			"Have the driver make a driving check as usual. If she succeeds at the check, she can turn the vehicle. When a vehicle makes a turn, it has a chance to make a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver on any creature within the turning area, which is a square with sides equal to the vehicle's length, with one vertex touching the front facing of the vehicle on the side opposite to the direction of the turn. In other words, put the square with one side running along the vehicle's front, perpendicular to its forward facing, and another running the direction of its current forward facing. Place the square so its far corner is within the desired destination of the vehicle. If the turn is successful, the vehicle ends this movement in that area, facing toward the direction of the turn.",
			"",
			"The vehicle then makes either vehicular overruns or vehicular bull rushes (if the driver makes the required swift action) on all creatures and objects within the square that are smaller than it, and makes ramming maneuvers on all creatures and objects that are larger than it, including solid objects. It takes a -10 penalty on the vehicular bull rush and vehicular overrun maneuvers. The driver can choose to make these in any order she likes. She makes them one at a time (even after the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop), and all effects are cumulative. If the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop, the GM decides the final resting location within the turning area, picking the most plausible location given the effects.",
