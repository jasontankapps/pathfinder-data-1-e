			"This vial contains what appears to be ordinary ink. However, when a command word is uttered and then an individual uses the ink to write something, the ink \"stores\" that person's handwriting style, and can then be used to duplicate it, allowing the creation of a nearly perfect forgery. For example, if a noble was provided the ink for the purpose of signing a writ of arrest, the next person to use the ink could activate its power and scribe a pardon in the exact handwriting of the noble. Such a falsified document perfectly matches the stored handwriting, thus granting a +20 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (which doesn't stack with any bonus from possessing an original copy of the handwriting in question). At the GM's discretion, if the person attempting to detect the forgery doesn't have the appropriate knowledge to look for other clues, such as the type of paper used, the seal, the method of delivery, or the phrasing, the check to detect the forgery automatically fails. The individual being mimicked must inscribe something legible. Doodling, drawing, or random scratching doesn't convey the handwriting style, though simple lists, signatures, or mathematical computations do. The ink can't produce magical writing (spellbook pages or scrolls) unless the forger has the ability to create such writing and is attempting to do so, in which case the magical inscription appears in the mimicked person's handwriting and must be deciphered by {spell/read magic} as normal. The vial contains enough ink of mimicry to create 10 pages of forged text. Text written using the ink in the process of storing the writer's handwriting style doesn't count toward the limit.",

On a hit, the spheres explode outward, forming an immobile cage of semi-solid lightning around the target.

Four lightning trap spheres thrown simultaneously can capture a Medium target, eight spheres can capture a Large target, 12 spheres can capture a Huge target, and 16 spheres can capture a Gargantuan target.

			"This mummified house cat - dried, filled with sand, and bound in linen wrappings - appears to be nothing more than a family pet buried alongside its deceased master. Far more than a mere pet, however, a mummified guardian protects and preserves the corpse it is interred with and acts as a guardian against grave robbers and looters, potentially driving such trespassers toward more dangerous defenders or traps. When placed inside a sarcophagus or coffin alongside a dead body and activated, a mummified guardian also infuses the corpse with positive energy, preventing the body from being turned into an undead creature, as sanctify corpse.",
			"",
			"In addition, the mummified guardian also creates a magical ward around the sarcophagus containing it. If the sarcophagus is opened after the mummified guardian is placed inside, any creature with 5 Hit Dice or fewer within 20 feet of the open sarcophagus is overcome by a feeling of dread and must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be frightened for 3 rounds. On a successful save, a creature is instead shaken for 1 round. This ability functions only once. Once triggered, the mummified guardian retains only its sanctify corpse ability (this reduces the price of the mummified guardian to 3,000 gp).",
			"",
			"If the sarcophagus containing the mummified guardian is placed in an area or room with multiple paths of egress, the owner may designate one general direction an affected target must take if it flees, as long as the chosen direction does not require the target to move any closer to the mummified guardian. After moving in the designated direction for 1 round, the target behaves as normal for the frightened condition for the remainder of the effect's duration.",
			"",
			"A mummified guardian must be placed inside a sarcophagus, coffin, or other enclosed container with a dead body to function. Although cats are most common, mummified guardians can be created from the mummified remains of other small animals as well.",
