Other gangs such as the reptile-wrangling Crocodile Raiders, the metal-salvaging Machine Union, the diseased and drug-dealing Possum Gang, the mystical cult known as Three Prong, and the skygazing descendants of the Lirgeni known as the An-Ydak - as well as dozens of others - all stake their claims on the apocalyptic lands of the Abendego Gulf.",

In the far southern coast of the Sodden Lands, a pirate town known as Greenblood hosts an annual bloodsport event called Green Blood on a Black Rock that brings pirates from the Shackles and beyond to the Sodden Lands, leaving the sodden scavengers with yet more foes in the harsh and daunting region."

In the time since, the cult has flourished in Thuvia, where in the vast deserts of that nation the House of Oblivion stands as a permanent marker of Ahriman's presence.

Usij cabals operate independently of each other, but they always pursue the same goal: ruin. Recent rumors claim a cabal of Usij alchemists have joined with a great wyrm blue dragon and are scouring the desert for sun orchids in order to synthesize their own version of the sun orchid elixir. Some say that certain Usij leaders meet annually at a secret location somewhere in central Casmaron, but this may be only whispers on paranoid lips.",

He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about - to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more \"monstrous\" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.",

Because of his reluctance to kill, he is useful for an encounter where the PCs should negotiate or surrender instead of fighting.",

			"For the vast majority of ships, the shackled sorcerer provides the main artillery in skirmishes, sending sheets of flame at enemy vessels or targeting burly, hostile sailors with blasts of arcane might from the rear of a boarding party. Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth, knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however, pirates do all they can to protect their magic-wielding allies from harm, knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and swinging from a gibbet.",
			"",
			"The majority of shackled sorcerers are considered officers, but they rarely assume traditional positions of authority such as a captain's first mate. Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are highly prized among sea-faring magic-wielders. While the bloodlines of shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at sea - including the Aquatic or Stormborn bloodlines - any gifted arcane casters who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships."

			"Based in the Nidalese city of Nisroch, the Silent Enforcers maintain brutal order in the name of Zon-Kuthon and the city's Silent Shroud, the official security force that they're members of. Rather than recruiting from among Nisroch's populace, the enforcers of the Silent Shroud kidnap children from the city's lowest classes, whom they mold to fit their ideals. These children must endure a terrifying regimen of indoctrination and torture, and are rendered mute by the application of a hot poker to the throat. Those who survive emerge nameless and almost devoid of identity, their bodies hardened into living weapons that need neither armor with which to protect themselves nor implements with which to kill. Indoctrinated only to listen and react, to obey and not to think, a fully trained Silent Enforcer is a merciless and imposing agent of the Shrouded One - the mysterious leader of the Silent Shroud, and the only member to retain the ability to speak. The Shrouded One's identity is known only to Nisroch's top city officials, but even she is said to remain nameless, like her enforcers, identifying herself only with a series of hand gestures despite her ability to speak her own name should she wish to do so.",
			"",
			"Silent Enforcers primarily exercise authority over the peasants of Nisroch, but have jurisdiction over any criminal act committed in their sight. For the most part, the punishment for a crime the monks witness is up to each Silent Enforcer's own discretion, and they more often err on the side of the harsh and lethal variety. Should a Silent Enforcer catch a more notable citizen or an influential foreigner committing a crime, the perpetrator is expected to be apprehended rather than killed; it is acceptable for such criminals to turn up battered, so long as they're taken alive. Completely devoid of redeeming emotion, Silent Enforcers show mercy not to spare lives, but rather to subject their prisoners to the fearsome justice of Nidal. Most victims prefer a clean death in battle to the unimaginably sadistic tortures that would be exacted upon them should they be taken prisoner by an agent of the Silent Shroud.",
			"",
			"Typically, Silent Enforcers work in pairs or other multiples of two. Partners are assigned randomly each dawn, lest undue attachments form between agents that might compromise their duties. Should a Silent Enforcer be defeated, the lives of any peasants who bear witness to or spread tales of such an embarrassment are forfeit. Even nobles fear to speak of such occurrences, for the protections normally provided for those of their stature are ignored when the flawless reputation and intimidating legend of the Silent Shroud is at stake. Silent Enforcers treat the elimination of those attempting to escape their authority as a paramount duty, though their pursuit rarely extends beyond Nisroch's walls."

These warriors rarely rush into combat without some consideration and preparation. They prefer to cast preparatory spells such as shield of faith and weapon of awe if time permits. Their preferred method of combat is ambush; they use Stealth and attempt to approach their enemies undetected. The cannibals prefer to incapacitate their enemies using hold person or tanglefoot bags so they can tie up and eventually cook and eat their victims; a living prisoner spoils less quickly than a decaying corpse. If open combat becomes necessary, these zealots let the ferocious rage of the Three Feasters overtake them and don't back down until they or their enemies are dead.",

			"**Laser Pistol (Ex)** The gunslinger's laser pistol is a one-handed firearm that shoots a beam of highly focused light at its target, dealing 1d8 points of fire damage on a successful hit. The gun has a range increment of 50 feet, and its attacks resolve against the target's touch AC. Lasers can pass through force fields and force effects like a wall of force without damaging that field to strike a foe beyond. Objects like glass or other transparent barriers do not provide cover from lasers (but unlike force barriers, glass still takes damage from a laser strike passing through it). Invisible creatures are immune to damage caused by lasers. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide cover in addition to concealment from laser attacks. Each shot expends 1 charge of the gun's 10-charge capacity. As a semiautomatic weapon, the gun fires one shot per attack. If the gunslinger wishes, he can fire an additional shot per round as if using the {feat/Rapid Shot} feat. This additional shot can stack with the additional shot granted by Rapid Shot, but when it does so, it increases the penalty for all shots fired that round to -6. A laser pistol is worth 10,000 gp and weighs 2 pounds.",
			"",
			"**Numerian Silverdisks (Ex)** These small, coin-sized discs are etched with circuitry, and contain 10 charges each. When placed in a special slot in the gunslinger's laser pistol, a silverdisk transfers its charge into the gun's internal capacitors, effectively reloading the weapon. A silverdisk can be recharged (with a 20% chance of being destroyed) with an active generator. A charged silverdisk glows with light equivalent to that of a candle. A Numerian silverdisk is worth 100 gp as long as it is capable of holding a charge; a dead silverdisk is worth 1 gp.",
			"",
			"**Rare Resources (Ex)** The Numerian gunslinger's access to the rare and expensive technology of the land's many metal ruins increases his wealth to that of a PC of her level. This increases his CR by 1.",

In the course of his travels, he's made enemies among the Technic League, who, like the people of Alkenstar, want to ensure that their advanced technology doesn't spread beyond their reach. Other technological firearms can be found in Numeria beyond the laser pistol."

			"The members of Rahadoum's elite Pure Legion are among the most vigilant and skilled police force in the Inner Sea region, dedicated to the sole purpose of keeping that nation free of the influence of gods and those who worship them. In the wake of the Oath Wars, which tore northern Garund apart as the churches of Nethys, Norgorber, and Sarenrae fought for control of the region, the nation of Rahadoum was founded upon the belief that all religions were a pox upon the world and that the worship of any divine force could bring about nothing but ill fortune. To stay true to this belief, for the last 21 centuries the Pure Legionnaires have worked ceaselessly to keep priests, lay worshipers, and religious paraphernalia out of their land.",
			"",
			"Based in Azir, the birthplace of the Laws of Man and now known as Port Godless, the Pure Legion inspects all vessels coming into Rahadoum to ensure they contain no religious paraphernalia and convey no would-be proselytizers. Any religious iconography found within the nation is confiscated and destroyed, and those who profess the veneration of any deity are forbidden entry into the land; such residents are deported or worse, depending on the seriousness of their crime. Legionnaires are trained to see through deception, from mundane lies about a visitor's faith to illusions and magical misdirections, and often utilize trusted arcane spellcasters to verify that magical items brought into Rahadoum pose no divine threat to their strictly atheist society.",
			"",
			"Pure Legionnaires fill a variety of roles, from serving as ship inspectors and camel-riding desert caravan guards to city law enforcement and cult-hunters who infiltrate secret sects of illicit deity worshipers within the Rahadoumi population. Smugglers who are tempted to make a steep profit by transporting religious items into the nation often discover that the cost of challenging the Pure Legion is more than they're willing to pay, and much of the Pure Legion's work involves maintaining enough of a reputation to deter hidden priests and closet faithful from publicly violating their nation's most important law. While Pure Legionnaires aren't as bloodthirsty as other nations may portray them, all are zealously devoted to the cause."

Most armigers have up to 4 or 5 class levels in fighter or ranger, though some pupils have backgrounds as cavaliers or even rogues. Citadel Vraid's Hellknights and signifers are significantly more challenging than their greener associates, and possess at least 1 level in either the Hellknight or Hellknight Signifer prestige class.

Amid the mountains in the island's interior, however, lurk a great threat to this community: hill giants, ettins, and trolls, both in independent clans and under the sway of the hill giant war chief Gorgnak. Thus the half-orcs who call Averaka home have dedicated themselves to the eradication of their violent, monstrous neighbors. Some believe such channeling and focusing of their aggression represents the human side of the half-orcs winning out over the bloodthirsty instincts of their orc blood, though a few worry about where that aggression might be pointed next if they manage to defeat their giant enemies.",

While many removed their masks and now do all they can to pursue a normal life, the most fanatical and psychologically scarred spread throughout Varisia, into some parts of Cheliax, and to more distant lands. Without a leader but knowing little else beyond service and violence, these remaining Gray Maidens seek new names and purposes in a world they no longer feel connected to. In Korvosa itself, Sabina Merrin (LN female human fighter 14) - the order's founder and Queen Ileosa's former consort - works to right the wrongs committed by the Gray Maidens, though many in the city are still understandably wary of her intentions. Elsewhere in Varisia, however, the former Gray Maiden Oriana (CN female human fighter 8) leads a devout group of fellow dishonored maidens who are unrepentant of their actions under Ileosa. Their whereabouts are currently unknown, but Oriana and those faithful to her are believed to be working toward retaking Korvosa in Queen Ileosa's honor, though what means they plan to use remain as shrouded as their scar-marked faces. (For more details on the Gray Maidens, see Pathfinder Adventure Path #62.)"

She is usually able to find alternative ways for poor folk to pay for her services, and as a result is beloved by her community.

			"Osirionologists are often amenable to working with Pathfinders exploring the ruins of Ancient Osirion as long as they feel their academic agendas are respected. They also work as hired experts for the [Aspis Consortium](rule/aff_profiteers) so they can undertake otherwise unaffordable expeditions. Naturally, most Osirionologists place their own motivations above those of their allies, and can be trusted only so long as they are moving toward their goals."

Once a mercenary, she turned to assassination in order to have more control over her actions and lower her own risk of death, and she's not about to stick her neck out now. She almost never fights in the middle of the day, preferring to attack at night or near dusk or dawn when the shadows are long.",
