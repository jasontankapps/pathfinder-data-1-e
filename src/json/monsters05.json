			"Devious and aggressive, charau-ka range farther across the Inner Sea than anyone truly expects. Their jungle tricksters-masters of stealth, deception, and disguise-roam freely, if sparsely, in the shadows of the world, or boldly stride through cities cloaked in makeup or glamers. Across Garund they often pose as common apes, but they sometimes travel abroad in the guise of exotic pets of obedient human slaves or use illusions to pose as halflings or human children. Between Jalmeray and Vudra, resourceful apes pose as playful vanaras as well.",
			"",
			"Some tricksters act as the eyes and ears of Usaro, but many serve as thieves-gathering magic and wealth to sate Ruthazek-or as saboteurs undermining enemies of the state or arranging bloody massacres for Angazhan's glory. They pose as guides or playful apes to lead adventurers and travelers into the jungles' many hazards."

			"A decade ago, intent on impressing the Gorilla King, a tribe of charau-ka crossed the Brazen Peaks and raided Alkenstar's Dongun Hold, a dwarven citadel loaded with the Grand Duchy's prized firearms. They suffered severe casualties but absconded with scores of guns. Ruthazek then handpicked several dozen promising ape-men to master the weapons, creating an elite caste of assassins, monster wranglers, and bounty hunters. Many warriors managed to survive this unorthodox training and now wander the jungle at Ruthazek's command, eliminating Usaro's enemies, retrieving fugitive slaves, and stocking the beast pits. The Gorilla King takes a special joy in sending his technological marvels to eliminate mages and healers.",
			"",
			"Rather than confronting foes directly, sharpshooters take aim from above, disappearing into the wilderness long before victims can muster a counterattack. They show no remorse and chase wounded targets through the jungle for miles with relentless determination. Priests of Angazhan instilled a strong sense of survival in these sharpshooters, who show surprising restraint for charau-ka. The telltale frenzy of their kin surfaces only when enemies draw close to these gunslingers, and several have broken their muskets bludgeoning foes to death, only to suffer horrible reprimands for their carelessness. Those who keep their rage tempered travel far beyond the borders of the Gorilla King's realm, searching Golarion for anything their sovereign requires. Loyal to the very core, these charau-ka never reveal what they seek until it lies within their sights."

Hunting and slaying help determine an individual's power within the group. Chardas often engage in infanticide and cannibalism. While they patrol their territories in groups, they fight individually with little strategy or structure. Chardas do not assist each other with their kills, as they perceive aid as a weakness and a dishonor to both themselves and their foes."

			"**Corporate Will (Su)** A charnel colossus is composed of the sentience of scores of creatures. Though they are able to work in concert as a cohesive whole, they are also able to separate their actions at will so as to not be impeded by the limitations of a single consciousness, effectively allowing them to focus on two things at once. As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two spell-like abilities in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other fullfound actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy). While part of the creature's sentience may be affected by a turn attempt, there are enough unaffected intellects within to override the effect.",
			"",
			"**Mind Feed (Su)** When a charnel colossus succeeds at a grapple check with a slam attack, it can use its mind feed ability as a free action during each round in which the grapple is maintained. A victim of a mind feed attempt must succeed at a DC 38 Will save each round that the ability is used. On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage per round. If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature's mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim's memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a wish or miracle. If the charnel colossus has grappled multiple victims, it can attempt multiple mind feeds in a single round. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
			"",
			"**Voice of the Ancients (Su)** A charnel colossus can, as a full-round action, cause its collective knowledge to be whispered into the minds of any sentient creature within 100 feet. These whispers riffle through the brain of any such creatures within range in a maddening susurrus. These individuals must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed and frozen in place as if by the hold monster spell. The victim may attempt a new save each round to try and break the effect. ",
			"",
			"Regardless of whether or not the save is successful, the effect leaves an insidious seed implanted in the victim's mind. The day after the save is made, the victim must succeed at a new save or the seed takes root and creates the subconscious compulsion for the victim to return to the charnel colossus at some point in the future. When and how this occurs is up the GM. This compulsion can be removed with a remove curse spell or by destroying the charnel colossus that implanted the compulsion. ",
			"",
			"This is a mind-affecting compulsion and cannot be negated by a silence spell because it is heard directly in the mind of the victim. Each time a creature is subjected to this attack, there is a 1% chance that some of the lost lore transmitted into her mind causes her to gain a permanent +2 bonus to Intelligence. This beneficial side effect can only occur to a creature once. When a charnel colossus uses this ability, it cannot use its spell-like abilities or take other actions in that round. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Some dead don't rest easy because of the circumstances of their death or the horrific experiences they underwent in life. Their souls return to the world of the living demanding justice, revenge, or just wanton destruction. Some dead, however, never intended for their souls to leave. Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus.",
			"",
			"A charnel colossus is an amalgam of scores, even hundreds, of individuals who, upon death, chose to be interred under special ritual circumstances with others of like mind. This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library-if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred-often over a period spanning hundreds of years-creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of any such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror.",
			"",
			"The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable-the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim's own life experience. The colossus can also form two thin tendrils of this charnel stuff in order to lash out and draw prey into its embrace.",
			"",
			"As powerful, ever-hungering abominations, charnel colossi are thankfully few and far between. The only documented one currently known to exist is reported to be trapped beneath the ruins of Kalexcourt in northwestern Ustalav, in an ancient Kellid shamanistic burial site."

The target must be within 60 feet of the charnel god, and it must attempt a DC 35 Will save to avoid being cut off from the divine. If successful, the target cannot be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours. If the target fails, it becomes stunned for 1 round and then permanently staggered thereafter. This ability has no effect on characters who don't have levels in any class that grants divine spellcasting, but it does affect characters who have minimal divine spellcasting abilities, such as paladins or rangers. This is a curse effect. Atonement can remove this effect, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The gods are no less strange and terrifying in death than in life. Though the death of any god is staggeringly rare, some do meet violent ends, often at the hands of other deities. When this happens, the deity's death casts fragments of the god's power out among the planes. These fragments are sometimes drawn to places where the god was worshiped in its life, where they can produce miraculous effects, such as striking the god's devout followers deaf or blind, or granting visions of the god's demise. Sometimes these shards of power go unnoticed and boil away into nothing over time. But sometimes, something far more terrible occurs-such fragments can find a new home within a graven image of the former deity, forming a new creature: a charnel god.",
			"",
			"Regardless of the deceased god's alignment or nature, all charnel gods are beings of sublime wickedness fueled by bitter anger. The memory of being killed and cast into the void leaves charnel gods utterly and cruelly insane. Further, they feel the pain of being incomplete, of being only a small portion of what they once were, and this torments them. Charnel gods have some memories of their time as gods, but any recollections are fragmented and muddled. A charnel god might be able to share a hidden secret it knew in its former life, but it could just as easily confuse the details or call forth a false memory, making it an unreliable source of wisdom. Charnel gods resent such questions anyway, as remembering their former lives only reminds them of their pitiful current state.",
			"",
			"Those who believe encountering a charnel god will be a chance to reconnect with a deceased divine patron are in for a rude awakening. Without exception, charnel gods detest any who once worshiped them. Unable to come to terms with the fact that they were defeated, they blame the incompetence or faithlessness of their former worshipers for their deaths. Charnel gods also hate the servants of other deities, though with less fervor than they feel toward their own former followers. To a charnel god, all worshipers are false and deserve to be punished for their lack of loyalty and devotion.",
			"",
			"At the same time, charnel gods long for mortals' worship. Truly, that is a charnel god's greatest wish-to once again be venerated, offered sacrifices, and loved and feared above all else in the world. Charnel gods cannot grant spells like a true deity, and so must rely on their own terrible powers and fearsome demeanor to cow and bully others into worshiping them. Their cults rarely last long, for the charnel god is an easily angered and fickle deity.",
			"",
			"The example charnel god presented here was once a demon lord of the hunt who was slain by a vengeful goddess. When creating a charnel god of a different deity, GMs should replace some or all of the charnel god's feats and skills to better support that deity's favored weapon and fighting style. Likewise, the charnel god's melee attacks should be altered as needed, but the end result should approximate the average damage a CR 23 creature might deal in a round. Note that charnel gods like the one detailed above can attack with their natural attacks as secondary attacks when attacking with ranged weapons.",

The monster's claws are particularly well suited to puncturing the hulls of ships, and most charybdises have learned that a single large merchant vessel contains enough sailors to make a perfectly sized meal. Often, a charybdis settles in along a well-known shipping route near the shoreline or amid an archipelago of islands where ships are forced along relatively narrow lanes between rocky isles-such locations allow the charybdis to lie in wait and increases the chance of its prey being unable to circumvent its vortex.",

Chickcharneys fiercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as humanoids. The shells are thought to possess alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and many alchemists are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens.",
			"",
			"While some pirates of the Shackles continue to insist that encountering a chickcharney is a good omen, a much larger contingent gives the ornery and erratic bird a wide berth. A chickcharney is 3 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds."

Their flight means they can pick and choose their prey, and they usually hunt a large area in search of easy food. They are too stupid and belligerent to acquire followers, though sometimes a tribe of kobolds might give them offerings. Conversely, they are just intelligent and stubborn enough that they make poor pets, and only a significantly more powerful creature can keep them submissive. They may form equal partnerships with a respectful humanoid or similar creature, and even consent to be used as a mount. A pride of chimeras is very leonine in its hierarchy, with a dominant male leading the group and most of the hunting done by the females. A solitary chimera may be a young male or a female with cubs nearby."

Those legendary chimeras still left are shunned and feared by their lesser kin, the common chimeras, and so the great beings reside only in the deepest expanses of wilderness, where they nurse their grudges and unleash terrible rampages upon nearby settlements and meddlesome intruders who awaken them from their dark dreams of what could have been.",

Such creatures can remain in good health for well over a millennium, and thus, while they are only a little smarter than their common brethren, these illustrious beasts can live to see whole civilizations rise and fall, and possess an innate melancholy and dire wisdom few humanoids can fathom. And indeed, even if humanoids could, the legendary chimeras rarely humor beings they regard as inferior to themselves."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Stalking the edges of civilization, this chitinous predator uses a unique strategy to attract prey: it mimics the screams of its intended victims. When a curious or valorous creature investigates, the chitikin erupts in ambush, amplifying its shriek to terrify its meal. Villagers near the Verduran Forest and World's Edge Mountains have countless stories revolving around a lonely traveler who hears someone screaming in pain, either in a cave or otherwise off the beaten path, only to investigate and find this horror waiting for him.",
			"",
			"At a glance, a chitikin might be mistaken for a giant black centipede, with its 15-foot body resting on 18 spindly legs. But unlike its smaller, simpler cousins, a chitikin also has a stinger dripping with venom and two large scythe-like claws. Above its hinged jaw are two glowing bulbs on constantly flicking antennae.",
			"",
			"A full-grown adult chitikin is 15 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"A larval chitikin at first appears to be nothing but a large centipede. It grows quickly, and within a few weeks it wraps itself in a cocoon-like casing, soon emerging several times larger. This process repeats periodically during a chitikin's life cycle, and at later stages, its cocoon might be mistaken for that of the rare giant blue moth; a potent alchemical ingredient. An alchemist who attempts to harvest such a chrysalis often finds he has made a fatal mistake when the chitikins emerges from its cocoon in a ravenous frenzy. The typical adult chitikin molts four times in its life, but there are rumors of a gargantuan specimen that underwent a fifth molting to grow to a fearsome size.",
			"",
			"Chitikins lure their prey by rubbing their antennae together, producing a sound not unlike the incoherent wailing of an innocent in desperate pain. When their prey gets closer, chitikins rise up and emit terrifying screams intended to unnerve their victims. Sages debate whether this behavior evolved naturally, but many layfolk who have survived encounters with the monsters claim they recognized their loved ones' voices and therefore suspect something more sinister at work. Some scholars hypothesize that some of the folktales in small towns warning travelers not to stop to help an injured stranger are cautionary stories based on chitikin attacks.",
			"",
			"Chitikins are careful hunters, preferring to ambush prey they have lured to their lairs. The creatures' multitude of legs and large claws grants them the ability to climb with ease, and they use this mobility to their advantage, clinging to cavern ceilings with most of their legs and reaching down to slash at prey below. In forests, chitikins scramble rapidly between tree trunks and sting targets with their tails, paralyzing the victims long enough to efficiently dismember them.",
			"",
			"Despite their brutal hunting methods, chitikins seem to have a compulsion with cleanliness. They suck away every trace of blood and entrails from their kills, leaving bones that they then crush with their mandibles until even the bones disintegrate. When not hunting or lying in ambush, chitikins repeatedly groom their antennae, claws, and mandibles, and polish their carapaces until they are a bright, gleaming black.",
			"",
			"This grooming behavior becomes more pronounced when a chitikin is ready to lay its eggs. First, it lays them on a wall, dangling off a tree, or in some other elevated location where they remain in stasis. At this stage the egg sac looks almost like a bag of marbles or gems, and the eggs emit a faint blue luminescence. The chitikin cleans the sac constantly, protecting it from scavengers and hunters. If the egg sac touches the ground, the chitikin flies into a rage, attacking any creatures nearby and sometimes chasing them for several miles, her brood forgotten. After this lengthy aerial incubation, the chitikin brings freshly killed prey to its nesting site and carefully implants its eggs in the corpse. After about a month, the eggs hatch and the chitikin larvae feast on the liquefied remains.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Chitikins lead mostly solitary lives at the fringes of civilization, close enough to lure prey but not so close that they attract undue attention. Their nests are often in thick forest canopies, mountain crags, and shallow caves. It's not uncommon for towns near swaths of wild territory to be terrorized by a chitikin for months as it skitters around the periphery, luring unsuspecting townspeople to their doom.",
			"",
			"While its appearance can be unsettling, the most terrifying aspect of this predator is its ability to emulate humanoid screams. The particular scream a chitikin produces is influenced by what it hunts; a chitikin that preys on human villagers sounds much different from one that scours caves for goblin victims. On rare occasions, chitikins living near larger cities learn to mimic the cries of domesticated pets or livestock rather than people, as imitating the latter has the undesirable consequence of summoning city guards, who often prove too troublesome as prey.",
			"",
			"While chitikins are rarely found with others of their own kind, except for brief encounters to mate, they do appear to have an odd fondness for the giant spiders that frequently share their environs. Accounts exist of chitikins grooming such spiders, and the arachnids seem to tolerate the attention. Ettercaps have also been known to share larger lairs with a chitikin, though they do not appear to get the same attention-and when a chitikin is ready to lay eggs, it drives away or eats any ettercaps in the vicinity. Likely thanks to these uneasy truces, adventurers have found webs so often in chitikin lairs that it's widely believed the creatures are capable of spinning the webs themselves, but the closest a chitikin comes to making a web is vomiting up the sticky brown goo it uses to make its cocoon just before molting.",
			"",
			"Chitikins prefer damp, dark places for their lairs. Caves are preferable, but they also live in forests and jungles under the darkest parts of the canopy. The creatures' restless pacing eventually reduces any soil or dirt to very fine powder, and their fastidious nature means there is no blood or gore to betray their presence. A chitikin lair in a forest is often marked by a copse of trees whose trunks are marred by rings gouged into the wood at a variety of heights-a result of the creature's constant movement and a telltale sign of a chitikin's presence to the knowledgeable or wary.",
			"",
			"Chitikin hunting methods inevitably cause the vermin's territory to become less and less fruitful as locals learn to avoid the paths and places from which few lone travelers return. As a result, chitikins move their lairs every few years, migrating by night until they find a suitable new location. Creatures sharing a chitikin's lair sometimes come along on these nocturnal migrations, forming a nightmarish convoy with spiders large and small that ride on the monster's back or scrabble alongside. It is often during these migrations that chitikins encounter another of their kind. If the two are not a mating pair, they fight to the death in a vicious, screaming battle."

A choker will attempt to grasp creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or smaller.",
			"",
			"Chokers appear to have little culture of their own, gathering only briefly to mate before their wanderlust and hunger spurs them again to a solitary existence. Their just-better-than-animalistic intelligence grants them a fascination with the trappings of society even if they do not truly understand it. Accordingly, the grubby lair of a choker (often situated in a difficult-to-reach nook or cranny) usually contains valuable objects such as rings, brooches, cloak clasps, and loose coins gathered from devoured victims.",
			"",
			"This fascination occasionally compels a choker to abandon its subterranean home for a closer study of the sunlit world's many civilizations. These chokers feel most at home in the darkened narrow alleyways of human cities, squeezing themselves into sewers, forgotten alcoves, barrels, and similar cramped, overlooked spaces. Chokers prefer to keep hidden during the light of day, emerging from their hidey-holes under cover of darkness to hunt for food and cruel pleasure. Favorite tactics include using their long arms to scoop prey off the street from the safety of a nearby rooftop, attacking sleeping families by squeezing through an open chimney, or tapping on a window to bring their curious food within grasping distance."

			"**Gravedust (Su)** As a standard action, a choking shade can enter the lungs of an adjacent living creature that is under the influence of a fear effect (such as the effect brought on by its desperation aura), bringing with it the dust of the grave. The victim can resist this attack with a successful DC 16 Fortitude save, and the choking shade is instantly expelled from a victim's lungs as soon as the victim is no longer under the effect of a fear effect (for example, because the victim has left the radius of the choking shade's aura or succeeded on the Will save). Until that point, the victim is prevented from breathing or speaking while the undead occupies its lungs. A creature can attempt to cough the shade out of its lungs on its turn as a standard action, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save to do so. See the [Environmental Rules](rule/environmental_rules) for how long a victim can hold its breath and the consequences of eventual suffocation.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Wind (Ex)** A choking shade is treated as a Tiny corporeal creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"There is nothing quite like the desperation of a suffocating creature, frantic for one last, sweet breath of air to fill deprived, aching lungs; it is a terrible way to die. There are so many ways to die of suffocation: asphyxiation in a fire, being buried alive, crucifixion, disease, drowning, strangulation-the list seems endless. Sometimes, the terrible imminence filling a person as life ends in so cruel a manner is enough to cause the doomed soul to rise from death as a choking shade.",
			"",
			"Choking shades animate into a swirling swarm of ashes, bone shards, dirt, and dust, assuming a facsimile of a humanoid form. They have a brutish intelligence and are drawn with envy to the breath of living creatures, attacking them on sight. In addition to the dust of the grave, these hateful spirits carry with them the overwhelming fear that accompanied them in their suffocating deaths, and this aura infects those who are near them with this same terror. Choking shades can take advantage of those affected by their fearful auras (or those already under the influence of a fear effect): they enter the victim's lungs, carrying their dusty remains with them, threatening unwilling hosts with the same awful deaths that they endured. Anyone slain by the choking essence of these undead creatures rises as one of their number, seeking retribution for all who are still afforded the freedom to breathe, a luxury taken for granted by the living.",
			"",
			"Though choking shades have some measure of intelligence and understand the languages they knew in life, their unreasoning hatred of the living makes communication with them impossible: these spirits would much rather make even a futile assault on the lungs of the living than engage in any form of communication.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Upon rising from death, a choking shade has a tendency to remain near either its grave or the site of its demise. It is not uncommon for these hateful spirits to manifest in a lethal, predatory pack, especially if they died together in the same tragic event. Choking shades who drowned and whose bodies remained in the water most often seek out dry land, but they tend to remain near that body of water, haunting the shoreline in search of potential victims.",
			"",
			"The threat of choking shades has affected the safety of miners and builders for generations. When miners are killed in a cave-in or laborers crushed by a collapsing structure, wise city managers and foremen seek the aid of the clergy to ensure the bodies are excavated and given proper burials. Clerics are often posted to spend some nights at the place of such an unfortunate event as a precaution against an undead infestation at the work site. Laying to rest these desperate, hatefully aggressive spirits is in the service of all those who still draw breath. The most common ritual for this purpose ends by extinguishing a blessed candle, respectfully putting out a flame that feeds on the oxygen the dead were denied.",
			"",
			"### Variant Choking Shades",
			"",
			"While these several variants of choking shades differ primarily by the nature of their suffocating deaths, the intensity of those deaths and the circumstances of their lives when the air was taken from their lungs make some shades even stronger and fiercer. At minimum, all variants have the advanced template as well as alterations to the gravedust special ability, modified by the circumstances of their deaths. Four are noted below.",
			"",
			"**Crushed Shade:** Suffocation following a cave-in or the collapse of a structure creates these shades. When a crushed shade is expelled from a host's lungs, the victim must succeed at a Will save against the gravedust's DC or be cursed by a permanent form of claustrophobia: whenever the victim is about to enter a cramped space, crowded venue, or other place from which escape may be difficult, she becomes shaken. The victim can attempt a DC 14 Will save to negate this condition, but failure makes the condition persistent. Even if the victim endures the claustrophobic circumstances with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition and the threat passes (the crowded disperses or flees, the obstacle is surmounted or avoided), the condition persists until she succeeds at the appropriate saves. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Drowned Shade:** Those choking shades whose suffocating deaths occurred in water are even more dreadful. When they are driven from a victim, the muck of the grave remains within the lungs. Victims are nauseated for 1d4 rounds after a drowned shade exits their lungs.",
			"",
			"**Smoking Shade:** Smoke inhalation within a fire caused the deaths of these choking shades. Each round a smoking shade occupies the lungs of a host, that host also takes 1d4 points of fire damage. After the choking shade is expelled, the victim is staggered from the pain for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Strangled Shade:** A strangled shade was asphyxiated by a murderer, and when it invades a victim's lungs, hand-shaped bruises arise on the victim's throat. Each round a strangled shade occupies a host, the victim takes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, and after the strangled shade is expelled from the lungs, the victim can't speak until an hour passes or receiving any amount of magical healing (whichever comes first)."

While the city remained safe from intrusion, its residents were unaware that they were trapped within a temporal prison, replaying the same week-long period over and over. The city's inhabitants never aged, but the souls of those who died couldn't escape to the Boneyard. Instead, these trapped souls festered within the demiplane, and over the course of centuries transformed into terrifying, incorporeal undead creatures called chronogeists.",

Yet sometimes, people would vaguely recall those who had perished in the form of half-remembered dreams, and as the presence of chronogeists slowly grew, theories as to their nature began to spread through the city's scholars. Some correctly suspected they were tied to a distortion in time, but most believed they were manifestations of dreams or forgotten memories that sought vengeance upon those who had misremembered them. Of course, at the end of every week, with the resetting of time, these theories would all be forgotten.",

Unhealthy, pale yellow, or orange lights typically permeate chronogeists, though they flash a gamut of bright colors when they harness the unstable time within them to attack those who disturb them.

			"When chronogeists arise, they typically haunt the general area of their death, confused and distraught about why they persist. They lose most memories they held in life and become enraged, aggressive threats to any who happen upon their territory, screeching and flying through victims' bodies in an attempt to right the temporal snags and instability that led to their undeath. This doesn't mean that chronogeists are unintelligent, however. Rather, chronogeists exist in a pure state of emotion and denial; they don't understand that a snag in time has prevented their souls' journeys, but are enraged that they're stuck on the Material Plane or elsewhere, so they continue to unleash the temporal dangers within them in fruitless attempts to understand their own natures.",

			"Chronogeists have no sense of companionship or interpersonal relations. They barely recognize that they're no longer their former mortal selves, and in death have become near-mindless evil creatures. Chronogeists whose progenitor creatures held particularly strong convictions, however, sometimes retain a sliver of an important memory-such as whether they once vowed to protect someone or something with their lives. These chronogeists still typically haunt the relevant areas, and might even still make efforts to fulfill an important vow they made in life, even if they don't recognize why or how they're doing so. These actions typically manifest in tragically ironic forms, such as a chronogeist forgetting entirely why it's protecting an area even while the subject of its previous concern, such as a precious artifact, lies forgotten in the dust.",
			"",
			"In most cases, it's rare for more than one chronogeist to haunt an area, since the creatures are territorial and are usually tightly tied to the place where they died. In places where temporal events are common or where the fabric of time is unstable, however, many chronogeists might arise spontaneously in a single location. When this happens, these chronogeists tend to move together, roving their territory for intruders or blindly trying to fulfill some mission they held dearly in life. Like when they operate alone, these chronogeists barely realize that they're working with others of their kind or to what end. They simply continue to rage against any living creatures that intrude upon their haunts, desperately seeking to understand their complex and tragic fate."

Even larval chuuls have this inherent sense of malice, further developed through inflicting suffering on other sentient creatures.",
			"",
			"Rare chuuls that have existed for generations outside of aboleth society may be of chaotic neutral alignment rather than chaotic evil, though these creatures still require the cerebral tissue of intelligent creatures to develop their own sentience, making a chuul clutch's ultimate shift away from inherently evil tendencies unlikely. Aboleth-serving chuuls typically destroy these independent groups as soon as they are discovered, though some find refuge in the deepest and darkest corners of the oceans of Golarion where not even aboleths tread. These chuuls make alliances with deep merfolk and other inhabitants of the lightless reaches of the deepest oceans.",
			"",
			"### Variants",
			"",
			"While the majority of all chuuls are represented by the statistics presented in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, some unique variants were created or modified by aboleth masters to serve specific roles in far-reaching plans, or have evolved different physiologies in response to vastly different environments.",
			"",
			"Arctic Chuuls: Arctic chuuls were designed to inhabit the freezing waters of the Crown of the World. These cold-dwelling creatures have cold resistance 10 and a burrow speed of 20 feet usable only in snow or ice.",
			"",
			"Deep Chuuls: A deep chuul is dusky gray to midnight blue in coloration and bears a glowing antenna that sheds light like a torch, much like an anglerfish's lure. Deep chuuls can use this light to fascinate creatures as per the [hypnotism](spell/hypnotism) spell (CL = the chuul's Hit Dice).",
			"",
			"Psychic Chuuls: Chuuls that feed on the brains of creatures capable of casting psychic magic sometimes develop inherent psychic magic abilities of their own in the form of spell-like abilities, but they are destroyed on sight by aboleths who encounter them. Rumors persist that psychic chuuls are capable of evolving into a new state beyond that of the adult chuul form.",
			"",
			"Sand Chuuls: Rarest of all chuul breeds, sand chuuls inhabit parched wastelands and deserts, and were intended to serve as the shock troops of a land invasion force following Earthfall. When the aboleths' plans failed to come to fruition, these specially engineered chuuls were largely forgotten. Now native to blasted regions of Casmaron and southern Garund, sand chuuls lack the aquatic subtype, the amphibious special quality, and a swim speed. Instead, a sand chuul has a burrow speed of 30 feet and tremorsense out to a distance of 30 feet."

			"Chyzaedu resemble massive pale earthworms, save that each has a hard beaks at one end and a knot of short tentacles at the other. Their bodies are extremely flexible and ringed with powerful muscles. Chyzaedu have very efficient, well-developed digestive systems, allowing them to ingest a wide variety of materials, although they prefer to eat sentient creatures in order to share the religious experience of consumption.",
			"",
			"Chyzaedu have a ring of tiny eyes around their beaklike maws, mostly hidden by the folds of their skin. These eyes are particularly keen and can dilate to allow the creature excellent night vision. Their eyes are supplemented by the lumpy and irregularly sized parietal eyes that line the area just behind their beaks; these serve as supplemental sensory organs, pinpointing the location of other nearby creatures in contact with the ground. The cloaca at the end of a chyzaedu's body is ringed by five flexible, ridged tentacles, which can wind together to form a clawlike appendage. A chyzaedu has significant control over this appendage and can use it to grasp items, manipulate devices, or cast spells with somatic components.",
			"",
			"Millennia ago, chyzaedu formed a brutal empire that subjugated several planets, and their voracious appetites stripped their conquered worlds of flora and fauna. Only the chyzaedu- home planet was spared this depredation, as the giant worms revered the life found there. In a bizarre astronomical accident-which some suspect the inscrutable masters of the Dominion of the Black of orchestrating-the cherished chyzaedu homeworld was swallowed by a black hole. This void emitted a strange, singing noise as it did so, along with staccato exhalations reminiscent of cruel laughter.",
			"",
			"The surviving chyzaedu saw this catastrophe as a divine revelation, experiencing a species-wide psychic rapture that resonates within all chyzaedu even today. The chyzaedu became zealots, spreading outward into space to preach the sanctity of destruction they call the Deglutitious Void. When the chyzaedu eventually encountered the starfaring collective called the Dominion of the Black, they found their theology to be closely aligned with the destructive philosophies of the Dominion.",
			"",
			"Chyzaedu are now firmly ensconced as the priestly caste of the Dominion of the Black and lead the collective's other races in abstruse religious rites. Most of these rites revolve around all-consuming voids, black holes, or gulfs of null space that utterly extinguish all matter. Most notably, chyzaedu orchestrate the biennial ceremony known as the Banquet, in which tens of thousands of sacrifices are hurled into black holes in the hope of evoking the same singing and chuckling exhalations that accompanied the consumption of the chyzaedu homeworld. Although focused on devouring, chyzaedu religion is not eschatological, but instead emphasizes the sanctity of the passage into the void: that is, the rapturous moment of devouring and of being devoured. All moments of swallowing are sacred to the chyzaedu. Creatures ingested by chyzaedu are unlikely to share the chyzaedu's religious appreciation for the event, which puzzles the aberrations.",
			"",
			"Chyzaedu are social creatures. They're eager conversationalists, although they eventually bring any discourse around to the topic of religion, consumption, or both. Chyzaedu are often found alongside other races of the Dominion as advisors, diplomats, and spiritual advisors. Despite their great bulk, chyzaedu make excellent spies: they are welcome throughout most of Dominion territory, and few members of the mostly secular Dominion understand the full capabilities of the creatures' divine magic. Chyzaedu rarely congregate with their own kind except during brief periods of mating or when communally presiding over religious services; idle chyzaedu inevitably quarrel with each other about religious minutiae, and such religious quarrels invariably end in violence.",
			"",
			"Chyzaedu drape themselves with vestments of a flexible metallic fiber akin to mithral. Each chyzaedu crafts its own garment using secret processes the worm-priests do not share with other races. As few races in the Dominion of the Black use metal, chyzaedu's vestments are both rare and distinctive in their cosmopolitan society. Although chyzaedu vestments don't function for other races, the 500 pounds of metallic fabric that constitute the garment are worth 7,500 gp.",
			"",
			"Unlike most races of the Dominion, chyzaedu have a keen interest in Golarion and make occasional expeditions to the planet. Chyzaedu share a myth similar to the Casmar legend of the Star-Worm-it tells of an interstellar monster that crashed on Golarion eons ago and gave birth to the first purple worms. Chyzaedu track and study purple worms and their variants (in particular, the colossal crimson worms of the Storval Plateau). Some chyzaedu view purple worms as enlightened brutes, devoid of intellect but wholly overwhelmed by the religious fervor of consumption. Other chyzaedu see purple worms as little more than breeding stock, but hope to use them to enhance future generations of their race. The worm-priests find the diverse panoply of deities worshipped on Golarion to be confusing and unnecessary, and are particularly offended by the worship of Rovagug-the Rough Beast's theology of destruction wholly devoid of purpose smacks of apostasy.",

			"Ravenous forces of destruction, cipactlis are created by the gods to scour worlds of specific mortal qualities. It is believed that primal and destructive forces of nature spawned the first cipactli, and that it was wrought upon the world as an insatiable agent of annihilation. Stories claim that the gods saw fault in this creation and set a trap to destroy the first and most powerful cipactli, but such legends suggest that this destruction wasn't complete. Either the gods' methods were flawed or other divinities learned how to create new cipactlis, for now these beasts have spread throughout multiple worlds.",
			"",
			"These monsters are individual creations of the gods and voracious devourers of particular elements of the universe. All cipactlis are attuned to certain aspects of their worlds, and when not slumbering in wait, they tear through mortal civilizations in a swath of destructive feasting. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare.",
			"",
			"Essentially ageless, many a cipactli has been defeated by great heroes, only to have a portion of its body sink below the waters and regenerate. After such a defeat, a cipactli often goes into a state of hibernation that can last for centuries.",
			"",
			"Though they are destructive creatures, they have immense knowledge of the world. Those who can calm them may learn secrets about the universe to which most mortals are not normally privy.",

			"Destroyer (CR + 0): These clockwork dragons are used as highly mobile and powerful siege engines. While the destroyer clockwork dragon lacks a breath weapon, as a full-round action taken while on solid ground, it can move its gears to pull its wings apart and to rise up as a heavy bombard. The body of the clockwork is used as the platform for the bombard, and the internal workings of the clockwork can load the bombard without a crew, though it still takes five full-round actions on the part of the clockwork to load the bombard. The clockwork dragon can also take the actions necessary to aim the bombard. A clockwork dragon carries enough ammunition to fire the bombard 10 times.",
			"",
			"Flaming Tar Breath (CR +1): Instead of breathing fire, some clockwork dragons spray a 30-foot cone of flaming tar. Creatures in the area of effect take 14d6 points of fire damage and are entangled in a thick layer of flaming tar. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled effect. Creatures are entangled for 5 rounds as the tar burns. Entangled creatures take 3d6 points of fire damage each round on their turn. Spending a full-round action and succeeding at a DC 22 Reflex save removes the tar, freeing the trapped creature from the entanglement and further fire damage.",
			"",
			"Infiltrator (CR + 1): These clockwork dragons are more subtle and nimble than those of other clockwork dragons. An infiltrator clockwork dragon can rearrange its movable parts into very serpentine and compact shapes, which gives it the compression ability. Furthermore, its parts are coated with a black, noise-dampening resin, granting it a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks (typically Stealth +0). Finally, it's infused with magic allowing it, as a standard action, to become invisible as the greater invisibility spell (CL 15th) three times per day. The infiltrator clockwork dragon's invisibility is a supernatural ability.",
			"",
			"Mithral (CR +0): This variant loses its adamantine weapons and its DR, which are replaced by greater flight capability thanks to its spell-infused mithral parts. Its land and swim speeds increase to 70 feet, and its fly speed increases to 200 feet with good maneuverability. In addition, once per day as a swift action, it can gain the benefits of the haste spell for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"Rust Breath (CR +0): Rust-breath clockwork dragons do not breathe fire. Instead, the creatures breathe out a fine mist of an alchemical solvent that instantly rusts exposed metals. This so-called \"rust breath\" issues forth in a 60-foot line. Creatures can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid the effect for attended items; however, they need to make a separate attempt for each exposed item. Each alchemical dragon can hold enough of the alchemical solvent to make up to three breath weapon attacks before the solvent must be refilled manually, which takes 10 minutes. These clockwork dragons are made of ironwood, adamantine, and other resistant materials immune to rusting of any form.",
			"",
			"Sleep Gas Breath (CR +0): This clockwork dragon's breath weapon is replaced with tanks of sleep gas. When the clockwork breathes out this gas in a 30-foot cone, creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+10 rounds. Clockwork dragons with this breath weapon tend to have either the infiltrator or mithral variants, and often they have both variants. These clockwork dragons excel at missions that require stealth and precision rather than brute force.",

			"",
			"**Explosive Charge (Su)** A clockwork excavator can create alchemical explosives that aid it in clearing particularly dense areas of rock. Three times per day, an excavator can launch a cylindrical explosive charge as a ranged attack, targeting any grid intersection within 30 feet. A thrown charge detonates 1d4-1 rounds after being released (a result of 0 causes it to detonate upon impact), creating a 10-foot burst that deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (bypassing objects' hardness). Creatures in the blast radius can attempt a DC 16 Reflex saving throw for half damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Metal Sense (Su)** When a clockwork excavator is wound, the operator can place 1 pound of one type of gem, metal ore, or mineral in the construct's headpiece, keying the clockwork to search for the desired material within 120 feet. If the construct does not immediately sense the presence of its target, it begins searching in a clockwise spiral from its activation point outward until it needs to be wound again (barring any other instructions from its operator). Placing an artificial or mixed material, such as steel, bronze, or alloyed coins, in the construct's head keys the excavator to one of the material's base elements (at random) and the creature has a cumulative 5% chance of going berserk every hour of operation. A berserk excavator goes on a rampage, attacking the nearest living creature or object, then moving on to spread more destruction until it needs to be wound again.",
			"",
			"**Pulverizing Ray (Su)** A clockwork excavator can make short work of obstacles in its way with a powerful sonic ray. This functions as a breath weapon usable every 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Superior Craftsmanship (Ex)** Clockwork excavators are designed to be able to break apart almost any material as part of their mining duties. The drill bits on a clockwork excavator are crafted from adamantine and ignore all hardness, and the construct does not rust.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The product of greed and invention, clockwork excavators are designed to strip-mine an area in pursuit of mineral wealth. Found in areas where such desires override any concern for the natural environment, clockwork excavators are durable, tough, and purpose-driven.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Clockwork](family/clockwork)",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The original inventors of clockwork excavators worked hand in hand with experienced miners to determine the most beneficial abilities for such a contraption. Able to work day and night in complete darkness with no fear of poisonous gas pockets in mine shafts, these constructs can find a vein of diamonds, gold, or iron, place the raw ore into its storage compartment, and haul it back to its operators with no risk to life or limb.",
			"",
			"As clockworks, these constructs are able to take more complex commands than a lesser construct might be able to, and can easily distinguish friend from foe. However, unscrupulous owners might opt to store iron in the clockwork excavator's headpiece and set it loose in a populated area, turning this industrial clockwork into an impromptu weapon as it attempts to feed steel armor and weapons into storage-with their owners still attached. The clockwork excavator is only as good as the instructions it is given, and disregarding safety in favor of acquiring more wealth is always a temptation. Such attempts come with their own risks, of course, as a complex metal placed in the clockwork can cause it to go berserk, rampaging without control through narrow, inescapable mining tunnels.",
			"",
			"The nature of the clockwork excavator is such that the creator can easily swap out the tools at the end of the excavator's arms. Picks, saws, and shovels are all common replacements, and pulley systems to lift heavy loads from the bottom of a quarry are not unheard of. Many clockwork inventors specializing in these excavators hope to eventually include within their creations a means to process the raw ore. As of yet, that goal has not been achieved, as the complexities of including a hot smelter among all the delicate gears has proven difficult, and the failures have been explosive and fiery.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Being constructs, clockwork excavators have no society of their own, and they can be found wherever their skills are needed, usually owned by someone with both deep pockets and an engineer on staff to maintain the complicated machinery. A few inventors make a tidy living moving their clockwork excavators from site to site, renting out an excavator for one winding of the key before moving on.",
			"",
			"Traditional miners view clockwork excavators and their creators as a threat to their way of life-others, as the inevitable future. The constructs are often the target of sabotage attempts, but many attempts are cut short when the would-be saboteurs realize that a clockwork excavator is very capable of defending itself.",
			"",
			"Purpose-built to find specific minerals, a clockwork excavator can search for only inorganic material, with gemstones and metal ores being the most common. Complex locks are often added to the headpiece to prevent any malicious altering of its target, as the clockwork excavator is fairly indiscriminate in pursuit of its goal. In 4702 ar, a Nirmathi inventor by the name of Kyrdu Bellhorn was hanged after the iron ore in his excavator was replaced with gold coins and the construct massacred several wealthy merchants. His excavator was dismantled and sold as scrap by followers of Brigh, who then distributed the proceeds to the victims' families.",
			"",
			"Dwarves and followers of the clockwork goddess Brigh most often create clockwork excavators, though dwarves who do so can earn the ire of traditionalists who frown upon mechanical automatons taking the place of skilled workers. Brigh and her followers, on the other hand, have no such compunctions holding them back, and have yet to let tradition stymie innovation or engineering triumphs. Clockwork-focused engineers from across the Inner Sea have received invitations to Absalom for a conference in the summer of 4717 ar, where they can meet with like-minded peers and show off their work. More importantly, High Clockmother Llanalir of Alkenstar will be attending to judge a contest, with hopes of finding new ideas and clockwork innovators from beyond Alkenstar's borders by offering the winner a workshop in Alkenstar City. The opportunity to work in Alkenstar with both the High Clockmother and the nearby dwarves of Dongun Hold has already attracted countless contestants to the city, where they tinker in preparation for the pending festivities.",

This thin film also reflects incoming rays, scattering these magical attacks without harm to the clockwork nautiloid.",
			"",
			"Unlike with living nautiluses, which inhabit only the largest portions of their shells as they grow, a clockwork nautiloid's entire spiraled shell is filled with gears, rods, and springs. The pleasing logarithmic spiral of a clockwork nautiloid's shell arises not from a pattern of natural growth but because the mathematically consistent shape allows for the most efficient packing of the creature's clockworks. A clockwork nautiloid's winding key fits into a small hole at the precise center of its spiraled shell, on either the left or right side.",

			"Although clockwork nautiloids have few natural predators, mysterious titanic creatures lurk in the deep oceans, and clockwork engineers often camouflage their clockwork nautiloids just to be safe. The upper side of a clockwork nautiloid is often constructed of dark metals in overlapping stripes, allowing the clockwork nautiloid to blend with the deeper ocean below when it is seen from above. Similarly, the creature's underside is usually constructed of bright, pale metals; when seen from below, the creature appears part of the brighter ocean above. Clockwork nautiloids cannot retract into their shells, although they can fold their tentacles over each other to form a rigid covering.",

Because of the expense of creating these constructs, they are usually programmed to perform specific, important tasks lasting no more than 22 days (the limit of the clockwork nautiloid's winding). The tasks that bring clockwork nautiloids to the ocean depths are as varied as the motives of their creators. A creator might deploy a clockwork nautiloid to defend a strategic undersea locale, recover treasures from a shipwreck, explore a submerged ruin, or capture valuable marine specimens.",

Like most clockwork constructs, clockwork nautiloids lack an Intelligence score, but each is constructed with multiple internal turning scripts that turn simultaneously when wound. As a result, clockwork nautiloids can process multiple strategies to surmount obstacles. This parallel thinking also makes a clockwork nautiloid a surprisingly flexible combatant, able to efficiently fight large groups by grappling smaller foes, biting at others, and rotating its thick shell to intercept attacks.",

			"**Overclock (Ex)** In place of making a lash attack on its turn, a clockwork overseer can overclock another clockwork creature within its reach, impelling it to exceed its performance limitations. At the beginning of its turn, an overclocked creature takes an amount of damage equal to half its Hit Dice (minimum 1), expends 1 full day of activity stored by its winding ability, and gains one of the following benefits, selected by the clockwork overseer.",

			"",
			"A clockwork overseer can end this effect on a clockwork creature affected by its aura of command as a free action. The overclocked condition otherwise continues until the clockwork creature expends its stored days of activity or is destroyed.",
			"",
			"**Tactical Calculus (Ex)** A clockwork overseer can store hundreds of commands and scripts, allowing it to perform modest feats of problem-solving and strategic command as though it had an Intelligence score of 10. In practice, this enables a clockwork overseer to make tactical decisions, such as exploiting terrain or flanking targets, as well as convey simple tactical commands to other clockwork creatures in its aura of command. If the clockwork overseer takes electricity damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = the electricity damage dealt) or lose both its aura of command and tactical calculus abilities for 1d4 rounds.",

			"What clockwork creatures boast in both strength and resilience, they often lack in nuance and strategy. Most machinists are content to command their constructs directly when seeking tactical precision, but only a few artificers have the technical expertise needed to create a mechanical lieutenant capable of reasoning and adapting in its master's absence. Known as clockwork overseers, these constructs boast extraordinarily complex programming that far exceeds the basic command vocabulary of other clockwork creatures. This allows clockwork overseers to store hundreds or even thousands of commands, which they can parse and sort quickly enough to simulate an intelligent creature's adaptive thinking-at least regarding combat strategy and moderately complex tasks of coordinating construct laborers. These functions fall short of true thought, and clockwork overseers are incapable of language, emotion, higher thinking, or symbolic reasoning beyond specific sounds and statements they might parrot on command.",

			"Like most clockwork creatures, clockwork overseers are finely tuned creations of metal, gears, and magic, but they differ in two major regards: their mechanical \"brains\" and their kinetic generators. The complex inner workings of a clockwork overseer's programming core are an order of magnitude more complicated that those of its counterparts, composed of delicate arrays of counters, springs, toggles, and other perfectly fitted components that collectively store and compute data.",
			"",
			"Clockwork overseers can compel even greater feats from their subordinates, though doing so requires direct contact between the constructs via the overseer's lash to convey an electrical charge. This electricity builds over time, accumulated by static energy discharges created by the movement of limbs and gears. Most clockwork creatures respond readily to this electrical goading, overriding their standard operating specifications based on the exact combination of current and voltage the overseer conveys. Clockwork overseers harness and exploit electricity in small amounts, but they're as vulnerable as other clockwork creatures to massive discharges-arguably more so, since such attacks can scramble an overseer's decision-making hardware and temporarily reduce it to a truly mindless state.",
			"",
			"Numerous cultures and machine schools have built clockwork overseers over the ages, emphasizing different martial techniques in the process. These variant clockwork overseers can grant a different combat feat-typically one for which they qualify-to their minions. What's more, these overseers sometimes represent the last record of otherwise extinct fighting styles; a creature with the [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat or that succeeds at a DC 21 Craft (clockwork) or Knowledge (engineering) check can spend 8 hours deciphering an overseer's mechanical \"brain\" in order to decode the stored combat feat, using this new knowledge as the basis to learn the feat or teach it to others.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Since they are artificial constructs, clockwork overseers almost always exist because either a skilled artificer or a machinist created them. The creator typically already owns several other clockwork creatures and needs a capable, tireless entity to direct them. As a result, a clockwork overseer is only rarely encountered alone, unless attrition, misfortune, or time have destroyed its entourage.",
			"",
			"Under rare circumstances-especially involving areas of sustained magical energy-an overseer can independently learn new tricks or even develop self-awareness. These creatures often commandeer other clockwork creatures, creating tiny fiefdoms dedicated to building new wonders or helping the overseer attain true sentience.

Starting a song is a standard action, and it can be maintained each round as a free action; stopping a song is a standard action.

These benefits do not stack with those provided by the airy arias of other clockwork songbirds.",
			"- Gentle Lullaby: The gentle, crooning lullaby of a clockwork songbird can cause enemies to drift toward slumber. Each round that a clockwork songbird sings its gentle lullaby, each foe within 30 feet that can hear it must attempt a DC 11 Will save. If the creature fails the save, it becomes drowsy; while drowsy, the creature takes a -2 penalty to Dexterity. If the creature is already drowsy and fails the DC 11 Will save, the creature falls asleep and gains the helpless condition. Slapping or wounding the affected creature fully awakens it, but normal noise does not. Alternatively, an ally can fully awaken a creature that is drowsy or fully asleep due to a gentle lullaby as a standard action. A creature that becomes fully asleep due to the gentle lullaby cannot be affected by gentle lullaby for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Inspiring Anthem: The clockwork songbird sings a hopeful song that, though somewhat piping and thin, rings true across the battlefield and instills a sense of duty in the hearts of the songbird's allies.

The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.",

			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Clockwork vivisectionists are vaguely humanoid in shape, but they diverge from this general form in disturbing ways. They typically stand 6 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds. They have four segmented mechanical legs that allow them to move quickly in any direction. Their chests are wrought metal cages that swing open to reveal an assortment of syringes loaded with paralyzing poisons, and their misshapen arms end in vicious surgical implements, often caked with dried blood and bits of gore. A clockwork vivisectionist's head has three visages, each facing a different direction, allowing the vivisectionist to see in every direction at once. A vivisectionist's forged metal faces are often locked in expressions of horror, terror, or agony, as if whoever (or whatever) created them was building a facsimile of a humanoid, but had only ever seen faces expressing these emotions. Every few minutes, the faces rotate positions with a ratcheting sound, but it's unclear why a clockwork vivisectionist does this.",
			"",
			"The clockwork mechanisms within a vivisectionist are noticeably more complex than those of clockwork constructs built by most sages and engineers in the Inner Sea region. Those few scholars who have examined a disassembled vivisectionist have noted the incredibly precise machining of the gears, the astonishing density of the gear trains, and the banks of levers that seem able to store information by locking into countless combinations of positions. It's possible that the information gleaned from their vivisections is stored within these mechanisms for later retrieval by their mysterious creators. Despite this complexity, clockwork vivisectionists have no true intelligence. The emotionless manner in which they carry out their experiments only amplifies the chilling horror of encountering one.",
			"",
			"The key used to wind a clockwork vivisectionist is often difficult to recognize as a key at all. It usually takes an arcane shape and using it may require solving a puzzle of some kind. Examples include a star map cast in bronze that aligns with a star pattern on the clockwork's back (often depicting constellations unrecognizable to denizens of Golarion), a set of independently rotating rings with unfamiliar runes on them that must be inserted into a socket on the clockwork and rotated into the correct alignment, and a complex set of lenses and mirrors that must be correctly focused to shine a beam of light on a particular spot on the clockwork's body.",
			"",
			"Because its singular purpose is to cut open and experiment on still-living creatures, a clockwork vivisectionist employs unusual tactics in combat. Once it has pierced a victim with its scalpel claws and injected him with anesthetic, it drops the paralyzed victim and moves on to another. Only once all enemies are paralyzed or have fled will the vivisectionist begin \"operating,\" keeping each victim paralyzed but alive as long as possible (rarely longer than 1 hour) with regular injections from the bank of fluid-filled syringes in its chest. A victim can continue to attempt DC 16 Fortitude saving throws once per minute to escape the paralysis effect. A victim who escapes or is rescued once this process has begun may suffer from severe mental trauma even after her physical wounds have been healed.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Explorers of the deepest dungeons in Golarion report finding clockwork vivisectionists in isolated chambers surrounded by mutilated corpses that were the result of the vivisectionist's past experiments. This can include entire corpses with the skin removed, organs affixed to walls in careful arrangements, and bizarre sculptures with eerie radial symmetry built from the body parts of multiple victims. Clockwork vivisectionists are often found in areas with connections to Azlant or Thassilon. However, they have also been found in the ruins of Shadun in Qadira, Tumen in Osirion, and in the catacombs of El-Fatar. It is rumored that the Pactmasters of Katapesh maintain a collection of clockwork vivisectionists, their mechanisms wound down and their keys carefully hidden away.",
			"",
			"Though they don't typically remain in one location, instead roaming tombs and dungeons in search of victims for as long as their windings will allow, clockwork vivisectionists often seek out traps, natural locations, or other creatures with daze or stun attacks that might help them to conduct their vivisections. Traps involving azure lily pollen, cytillipedes, Leng ghouls, or tenebrous worms are often found in the same area of a dungeon as a clockwork vivisectionist.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"No one on Golarion has successfully constructed a clockwork vivisectionist in recent memory, or, if they are indeed the work of extraplanar entities, ever. However, arcane academics who have examined partially destroyed vivisectionists have reverse-engineered the process, and it's rumored that the dwarven metalsmiths of Maheto and arcane researchers in Gurat are competing to be the first to build a functioning one.",
			"",
			"Creating these clockworks requires precisely crafted gears and other refined mechanisms, plus various anesthetizing fluids, worth 8,500 gp. However, the process isn't a matter of simply building the mechanisms in the correct shape-some aspect of a clockwork vivisectionist's function remains incomprehensible and alien to beings on the Material Plane, so aspiring clockwork makers must consult with extraplanar powers using contact other plane. One theory suggests that constructing the clockwork near a gate to Leng, or, for the truly adventurous builder, on Leng itself, may increase the chance of successfully creating a functional clockwork vivisectionist.",

			"**Petrification (Su)** A cockatrice's bite causes flesh to calcify and harden-multiple bites can cause a living creature to fossilize into stone. Each time a creature is damaged by a cockatrice's bite attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage as its flesh and bones stiffen and harden. (This slow petrification does not alter a bitten creature's natural armor.) A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a cockatrice's bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)-but after a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources. A cockatrice is immune to the petrification ability of itself and of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"#### Description",

			"Stupid, vicious, and repulsive, cockatrices are avoided by other creatures due to their magical ability to turn flesh to stone. Legends say that the first cockatrice emerged from an egg laid by a cockerel and incubated by a toad. Whether or not the story is true, today's cockatrices breed true in terrifying and filthy dens haphazardly excavated by as many as a dozen of the squawking creatures. Males greatly outnumber females in these flocks, and are distinguished only by their wattles and combs. The typical cockatrice stands just over 2 feet high and weighs 5 pounds.",
			"",
			"While their diet consists primarily of seeds and petrified insects (which conveniently double in the creature's gizzard as both gastroliths and nutrition as they grind away), cockatrices fiercely defend their territories from anything they deem a threat, and the wanderings of rogue males seeking new spots to build dens sometimes bring them into unintentional contact with humanoids, with devastating results.",
			"",
			"The cockatrice's strange ability to turn other creatures to stone is the creature's greatest defense, and a cockatrice lair is invariably littered with petrified remnants of foes. In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets-the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices' nests and consume their eggs-appear to be completely immune to the effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one."

Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-floating, eerie radiance.

Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again. Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable, not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but also by the presence of those the colour has fed on.

As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets. Every 24 hours, a creature suffering from this simple template must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or crumble into fine, white ash-such a doom means instant death and, for many color-blighted creatures, the only chance at escape from a life filled with pain."

			"**Deific (Su)** Conqueror worms can grant divine spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on a conqueror worm's behalf. Conqueror worms grant access to the domains of Charm, Evil, Nobility, and Trickery, and their favored weapon varies but is always a simple weapon (daggers and sickles being the most common choices). Each conqueror worm has its own unique holy symbol, although typically it resembles a ring of eyes.",
			"",
			"**Mental Invader (Su)** A conqueror worm infects the minds of others from afar, allowing it to control its puppets without leaving the safety of the earth's depths. When a conqueror worm communicates with a creature mentally, such as by using telepathy or spells such as dream, it can attempt to form a lasting mental connection with that creature. The target can resist this connection with a successful DC 33 Will save. A target that succeeds at this save is immune to that conqueror worm's mental invader ability forever. Once a connection is formed, the worm can communicate with the bonded creature using telepathy over any distance, and can target the bonded creature with mind-affecting spells and effects regardless of range. A worm can form bonds with a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence modifier (10 for the typical conqueror worm). If a new bond would exceed this limit, the worm must choose to break one of its previous connections. The effects of a bond are suppressed while the worm and the bonded creature are on different planes. A bond can otherwise be broken only via a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell cast on the bonded creature, or by the worm's death. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Escape (Su)** A conqueror worm can escape death by casting its mind out of its body at the moment of death. Up to once per day, when an attack, spell, or effect would reduce a conqueror worm to 0 or fewer hit points or otherwise kill it instantly, it can transfer its mind to one of the creatures it has formed a connection with using its mental invader ability. The target can attempt a DC 33 Will save to resist being overtaken. If the target succeeds, the conqueror worm can be killed normally. If the target fails, the conqueror worm transfers its soul into the bonded creature's body. This functions as the spell possession (CL 21st) except the possession is permanent. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm in this way undergoes terrible changes to its physiology. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. Over time, the host slowly grows more wormlike in appearance, losing body hair, growing obese, and taking on a pale yellow-white coloration. When the host's Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a brand new body as a new conqueror worm that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally). If the host is slain before this transformation completes, the conqueror worm dies as well. The effect can also be ended by any effect that successfully expels the conqueror worm's possessing spirit from the host. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Though conqueror worms resemble immense vermin, those who mistake them for mindless creatures suffer terribly for their mistake. In truth, conqueror worms are creatures of vast intellect and equal depravity. These monstrous beings exist only to rule \"lesser civilizations\" from the shadows, and revel in the complete control of an unknowing society through the remote manipulation of its supposed leaders.",
			"",
			"A conqueror worm prefers to play with its toys before breaking them. To do so, it burrows its way below a target nation's capital. From there, the conqueror worm makes mental contact with the city's leaders, forming sinister psychic connections with those in power. The worm beguiles some of these leaders with promises of wealth or power. Others, the worm controls outright using the considerable psychic magic at its disposal. Regardless, the end result is the same; without intervention, all end up as puppets dancing to the conqueror worm's whims.",
			"",
			"Once a conqueror worm seizes control of a city or nation, that region's downfall can take years, if not decades-for conqueror worms are surprisingly theatrical. A conqueror worm may direct a kingdom's leader to enact cruel or tyrannical laws, only to then use a second puppet to inflame the populace into revolt. Once the fires of revolution die down, the worm might then expose the rebel leader as a traitor or depraved criminal, causing the rebellion to turn on itself and descend again into violence. All the while, the conqueror worm watches in delight at the madness, sin, and horror it inspires in others.",
			"",
			"Eventually a conqueror worm tires of its games, and plots to destroy its subjects. Often it does this by sending its puppets to war against a nearby nation. The horrors of war devastate not only the worm's own populace, but also those of its neighbors, bringing perverse joy to the worm's many hearts. However, a special fate awaits the worm's favorite servants, who are brought down into its subterranean realm so they can glimpse their master's true form before being impaled on the conqueror worm's goreslick jaws. Its work finally finished, the conqueror worm then seeks out a new realm to subjugate.",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most terrifying and peculiar aspect of the conqueror worm is its ability to form cults. Whether through accumulation of psychic power or some hidden divine spark, conqueror worms are capable of granting spells to creatures that worship them. A conqueror worm exploits this ability to attract cultists, which it uses to further its goals in the civilized world above. Although such cults are absolutely loyal to the conqueror worm, which they worship as an all-knowing and all-powerful god, the conqueror worm usually considers its mortal followers expendable.",

			"Once, the entities that would become known as contemplatives were relatively normal humanoids, notable only for their extreme intelligence. At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as telekinesis. Evolution- whether natural or forced by the contemplatives themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank.",
			"",
			"Today, a contemplative's massive brain makes up roughly 80 percent of its body weight. Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities, resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in appearance and demeanor, contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conflict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution.",
			"",
			"A typical contemplative weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 4 feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever it's talking to. When it speaks inside another creature's head, its voice is monotone and seems to come from everywhere at once, and when multiple contemplatives are encountered, they almost always use the pronoun \"we\" rather than the individual \"I.\""

Yet a small subset engaged in daring research into occultism and the Esoteric Planes favor a more reckless approach. The most impressive discoveries of these self-styled \"enlightened\" individuals allow them to transcend the material world's limitations for brief periods of time, much to the chagrin of more conservative contemplatives, who prefer to pursue less radical methods than their peers."

Whatever their source, some imbalances lead to the creation of even greater horrors, like the blighted copsewight.",

As such, they gain no sustenance from the soil or from the creatures they kill. Based on their behavior, copsewights exist for the sole purpose of killing the living and spreading their blight to the rest of the forest.",
			"",
			"A single copsewight can be dangerous to those fooled by its appearance. The creature especially enjoys luring in humanoids, but takes the opportunity to attack animals or other living creatures that threaten it or if there are no preferable targets within range. A copsewight does its best to disguise itself, swaying in the wind to mimic the motions of normal trees.",
			"",
			"When multiple copsewights gather together, they are much more difficult to overcome. The trees conspire to catch victims in the cross fire of their poisonous fruits or to drive targets within reach of each other's grasping limbs.

			"",
			"Scholars believe that the first copsewights may have been intentionally created by some vengeful fey who wanted to punish mortals for allowing a favorite tree or grove of trees to succumb to disease. Proponents of this theory point to the fact that copsewights understand Sylvan, although they cannot speak any languages. Others claim that they are a byproduct of the Abyssal Darkblight ravaging portions of the Fangwood, but the trees move very slowly and have been encountered in places scattered around the Inner Sea region and beyond, suggesting that the Darkblight is not the only source of these creatures. Whatever their original source, most copsewights now seem to arise spontaneously, especially when diseased trees die within an area contaminated by fell magic.",

The ruin has a reputation as a lure for undead, who seem to be answering a call that only they can hear.

			"Coral capuchins live in tropical coastal areas, generally in small familial groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older matriarch (see below). Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often befriended by sailors and fishers willing to put up with the creatures' incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They can be trained to fish for their allies and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other seafaring folk who more willingly accept their thieving nature.",
			"",
			"Despite their mercurial temperaments and propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the creatures' exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. Spellcasters of 3rd level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.",

A coral capuchin matriarch has a Charisma score of 15, and most are 2nd- to 5th-level oracles. These matriarchs can never serve as familiars."

			"An ambush predator that conceals itself among tall trees, corbayrants are bizarre amalgamations of insect and plant. Appearing somewhat like an oversized scorpion with barbed spines in place of claws, corbayrants have an exoskeleton made of thick layers of bark and moss. With their segmented limbs fully extended, their legs resemble tree trunks and their mossy underside blends in with the forest canopy.

Corbayrants lack eyes, but they perceive their surroundings through a combination of sound and changes in air pressure.",
			"",
			"A corbayrant's spiny forelegs deliver a magical paralytic toxin that causes afflicted victims to sprout barbs that can transmit the paralysis to others. A corbayrant rarely waits for this paralysis to run its course, as it prefers to snatch up paralyzed victims in its large quadrisecting mouth and swallow them whole. The creature's abdomen contains sharp thorns that exude the same paralytic toxin as its spines, which keep its prey immobile while it is being digested.",

During the Age of Anguish, when gnomes fled to Golarion from the First World, the corbayrants followed. History is unclear as to whether the Green Mother dispatched her corbayrants to hunt the fleeing gnomes, or whether the beasts were also refugees. In any case, the Eldest took steps to ensure that her hunters would remain on Golarion to spread chaos, severing their connection to the First World. Corbayrants spread throughout the forests of Avistan- and particularly throughout the vast Verduran Forest- gleefully preying upon travelers and sating their monstrous appetites. Patient and watchful, corbayrants can remain hidden for days or even months, waiting for the perfect time to strike at prey. Despite their exile, corbayrants retain many features that demonstrate their otherworldly origin, including a magical paralytic toxin, a whimsical and cruel demeanor, and a life span so long as to make them essentially ageless.",
			"",
			"The corbayrants' depredations continued until the march of Taldor's First Army of Exploration. Pushing northward through the Verduran Forest, the armies not only annexed humanoid realms but also vanquished monsters that endangered Taldan civilization. Units of elite monster-hunters cornered and killed several corbayrants, driving the most powerful and cunning survivors deep into hiding. As millennia went by, the reclusive beasts became little more than legend, although many still prey upon animals and daring travelers who penetrate their remote forest lairs.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Corbayrants are incredibly rare, and those few that survived into the modern day are crafty and careful. Daring monster-hunters occasionally venture into their forests to learn whether rumors of surviving corbayrants are true; these brave warriors generally seek the glory from vanquishing such a legendary foe or wish to acquire a corbayrant's rare and valuable toxins. A few druidic cabals know that corbayrants exist, but they give the creatures a wide berth and steer others well away from the monsters' hunting grounds to avoid triggering a corbayrant's capricious wrath.",
			"",
			"Corbayrants dislike the company of others of their kind; they see other corbayrants as competitors and reminders of the days when they were hunted. Corbayrants can't reproduce outside of the First World and therefore can't expand their species, although some corbayrants are independently investigating magical methods of propagation that involve bizarre rituals and bloody sacrifices of fey creatures.",
			"",
			"A corbayrant's strange biology is dramatically impacted by cold environments, making it sluggish and irritable. Cold damage causes its flesh to degenerate with surprising speed, and the touch of even a single snowflake causes it excruciating agony. Although corbayrants are reluctant to relocate from their established hunting grounds, prolonged periods of cold weather usually compel them to seek warmer territory. A rare few corbayrants have adapted to other habitats, lurking in warm, fetid marshes or amid desert oases."

Its lower jaw folds under its head as the cordulegaster rests, cupping over the mandibles like a mask of interlocking, irregular teeth.

			"Auwaz couatls are a variety of couatl known for helping those who are lost find their way back to safety. They are particularly known for traveling around the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls are the most commonly known couatls across Golarion, at least among those people who live near coasts. An auwaz couatl's scales are a light gray with subtle light blue and green markings. Their feathers are typically blue and green, with hints of light yellow reminiscent of the sun. The coloring resembles the waters of the oceans, and the exact coloring of an auwaz couatl tends to vary depending on which body of water the couatl frequents-each major sea and ocean seems to have its own distinct auwaz markings and colorations. The sound of an auwaz couatl's wings resembles that of a gentle ocean breeze. This makes it hard to detect their approach, and many sailors tend to utter short blessings whenever they encounter a calm, compliant breeze, just in case an auwaz couatl is nearby.",
			"",
			"Each auwaz couatl knows the location of every settlement on the edge of its waters and is happy to share this knowledge with those it views favorably. Those who draw an auwaz couatl's suspicion sometimes receive inaccurate knowledge, ending up at a settlement a few hundred miles away from their intended destination. An auwaz couatl usually gives this misinformation to allow it time to follow the travelers and determine whether they are dangerous, correcting its original directions only if the travelers appear to be good-hearted. When dealing with evil travelers, an auwaz couatl usually points them toward subtle dangers such as troubled waters, reefs, and other oceanic dangers. The creature won't follow these travelers and is content with letting the ocean determine their fates.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls have moderate control over the weather, calling forth winds and storms as they feel necessary. They use this power to aid the travel of those they are guiding home, summoning strong winds to make the journeys of sailing ships shorter. Similarly, if an auwaz couatl encounters a sinking ship, it uses its powers to grant survivors the ability to breathe water and personally guides these victims to safety. This power also allows an auwaz couatl to work against evil travelers, making their journeys difficult and even calling on lightning storms to strike ships when necessary.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls have the shortest lives of all couatls, living only about a century at most, and most have life spans equivalent to those of humans. Due to their flighty nature, they rarely take the time to meet with others of their kind, though they do gather once every few years to reproduce, laying several eggs each. Its uncertain how auwaz couatls know the exact time to gather, though many believe they read a message in the stars left behind by their cousins, the [mix couatls](monster/mix_couatl).",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls live roving, independent lives that allow them to travel all across Golarion. Although most auwaz couatls live near the seas and oceans of Golarion, some prefer to stay inland and help those lost in forests or mountains. An auwaz couatl typically sticks to its home in its younger years, but it eventually travels the world through its adult life before returning. Auwaz couatls tend to avoid each other and keep out of each other's affairs, except in times of peril. In these cases, an auwaz couatl uses a particular call, perceptible only to other couatls, to warn of danger. During these fraught times, auwaz couatls travel in packs, especially to protect the younger members of their kind.",
			"",
			"As they are generally good-natured and curious, many auwaz couatls take time to speak with any travelers they find, often flying above ships and conversing with those on board. These conversations usually involve current events, as auwaz couatls prefer to keep updated so as to not send travelers to dangerous locales, but they can also include artistic and philosophical discussions. Some auwaz couatls are quite fond of humorous stories and like to spend hours telling such tales, especially if there are children among the travelers. The sight of an auwaz couatl above a ship serves as a signal to others that the ship is protected, so many ships fly kites in the shape of auwaz couatls in hopes of giving marauders pause.",
			"",
			"Auwaz couatls are particularly fond of children, as they find kinship in their innocence. They are more than happy to comfort distressed children and guide them home. In particularly dire situations, or ones where a child may be too far from home to safely travel, an auwaz couatl will carry the child on its back and fly it to safety. An auwaz couatl typically has a different approach with children who have run away from home; the auwaz couatl takes time to speak with the child and learn her reasons for running away. In some cases, the child seeks to escape a troubled life and the auwaz couatl helps guide the child to a new home. In other cases, the auwaz couatl convinces the child to return home but encourages her to cultivate the wanderlust in her heart. Such children tend to grow into adventurers and travel the world years later."

			"Chicomes are a powerful but gentle variety of couatl- winged serpentine outsiders who act as agents of lawful good deities-whose purpose is to reestablish nature in destroyed and ravaged lands, especially those that have been recently cleansed of evil. Chicomes accomplish this by way of powerful druidic magic and the cloud of restorative pollen and dew that constantly drifts from their wings. Like other couatls, chicomes have varicolored feathers and beautiful, glossy scales. The couatls' wing feathers are typically shades of green or brown, but their crests are always a brilliant crimson. Like for other couatls, the feathers of chicomes are incredibly powerful magic items when bestowed upon chosen mortals. Such a freely given feather can be used as the material component for a [planar ally](spell/planar_ally) spell. In addition, if buried in at least 6 inches of soil and undisturbed for 24 hours, the feather can be used as the material component to cast a [hallow](spell/hallow) spell; the spell effect tied to the hallowed site is always the enrichment version of [plant growth](spell/plant_growth). By using a chicome feather in this way, the caster need not expend the typical payment of gold or other valuables required by the spell.",
			"",
			"A typical chicome is 40 feet long with a wingspan of 30 feet and weighs 5,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Chicomes typically show themselves only in the aftermath of an incredible act of devastation or widespread destruction, such as a massive battle or the razing of a large settlement, and even then only if the couatl deems the area in question worthy of being restored. Their exact criteria for worthy lands are unclear; what is known is that badlands chosen by one of these blessed sky serpents are enormously enriched by the outsider's presence. When a chicome restores the balance of nature to a ruined area, it cleanses the land of any residual toxins and contagions, such as contaminated earth or water, and plants the seeds of new life. If the restoration of healthy biomes is not enough to draw nearby wildlife back to the region- or if all the local fauna has been exhausted-the couatl uses its magic to coax animals from other corners of the world to the fledgling environment.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Chicomes are strictly solitary creatures who dwell in the lands that need their help. While they are purifying a particular region, chicomes periodically take flight to survey the area and determine whether their presence is still justified. The couatls also scout for worthy guardians in the vicinity to take over stewardship-typically a powerful awakened animal, but sometimes a nemophilist in a nearby settlement. These individuals typically become druids who learn their abilities from the chicome, though anyone the couatl deems worthy may serve as a steward of such lands, regardless of the individual's magical prowess. Those who have received a chicome's blessing are sometimes referred to as Children of the Chicome. If ever one such steward is slain while protecting her pocket of wilderness, her host chicome will return its child to life using its powers of reincarnation. The steward is typically reborn as the animal it most identified with in life.",
			"",
			"Though they may serve a range of lawful and good deities, chicomes are typically agents of those gods with an aspect of nature or life, such as [Erastil](faith/erastil) or Cihua Couatl, or empyreal lords like [Cernunnos](faith/cernunnos) or [Valani](faith/valani). Some chicomes may even serve neutral-aligned deities such as [Gozreh](faith/gozreh) or [Feronia](faith/feronia). Chicomes never serve deities, no matter how noble, whose portfolio includes the destruction of nature or the spread of civilization, such as [Torag](faith/torag). Many chicomes serve no deities at all and are dedicated only to the primordial forces of nature."

			"Lord Sun-Warrior acts independently of any deity, though he maintains positive relations with all of the good-aligned ones.

He is aided in his efforts by his champion, Jua Mfuasi (LG male human paladin of Iomedae 10), who was once a necromancer known as the Corpse-King until he was killed and returned to life by Sun-Warrior, after which he renounced his evil ways and abandoned arcane magic to become a paladin."

Many who know of mix couatls or recognize this sound claim that the noise is very calming, as it is both a reminder of relaxing summer rains and of the couatls' protection.",
			"",
			"Each mix couatl is gifted with the knowledge of the rest of its brothers and sisters, though it does not have access to this knowledge on an individual basis. Instead, a mix couatl can call upon bits of knowledge to share with others, much as one might pluck a star from the night sky. The mix couatl can bless an individual with this knowledge, even though the couatl itself may not know the full details of the gift it grants. This shared knowledge allows mix couatls to work together and aid each other even if they never meet face to face, a lesson that they also teach to others. Individual mix couatls may have different skills from those listed above, depending on their own experience and expertise.",
			"",
			"Mix couatls are among the couatls with the longest life spans. Though they don't live as long as [xiuh couatls](monster/xiuh_couatl), their legacy can live on for centuries thanks to the knowledge they share with others. When a mix couatl reaches the final years of its life, it lays a small clutch of eggs, which typically hatch up to half a dozen couatls.",
			"",
			"Although they are more than capable hunters on their own, many mix couatls have grown accustomed to receiving gifts of fruit, vegetables, and livestock from the first harvests of a settlement. As such, many stories state that earning a mix couatl's favor requires a single sweet fruit.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Mix couatls find their own kind somewhat abrasive. Every mix couatl has its own belief as to what a settlement requires, and many mix couatls find themselves disagreeing with their kin on such matters. They each mark the settlements they are aiding by marking them with starlike beacons, and keep away from each others' territory to avoid bickering.",
			"",
			"When assisting a settlement, a mix couatl tends to share knowledge about the natural world to assist with farming and hunting methods. Thanks to this knowledge, many see mix couatls as demigods of the hunt. Some claim that mix couatls were present during the early days of Golarion to help guide humanity by providing knowledge of fire and magic. With this knowledge, the first humans were able to learn how to make war, so some humans also consider mix couatls to be demigods of war-a reputation mix couatls have worked hard to escape in the millennia since.",
			"",
			"Although they are altruistic as a whole, mix couatls are known for having fun with their duties, often sharing less relevant or risky knowledge to shake up the growth of a settlement. Many tales tell of mix couatls teaching small children about magic or places that then cause trouble for a settlement. In the end, most settlements find that these challenges teach great lessons and use this valuable knowledge to improve their settlements in unexpected ways.",
			"",
			"Mix couatls commonly return to the sites of settlements they have helped nurture over the span of multiple generations-each new generation hears tales of beautiful flying serpents made of stars and considers it a great blessing to see this creature once more. Only on rare occasions does a mix couatl abandon a settlement. This usually happens when the mix couatl recognizes that its attempts to improve the settlement may actually be harmful, whether due to a potential loss of important traditions or when the possibility of growth could expose the settlement to great dangers from the outside world."

Fire damage dealt by a tletli is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",

These divine spells are considered arcane spells for the tletli, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.",
			"",
			"**Stoke Flames (Ex)** Once per round when a tletli attacks with its wings, it can cause areas of active fire within 30 feet to spread as a free action. An affected 5-foot square of fire spreads to one adjacent square that is not on fire, possibly burning objects or creatures in that space. The tletli determines which adjacent squares are set on fire.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Of all the couatls, tletlis are among the most vengeful and easily the most actively destructive, channeling their righteous fury to rid Golarion of large swaths of evildoers. While some couatls may offer redemption to evil individuals, a tletli withholds salvation and exacts punishment on whole sects of people whose crimes they deem warrant oblivion. Tletlis do not hunt down individuals, instead targeting gangs, corrupt governments, and even entire settlements that they believe have fallen beyond redemption.",
			"",
			"The tletli is a terrifying sight to behold. Its wings are continually shrouded in flame, ranging from warm orange at the base to hot blue at the tips, causing the air around the couatl to radiate with an ominous light best described as apocalyptic. Further magnifying the effect, the beast's opalescent scales seem to reflect a divine light. A typical tletli is 35 long with a wingspan of 25 feet. It is one of the heaviest couatls, weighing nearly 6,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The tletli has a unique connection to the powers of the firmament, even compared to other couatls. The divine intensity of a tletli's fire is so great that it can penetrate the defenses of even creatures made from flame, and its conflagration is infused with holy power that can wreak devastation among evil outsiders, dragons, and undead.",
			"",
			"Tletlis rarely gift their sacred feathers to mortals, but when they do it is a true honor, and one that bestows great power upon the recipient of the holy item. A tletli's freely given feather acts in all ways as a [couatl's](monster/couatl) feather, allowing a spellcaster to use it as an additional material component to cast [planar ally](spell/planar_ally) to conjure that specific tletli without expending the typical payment of gold or other valuables-provided the tletli approves of the service asked for by the spellcaster. Alternatively, a tletli's feather can be used as an additional material component while casting any damage-dealing spell with the fire descriptor; in this case, the spell gains the benefits of the [Maximize Spell](feat/maximize_spell) metamagic feat, and the spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A tletli appears only as a last resort, when a particular settlement or area has become filled with irredeemably evil individuals. Ghost towns overrun with undead, blighted forests plagued by evil fey, and interplanar portals that act as gateways for devils or demons are all likely targets for a tletli's wrath. In addition to their worship of righteous deities such as [Sarenrae](faith/sarenrae) and [Torag](faith/torag), tletlis serve a disproportionate number of empyreal lords, enacting swift justice on behalf of mighty angels and archons like [Ragathiel](faith/ragathiel), [Olheon](faith/olheon), and [Damerrich](faith/damerrich). Like their masters, they assume the role of divine executioners, meting out the most extreme discipline possible to agents of vileness.",
			"",
			"Although tletlis are near legendary in terms of their scarcity, those who recognize these massive creatures for what they are quickly understand the destruction soon to come. Legend tells that tletlis were more prominent on Golarion shortly after Earthfall as they worked to fight the evils that arose during the Age of Darkness.",
			"",
			"If and when a tletli is called upon to obliterate an irredeemable region, the couatl enlists mortals to aid its efforts, typically in the form of envoys and delegates who extend a final chance for redemption to the sinners in question. A tletli's prerogative, however, is punishment, not mercy, and woe be unto any who cavort with the wrong kind of company at the wrong time in a tletli's presence. If there are genuine innocents within a group or settlement on which the tletli has set its sights, the couatl may send an emissary, such as a charmed person, to forewarn the pure of heart, but it otherwise does not hesitate to incinerate the entire locale. Their deific masters understand tletlis' unrivaled propensity for holy retribution all too well, and they typically send other couatls or celestials like angels to accompany the tletlis in case there are a number of individuals in a settlement that should be evacuated or protected during the razing."

Those who do not accept this offer or cannot be redeemed face the xiuh couatl's fearsome and absolute punishment. In cases where its might alone is not enough, a xiuh couatl offers its assistance to a powerful, righteous figure to mete out justice on its behalf. The winged serpents glow with an intense plume of flames, draped in arcing electricity. Their feathers range in color from bright crimson to deep violet, encompassing the shades of the setting sun. A typical xiuh couatl is 20 feet long with a wingspan of 25 feet. It weighs 4,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Unlike their cousins, the common quetz couatl and the roving auwaz couatl, xiuh couatls are rarely seen, but are a sight to behold when they make themselves known. The beat of each wing is a brilliant display of terrifying flames and magnificent flashes of lightning that send cacophonous echoes through the sky. The couatls' flight can be heard up to a mile away. As they move through the air, they resemble thunderstorms with flaming rain. These fiery tempests are said to be omens signaling the imminent fall of wickedness or a forthcoming new beginning, born of a purifying inferno.",
			"",
			"A xiuh couatl's snout glows red hot for minutes after spewing forth its elemental breath. This breath, like the xiuh couatl's wings, is a coalescence of fire and electricity-a fearsome ray of powerful energy. The breath is used not only to attack enemies, but also to burn away decayed or corrupted lands with cleansing flame. The couatl's tail ends in a small conflagration that moves and flickers in response to the couatl's moods.",
			"",
			"The mind of a xiuh couatl is powerful and wise, bordering on the transcendent. It uses its extraordinary psychic gifts to track down evil foes, making use of its ability to see into possible futures to quickly find its targets. Once it locates a creature, the xiuh couatl sends portents to the target's dreams to dissuade it from a life of evil. If these visions are not enough, a xiuh couatl visits the creature and offers to share its knowledge of goodness and virtue. The xiuh couatl shows the creature the differences in its life if it continues on a path of evildoing and if it accepts redemption. If these steps fail, the xiuh couatl destroys the creature's body or its mind, whichever is found to be a more fitting punishment, as a last resort.",
			"",
			"Xiuh couatls are extremely long-lived, with some said to have been alive before Earthfall. During its lifetime, a female xiuh couatl lays only a single egg. The egg is as black as ash and hatches anywhere from a single couatl to a litter of eight to 10. As native outsiders, xiuh couatls must eat, and they are known to feed on large wildlife such as bison, deer, or wild horses. Occasionally, they consume larger creatures that pose threats to local civilizations or environments, such as rocs or young dragons.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Unlike their more common cousins, xiuh couatls are seen only during the gravest of times. When not actively seeking foul creatures to redeem, they nest in dangerous, remote places where they are likely to be undisturbed. Volcanic calderas, remote valleys, and high mountaintops wrapped in continual lightning storms are notable locations where xiuh couatl nests have been found. For years after they have been abandoned, the nests are known for their tendency to attract fire and lightning elementals. Xiuh couatls and their nests are extremely rare in Avistan, but are more frequently found in central and southern Garund and the mountains of central Arcadia.",
			"",
			"While solitary creatures, xiuh couatls occasionally form a close bond with a partner with whom they may even mate (should they have not done so previously in their long lifetimes). The closest of these relationships are forged between a couatl and one of the offspring born from its sole egg. While a parent cannot mate again, such a bond is universally platonic and can span centuries, far longer than most similar pairings. While a partnership may last as long as a millennia, nearly all xiuh couatls eventually return to lives of solitude. They can acquire many allies during a crusade for good, but move on as soon as they have vanquished a particular evil.",
			"",
			"Though they tend to rely on their own visions and divinations to seek out evil, xiuh couatls are sometimes called on by the gods to tackle given tasks. Sarenrae, in particular, makes the most of use of all types of couatls, but xiuh couatls can be called upon by Desna, Shelyn, or, in Arcadia, Kazutal, goddess of community, liberty, and safety. As usual, xiuh couatls first attempt to redeem the creatures they are tasked with destroying, but follow with violent retribution if required. Gods may also assign xiuh couatls to aid individuals who require assistance in times of adversity. These individuals are gifted weapons by their divine patrons, and may never know they actually wield xiuh couatls, even after their tasks have been completed."

This crocodilian possesses a shorter, rounder snout than the typical crocodile, and thus resembles a giant alligator. A patient hunter, the deinosuchus is all but invisible beneath the surface of the water. Only its nostrils breach the water's surface, allowing the rest of its formidable mass to remain out of sight from even highly perceptive prey.",
			"",
			"In combat, the deinosuchus grinds its prey between its powerful jaws, knocking back other foes with its formidable tail while it snaps bones and tears the flesh of its captured meal."

Adult saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths upward of 20 feet and weights of over 2,000 pounds, and are typically more lethargic than their smaller kin, spending their days sunning themselves on land or in shallow water and hunting at night."
