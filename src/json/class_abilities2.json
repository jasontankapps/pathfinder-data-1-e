			"Each animal companion has different starting sizes, speed, attacks, ability scores, and special qualities. All animal attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Animal attacks add the animal's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 its Strength modifier. Some have special abilities, such as [scent](umr/scent). As you gain levels, your animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or 7th level, in addition to the standard bonuses noted on **the [Animal Companion](sidekick/animal_companion) page.** Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Dexterity and Constitution by 2.",

The Monstrous Mount Choices section below details monsters that are ridden primarily by cavaliers, rangers, and paladins. Taking on a monstrous mount requires [a feat](feat/monstrous_mount), but otherwise uses the rules for the animal companion class feature. Unlocking the most useful abilities and powerful attacks of a monstrous mount requires [a second feat](feat/monstrous_mount_mastery).",

All plant companion attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Plant companion attacks add the plant's Strength modifier on the damage roll, unless it has only one attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent. Plant companions can't gain armor or weapon proficiency feats even as they advance in Hit Dice, and they can't use manufactured weapons at all unless their description says otherwise.",

			"**Mindless:** Vermin companions have no Intelligence score and possess the mindless trait. In spite of this, vermin companions may learn one trick, plus additional bonus tricks. If a vermin animal companion gains an ability score increase (at 4 Hit Dice, 8 Hit Dice, and so on), the druid can apply this increase to the companion's Intelligence, changing it from - to 1, at which point the companion loses the mindless quality and is able to know up to 3 tricks per point of Intelligence, plus the additional bonus tricks. Vermin companions have no skill points or feats as long as they have the mindless quality.",

Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal.

The eidolon can expose a creature to its disease no more than once per round. By spending 2 additional evolution points, you can instead choose the following additional diseases: demon fever (only if the eidolon has the demon subtype), devil chills (only if the eidolon has the devil subtype), or slimy doom. *Requirements:* Aberrant, daemon, demon, or devil subtype or the undead appearance evolution; summoner level 7th.",

The eidolon heals 1 point of damage per round, just like via natural healing. Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner.

			"## Exploits of the Outer Rifts",
			"",
			"**Source** [Horror Realms pg. 6](source/horror_realms)",
			"",
			"Arcanists experiment with ancient knowledge and mystic lore, manipulating their own natural abilities to unlock powerful arcane secrets.Despite extensive effort, not all arcanists achieve the power they seek. Some discover that their blood lacks the innate power of a sorcerer's, or that deciphering mysteries in ancient tomes requires a degree of scholarly discipline they do not have. Undeterred, such individuals continue their quest by turning to the powerful mysteries of the Outer Rifts, be they blasphemous secrets found in lost ruins, tricks of magic etched into fiendish runestones, or any other dangerous form of sinister exploitation from these horrific realms.Not all arcanists who choose this route are necessarily evil-they justify these exploits by claiming to be in control of their actions and to use the tools of their enemies against them. Nevertheless, those who bend magic using exploits from the Outer Rifts should be wary of attracting the wrong attention or enabling a greater evil than that which they seek to defeat.",
			"",
			"All of the following exploits can be learned by arcanists of any alignment, but these exploits come with a risk. If you use an Outer Rift exploit and in doing so reduce your arcane reservoir to 0, you immediately gain the stain of one manifestation from the accursed, demonic, hellbound, or possessed corruption. The GM chooses which corruption, manifestation, and stain you receive; this stain persists for 24 hours. Reducing your arcane reservoir to 0 in this way multiple times within a 24-hour period results in a new stain for each such instance, and each time you do so you reset the timer for all stains gained in this manner to 24 hours. At the GM's option, multiple instances of abusing exploits in this manner could result in a permanent corruption, but otherwise these corruptions are temporary and do not progress.You can never gain a gift from a corruption in this way.",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist's exploit equals 10 + 1/2 the arcanist's class level + the arcanist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"### Blood Tears (Su)",
			"",
			"As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During this time, the arcanist's vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that creature does not gain concealment against him. At a distance of greater than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand, splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn't wipe his bleeding tears away, the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of 1 minute per arcanist level.",
			"",
			"### Damnation Susurrus (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to manifest a choir of insidious whispers, which echo in the mind of a single target within 30 feet, urging the target to harm itself. A creature that fails a Will save to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level. Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"### Fiendish Proboscis (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist's face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit's effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis's tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target's magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target's life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target's ability to use magic, the tongue's unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.",
			"",
			"### Rift Fog (Su)",
			"",
			"As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog's supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the [slow](spell/slow) spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.",
			"",
			"### Shadows out of Light (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to pull fiendish essence from the Outer Rifts into his own shadow. Malformed and nearly amorphous, the shadow-things swarm across his body, turning his eyes completely black and distorting his physical form. These shadows persist for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round) and grant the arcanist a +2 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. The shadows are threatening, and as long as they persist the arcanist is considered armed for the purpose of flanking or threatening an attack of opportunity. Whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the arcanist, he may make the attack of opportunity with his shadow, striking as a touch attack that deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier plus 1 point of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage. This ability does not itself increase the number of attacks of opportunity the arcanist can make in a round, but feats like [Combat Reflexes](feat/combat_reflexes) do allow him to make multiple attacks of opportunity with his shadow. The shadows cannot be compelled to make normal attacks-they lash out in this way only as a reaction to being provoked.",
			"",
			"### Soulrider (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a \"soulrider.\" The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target's subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell's effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell's effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. [Detect magic](spell/detect_magic) and [detect evil](spell/detect_evil) can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of [status](spell/status), and the creature takes a -2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per [sending](spell/sending). Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"### Tentacles (Su)",
			"",
			"As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist's size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist's Strength score. The arcanist's reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach."

He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.",
			"",
			"**Awakened Intellect** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's constant exposure to strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently increases by 2 points.",
			"",
			"**Change Alignment, Greater (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): The effects of the alchemist's change alignment infusion become permanent and can only be reversed by a [wish](spell/wish) or [miracle](spell/miracle). A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Youth** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores from advanced age. If the alchemist is already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.",

			"**Abominate (Sp)** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 28](source/magical_marketplace)): The witch transforms a creature within 30 feet into an aberration. This hex acts as baleful polymorph, except the target is transmuted into a Small, Medium, or Large aberration. The target's abilities are modified as monstrous physique IV. Whether or not its save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Animal Servant (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can use this hex to turn a humanoid enemy into an animal and rob it of its free will. The transformation works as [beast shape II](spell/beast_shape_2) and is negated by a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its mind. This effect functions as [dominate monster](spell/dominate_monster), except the creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the hex. The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch also ends the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Curse of Nonviolence (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch can curse a creature to prevent it from attacking innocents. If the target fails its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than itself. If another creature takes hostile action against the cursed creature, the cursed creature can act normally in regard to that creature only. This is an abjuration effect. The curse is permanent but can be removed with a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Curse (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Interrupted (Su)** ([Healer's Handbook pg. 17](source/healer's_handbook)): A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature's soul from the River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual resurrection. In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally's soul must be free and willing to return at the witch's behest. When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Dire Prophecy (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty equal to the witch's caster level to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Slumber (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch can touch a creature, causing it to drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed with a wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Forced Reincarnation (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately reincarnated into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell reincarnate. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Lay to Rest (Sp)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch may target a single undead creature with this hex as if with an undeath to death spell. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Life Giver (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): Once per day the witch can, as a full round action, touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This functions as resurrection, but it does not require a material component.",
			"",
			"**Natural Disaster (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a storm of vengeance combined with an earthquake that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per day.",
			"",
			"**Summon Spirit (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 83](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Hut (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 83](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as \"follow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."

Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Deadeye (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger's Dodge (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.",
			"",
			"**Quick Clear (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger Initiative (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the [Quick Draw](feat/quick_draw) feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.",
			"",
			"**Pistol-Whip (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/&times;2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.",
			"",
			"**Utility Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.",
			"",
			"- Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.",
			"- Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.",
			"- Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Dead Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.",
			"",
			"**Startling Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.",
			"",
			"**Targeting (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.",
			"",
			"- Arms: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.",
			"- Head: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Legs: On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.",
			"- Torso: Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20.",
			"- Wings: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.",
			"",
			"### 11th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Wound (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",
			"",
			"**Expert Loading (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.",
			"",
			"**Lightning Reload (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If she has the [Rapid Reload](feat/rapid_reload) feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",

			"### 15th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Evasive (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.",
			"",
			"**Menacing Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"**Slinger's Luck (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed's cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.",
			"",
			"### 19th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Cheat Death (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Death's Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a killing blow.",
			"",
			"**Stunning Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect."

The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it's confused in this way, during any round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature's confusion result is 76-100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned it (attacking the hexer's enemies or performing such other tasks that the hexer can communicate to it).

If the effect is created by magic, the witch can see up to 15 feet without penalty, with normal penalties and effects applying beyond that distance.

The witch can withdraw this hex from a target as a move action at any range.

The effect lasts for 1 round, but the witch can extend this effect for 1 additional round (up to a total number of rounds equal to her class level) by taking a standard action to continue her enthralling movements.

The damage is bludgeoning damage, and if the colliding foe has any natural attacks, the damage is also considered magic, evil, or any other type of damage the natural attack deals.

			"If an inquisition's granted power calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier. Unless otherwise stated, the caster level for granted power spell-like abilities is equal to the inquisitor's class level.",
			"",
			"Inquisitions are intended for inquisitors, not for other classes that give access to domains. While a cleric or other domain-using class can select an inquisition in place of a domain (if appropriate to the character's deity), inquisitions do not grant domain spell slots or domain spells, and therefore are much weaker choices for those classes. These other classes use the appropriate class level as their inquisitor level for the purpose of inquisition granted powers (clerics use their cleric level as their inquisitor level, and so on).",

This talent has no effect on creatures that do not rely on eyes for sight or creatures with more than two eyes (although multiple critical hits might cause blindness, at the GM's discretion). Blindness can be cured by heal, regeneration, remove blindness, or similar abilities. An investigator must be at least 17th level to select this talent.",

			"**Domino Effect&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Origins pg. 15](source/advanced_class_origins)): When the investigator uses studied strike, he uses his opponents against each other and sets himself up for his next move.

An investigator must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",

			"**Iconclastic Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 31](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): When the investigator deals damage with a studied strike, she can perform a sunder combat maneuver as a free action against the creature the studied strike damaged. If the object targeted is a holy symbol or divine scroll, this sunder does not provoke attacks of opportunity and deals maximum damage on a successful check. An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Numerical Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Disciple's Doctrine pg. 17](source/disciple's_doctrine)): Once per day when the investigator has confirmed a critical hit with a studied strike, he can deal average damage instead of rolling damage as normal. This includes the damage dealt by the successful attack as well as the additional damage from the studied strike. He can expend a use of inspiration to use this ability a second time per day.

			"**Prolonged Study&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Origins pg. 15](source/advanced_class_origins)): The investigator can study his opponents for long periods of time. The effects of his studied combat ability last for a number of rounds equal to twice his Intelligence modifier (minimum 2) or until he deals damage with a studied strike, whichever comes first.

			"",
			"**Repositioning Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a reposition combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike.

A slowed opponent's movement speeds are each reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet) until the creature is healed through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage or with a successful DC 15 Heal check. Multiple slowing strikes stack, to a minimum of 5 feet. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Stealing Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a steal combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike. This steal does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be at least 13th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Timed Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Origins pg. 15](source/advanced_class_origins)): The longer the investigator studies his opponent, the greater the damage he ultimately deals with his studied strike. When the investigator makes a studied strike, he deal a number of points of additional damage equal to the number of consecutive rounds he studied the target with studied combat.",
			"",
			"**Toppling Strike&ast; (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): When the investigator deals damage with studied strike, he can perform a trip combat maneuver as a free action against the creature damaged by studied strike. This trip does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An investigator must be at least 9th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Twilight Talon Improvisation&ast; (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 31](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): Whenever the investigator deals studied strike damage with an improvised weapon, she can perform a dirty trick combat maneuver targeting that foe as a free action. This combat maneuver provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless the investigator has a feat or other ability to prevent it.",
			"",
			"**Alchemist Discovery (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): The investigator can select one of the following [alchemist discoveries](ability/discoveries) as an investigator talent: combine extracts, concentrate poison, dilution, elixir of life, enhance potion, eternal potion, extend potion, infusion, mutagen, and poison conversion. He can also choose to learn an [annointing](ability/annointings), instead. When selecting an alchemist discovery or annointing, he must be high enough level to qualify for it, using his investigator level as his alchemist level to determine if he qualifies. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time grants a new alchemist discovery.",
			"",
			"**Amazing Inspiration (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): When using inspiration, the investigator rolls a d8 instead of a d6. At 20th level, the investigator rolls 2d8 and adds both dice to the result. An investigator must be at least 7th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Anathema (Ex)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 15](source/potions_and_poisons)): When an investigator creates or prepares a poison, including poisons derived from racial or class abilities, he can spend one use of inspiration to create an anathema instead. Anathemas count as poisons, but they can affect creatures that are normally immune to poison, as they exploit vulnerabilities in their very nature rather than their biology. When an anathema is created, select a creature type (and subtype, if applicable) from the ranger favored enemy list; the anathema functions only against this chosen type. The investigator also chooses one of the following special abilities for the anathema to affect: damage reduction (except DR/-), energy resistance (one type chosen by the investigator), fast healing, movement speed, or spell resistance.",
			"",
			"The method of delivery (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) and the DC of the anathema's save are identical to those of the poison used to make the anathema. If the target fails its save against the anathema (even if the enemy is normally immune to effects that require a specific save, such as undead's immunity to effects that require a Fortitude save), the value of the chosen ability is lowered by 5 (minimum 0) for 1 round per investigator level.",
			"",
			"**Applied Engineering (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Origins pg. 15](source/advanced_class_origins)): The investigator can leverage his knowledge of engineering to solve tasks that normally require brute strength or keen eyes. He can expend one use of inspiration as a full-round action to study an object or area and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check. On his next turn, he can use the result of that Knowledge (engineering) check in place of a Strength check to break the object or in place of a Perception check to locate hidden doors or compartments in that area.",
			"",
			"**Atheist Inspiration (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 31](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): The investigator can use her inspiration on saving throws against divine spells without expending uses of inspiration. This talent counts as the Divine Defiance feat for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of other feats.",
			"",
			"**Castling (Ex)** ([Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9](source/elemental_master's_handbook)): The investigator treats soft cover granted by creatures of her size or larger as though it were cover instead. Cover the investigator gains from this talent does not allow her to attempt Stealth checks.",
			"",
			"**Chronicler's Insight** ([Adventurer's Guide pg. 146](source/adventurer's_guide)): The investigator can peruse a Pathfinder Chronicle as a standard action, applying its benefits as though he had studied it for the full 1d4 rounds. Upon studying a Pathfinder Chronicle, the investigator can expend one use of inspiration to apply the volume's benefits for a number of hours equal to his Intelligence modifier and gain an additional benefit based on the volume's associated Knowledge skill during that time.

			"**Ki Guardian (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As an immediate action before he rolls a saving throw against a targeted effect that also targets other allies or an area effect whose area includes other allies, a monk with this ability can spend any number of ki points and designate a number of adjacent allies equal to the number of ki points spent. The monk rolls one saving throw for each designated ally, using his bonus instead of the ally's. For each successful saving throw, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had succeeded at the saving throw, and for each saving throw failed, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had failed the saving throw. If the monk fails any of the saving throws (including his own original saving throw), the monk treats the effect as if he had failed the saving throw. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Hurricane (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As a full-round action, a monk with this ability can move up to twice his speed. At any point in that movement, the monk can spend 1 ki point to make the first attack in his flurry of blows. He can later spend another ki point to make the next attack in his flurry of blows, and so on, until he either stops spending ki points or has exhausted all the attacks from his flurry of blows. A monk must be at least 10th level and possess the sudden speed ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Meditation (Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 31](source/blood_of_the_beast)) A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points to meditate as a full-round action, as if using Combat Meditation. Alternatively, he can spend 4 ki points to meditate as a move action instead. Using these ki points does not count as one of the monk's daily uses of Combat Meditation, but it grants him the usual benefits he would gain from his meditation feats for doing so. The monk must have the Combat Meditation feat before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Metabolism (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability uses his ki to control his metabolism. As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, the monk needs to eat and drink only 1/4 as often as normal, needs only 2 hours of sleep each night (including to replenish his ki pool), and can hold his breath for up to 1 hour per point of Constitution. As a move action, he can spend 1 ki point to enter a state of suspended animation, falling unconscious and appearing dead to all senses. At the time he enters this state, he indicates a preset period of time or a triggering condition, after which he awakens.",
			"",
			"**Ki Mount (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a standard action to grant 2 temporary hit points per monk level he possesses to his mount for 1 hour per monk level. As long as the monk and his mount are adjacent or the monk is mounted, the mount shares the benefits of whichever of the AC bonus, evasion, high jump, improved evasion, ki strike, perfect self, and still mind abilities the monk possesses. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Range (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to increase the range increment of any thrown monk weapon by 20 feet. Apply this benefit before doubling the range increment with the [Far Shot](feat/far_shot) feat.",
			"",
			"**Ki Sunder (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 20](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a free action when attempting a sunder combat maneuver check to add his monk level as a bonus to the damage roll.",
			"",
			"**Ki Visions (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability often sees visions of spirits or hears the voice of his departed mentor in his dreams. On any given night during which the monk dreams, he can use this ability to gain the benefits of a [divination](spell/divination). If he does, he spends 2 ki points from the next day's total. A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Volley (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) When a targeted spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome the monk's spell resistance from diamond soul, he can spend 2 ki points as an immediate action to send that spell back at its caster as [spell turning](spell/spell_turning). A monk must be 16th level or higher and possess the diamond soul ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Light Steps (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can move effortlessly across nearly any surface. Whenever the monk activates his feather balance ki power, he can also ignore all difficult terrain. In addition, while active, he can cross any solid surface, even if it would normally not support his weight. This does not allow him to walk on liquids. A monk must be at least 8th level and have the feather balance ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Master-Thought Koan (Su)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 20](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A monk with this ability can spend an additional 2 ki points when using either the breaking-down koan or building-up koan ki powers. When combined with master-thought koan, breaking-down koan affects a number of characters of your choice within 30 feet equal to the monk's wisdom modifier. When combined with master-thought koan, building-up koan can be used on an ally within 30 feet. A monk must be at least 12th level and have either the breaking-down koan or the building-up koan ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**One Touch (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, as a standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against a foe as a touch attack. He adds 1/2 his monk level as a bonus on the damage roll. He can spend 1 ki point to double this bonus for that attack. A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Qinggong Power (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this power selects any of the qinggong monk ki powers for which he qualifies based on his monk level. A monk can select this ability multiple times. Each time, he must select a different qinggong monk ki power.",
			"",
			"**Quivering Palm (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 ki points, and the monk must announce his intent to use this ability (and spend the ki points) before making the attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any time within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action); unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it can still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than one quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous one is negated. A monk must be at least 16th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Racing Current (Su)** ([Wilderness Origins pg. 31](source/wilderness_origins)) A monk with this ki power can create a wave to help him maneuver allies upon the battlefield, as if using the spell [slipstream](spell/slipstream). Using this ability is a move action that costs 2 ki points, and the ability remains in effect for 1 minute. A monk must be 6th level to select this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Slow Fall (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent by expending 1 point from his ki pool. When he uses this ability, he takes no damage from the fall (as if using [feather fall](spell/feather_fall)), but he must be adjacent to a wall for the length of the fall (although this can be used to reduce the damage from a fall if only part of it is adjacent to a wall).",
			"",
			"**Sudden Speed (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself a sudden burst of speed. This increases the monk's base land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Water Sprint (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to gain the ability to walk on water, as if under the effects of [water walk](spell/water_walk). Once activated, this ability lasts for 1 minute per monk level. A monk must be fat least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Wholeness of Body (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can heal his own wounds as a standard action. By spending 2 points from his ki pool, he can heal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + his monk level.",
			"",
			"**Wind Jump (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a move action to grant himself a fly speed (with perfect maneuverability) equal to his base land speed. He must end his movement each round on solid ground (or some other surface that can support his weight) or fall as normal. Once activated, this ability lasts for 1 minute. A monk must be at least 8th level and have the high jump ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Zephyr Blow (Su)** ([Wilderness Origins pg. 31](source/wilderness_origins)) By spending 1 ki point as a standard action, a monk with this power can disrupt the wind and create a sharp blast of air, as if using the spell [gust of wind](spell/gust_of_wind). The monk's caster level for this effect is equal to his monk level."

			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Agony (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 67](source/advanced_player's_guide)): With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The target is nauseated for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. A Fortitude save negates this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Animal Skin** ([Blood of the Moon pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_moon)): The witch can become any animal of a size from Tiny to Large whose skin she wears. This ability is similar to beast shape II, except she takes on the appearance of the specific individual from which the skin came.",
			"",
			"**Beast Eye (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can project her senses into an animal within 100 feet, sensing whatever it senses. She cannot control the animal's actions. She can project her senses from that animal to another within 100 feet of it as a standard action, and can continue to make these sensory leaps, potentially viewing things very far from her actual location. She may return her senses to her own body as a free action. Normal animals get no saving throw against this ability, but animal companions, paladin mounts, and similar unusual animals may resist with a Will save; the witch may use this ability on her own familiar as if it were an animal. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet of her who also have the coven hex can see through this animal at will, although the acting witch still controls the ability. The witch can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"**Beast's Gift (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can use her magic to grant her allies ferocious animal abilities. The witch can partially transform a willing ally, granting him natural attacks for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. Choose one: the creature gains one bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage and one secondary attack of the witch's choice that deals 1d6 points of damage, or the creature gains two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage each. These attacks follow the standard rules for natural attacks.",
			"",
			"**Cook People (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can create fabulous spells by cooking an intelligent humanoid creature in her cauldron, either alive or dead. Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice, typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of the following benefits for 1 hour: age resistance, bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, neutralize poison (instantaneous) owl's wisdom, remove disease (instantaneous). Alternatively, the witch can shape the dough into a Small, humanlike creature, animating it as a homunculus for 1 hour. The witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act.",
			"",
			"**Delicious Fright** ([Blood of the Moon pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_moon)): The witch can feed on the fear of her victim. The target of this hex becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. As long as the witch remains within 30 feet of her target, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws as long as this effect persists. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"**Drugged (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can combine her magic with her poisons to weaken her enemies' minds. When the witch creates a poison, she can require the target of the poison to attempt a Will save rather than a Fortitude save. The witch must use this hex when she crafts the poison, and once used, the hex can't be undone without remaking the poison.",
			"",
			"**False Hospitality (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witches of Iblydos are known for greeting travelers with warmth only to reveal their powers once their enemies have lowered their defenses. A witch can use this hex to gain the benefits of [glibness](spell/glibness) with a caster level equal to the witch's level. This hex can be used once per day.",
			"",
			"**Hag's Eye (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 67](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see through. This functions as per the spell arcane eye. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls it. The witch can use this eye for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"**Harrowing Curse (Su)** ([The Harrow Handbook pg. 15](source/the_harrow_handbook)): The witch can curse a target creature by touching it with a card randomly drawn from a harrow deck she owns. The target is affected as if by the spell bestow curse using the witch's caster level, except that the witch can decrease only the ability score that corresponds to the suit of the card drawn. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be targeted by this hex more than once in 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts as a major curse spell. A witch with the cartomancer archetype can combine this hex with her spell deck's deliver touch spell ability.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Home (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can conceal or disguise her home and the area around it as if using mirage arcana. Before using the hex, she must spend 1 day pacing out the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define her home territory. Thereafter, she can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a standard action as long as she is within the area. The illusion persists until the witch changes or dismisses it. For the purpose of this ability, a witch can only have one \"home\" at a time.",
			"",
			"**Hoarfrost (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic, remove curse, and similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.",
			"",
			"**Ice Tomb (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8 points of cold damage (Fortitude half). If the target fails its save, it is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Infected Wounds (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The target's wounds become infected (Fortitude negates). The target takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day. After the first day, the target may save once per day to cure the infection. This is a disease effect.",

			"**Major Ameliorating (Su)** ([Healer's Handbook pg. 17](source/healer's_handbook)): The witch can touch a creature to suppress or protect it from more debilitating negative conditions. Each time she uses this hex, the witch either chooses the blinded or deafened condition, or chooses a type of effect: curse, disease, or poison. If the target is or later becomes afflicted with the chosen condition or effect, that condition or effect is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. Alternatively, for 24 hours the witch can grant her target a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects that cause any two of the above conditions or effects (witch's choice; she can choose any combination of conditions or effects, as long as she chooses only two total). At 15th level, the witch can choose up to two total conditions or types of effects to suppress or three total conditions or types of effects to grant a circumstance bonus against each time she uses the major ameliorating hex. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",

This acts as cure serious wounds, using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the major healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts like cure critical wounds.",
			"",
			"**Nightmares (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by terrible nightmares. This functions as the spell nightmare each time the affected creature attempts to rest. A Will save negates this effect. If the save is failed, the target must make a new save each night or be unable to rest.",
			"",
			"**Pariah (Su)** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 28](source/magical_marketplace)): The witch can cause a creature within 60 feet to be shunned by its allies for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. Any other creature attempting to directly assist the target with a harmless spell or aid another action must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the aiding creature is unaffected by this hex. If the save fails, the aiding creature can't follow through, the action is lost, and the aiding creature can't directly aid the target for the duration of this hex. This hex does not prevent the target from benefiting from area of effect spells.",
			"",
			"**Prophecy (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can call on her prophetic ancestors and cast [divination](spell/divination) once per day. She can spend a full hour casting the spell in place of providing the usual material components.",
			"",
			"**Regenerative Sinew (Su)** ([Healer's Handbook pg. 17](source/healer's_handbook)): The witch can cause the debilitating wounds of a creature she touches to quickly close, helping it heal rapidly. The target either gains fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the witch's class level or it heals up to 4 points of ability score damage from any two ability scores (witch's choice). At 15th level, in addition to the chosen effect, the target's severed body members, broken bones, and ruined organs grow back, as per regenerate. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Restless Slumber (Su)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 10](source/potions_and_poisons)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to fall into a sleep riddled with nightmares. This functions as the slumber hex. Additionally, the restless nature of the sleep causes the creature to violently toss and turn, dealing 1d10 points of damage to itself each turn. This damage does not wake the creature. When it wakes, the creature's addled state causes it to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the witch's level. The witch must have the slumber hexslumber to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Retribution (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target's flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee. Immediately after the hexed creature deals damage in melee, it takes half that damage (round down). This damage bypasses any resistances, immunities, or damage reduction the creature possesses. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. A Will save negates this effect.",
			"",
			"**Speak in Dreams (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can contact a creature as if using dream. The witch can use this ability on a number of creatures per day equal to her Intelligence bonus, but can dream-speak to those creatures as often as desired throughout that time period.",
			"",
			"**Steal Voice (Su)** ([Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 23](source/dirty_tactics_toolbox)): (Tiefling Only) The witch can steal the voice of one creature within 30 feet, causing it to lose, for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence bonus, all abilities that rely on speech, including talking, casting spells with verbal components, and using auditory bardic performances. A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. If this hex is used upon a willing target, the duration lasts for a number of hours equal to the witch's Intelligence bonus. Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as per vocal alteration.",
			"",
			"**Vision (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision.",
			"",
			"**Waxen Image (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch can spend a full-round action to create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30 feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must make a Will save. If the subject fails, the witch gains a small measure of control over the creature. Whenever she exercises this control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.",
			"",
			"**Weather Control (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with this hex can use control weather once per day, but creating the weather takes 1 full hour of chanting, dancing, and communing with her familiar.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Bounty (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch may bless a bush, plant, or tree that is planted in the ground, so that it creates a plentiful harvest. Each day at dawn, this blessed bush grows a number of goodberries equal to twice her witch level. Berries on the tree remain until they are picked, but the tree can never manifest a number of berries greater than twice her level at one time. The witch may only have one witch's bounty active at a time, but can shift her blessing to a new plant with a ritual requiring 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Brew (Ex)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): When the witch uses her cauldron to brew a potion, she may spend double the cost to create 2 identical potions that day instead of just 1. At 15th level, she may spend triple the cost to create 3 identical potions that day. The witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Charge (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): Once per day when preparing spells, a witch can designate a willing creature as her charge. She gains a constant status effect on this creature and can target it with beneficial touch spells from a range of 30 feet. The creature remains her charge until she designates a new one.",
			"",
			"**Withering (Su)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 10](source/potions_and_poisons)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to age rapidly, empowering the witch in the process. The target ages to the next age category (adult to middle-aged, and so on). The witch gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + her witch level and a +2 enhancement bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for a number of hours equal to her Intelligence modifier. These effects last for a number of hours equal to the witch's level. A creature cannot be aged past venerable age by this hex, and it can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect altogether. Once a creature has successfully saved against the withering hex, it cannot be affected by it again."

			"**Deflection Field (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): Whenever the psychic casts a linked spell that grants her a deflection bonus to AC, she can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to automatically reflect the first ranged attack that misses her (as long as the linked spell remains active) back at the attacker. This reflected attack uses the original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychic's caster level.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Pulse (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.",
			"",
			"**Dual Amplification (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.",
			"",
			"**Mimic Metamagic (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.",
			"",
			"**Space-rending Spell (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as [dimension door](spell/dimension_door)). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Subordinate Spell (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.",
			"",
			"**Synaptic Shock (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).",

The linked spell must have the mind-affecting descriptor and must have a range of touch or greater.",
			"",
			"**Turning Shield (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of [spell turning](spell/spell_turning) for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell."

			"**Allay Pain** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject of this trick gains DR 15/- against one attack that deals nonlethal damage. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is hit with an attack that deals nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"**Avian Escape** ([Occult Adventures pg. 43](source/occult_adventures)): The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy's attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as [beast shape III](spell/beast_shape_3). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven. This is a polymorph effect.",
			"",
			"**Concealing Veil** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): When this trick is triggered, the subject is affected by a [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.",

			"**Cursed Sanction** ([Occult Adventures pg. 43](source/occult_adventures)): A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject's forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Faked Death** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as [programmed image](spell/programmed_image)), but actually turns invisible (as [invisibility](spell/invisibility)) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.",
			"",
			"**Free in Body** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): When constrained, the subject can easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web). The subject gains the benefits of [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Mask Misery, Greater** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): This trick functions as the mask misery trick, but can be used to ignore greater conditions as well. A mesmerist must have the mask misery mesmerist [trick](ability/tricks) to take greater mask misery.",
			"",
			"**Mental Fallback** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by [charm monster](spell/charm_monster) cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Blend** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Stealth check while in an area of dim or darker light. The subject gains total concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.",
			"",
			"**Spatial Switch** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.",
			"",
			"**Spell Anticipation** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.",

When the subject attempts to lie, the mesmerist can trigger this trick. That particular lie resists truth-detecting magic, and creatures attempting to use such magic must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the mesmerist's class level to succeed; failure means the magic doesn't detect the subject's lie or force her to speak only the truth."

When she does this, she throws a single shuriken at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the attack hits.

			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)  ",
			"As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.",
			"",
			"Tricks marked with an asterisk (&ast;) add effects to a ninja's sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Attack&ast; (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninja's sneak attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any DR the creature might possess.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Range (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ninja trick increases the range at which she can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A ninja can take this trick more than once. Its effects stack.",
			"",
			"**Ki Block&ast; (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can prevent a creature from using its ki pool. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.",
			"",
			"**Pressure Points&ast; (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can strike at an opponent's vital pressure points, causing weakness and intense pain. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she also deals 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the ninja. Unlike normal ability damage, this damage can be healed by a DC 15 Heal check. Each successful check heals 1 point of damage caused by this trick. A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this Heal check.",
			"",
			"**Slow Reactions&ast; (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Opponents that are damaged by the ninja's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Acrobatic Master (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can focus her ki to grant her a +20 bonus on one Acrobatics check of her choice made before the start of her next turn. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.",
			"",
			"**Arcane Backfire (Su)** ([Heroes from the Fringe](source/heroes_from_the_fringe)) When a ninja with this trick successfully attacks a creature that is holding a magic item that has a number of charges or uses per day, she can attempt a Use Magic Device check (DC = 20 + the item's CL) to cause the item to lose either one daily use or a number of charges equal to the number of the ninja's sneak attack dice.",
			"",
			"**Blood Debt (Su)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) A ninja with this ability gains [In Harm's Way](feat/in_harm's_way) as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites. When the ninja intercepts an attack using this feat, she can spend 1 ki point to impose a blood debt on the aided ally. The ninja's ki pool is reduced by 1 until she ends this effect, which she may do as an immediate action. If the ninja ends the blood debt in response to a successful attack against her by a creature the indebted ally threatens, the ally (who must be willing) takes full damage from that attack and any associated effects instead of the ninja.",
			"",
			"**Breath of the Ancestors (Su)** ([Legacy of Dragons](source/legacy_of_dragons)) The ninja chooses one imperial dragon type (forest, sea, sky, sovereign, or underworld) when she gains this trick, and the choice can't be changed. She can use supplies similar to those used for ninja smoke bombs to produce an alchemical breath weapon that deals the same kind of damage as the selected dragon (piercing damage for forest dragons, fire for sea dragons, and so on). The breath weapon deals the same amount of damage as the ninja's sneak attack, with a Reflex save allowed for half damage. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone (or a 30-foot line if the underworld dragon is selected). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's class level + the ninja's Intelligence modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that expends up 2 ki points, and once used it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Choking Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Whenever a ninja throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the resulting cloud must make a Fortitude save or become staggered by the choking black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The ninja can decide to create an ordinary smoke bomb or add poison to this smoke bomb as normal. The ninja must have the poison bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.",
			"",
			"**Combat Trick (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja who selects this trick gains a bonus combat feat.",
			"",
			"**Darkvision (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) This trick allows the ninja to use her ki to enhance her sight, granting darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Using this trick is a standard action that costs 1 ki point. The enhanced senses last for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Deflect Arrows (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains the [Deflect Arrows](feat/deflect_arrows) feat as a bonus feat. The ninja must have the [Improved Unarmed Strike](feat/improved_unarmed_strike) combat feat before taking this trick.",
			"",
			"**Fast Stealth (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Feather Fall (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) As an immediate action, the ninja can slow her descent as if using [feather fall](spell/feather_fall). This ability uses her ninja level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.",
			"",
			"**Flurry of Stars (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can expend 1 ki point from her ki pool as a swift action before she makes a full-attack attack with shuriken. During that attack, she can throw two additional shuriken at her highest attack bonus, but all of her shuriken attacks are made at a -2 penalty, including the two extra attacks.",
			"",
			"**Forgotten Trick (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can recall one trick taught to her by her ancient masters. When she uses this ability, she selects one ninja trick (not a master trick or rogue talent) that she does not know and can use that ninja trick for a number of rounds equal to her level. She must pay any ki costs associated with the trick as normal. Using this ability expends 2 ki point from her ki pool, plus the ki cost of the trick she chooses.",
			"",
			"**Herbal Compound (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A ninja with this trick can consume specially prepared herbs to strengthen her mind. The ninja can spend 1 ki point and smoke, eat, or inject an herbal compound as a move action. The ninja takes a -2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saves but gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Will saves for 10 minutes per ninja level.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Weapons (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can easily conceal weapons on her body. The ninja adds her level on opposed Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. In addition, she can draw hidden weapons as a move action, instead of as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**High Jumper (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) When a ninja with this trick makes a high jump, the DC for that jump is half the normal DC. The ninja must have the acrobatic master trick before taking this talent.",
			"",
			"**Kamikaze (Su)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) A ninja with this ability strikes without concern for her own well-being. The ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give her unarmed strikes and any weapons she wields the vicious weapon special ability for 1 round per level. The ninja can spend 1 ki point to dismiss this effect.",
			"",
			"**Ki Charge (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can invest a portion of her ki into a single thrown weapon, such as a shuriken, and throw it as a standard action. The thrown weapon explodes on impact in a 5-foot burst, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage for every four levels of the ninja above 2nd, to a maximum 4d6 at 18th level. Creatures caught in the blast receive a Reflex save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. If the thrown weapon hits a creature, that creature takes a -2 penalty on the saving throw. If the thrown weapon misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.",
			"",
			"**Ki Venom (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A ninja with this trick knows how to make poisons from innocuous herbs or minerals. Creating ki venom is a full-round action that costs 1 ki point. The poison lasts for 24 hours before becoming inert. The poison deals either Strength or Dexterity damage, chosen when the venom is created. The ninja can spend additional ki as part of the process of creating the ki venom to improve the venom in one or more of the following ways: spend 1 ki point to increase the damage die to a d6, spend 1 ki point to change the ability damage dealt to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage, or spend 1 ki point to increase the number of saves required to cure the poison by 1.",
			"",
			">**Ki Venom:** *Type* poison, injury; *Save* Fortitude DC = 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + her Charisma modifier  ",
			">*Frequency* 1/round for rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier.  ",

			"",
			"**Poison Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Whenever the ninja throws a smoke bomb, she can decide to include 1 dose of any inhaled poison she possesses. This poison affects all creatures in the smoke and lasts as long as the smoke lasts. She must pay for the poison normally. The ninja must have the smoke bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.",
			"",
			"**Redirect Force (Ex)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) If the ninja has a feat that allows her to attempt a combat maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity, she can choose to provoke them anyway when she performs that maneuver. If she does so and takes damage from the attack of opportunity, the ninja adds the damage as a bonus on her attack roll instead of as a penalty.",
			"",
			"**Rogue Talent** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja can select a rogue talent in place of a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select a rogue talent that has the same name as a ninja trick. The ninja can select this talent multiple times.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Clone (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her true location. This ability functions as mirror image, using the ninja's level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that uses up 1 ki point.",
			"",
			"**Slow Metabolism (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the ninja is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of -1/round for 6 rounds' would instead be -1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.-",
			"",
			"**Smoke Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) This ability allows a ninja to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius.
