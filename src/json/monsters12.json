			"",
			"**Siphon Dart (Ex)** A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications into needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet with no range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its Strength modifier, and possibly poisoning the target.",
			"",
			"**Siphon Jet (Ex)** As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon to move a creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly away from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean floor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam.",
			"",
			"Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food.",
			"",
			"Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water.",
			"",
			"Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds.",
			"",
			"Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them.",
			"",
			"### Infamous Deeds",
			"",
			"Primarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them worthy of their notoriety.",
			"",
			"Humanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well-a field of the creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the day of the attack, which many claim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not normally available to the gigas clams. Many of the merfolk still yearn to reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings.",
			"",
			"In the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji River delta, where they feed on the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the river's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures. The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry that the clams might organize a retributive assault.",
			"",
			"### Adventure Hooks",
			"",
			"Gigas clams tend to remain passive during the cooler months, but those who venture too close to their homes during the wrong season might run afoul of the giant mollusks.",
			"",
			"- A trio of scavenger ships recently returned from looting Azlanti ruins only to meet their fate at the hands of a gigas clam, which smashed the ships to pieces and littered their treasures all over the sea floor below. Only the captain and two sailors survived the ordeal; the captain wants to return and claim what's his, while his two crew members want to have nothing to do with the sea for a long while.",
			"- In response to sightings of a gigas clam breaching the water this past summer near Corentyn, the Chelish Navy issued notice of a substantial bounty on the strange beasts. Several folk plan to set sail to hunt the creature. One ship in particular is crewed entirely by tengus, who keep a mysterious contraption covered with oiled canvas on their ship's deck and guard it day and night."

			"",
			"The first known record of an Abaddon gigas dates back to Lamashtu's first struggles with the daemon race, when the Demon Queen captured and murdered two of the Four Horsemen. The putrid remains of the slain Horsemen oozed toward Abaddon's heart, where they merged with the body of a captured Thanatotic titan (and perhaps some of the energy of the fabled Oinodaemon) to create the first gigas on that plane. A hideous and gigantic being of size beyond reason and composed of some of the multiverse's most powerful souls, this mythic gigas soon tore itself into pieces while struggling against its uncompromising quaternary nature. In doing so, this first behemoth created countless \"children,\" the beings known in present times as Abaddon gigas.",

The daemons and divs believe that Abaddon gigas roam in search of souls to sate their enormous hunger for life. The rare interplanar scholars who travel to Abaddon claim that the gigas carry out nefarious deeds for fell beings such as olethrodaemons or akvans. Only Charon, the eldest of the current Four Horsemen, knows the true source of the Abaddon gigas' wanderlust: they yearn for the Oinodaemon. The Boatman keeps this secret to himself, and keeps a distant watch over the gigas of Abaddon, though it is unclear whether his surveillance is out of curiosity or some ulterior motive.",
			"",

			"",

The monster resembles a towering naked man with dark red skin the texture of granite. The right half of its body has been mutilated beyond comprehension, revealing a mess of blue veins that intermingle with oozing alien organs and pulsing black guts.",
			"",
			"Goros wears no armor (reducing its AC to 22 and its flat-footed AC to 19), and flies into a rage if reduced to half its hit points. While in a rage, Goros gains all the same benefits and penalties as a raging 20th-level barbarian (gaining a +8 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 morale bonus on Will saves), though the gigas doesn't gain any rage powers.",

			"Mephengitan: Mephengitan the Arch-Giant dwells among the icy wastes of Hoarspan, a borderland of polluted arctic waters and vicious icebergs where the fetid swamps of Plaguemere meet with Charon's Drowning Court. The gigas's eyes are the color of a clear winter sky, and on its frosty breath one can hear the whispers of a thousand souls whose lives were claimed by the Arch-Giant.",

Any living creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of cold damage as its core body temperature plummets and its blood begins to freeze. Creatures that don't need water to live are immune to this effect. Creatures with the water subtype take twice as much as damage."

More than capable of personally ruining most of their own foes physically, Hell gigas prefer campaigns of fear and pain, expending legions of slaves before bringing their own monstrous might to bear upon thoroughly defeated foes-though their rage often provokes them to forgo more satisfying climaxes in favor of immediate destruction.",

For reasons that remain unknown to this day (but which surely have nothing to do with compassion), the aboleths rescued a small fraction of these drowning humans, warping their flesh to help them survive in the aboleths' uncontested undersea realm. Yet with that action, the aboleths seemed to lose interest, and in the thousands of years that followed, the gillmen formed a society of their own.",

Some awakened agents teeter on the brink of madness, never fully understanding the purpose behind their own actions. Others carry out their assignments in the belief that everything they do is absolutely necessary for the well-being of their race-sacrificing the world to guarantee their people a role as favored pets.

			"Hunting below the waves secures only a precarious living, and forges don't burn underwater. To acquire worked goods and supplement their income, many Low Azlanti turn to scavenging. Shipwrecks, storm-washed flotsam, and jetsam abandoned to dodge customs officers all offer a wealth of goods now beyond the reach of their human creators and free to any aquatic creature strong and brave enough to claim them. Those gillmen who pick the bones of sunken hulks must compete with other ocean-going scavengers, from sharks and giant crabs to sahuagin. Fierce battles can erupt over new opportunities, just as surface peoples may battle over a mine or treasure-laden tomb. Truly successful scavengers often conceal or booby-trap their most lucrative discoveries, or recruit additional gillmen to help them guard a find and swiftly pick it clean. Groups of gillmen ranging in size from small gangs to large organized companies may claim especially treacherous waters and identify these jagged reefs, stormwracked passes, and monster-infested shoals with distinct markers, which canny sailors learn to use for navigation.",
			"",
			"While most ship scavengers content themselves with recovering lost treasures from past accidents or battles, a greedy few cause shipwrecks by moving buoys, extinguishing lighthouses, disseminating false charts, and sabotaging vessels. The worst are little better than pirates, prying ships apart from below the waves or setting them aflame, then slaughtering the crew as they leap into the ocean. Whether they're malign or merely opportunistic, ship scavengers are unlikely to share a wreck's treasures, even-or especially-with its air-breathing former owners."

They negotiate trade agreements, organize salvage operations and undersea expeditions, and connect human diplomats and scholars with other skilled Low Azlanti. But when the need arises, an emissary transforms into a spy, provocateur, or saboteur capable of facing incredible threats, undermining overly curious surface dwellers, and retrieving Azlanti artifacts never meant for the clumsy hands of non-Azlanti humans. Most walk a fine line, gathering agents and contacts to assist them while keeping their underlings forever ignorant of their true goals.",

They possess an almost endless supply of sea-creature venoms, aquatic beasts that boggle description, and secret magic lost below the waves for centuries. With access to all manner of twisting, secluded hideaways, these gillmen can lead the overly curious into undertaking convoluted quests while the Low Azlanti accomplish their real objectives. Victims who survive the emissaries' poisons or monster attacks may look forward to a short, desperate future spent trapped in lightless sea caves unseen by landwalkers' eyes for 10,000 years."

			"Ginevers are cruel human-seeming creatures suffused with liquor and spite. Sometimes called \"gin devils,\" they haunt dive bars and tumbledown slums, living in the shadow of civilization. They are eager carnivores, and while they can sate themselves on any meat, they prefer the taste of flesh marinated for months in sweet, soothing alcohol-a diet that frequently brings them into contact with the dregs of society.",
			"",
			"Ginevers are newer arrivals in Taldor, apparently hailing from Casmaron where they have hunted for thousands of years. They claim to be the sacred children of a vile foreign god of fermentation, though Qadiran tales describe them as bandits and vagabonds cursed for their gluttony. Given that ginevers are both argumentative and prone to exaggeration, the truth of their origins is likely lost to history.",
			"",
			"Their near-human appearance allows ginevers to blend into society, avoiding notice so long as they control their appetites and avoid scrutiny. With this natural camouflage, they may have dwelled in city shadows for far longer than is known, only emerging in greater numbers as Taldor declines. While a ginever's gaze can transform even water into some form of alcohol, the magically created spirits are of low, burning quality, and so what little coin the ginever collects is quickly spent on high-quality ales, liquors, and wines."

			"Girallons are among the jungle's most dangerous predators. They are aggressive, carnivorous, highly territorial, and incredibly strong. Worse, their four muscular arms are capable of inflicting incredible damage on anything that falls into their clutches. Their exotic appearance makes them popular creatures in certain cities as attractions in gladiatorial combats, either starved and pitted against each other, or set against gladiators eager to increase their fame and notoriety. One who kills a girallon is all but assured of fame, yet most battles against these ferocious beasts end poorly for those foolish enough to attempt to single-handedly defeat one. An adult girallon is 8 feet tall, broad-chested, and covered in thick, pure white fur. It weighs roughly 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Girallons live in troops led by a dominant male. Solitary girallons are usually young males looking to start their own troop. Girallons are very territorial and tend to attack intruders without warning, including strangers of their own kind. Groups of girallons may attack in a line to drive prey toward a cliff or other hazard, or quietly form a ring around their target and suddenly close in.",
			"",
			"While most girallons are little more than beasts, ancient carvings and the oral traditions of some tribes hint that the girallon wasn't always the stupid creature it is today. According to these legends, the first girallons were men who called upon savage demon gods to gain great strength, yet in so doing abandoned their humanity. With each generation, these first girallons grew more and more savage and feral, and the same legends maintain that these intelligent girallons still dwell in the darkest part of the jungle. In addition to their intellects, these girallons retain a vast appetite for cruelty. Called \"high girallons,\" these creatures are almost always chaotic evil, and have Intelligence scores of 6 or higher. An intelligent girallon generally speaks whatever language the local humans speak. Often, they become leaders of unusually large troops of their less-intelligent kin, inhabit strange ruined cities in the jungle or mountains, and conduct raids on villages for food and treasure. Some primitive tribes worship these girallons as the agents of evil gods or demons, and a few high girallons have been known to work for or even breed with tribal orcs, inspiring legends of four-armed \"high girallons,\""

A gishvit's ribbon deals no damage on a hit, but it can be used to grab the target. A gishvit has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe grabbed by its ribbon. A gishvit does not gain the grappled condition while using its ribbon in this manner.",
			"",
			"**Transcription (Su)** A gishvit finds pleasure in being a repository of information. It can immediately transcribe information dictated to it and material it overhears. Alternately, a gishvit can spend an hour with a willing subject, wherein it collects memories and experiences from the subject. This transcription process is not dangerous to either the gishvit or the target. Information recorded and stored in this manner appears as filled pages within the gishvit's booklike body, and it remains there for up to 24 hours after the gishvit is slain (unless the gishvit was killed by an [erase](spell/erase) spell, see below). Another creature can research the pages of a willing or deceased gishvit. The text inside a gishvit is comprehensible to any creature that can read and knows at least one written language.

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Sometimes referred to as \"lore roaches\" by scholars familiar with the Outer Planes, gishvits are natural inhabitants of the lawful plane of Axis. Often associated with the native axiomites and scrivenites, gishvits occupy a mundane role on Axis, maintaining vast stores of knowledge within their booklike bodies. Transcribing knowledge from living creatures, a gishvit stores information in its body in the form of written text, preserving the acquired knowledge within itself. Because of this unique method of information gathering, gishvits are treasured by information brokers and spellcasters on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"A gishvit varies between 1 to 2 feet in length, often weighing no more than 8 pounds.",
			"",
			"The booklike body of a gishvit is indicative of its ultimate purpose: the consumption and storage of knowledge. For as long as the ordered realm of Axis has existed, gishvits have clambered throughout its seemingly endless streets and meandered within its many archives of knowledge. Some scholars believe that these creatures first emerged from the quintessence of Axis as companions to axiomites and [scrivenites](unknown/scrivenites). While axiomites tend to ignore the pesky little creatures, scrivenites associate with the booklike outsiders, sometimes even treating them like pets more than pests.",
			"",
			"A gishvit has a set of razor-sharp teeth that emerge from the edges of its cover page and back page, though it lacks the strength to use them with great effectiveness. These teeth are visible only when the outsider opens its mouth. A set of similarly sharp insectile limbs emerge from within the gishvit's body, acting as legs that can be retracted at a whim to act as embellishments for the gishvit's spine. A whipping, silken bookmark tongue that issues from between the pages of its body completes the gishvit's odd anatomy.",
			"",
			"A gishvit absorbs knowledge from its surroundings and from individuals who wish to store their memories and experiences within the creature's pages. Once the small outsider has consumed a sufficient amount of knowledge, it darts off to digest the information. This digestion takes place over several hours, during which the gishvit's interior pages fill with the stored lore.",
			"",
			"Gishvits understand all spoken languages thanks to their truespeech ability, though they lack vocal cords and the ability to speak. Only creatures capable of telepathic communication can engage a gishvit in conversation, and even then, such conversations are generally dominated by the gishvit's ravenous desire for new information or its hope to hibernate and mull over the stored information after filling its pages with stores of memories and experiences. Despite having considerable insight into numerous topics, even without ingesting any knowledge from other creatures, a gishvit finds little joy in relating such information through conversation. Negotiators find conversations with gishvits incredibly difficult, and though gishvits rarely have the chance to converse with other beings, they still find most conversations a detraction from their endless urge to transcribe knowledge.",
			"",
			"In addition to being able to collect a wealth of information into their small forms, gishvits are known for their knack for transcribing accurate information. Since they interact directly with subjects' experiences and memories, they have the ability to cut through bias and misremembered experiences. This makes the information stored within a gishvit valuable to court proceedings and other instances where the truth is more important than a potentially flawed statement.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most inhabitants of Axis are powerful enough to pay gishvits little more heed than a creature from the Material Plane would associate with most common vermin. Despite the creatures' lowly status, several factions on the lawful plane employ gishvits as negotiation tools or unintentional spies. In these roles, the little gishvits excel, as they are able to extract knowledge from negotiators and put it to paper or collect valuable and accurate information from stationed guards. Still, many creatures on Axis have far more reliable means of extracting information, so they instead relegate gishvits to a pitiable status as planar vermin. It is not uncommon for an eager gishvit to pester a creature enjoying a meal inside one of Axis's many restaurants to spend time with it in hopes of adding lore to its pages, or for a patron of the plane's many archives to find herself accosted by a whipping bookmark tongue when she picks it up by accident while the creature was resting on a shelf.",
			"",
			"On both Axis and the Material Plane, a satiated gishvit quickly enters a state of gradual torpor, followed by a period of hibernation. Such gishvits often seek to rest in large archives or repositories, hiding among hundreds or thousands of similar-looking mundane books. They then wait for centuries at a time, content to rest with the knowledge they have digested. After several centuries, a gishvit willingly discards its digested knowledge. It is then instinctually compelled to repeat the process of acquiring and digesting new information. Sadly for the gishvit, it often finds itself trapped in a now-long forgotten archive, unable to escape. In these unfortunate circumstances, the next creatures to enter the gishvit's sealed-off home are immediately assaulted by the knowledge-ravenous creatures."

Less known, even among the greatest planar scholars, is that carnivorous crystals are not the only oozes that hail from the Plane of Earth and gain sustenance from living things.",
			"",
			"Unlike their more aggressive cousins, the carnivorous geodes known as glimmerhollows rely entirely on the enticement of rich mineral deposits to attract prey. They still leach minerals from the earth around them for food, but they use some of those minerals to grow wondrous crystal formations. Creatures that lust after such treasures, either for wealth or for food, find that the glimmerhollow relishes the minerals in their bodies above all else.",
			"",
			"A mature glimmerhollow can cover the inside of a 10-foot cube and weighs a staggering 100,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows are among the rare ooze creatures that were not spawned by the careless experimentation of renegade wizards. Like carnivorous crystals, they originated on the Plane of Earth, but even in those endless tunnels, glimmerhollows are fairly uncommon. Of course, it is precisely because they are not well known that glimmerhollows manage to survive.",
			"",
			"A glimmerhollow hunts by moving into a small cavern or similar space and spreading itself over the chamber's interior, covering the walls, floor, and ceiling, while leaving an opening for prey to enter. If no natural cave of sufficient size is available, the glimmerhollow wedges itself into a crack or fissure, spending a day or more to slowly burrow and consume enough earth and rock to create a niche for itself. Once inside, it uses consumed minerals to grow a layer of crystals on its inner surface.",
			"",
			"These crystals are spectacular to behold. The formations can be heavy and impressive or thin and delicate. They may be squat clusters or sharp spikes. Whatever form they take, the crystals create the false image of a massive geode, filled with some of the purest, most exquisite specimens ever seen. Some of the crystals even possess an inherent luminosity, causing the whole space to glint and sparkle. The glimmerhollow can use this luminosity to generate a hypnotic effect that draws in victims.",
			"",
			"Like other oozes, glimmerhollows can produce pseudopods to defend themselves, often using them to drag victims that resist the other lures into their central cavities. Glimmerhollows prefer, however, to let greed, hunger, or their hypnotic power bring in targets. Once the prey is inside, an ooze quickly snaps the trap shut. The crystals that once promised treasure now serve as lacerating gizzard stones. Victims are macerated and mixed with acidic digestive fluids to break them down into their constituent mineral elements, which the glimmerhollow absorbs. The process usually kills the prey quickly, either through injury or suffocation, but digestion can take several days, depending on the size of the creature's meal.",
			"",
			"On the Plane of Earth, glimmerhollows prey on the plane's native creatures that eat rocks and gems. In general, this means crysmals and xorns, though they demonstrate a preference for xorns. If a crysmal is inside a glimmerhollow and a xorn is nearby, the ooze will wait long enough for the crysmal to escape, hoping to fool the xorn into thinking its chamber is a safe place to gather food. On the Material Plane, glimmerhollows rarely encounter xorns, but they have developed a taste for living creatures, whose bodies contain several delectable minerals as well as carbon, which it can also convert into crystalline materials.",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows reproduce by a form of mitosis. Given time and enough food, mature glimmerhollows grow to about one and a half times their adult size. Then the ooze splits, forming two identical creatures that slither into the darkness to feed on rock and mineral deposits until they are big enough to make geode traps of their own.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows are solitary creatures and have no discernible culture or society. Their method of feeding requires them to stay far apart from one another unless food is abundant. Generally, if two glimmerhollows encounter one another, they will fight until one kills or drives out the other.",
			"",
			"Glimmerhollows relocate when an area has been exhausted of prey. Over time, they may come across well-traveled paths. They instinctively avoid areas that are too busy, instead keeping to hidden paths and niches nearby. This allows them to capture the occasional curious, unwary traveler without drawing too much attention to themselves.",
			"",
			"### Treasure",
			"",
			"Although the crystal formations inside a glimmerhollow's trap serve the creatures as lures, many of them do have great monetary value. After slaying a glimmerhollow, characters can harvest a small trove of precious and semiprecious gems and crystals. These are mainly grade 3, 4, or 5 crystals, but at least one gem will be a greater precious gem (grade 6) worth at least 3,500 gold pieces (see Appendix 2 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment.)",
			"",
			"In perhaps one or two out of a hundred cases, a glimmerhollow's strange anatomy produces an extremely rare crystal, like a blue garnet, red emerald, or brilliant green diamond. Such a specimen could be worth more than 10,000 gold pieces simply for its rarity, but these gems are also prized by alchemists who can use them in elixirs, potions, tinctures, or even wondrous items. In Sothis, Atet-Anath (N female human alchemist 9) is adept at using powdered gemstones to enhance her potions, and claims some of her most spectacular results came from gems harvested from a glimmerhollow. Rumors circulate that she is seeking a way to capture and contain a glimmerhollow so she can study it and determine how to influence the crystals it produces."

Gloomwasps are the result of giant vermin exposed to the flesh-altering radiations of the Darklands, becoming vibrantly colorful if highly toxic additions to the strange ecosystem that thrives below Golarion's surface. They hunt by using their natural glow to attract curious creatures and travelers, then lash out with beams of energy. Gloomwasps often need only strike their victims a few times, then follow them for days while the lingering radiation slowly saps their prey's ability to flee or fight back.",

			"Surprisingly intelligent and tenacious, a small band of migrating gloomwasps can quickly become a full infestation. They build faintly radioactive nests high into cave ceilings, narrow tunnels, and hollow rock formations, where they nurse their drab, rat-sized grubs on a steady diet of regurgitated blood. The grubs eventually seal themselves within hexagonal cells, emerging weeks later as adult gloomwasps.",
			"",
			"While relatively fragile, gloomwasps' intelligence makes them formidable. They communicate with a system of dance, light flashes, and pheromones, and work together effectively to overwhelm prey of superior size and strength, including humanoids."

A gloomwing loose on the Material Plane is active for 2 to 3 hours at dawn and again for 2 to 3 hours at dusk, preferring to spend the remaining hours of the day hiding in abandoned buildings, caves, or deep canyons or foliage where the shadows are thickest. During its periods of activity, it flies through the sky on the hunt for creatures to attack and implant its eggs in-the gloomwing does not need to eat, leaving this urge to propagate its species as its primary drive.",

			"For all the dangers a gloomwing presents, it is the creature's young that pose the gravest threat.

The typical suspicions persist that it is the result of a mad wizard's experiments or the deliberate cultivations of druidic sects that have adopted anticivilization philosophies, yet those who have taken the time to truly examine these blood-drinking growths have noted disturbing elements that suggest a darker genesis. These botanists theorize that gluttongrass is seeded by the remnants of a creature that has died from starvation, whether in the wilds or in more urban territories. Indeed, patches of gluttongrass have been discovered flourishing in areas devastated by famine and around settlements whose populations have perished due to food supplies being cut off (such as in times of siege or after raiders have burned local crops). However, it has also been identified growing seemingly at random throughout forested areas and plains, blending in with normal grasses and other foliage, so certainly famine and starvation are not requirements for this plant's growth.",
			"",
			"Whatever its origin, one thing is certain: while a mindless plant, gluttongrass is far from harmless. Well-fed patches of this carnivorous grass average a height of 5 feet, with razor-sharp stalks able to pierce exposed skin with ease. Wary travelers should avoid rushing blindly through tall fields, as smaller patches of gluttongrass have been known to extend their roots toward one another, merging and slowly increasing their collective size, reach, and hunger. Some of the largest gluttongrass fields are suspected to have claimed hundreds of victims over the years.",
			"",
			"### Gluttongrass Field",
			"",
			"The thing that makes gluttongrass so dangerous when encountered as a field is the simple fact that the plants merge and link their root systems once enough of the plant monsters take root in close proximity. If at least 12 gluttongrasses take root in a single contiguous area, their roots begin to commingle. As long as the gluttongrasses do not move from their locations for at least 24 hours, this process completes and the carnivorous plants merge into a gluttongrass field.",
			"",
			"Once a gluttongrass field has formed, all of the individual gluttongrasses pool their hit points into one shared pool-thus, a patch of 12 gluttongrasses (the minimum required to make a field) has a total of 108 hit points. No single gluttongrass in the field dies until all of these pooled hit points are depleted, but a gluttongrass field forever loses its mobility and cannot uproot. Any area effect that deals damage to multiple gluttongrasses within a gluttongrass field treats the field as a single creature for the purpose of determining points of damage dealt to the field as a whole."

Male flinds who breed with female gnolls produce a litter with a flind about three quarters of the time. More capable of focus, cunning, and planning than gnolls, flinds are typically found in leadership roles within gnoll bands and tribes, and frequently lead hunting parties. Like gnolls, flinds use ambush tactics and often make slaves of surviving foes, yet a flind is more likely to go on the offensive when the odds are closer to even. Flinds still prefer the advantage of attacking in numbers-they just don't need the advantage to be overwhelming. In addition to using intimidation against enemies, flinds embrace flanking tactics and specialized uses of their unusual weapon, the flindbar.",
			"",
			"Flinds assign gnolls lower in the pack hierarchy the task of crafting [flindbars](equipment/weapon/flindbar). Flinds are very particular about these weapons, and a gnoll who fails to properly weight and polish a flindbar can expect a savage mauling from the flind who demanded the weapon.",
			"",
			"A flind is roughly 7 feet tall and weighs between 280 and 315 pounds. Flinds have brindled or spotted fur, and are primarily russet in color with patches of black."

			"**Blizzard (Su)** Once per hour as a standard action, a gnoph-keh can create a stationary blizzard that fills a 20-foot-radius spread. The gnoph-keh can place the center of this blizzard at any point within its reach. Multiple gnoph-kehs can use the aid another action to help a single gnoph-keh create a much larger blizzard-every additional gnoph-keh who aids the first increases the area of the blizzard's radius by 20 feet. All gnoph-kehs wishing to aid the primary creature must be within the area of that gnoph-keh's cold aura. Once created, the blizzard remains active for 1 hour if it was created in a cold environment, or for 1 minute if created anywhere else. The wind in the blizzard's area blows in a clockwise circular pattern at windstorm speeds, restricts visibility as fog does, and makes the region count as difficult terrain. A gnoph-keh can move through a blizzard (either one created by magic or a naturally occurring blizzard) without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Cold Aura (Su)** A gnoph-keh radiates an aura of blistering cold in a 30-foot radius. Any creature that ends its turn within this area takes 2d6 points of cold damage. While in a blizzard (either one created by magic, such as the gnoph-keh's blizzard power, or a naturally occurring blizzard), any creature that takes damage from a gnoph-keh's cold aura must make a DC 22 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the numbing cold for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Heat Susceptible (Ex)** A gnoph-keh takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the effects of [high temperatures](rule/heat_dangers). When a gnoph-keh takes damage from heat in this way, and the damage is from temperatures in excess of 90 F, the damage the creature takes is always lethal damage. In these conditions, the gnoph-keh's cold aura does not function at all.",
			"",
			"**Icewalking (Ex)** This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the gnoph-keh climbs must be icy. The beast can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice.",
			"",
			"**Snow Vision (Ex)** A gnoph-keh can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The gnoph-keh is a six-legged horned creature vaguely akin to a polar bear in shape and outline, yet possessed of a cruel and creative intellect that elevates it from the rank of wild beast to murderous warmonger. Covered with a dense pelt of shaggy white fur, the gnoph-keh is equally at home walking on two, four, or six legs. The creature prefers to travel on all six when using its powerful charge or running, but rears up on its hind legs in combat to bring its four front claws to bear on its foes. With the gnophkeh's ability to call up and direct powerful blizzards matched to its ability to move and see in such conditions without any disadvantage, the creature is rightfully feared in the frozen realms where it dwells."

Goblin snakes delight in fresh meat, but strongly prefer having others bring it to them over hunting and killing it themselves.",

Goblin snakes are exceedingly jealous of nagas, however, envying their serpentine majesty and mastery of magic. Enterprising and cunning goblin snakes have been known to impersonate nagas, demanding tribute and food from gullible creatures in awe of the \"naga's\" supposed magical abilities. Some scholars have noted the superficial similarities between goblin snakes and nagas, and have gone as far as to theorize that the goblin snake might be a particularly weak breed of naga-a theory that most nagas do not appreciate at all.",
			"",
			"Although goblin snakes are not as smart as goblins, their terrifying shape allows them to take positions of inflated prominence within goblin society. Fearful goblins typically defer to the beasts, which well suits the goblin snakes' innate arrogance and sense of superiority. Goblin snakes affiliated with goblin tribes usually treat their goblin associates as servants at best and slaves at worst.",
			"",
			"Goblin snakes share goblins' fear of horses (who could easily step on and crush an unwary goblin snake) and love of fire (though their lack of arms gives them little opportunity to indulge in arson), but they are not as superstitious as goblins. Goblin snakes eagerly embrace magic if given the opportunity, and it is not uncommon for a goblin snake with adept, cleric, oracle, or sorcerer class levels to serve as a goblin tribe's shaman or high priest."

			"Frog-talkers are among the most feared of all goblins; most don't even want to be on the good sides of these witches. Frog-talkers are cruel and fearless masters. It's said the frog-talkers bathe in mud and leeches every fortnight to renew their dedication to their patron, the god of filth and blood-and based on their pale complexions and emaciated frames, few doubt it. These mysterious witches often live alone, or surround themselves with acolytes and terrified goblin minions given to them by superstitious chieftains.",
			"",
			"No two goblins will give you the same answer about why they fear frog-talkers. Some legends claim that the frog-talkers aren't real goblins, but swamp ghosts in disguise. Others claim that they're indeed goblins, but controlled by hideous brain-leeches that have wriggled into their ears. And still others say that worshiping the filth god is scary enough on its own.",
			"",
			"Regardless of what their origins may be, frog-talkers are powerful spellcasters who vomit up swarms of swamp creatures to do their bidding and fry disobedient minions with sizzling lightning. The only mortal creatures a frogtalker seems to truly respect are (naturally) frogs, and most keep a frog or toad on their person at all times. But the most worrying aspect of frog-talkers is that they don't appear to feel fear-an otherwise omnipresent aspect of goblin life."

A goezspall is 14 feet long and weighs 3,500 pounds, though some lore describes smaller and larger specimens."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The goldpebble is a stony-scaled water snake that came into existence thanks to a greedy Taldan alchemist of a forgotten time. This ambitious experimenter attempted to create a fecund creature whose body would turn to gold after it died, ensuring an endless supply of wealth with little effort. She found a water snake that bred in shallow pools and produced dozens of offspring, and its biology responded well to her initial tests. The original snake's scales contained trace amounts of minerals and served as a clever camouflage in the wild, and the alchemist combined magical techniques with selective breeding to coax the species' scales into naturally producing nuggets of gold.",
			"",
			"At first, the experiment seemed to be going well; early generations demonstrated traces of gold in their scales, and as they sloughed away their skin with age, the cast-off scales contained enough gold to justify the alchemist's efforts. However, the snakes grew in size with each generation, and soon the breeding pools the alchemist had created could not contain them. Worse, the amount of gold each snake produced didn't increase, but rather seemed to decrease until only glittering flakes remained.",
			"",
			"Frustrated, the alchemist redoubled her efforts and saturated the breeding pools with transmutative alchemical reagents, mercilessly culling any snakes that failed to produce new growth. While this did little to increase the mineral content of the creatures' scales, it did invest them with a supernatural venom that causes victims' blood to slowly turn to water. When the overzealous alchemist next came to harvest her treasured pets, the goldpebbles struck, killing her and escaping into a nearby stream; they can now be found all across the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"A fully grown goldpebble is about 12 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Goldpebbles are solitary creatures, except for when they gather during the twice-annual breeding frenzy for which the alchemist selected the original species as a test subject. They often lurk in rivers and streams, mimicking the smooth river stones along the bed and waiting for some unlucky wanderer to notice the shimmering traces of gold in their skin. Once the target is near, the creature ambushes the unsuspecting victim, sinking its narrow teeth into the target's skin and attempting to drag its target below the water. In addition, most goldpebbles have the unusual and instinctive ability to cause the water around them to grow extremely cold, making it harder for a surprised victim to hold its breath. Weaker prey will often succumb to this attack, drowning and settling to the river floor to serve as dinner for the goldpebble. However, even if the victim of the goldpebble's bite manages to escape, it's not yet out of danger. Hours after the attack, the victim's blood begins to transmute into frigid water. Symptoms of this transformation vary, though they often resemble anemia or frostbite, as vital nutrients and oxygen have trouble reaching their destination and the victim's body temperature plummets from the inside outward. If condition is left untreated, the frigid water bleed into the victim's lungs, causing it to drown.",
			"",
			"During the breeding season, goldpebbles are even more dangerous than usual. Gathering in shallow pools and lakes, they turn the water into a glimmering froth, laying and fertilizing eggs in the cold mud of the riverbed before returning to their usual streams. When the eggs hatch, hundreds of tiny snakes slither in every direction in search of territory. With little control over their ability to cool surrounding waters, the young goldpebbles sometimes unintentionally flash-freeze their nursery pool in this initial burst of activity. The tiny offspring that survive find their way into streams, wells, and even irrigation systems, sometimes striking at innocent passersby. Despite the juvenile snakes' diminutive size, the result for their victims is always the same: they end up gasping for breath on dry land, their skin turning chill and blue while their horrified loved ones look on.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Even though they are solitary ambush hunters, goldpebbles don't exist in an ecological vacuum. Several different creatures have adapted to the presence of goldpebbles, and the snakes have also learned to take advantage of the creatures that share their habitats.",
			"",
			"In the mineral-rich waters of caves or the runoff from mining operations, a goldpebble sometimes deliberately nests upstream of a basidirond, a plant creature that causes powerful hallucinations that can enhance the goldpebble's glimmering scales in the eyes of its potential prey. Once the goldpebble has made its kill, the victim's blood flows into the basidirond's roots. Of course, if this blood is mingled with the goldpebble's transmutative venom, it can lead to an unfortunate end for the basidirond. Another creature that benefits from proximity to the goldpebble is the giant dragonfly. These carnivorous insects take advantage of the water snake's ambush tactics, seeking out lurking goldpebbles and laying their eggs in the nearby shallows. When the giant dragonfly nymphs hatch, they swarm around the goldpebble, instinctively attempting to eat it but unable to break through its stony skin. When the goldpebble brings down a victim, though, the nymphs are often able to devour most of the kill before the goldpebble's transmutative poison can do its work. Goldpebbles in this situation have to be more aggressive in their hunting, since the nymphs consume a majority of their kills, and these goldpebbles tend to develop more brilliantly colored scales that better attract victims.",
			"",
			"### Gempebbles",
			"",
			"One of the side effects of its rapid breeding cycle is the goldpebble's ability to adapt to its environment. The alchemist's original manipulations of the goldpebble's mineral-laced scales have changed slowly over time in some subpopulations of the snake, meaning that some goldpebbles have scales that, instead of being struck through with streaks of gold, glitter like gems or other precious stones. There are clans of dwarves who attempt to capitalize on this adaptiveness despite the creature's dangerous poison. They harvest young goldpebbles and then pour them into crevices in deep caves, in locations where they suspect veins of precious gems exist but are too difficult or dangerous to mine effectively. When the surviving snakes are fully grown, they return to the more spacious caves of the mine as gempebbles, ready to be harvested-and just as likely as their gold-streaked cousins to attack their dwarven stewards."

			"These deadly golems are crafted with a technique that incorporates inubrix, a rare skymetal, into their bodies. Due to the extraordinary material used in their construction, these golems are extremely rare throughout most of Golarion, found only in places with access to skymetals or in places where those who can afford such unique materials reside. Inubrix's unique characteristics allow it to pass through iron and steel without any impact, as if it existed slightly out of phase with such metals. This strange property has given it the nickname of \"ghost iron.\" Weaponsmiths were initially excited to learn that it could penetrate metal armor with ease. However, the soft metal is too malleable for effective crafting; weapons made from inubrix are weaker than their normal counterparts, making them less effective. Alloys of inubrix with other metals failed to maintain its unique property to phase through iron, causing many smiths to see it as a strange curiosity and nothing of practical value.",
			"",
			"Because of its ghostlike properties, the odd metal has also earned a reputation for being related to necromancy, gluttony, and temperance. Some spellcasters report spectacular effects when using inubrix in the creation of magic items associated with necromancy, as the metal tends to accept magical enhancements from that magic school more readily than from other schools of magic. This has led enterprising golem crafters to create the first inubrix golems. Rather than being imbued with an elemental spirit like many golems, inubrix golems gain their animating spark from negative energy, which seems to resonate particularly well with the inubrix used in their construction.",
			"",
			"Though creators can craft these golems into any configuration they desire, most form inubrix golems that have a skeletal aesthetic. This grotesque appearance only adds to the necromantic mystique of the golem, its visage promising the one thing these monstrosities can deliver: a brush with death. These 11-foot-tall creations weigh about 5,000 pounds, but their [air walk](spell/air_walk) ability allows them to navigate difficult and unstable terrain with ease. They cannot speak, though at times their metal bodies emit a low bass rumble.",
			"",
			"Technic League engineers created the first inubrix golems in the golem forges of Numeria. Their captains hoped to use them as scouts and shock troops when exploring the vast and dangerous metal ruins that speckle the landscape. However, their inability to communicate makes inubrix golems poor scouts, and the properties bestowed from their inubrix components left them often unable to harm the robotic contraptions they were sent to destroy. Their use as bodyguards is limited, as they cannot stop or deflect iron weapons, but they make decent assassins and excellent traps when hidden behind a wall of iron. Enterprising captains used the creatures to attack and assassinate their rivals, but it wasn't long before Technic League officers started to line their strongholds with lead and other materials that the golems can't pass through.",

Each socketed stone grants the golem full access to the stone's abilities and benefits, as though it were orbiting the ioun golem. An ioun golem gains 10 temporary hit points for each ioun stone socketed in this manner, to a maximum of 60 temporary hit points if all slots are filled. Temporary hit points last for 24 hours and each socket can grant temporary hit points only once per day, regardless of how many ioun stones are placed within it during that period. A socketed ioun stone cannot be independently targeted, but it can still be the subject of a successful steal or sunder combat maneuver performed against the ioun golem. Socketing or removing an ioun stone is a move action.",

Ioun stones orbiting a creature that are brought within 60 feet of an ioun golem are immediately targeted by a steal combat maneuver using the ioun golem's CMB. Targets of this combat maneuver receive a +4 circumstance bonus to their CMD against this steal attempt. Any stones successfully stolen in this manner are pulled toward the ioun golem and can be immediately socketed into an available receptacle as a free action. If no free receptacles are available, the pilfered ioun stones orbit the ioun golem, granting the golem their powers as normal. Unattended or protected stones, such as those embedded in the skin or held inside a [wayfinder](magic/wondrous/wayfinder), are unaffected by this aura.

The golem's body is crafted to store magical energy and can even siphon further energy from other battery-like magical devices' specifically, the iconic Azlanti ioun stone. An ioun golem's frame has enough energy to keep itself animate for centuries without rest, but the addition of an ioun stone, even for a moment, extends the active cycle of an ioun golem into millennia. By quickly siphoning the innate power of a socketed ioun stone, the golem can unleash the stored energy as a blast of magical force.",

Those that survived are now scattered across the shattered continent, either long inactive without access to their ioun stone batteries or ceaselessly fulfilling their last orders. Across the eons since the fall of Azlant, only three ioun golems are officially recorded to have made their way to Avistan-washed ashore after untold millennia of inactivity. The Red Mantis are said to keep one as a defender within the Crimson Citadel on Mediogalti Island. Another remains dormant and unpowered in a museum in the heart of Oppara. The final ioun golem is cited in numerous archives as appearing briefly across the continent, fulfilling some as of yet unknown agenda.",

These golems no longer follow their original Azlanti masters but instead serve the powers truly responsible for their creation: the [veiled masters](monster/veiled_master). Seen as a status symbol among alghollthus, an ioun golem guardian demonstrates either the commanding veiled master's cunning in acquiring the construct or the veiled master's age and determination to survive.",

What few manuals remain on the subject of constructing an ioun golem may be found only in the most secure of Azlanti ruins, if any survive at all.

A panthereon gets no saving throw against magical attacks that deal electricity damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Carefully constructed to serve as tomb guardians and protectors of their creators and their treasure, panthereons are a variant of clay golems. The majority of these golems were created during the First Age in Osirion, though evidence of their existence has turned up beyond the nation's borders. A panthereon stands over 8 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. While its sculpted form may vary, it is typically muscular and wears no clothing save for a simple Osirian skirt.",
			"",

			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Osirion's golem makers dispute the notion that the panthereon's design was simply the work of some arcane crafter. Instead, many of them believe the inspiration for its creation was bestowed by the ancient gods themselves. The design for golems has changed little from their initial creation in the First Age, and most variations only came along during the end of the Second Age.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As mindless constructs, panthereons have no society or culture of their own. Scholars closely associate panthereons with the societal norms of Osirion during the period when the creatures were widely used as tomb guardians. Many panthereons have abilities tied to their creators, but most of these creators have long since perished, leaving the golems to act on their last given orders.",
			"",
			"### Construction",

			"A panthereon's body is carved from 1,000 pounds of clay mixed with the powdered bones of a purebred Osiriani cat that was either awakened or served as a bonded familiar.

Each one of these variants lists the new abilities, as well as any additional construction requirements and the additional cost in special materials required to create the variant.",
			"",
			"#### Esteemed (CR +0)",
			"",
			"The ultimate palace guard, an esteemed panthereon can take the form of a black house cat at will as a standard action. This allows the panthereon to guard a location without being seen as an obvious sentry. Esteemed panthereons can be commanded to change between house cat and guardian forms by their creator, or they can be made to do so under set conditions. Though not widely held, the superstitious belief that any house cat could be a disguised esteemed panthereon has led some to keep cats as a deterrent to thieves and vandals.",

Because slaves and prisoners are often a very valuable commodity, the slaver panthereon has the ability to, as a swift action, convert all of its attacks to nonlethal damage. When it does so, its slam attacks also gain the grab special ability. As another swift action, it can change its attacks back to dealing normal lethal damage (losing the grab ability in the process).

Instead, should that spell be cast on the golem or its creator (as long as the creator is within 60 feet), the spell is immediately countered, as by counterspell, requiring no action of the panthereon or its creator. Once used, the spell in the panthereon is gone, and a new spell (or the same spell) may be placed into it.",
			"",
			"In addition, if a spell bearer panthereon's creator casts a spell within 60 feet of the panthereon, the golem may mirror its creator, and also cast the same spell the following round. A spell bearer panthereon can use this ability once per day for any spell 3rd-level or lower.",

Once the ritual is complete and the panthereon is activated, the golem receives a +4 bonus on attacks against its named target and deals it an extra 2d6 points of damage. This additional damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. A true hunter can always detect the presence and location of its target so long as the target is within 1 mile.",
			"",

As time went on, Jistkan golem crafters also found that these golems proved equally useful on the front lines of battle. However, as Jistkan enemies began utilizing creatures from beyond the Material Plane, sand golems were eventually phased out in favor of bigger, more dangerous beings with far greater abilities. As conflicts with their neighbors eventually broke and scattered the Jistka Imperium, the knowledge of how to create these golems was lost to the sands of time.",

Each week, such a wax golem has a cumulative 1% chance of becoming sentient (so the second week the chance is 2%, the third week 3%, and so on, to a maximum of 5%). If this occurs, the golem gains an Intelligence score of 10, retroactive skill points, feats dependent on its Hit Dice, and 1 class level with the potential to gain more. It also gains a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate the specific individual it was crafted to appear as. A sentient wax golem ventures into the world and tries to live a life similar to that of the person (or type of person) it resembles. However, if the sentient wax golem ever encounters the person it is modeled after, it attempts to stealthily kill that person and take his place. The only way for a sentient wax golem to lose its sentience is either to take an amount of fire damage equal to half its hit points (which melts its features away) or to be destroyed.",

While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life.

Though these golems can look like anything from faceless, colorless drones to finely detailed reconstructions, they all share the commonality of being formed purely from hard wax. Most wax golem crafters choose to create these lifelike statues not for aesthetic purposes, however, but to undertake devious chores such as infiltration, espionage, or assassination.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Wax golems possess the mysterious ability of possibly gaining self-awareness, an attribute almost exclusively reserved for humanoid creatures born of natural means. By resembling a subject so greatly, wax golems have a small chance of gaining conscious thought and higher-level thinking, effectively manifesting their own sentience.",
			"",
			"This extraordinary ability has no logical explanation, though some constructors of these beings who have witnessed this transformation theorize that wax golems obtain self-awareness by watching humanoids over an extended period of time. Wax golems that spend a significant amount of time around people who mistake them for the subjects they resemble (such as golems sent to perform espionage) have an even greater chance of gaining sentience.",
			"",
			"Oddly, wax golems that gain sentience also develop the genuine belief that they are who they are modeled after. This notion is so strong that if such a wax golem were to encounter the individual it is modeled after, it would go to great lengths to exterminate the person and take his or her place in society, even adopting a code of morals and principles similar to those of the murdered subject. In this way, wax golems stealthily inject themselves into roles as diplomats, leaders, and authority figures, often to the detriment of people close to the usurped individual.",
			"",
			"So meticulously designed are wax golems, however, that few can identify a wax golem as a fraud, even when in close proximity. Along with sentience, wax golems achieve moderate intelligence, as well as the ability to communicate and speak. In order to mask the glossy sheen associated with their wax bodies, deceptive golems take special care to garb themselves in clothes that hide their peculiar complexions. They still do not eat, sleep, or breathe, but crafty golems easily avoid the complications associated with these trivialities. The only definitive clue a well-built wax golem cannot easily hide is the distinct texture of its skin, which, even to the most unobservant individual, does not feel anything like flesh. Because of this, wax golems tend to be aloof and secretive, never allowing any one person to get too close, a trait that does not go unnoticed by those well-acquainted with the original individual, who tend to pick up on the rather sudden shift in demeanor.",
			"",
			"Environmental hazards such as heat from the sun or cold precipitation have little effect on wax golems, though constant exposure to temperatures over 100 degrees for more than an hour does produce a rather odd sheen, and spending longer than a day in such weather begins to take its toll on the golem, dealing 1d4 points of fire damage every hour spent in the elements after the first.",

At the start of any round in which the shadow golem's aura interacts with an in-place darkness or light spell effect, that effect is automatically dispelled if the effect is from a spell whose level is 4th level or lower. If the effect is from a 5th-level or higher-level spell, the golem's shadow aura attempts to dispel the effect as if via greater dispel magic (CL 20th). The golem's shadow aura can attempt to dispel any amount of spells in this way, and if it fails to do so during one round, it can attempt to do so again at the start of each following round.",

Despite their muscular forms, they can move with surprising speed, and weigh much less than one might expect a muscle-bound statue to weigh. While the creator of a shadow golem can fashion the construct into any shape, a strange element of the way the animating magic mixes with the raw shadowstuff results in an unusual side effect-the facial features of all shadow golems are indistinct, with the exception of two glowing eyes that are difficult to spot in the cloak of shadows that surrounds every shadow golem.",

However, more visionary scholars and researchers understand that anything is possible when a passionate creator is involved-particularly when such a person draws on preternatural resources such as those available in the Shadow Plane.",

Their aggression toward all other creatures means that there are few to no predators or other prey animals in their grazing grounds. Each herd is led by a dominant bull; solitary gorgons are usually adolescent bulls driven out of their herd by the lead bull.",
			"",
			"Their flesh is tough but beefy (once the armored hide is removed), and to those who acquire the taste, quite filling. Many stone giant tribes believe eating gorgon meat enhances their own natural armor.

In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it slowly grows to its normal size between transformations.

If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender.

			"Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals or communities.",
			"",
			"The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its \"empty\" state only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the herald.",
			"",
			"As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the company of other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its sense of \"taste\" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability.",
			"",
			"Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity, the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and more embarrassing over the centuries."

			"**Plant Form (Ex)** Grasslings have a number of immunities common to plant creatures, including immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep effects, and stunning.",
			"",
			"**Thicket Stride (Ex)** Grasslings can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as briars, natural thorns, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to impede movement still affects grasslings.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Grasslings are sneaky, inquisitive fey creatures that populate wild grasslands. Resembling a crude, fourarmed doll made of long blades of green grass, a grassling's body contains virtually no flesh or muscle- just fresh, tough grass. Despite their fibrous construction, grasslings are made up of magic and whimsy as much as they are of vegetation; they are fey creatures, not plants.",
			"",
			"Each of a grassling's four arms ends in a hand with grass blades that protrude like claws. These claws are supernaturally sharp and can slice flesh with ease, although grasslings prefer stealth and deception to direct combat. Their excellent reflexes allow them to twist away from danger with great agility and reach hiding spots before an observer can blink. Grasslings are capricious and delight in playing pranks-which range from harmless to mean spirited-upon larger creatures.",
			"",
			"A typical grassling stands about 3 feet tall and weighs 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"Grasslings roam freely across the plains they call home, keeping out of sight of larger creatures and exploring as their whimsy strikes them. Grasslings value their freedom and mobility above all else and hate having their travels blocked or their lands curtailed.",
			"",
			"Formed from small seeds sprouted by a mature grassling parent, young grasslings are carefully planted in areas with plenty of sun and wind. A grassling's parent monitors the region closely to protect the immature grassling from predators or natural dangers. A grassling must grow for one full spring and summer-a period called \"rooting\"-before it can step out of the soil and walk on its own, and young grasslings frequently perish if uprooted early. Hence, a grassling's parent will uproot and transplant its young in only the most dire of situations. A grassling parent considers these few months of tending its immobile young to be both boring and confining, and it abandons the new grassling almost immediately once its ward can move on its own.",
			"",
			"Grasslings primarily subsist on small insects, which they skewer on their long claws and munch on at their leisure. When food is scarce, a grassling can bury its feet in the earth and draw sustenance from the soil, as when it was young, but this method of eating makes grasslings sluggish and cross.",
			"",
			"Although their bodies don't provide sustenance for carnivores, grasslings are particularly appealing to many herbivores. Drawn by the small fey's nutritious scent, herbivores are likely to attempt to nibble at any grassling that ventures within reach, and it doesn't take a grassling long to realize the dangers such creatures pose.",
			"",
			"Grasslings avoid direct confrontation with non-fey unless surprised or cornered. If a grassling expects trouble, it prefers to set simple traps or confound its opponents with trickery. Grasslings don't particularly care whether these tricks harm or even kill their opponents, so a blundering foe might stumble into a patch of poisonous thorns or pursue a grassling into the hunting ground of a vicious predator. Grasslings are good at tying knots quickly, particularly in vegetation, so tripwires and snares are common grassling traps.",
			"",
			"Grasslings can live to be many centuries old, but they are susceptible to blights that afflict mundane grasses. Older grasslings begin to yellow along their stems and lose their ability to deal bleed damage; eventually, their claws weaken and become so flimsy that the grassling cannot feed itself. With no other option, these elderly grasslings plant themselves in the ground and await death.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Grasslings live in wild plains and rarely travel into other terrains. They sometimes venture into farms, pastures, or other civilized open spaces near settlements, but such visits are usually short. Grasslings are uncomfortable with the ordered design and straight rows that appeal to civilized humanoids. Furthermore, pastures are occupied by large herbivores such as cows, horses, or sheep-creatures that make grasslings nervous-and fields sometimes contain scarecrows, which grasslings see as abominable totems attempting to mimic the grassling form. Yet, despite their misgivings, grasslings can't seem to avoid occasional trips into settled lands. Driven by their relentless curiosity, grasslings want to know who would contort nature in such ways and what pranks or trouble would most vex such creatures. This curiosity extends to constructed mechanisms. While unfamiliar with the purpose of most mechanical devices, grasslings are good at taking them apart or rigging them to fail in catastrophic ways. This is more often due to mere inquisitiveness rather than a surfeit of maliciousness, although some grasslings become deliberate saboteurs when presented with the opportunity.",
			"",
			"Grasslings enjoy the company of other fey and are sociable among their own kind. When they congregate together in groups, called tufts, they attempt to outdo each other with boasts and dares; invariably, these dares lead to reckless behaviors as the grasslings attempt to prove themselves braver, tougher, or more daring than their kin. As a result, permanent grassling communities are rare. With the exception of the minimal sentiment that connects a grassling parent to its child during rooting, grasslings aren't particularly attached to each other, and a grassling is likely to leave others to their fates if serious danger arises.",
			"",
			"Humanoids are fixated with taming the unusual and dangerous environments that grasslings call home; as a result, grassling friendships with humanoids are rare. The most significant exceptions are druids, elves, and other folk who inhabit natural environments peacefully; grasslings find more commonality with such creatures and might even befriend them. These companions frequently learn-often through necessity-that keeping a grassling occupied with a puzzle box or a mechanical toy prevents it from getting bored and wandering into danger or casually disassembling vital equipment.",
			"",
			"Most grasslings have a keen fascination with fire. Tales regarding the capricious creatures are relatively rare because grasslings are so few in number, but the fairy stories about them that circulate among humanoids nearly always end with a grassling becoming entranced by fire, approaching it too closely, and burning up. While these stories aren't true-grasslings are too green to be particularly flammable and too clever to accidentally immolate themselves-grasslings do indeed enjoy watching the chaotic dance of open flames and aren't above creeping near a traveler's campfire or setting something ablaze just to watch the flames. Older grasslings know how quickly a brushfire can sweep across the wild plains they call home, however, and aren't prone to starting fires that could damage their territory (although damaging someone else's is less of a concern)."

Once all squares of dirt above a creature's head have been removed, the creature can breathe, and can escape with a DC 15 Strength or Escape Artist check. A standing Medium creature typically has its head buried under 5 feet of earth (3,000 pounds). For a Small creature, this is increased to roughly 7 feet of earth (4,200 pounds).

Obsessed with their own deaths, gravebound can't travel far from their resting places, but they seethe with the need to inflict their fate upon others. A gravebound digs graves and attempts to bury victims alive in them, and wounds taken at its hands can cause a victim to appear to be dead. Each gravebound arises with a shovel attached to its back-a mark of its obsession- and those who slay a gravebound can take the shovel to assist buried allies before they suffocate."

			"Air: Flight (Su)-The graven guardian gains a fly speed equal to its base speed with average maneuverability and a Fly skill of +6 (this includes a +4 racial bonus). Animal: Beast Ward (Su)-Animals must make a Will save before they can attack the graven guardian. Any attack on an animal (but not its allies) by the graven guardian breaks this protection. Once the animal makes this Will save, it need not save again against that particular graven guardian on subsequent attacks. Artifice: Repair (Ex)-The graven guardian's fast healing increases to 5.

Community: Alliance (Su)-Adjacent worshipers and graven guardians dedicated to the same god gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves. Darkness: Darkness (Su)-The graven guardian can cast darkness two times per day as a spell-like ability. Death: Bleed (Ex)-The graven guardian's weapon deals 2 points of bleed damage on a hit. Destruction: Shatter (Ex)-The graven guardian can cast shatter two times per day as a spell-like ability. Earth: Rocky (Ex)-The graven guardian's natural armor bonus increases by +2. Evil: Evil Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon and slam attacks are treated as evil-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to good targets. Fire: Flaming (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon gains the flaming property. Glory: Glorious (Su)-The graven guardian's magic weapon and slam attack deal an additional 1d6 points of damage against undead creatures. Good: Good Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon and slam attacks are treated as good-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to evil targets. Healing: Recovery (Su)-Once per day, when reduced below half hit points, the graven guardian automatically heals 3d10+6 points of damage. Knowledge: Familiarity (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls again any creature it attacked in the past round. Law: Lawful Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapons and slam attacks are treated as lawful-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets. Liberation: Unfettered (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +4 bonus to its CMD. Luck: Lucky (Su)-Once per day, the graven guardian may roll a saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as the actual result. Madness: Confusion (Su)-The graven guardian can cast confusion once per day as a spell-like ability. Magic: Resistant (Su)-The graven guardian's SR increases by 5. Nobility: Honored (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks. Plant: Entangle (Su)-The graven guardian can cast entangle three times per day as a spell-like ability. Protection: Protected (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +2 bonus on all saves. Repose: Rest Eternal (Su)-Damage dealt by the graven guardian resists any magical healing. Attempting to use magical healing to cure this damage requires a successful caster level check against the guardian's SR. This ability does not affect natural healing or healing provided by extraordinary abilities. Rune: Rune Carved (Su)-Runes cover the graven guardian. Whenever the graven guardian takes energy damage or energy damage fails to overcome its SR, for the next round, its attacks deal +1d6 points of damage of that energy type. If more than one type of energy attack occurs in a round, roll randomly to determine what kind of extra energy damage it deals. Strength: Powerful (Ex)-The graven guardian gains Power Attack as a bonus feat. Sun: Dazzling (Su)-When the graven guardian scores a critical hit with its magic weapon, a bright flash blinds the target for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). Travel: Speedy (Su)-The guardian gains Mobility as a bonus feat, and all of its modes of movement increase by +10 feet. Trickery: Trip (Su)-The graven guardian gains the trip ability with its melee weapon and slam attacks. War: Enhanced (Su)-The enhancement bonus of the graven guardian's weapon increases to +2.

			"**Phase (Su)** A gray has the ability to become out of phase, allowing it to pass through walls or material obstacles. In order to use this ability, a gray must begin and end its turn outside of whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. A gray can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. This innate acumen with phasing also lets a gray begin and end its [blink](spell/blink) spell-like ability as a free action on its turn.",
			"",
			"**Probe (Su)** As a standard action, a gray can probe the mind of a single intelligent, conscious, helpless creature it touches. Each minute it can scan for an answer to a simple question (such as, \"Where is your family hiding\"?) or for information on a general topic the subject knows. In addition, as long as the gray has probed the subject for at least 1 minute, it can choose one Knowledge skill the subject has at least 1 rank in and make Knowledge checks using the subject's skill modifier instead of its own for the next 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Sensory Overload (Su)** Any creature hit by a gray's touch is stunned by sensory overload for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 16 Will save. A gray can't use sensory overload and probe at the same time, and must choose only one of these to use each time it touches a creature. The save DC is Intelligence-based.",
			"",
			"**Sleep Paralysis (Su)** As a standard action, a gray can paralyze a sleeping creature within 30 feet that it can see. Targets who succeed at a DC 17 Will save remain asleep and are immune to the same gray's sleep paralysis for 24 hours. A creature who fails awakens and is paralyzed for 1d6 minutes. Any attack or hostile action other than a gray's probe ability ends this paralysis. If the paralysis is not interrupted early, at the end of its duration the victim falls back asleep and has no memory of the event, as if its memory were eliminated by [modify memory](spell/modify_memory). The creature attempts a Will save against the memory erasure, and if it succeeds it remembers the paralysis and probing but with imperfect clarity. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Intelligence-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Enigmatic grays travel the Material Plane in search of knowledge and living specimens for research, yet little is known about their motivations or where exactly they come from. Stories of encounters with these creatures often take the form of poorly remembered nightmares from those who experience a gray's sleep paralysis. Some abductees recall being brought aboard the grays' vast, otherworldly vessels and subjected to nightmarish experiments, while others have vivid but terrifying memories of being confined in cramped, dark places that are seemingly alive. In spite of the differences in their experiences, those who have encountered grays universally find their presence alien, condescending, and sinister. Grays' movements and expressions are disturbing and inhuman, and their intentions remain inscrutable. Through telepathic contact with the beings, their victims detect a constant, unwavering malevolence. Beyond that, the grays' faces and full, black eyes show little emotion. Their movements are efficient, and they frequently spend several seconds in deliberation before each move they make. They seem to communicate with their own kind using only telepathy, forgoing even body language or eye contact."

Others were originally benign, intended to enhance crops and clean them of pests or combat diseases, but malfunctioned and abandoned their programming. Nanites have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such controlled swarms are capable of relatively complex decision making, and they might spare the treasure their victims carry, for instance, allowing their masters to better loot the bodies.",

Medical nanites can infest a host body, using their infest ability, but choose not to damage the creature itself, instead surgically targeting invasive organisms, functioning as a remove disease spell with a caster level equal to the swarm's hit dice. Crafter nanites can dismantle objects to build others, as fabricate, and potentially even do the same with flesh, as regenerate."

Renders are gifted with immense strength, and some reports claim to have witnessed a gray render uprooting a fully grown tree and tearing it to splinters in order to catch prey hiding within. Gray renders actively avoid forming groups or communities with their own kind, and perhaps only tolerate the presence of other renders when it is time to mate. Some sages claim they are asexual, but it is more likely they are hermaphrodites able to self-fertilize, and reproduce only rarely.",
			"",
			"Despite its solitary existence, a gray render often develops an affectionate bond with other creatures, typically a herd of herbivores or a small tribe of humanoids, but in some cases a solitary denizen of its swamp. The render acts as a guardian for this creature or creatures, never straying more than a mile away, running to protect them if they are attacked, and providing an offering of meat once each day, as might a domesticated cat. A gray render never harms its protected creatures, and retreats in confusion if they attack it. Most animal \"pets\" grow to accept its presence, and primitive humanoid \"pets\" often believe their guardian is a sign of favor from the gods. A render's bond may last from a few months to as long as 10 years, after which it wanders to a new territory and ignores its former favorites.",

			"",
			"**Deific (Su)** A green man grants divine spells to worshipers. This does not require any specific action on the green man's behalf. The domains granted by a green man vary according to the green man's alignment. Most green men are neutral and grant access to the domains of Plant, Protection, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. A neutral good green man grants access to the domains of Good, Plant, Protection, and Weather and to the subdomains of Defense, Growth, Purity, and Seasons. A neutral evil green man grants access to the domains of Evil, Plant, Strength, and Weather and to the subdomains of Decay, Growth, Resolve, and Seasons. Regardless of his alignment, a green man's favored weapon is the sickle. If a druid worshiping a green man chooses to take a domain, the druid must choose the Plant domain, regardless of alignment. The green man's holy symbol is that of a masculine face made of leaves, but the exact expression and appearance of the face varies by green man, and each is unique in detail.",
			"",
			"**Green Caress (Su)** Non-plant living creatures within 60 feet of a green man slowly begin to transform into non-magical plants. Treat this effect as the spell green caress, save that the green man need not touch a creature to begin the effect. A creature must attempt a DC 36 Fortitude save against this effect once upon first entering the aura. If successful, that creature partially resists the effect as per the spell description and is immune to that particular green man's aura for 24 hours. On a failed save, the effect persists until the creature transforms or the effect is removed (unlike with the spell, it is not limited to a maximum duration of 7 days). Also unlike the spell, this effect is not contagious, and a spellcaster who attempts to stop this green caress via break enchantment, miracle, polymorph any object, remove curse, or wish does not risk becoming targeted by the effect. This aura, being supernatural in nature and not a spell or spell-like ability, cannot be stopped via dispel magic. A green man can select creatures to be unaffected by his aura as an immediate action, but he must be aware of them to grant such clemency, and he cannot reverse the effects of the aura once inflicted.

			"**Summon Plants (Sp)** Three times per day as a swift action, a green man can summon any combination of plant creatures whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This otherwise works like the [summon](umr/summon) universal monster rule with a 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.",

			"**Thorns (Su)** A green man's thorns are ranged touch attacks with a range increment of 120 feet. A creature damaged by a green man's thorn moves at half speed and can't take 5-foot steps, fly, or use air walk, either naturally or magically, until the target or another creature pulls out the thorn as a full round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",

Most care little for other aspects of nature, from animals to geology, focusing exclusively on the flora of their home forest and the seasonal impact of weather. They grant spells enthusiastically to intelligent plants that worship them and somewhat more hesitantly to other sentient races who prove themselves friends of plants. Sometimes called \"leshy kings\" in esoteric texts, the enigmatic green men are said to be the ones who first taught druids the secrets of creating leshies, yet they themselves are far more powerful than these tiny creations.",
			"",
			"Most green men keep out of the way of the \"animal races\" as long as they leave the forest alone, while the rare benevolent and malevolent green men actively spread their influence over their home forests. Benevolent green men are kindly and nurturing patriarchs to all within their domain, even non-plants. Their territories are blessed with beautiful flowers and peaceful groves. Malevolent green men are twisted and sadistic bullies, and are fortunately the rarest of these paragons of plant life. Their territories are marred with poisonous plants, thorny vines, and twisted trees. What few animals remain in such regions are either vicious enough to stand up to their plant tormentors or are allowed to remain to provide sport."
