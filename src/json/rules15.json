The standard methods for creating monsters and NPCs are similar to those for creating player characters, but striking the right power balance can be challenging.",
			"",
			"The simple monster creation system presented here lets you create a monster and have it ready for your table quickly. This means bending the normal rules to cut out time-consuming steps, such as picking a ton of 1st-level spells a monster is unlikely to cast, selecting magic items according to an NPC's budget, or recalculating statistics based on spell effects. Rather than making you build a monster from scratch, this system uses baselines derived from [Table 1-1: Monster Statistics by CR](rule/step_2_target_statistics). This gives you the flexibility to start off with almost-final statistics and make a few adjustments as needed to create a formidable unchained monster."

			"The arrays presented in this section allow you to quickly derive the statistics for three broad types of monsters. Each one allows for a fair amount of customization-especially through monster options-but the monster's statistics stay close to the baselines set by PC progressions and [Table 1-1 in the Bestiary](rule/step_2_target_statistics). The options roughly correspond to the combat, skill, and spell roles used for monster advancement in the normal monster creation system. Therefore, if you were to recreate a monster with the combat role (such as an ogre or vrock), you would start with the combatant array. You can choose whichever array you prefer, unless the monster is meant to mimic an NPC created with a character class from [Step 2](rule/step_2_creature_type_or_class_graft) or a template from [Step 4](rule/step_4_template_graft). The three arrays are as follows.",
			"",
			"***Combatant:*** Any monster that focuses primarily on its physical power uses the combatant array. High attack bonuses, hit points, and defenses are the defining traits of this array. A combatant's skills are weak, and the majority of its options are in the combat category. Most creatures of low or no Intelligence should be combatants, as should intelligent monsters with combat training.",
			"",
			"***Expert:*** A monster uses the expert array if it's focused on skills, interaction, or cunning tactics. This array provides moderate statistics in most areas, but strong skills and extensive monster options. The expert array is the ideal way to replicate skill-based NPCs such as rogues or bards. In many cases, expert monsters are more likely to attempt tricking or befriending the PCs than fight.",
			"",
			"***Spellcaster:*** If a monster relies primarily on spells, it uses the spellcaster array. Though the monster's statistics are typically weak overall, it gains access to a sizable number of spells from the lists in [Step 6](rule/step_6_spells). Because this system uses benchmark numbers instead of calculating individual statistics, a monster that uses its spells primarily to increase its own abilities (so that it can become a strong melee combatant, for instance) should use the array that best matches the way it will be used in the game rather than using the spellcaster array just because it can cast magic."

In this case, look ahead to the [class grafts](rule/class_grafts) and use the array required by the class you desire. Keep in mind that a monster with class levels typically has a CR equal to its class level - 1, so if you want your monster to have particular level-dependent class abilities, you'll want to use the statistics for a CR that's 1 lower than the target class level.",

			"In the simple monster creation system, you don't use the normal calculations to generate your monster's final statistics. Instead, you take the numbers directly from the array, then make a few adjustments based on grafts and monster options later along in the process. In other words, if the array says the monster's Fortitude saving throw bonus is +11, that number is its total bonus-it's assumed to already include all bonuses from Hit Dice, classes, Constitution modifier, and magic items, regardless of later adjustments.",
			"",
			"Each array consists of two tables: the first contains most of the monster's statistics and choices, and the second contains the array's options for attacks and damage values. To start creating your monster's statistics, find the table with the appropriate array and go to the row for your monster's desired CR. Record the statistics from that row according to the following guidelines.",
			"",
			"CR, AC, Saving Throws, CMD, hp, and DCs: Record these numbers as they appear on the table. A few of these might change in later stages, but there aren't any additional choices to make for these numbers during this step of the process. Note that for AC, the first number is the normal AC, the second is touch AC, and the third is flat-footed AC. For saving throws, you can swap one save with another to better suits your monster. The two DC columns are used for all the monster's abilities and spells. For any ability that isn't a spell, use the ability DC listed. For any spell the monster can cast, add the spell's level to the number from the spell DC column. Use the spell's cleric or sorcerer/ wizard level if multiple classes can cast it. If neither of those classes has the spell, use the highest spell level listed in the spell's description.",
			"",
			"***Ability Modifiers:*** For this step, you'll assign the modifiers for the monster's three most important ability scores. You can use whatever criteria you like to assign the ability modifiers; each array's section gives suggestions for typical choices. All other abilities have a modifier of +0, though you can give the monster a penalty if thematically appropriate. Note that these entries are the ability modifiers, not the ability scores, since you'll primarily use them as the default modifiers for skill checks and ability checks. Write down the ability modifier assignments you've chosen.",
			"",
			"***Skills:*** All skills are divided into two categories, representing those the monster has mastered and ones it's merely good at. The number with the plus before it is the skill's bonus, and the number in parentheses indicates how many skills the monster gets at that level of expertise. For instance, a master entry of \"+11 (2)\" means that the monster gets two skills at +11, and any other \"master skills\" that grafts provide will also be at +11. These bonuses are assumed to include the monster's ability score bonuses, ranks, feats, and racial modifiers as appropriate to get the value given here. Write down the monster's good and master bonuses, and note how many skills it has with each bonus. Because grafts can alter a monster's number of skills or bestow or deny specific skills, you'll decide on specific skills in [Step 8](rule/step_8_skills).",
			"",
			"***Options:*** Most of a monster's abilities beyond its base statistics come from monster options. There are four categories of options: combat, magic, social, and universal. Each entry lists how many options of a given category that monster can take, with \"any\" meaning that there's no category restriction for those options. Make a note of how many options of each type the monster gets. You define the options in [Step 7](rule/step_7_monster_options).",
			"",
			"***Attacks and Damage:*** The second table shows four options for a monster's attacks. Two columns show weapon-based attacks, one with a high bonus and one with a low bonus. Use the higher attack and damage values for the monster's main attack. If the monster has additional attacks that are less powerful, use the lower attack and damage values for those attacks-a creature that's primarily a ranged attacker would use high values for its longbow attacks and low values for its longsword attacks. You can mix and match these values. For example, since ranged attacks typically deal less damage, you might have a longbow attack use the high attack value but the low damage value.",
			"",
			"The remaining two columns are for natural attacks-either two attacks (two slam or claw attacks, for example) or one powerful primary attack and two weaker secondary attacks (such as a bite and two claws). At some levels, a monster might have a negative number for an attack bonus; this means that number of attacks is probably too strong for a monster of that CR. These entries are included for completeness.",
			"",
			"The number in parentheses indicates the amount of damage each attack deals. For example, an entry that reads \"+10/+5 (10)\" means that when the monster makes a full attack, it makes one attack at +10 and one at +5, and that each attack deals an average of 10 points of damage. An entry reading \"1 at +10 (10), 2 at +5 (5)\" indicates that the monster would make one attack at +10 that deals 10 points of damage and two at +5 that deal 5 points of damage each.",
			"",
			"Write down the attack bonuses and the damage for the monster's attacks. In [Step 9](rule/step_9_damage), you'll assign dice to the damage values. If your monster should have a number of attacks different from what you see here (four tentacle attacks, for example), that section includes advice for how to alter the monster's attacks using [Table 1-1](rule/step_2_target_statistics).",

The theme entry suggests the main ability scores, skills, and monster options the monster might take. Spellcaster entries also include suggested spell lists. All these listings are simply suggestions, and are provided to point you toward the best monster options quickly.",
			"",
			"***Main Statistics:*** Most statistics for the monster array appear on the large table at the bottom of the left-hand page, organized by CR.",

			"If you want to replicate a class without using the indicated array, do so without using the class graft. For example, if you wanted to create a cleric monster with the combatant array, you could still achieve a cleric's flavor by choosing the secondary magic option in Step 7. This essentially replicates a cleric built under the standard creation system that took combat feats and pre-casts many of its spells to give itself combat bonuses.",

			"***Statistics Adjustments:*** These change or replace some of the baseline numbers, skills, and options given by the monster's array. Apply the adjustments as written. Any skill listed replaces one of the choices of skills the monster gets from its array (with either a master or good bonus, as specified). If a monster gains additional skills above the normal allotment, this entry lists \"one additional master skill\" or \"one additional good skill.\" The adjustments might also specify options, which replace the allotted options the monster gets from its array.",

			"***CR Entries:*** These adjustments replicate advancement by level. Apply only the highest entry to your monster: a CR 3 rogue would get the CR 3 line, but not the CR 1 line. Options gained from these entries replace options granted by the monster's array. It's possible the class graft will add more options than the monster's array allows; that's fine, and as usual you can selectively add or remove bonus options if you need to do so to make the monster function in a thematically appropriate way. See Step 7 for descriptions of these options.",

			"***Suggested Ability Modifiers:*** This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's ability score bonuses, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the barbarian lists \"Strength, Constitution, Dexterity,\" meaning that when making a CR 1/2 barbarian, you would give it a +3 Strength modifier, a +2 Constitution modifier, and a +1 Dexterity modifier.",
			"",
			"***Suggested Options:*** These entries offer suggestions for cases in which the monster's array grants additional monster options beyond those determined by the class graft. They typically mimic flexible character class options, such as barbarian rage powers or rogue talents (see [Step 7](rule/step_7_monster_options)).",

			"Options are the main way to specialize your monster. They represent feats, universal monster rules, magic items, and all the other abilities a monster has at its disposal beyond its statistics. There are a large number of monster options to choose from, especially compared to the number of choices you make during the other steps of the simple monster creation process. Some are active abilities (such as those that give the monster a special attack), others adjust statistics (such as the power attack option, which has the same purpose as the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat), and still others grant conditional modifiers (such as combat casting's bonus to concentration checks). Unless specified otherwise, saving throw DCs in this section use the Ability DC from the monster's array, modified by the monster's grafts."

			"Look at the number of monster options you're supposed to choose based on the monster's array and grafts. You should have a list saying how many to pick of each category. When you pick an option, write down the option's name and effects. Adjust any statistics the option's entry tells you to. After you've selected all the monster options you're supposed to, look at the list carefully. Does the monster do everything it needs to do? Does it seem like it has too few or too many options? Using your best judgment, add or remove options as necessary.",
			"",
			"***Categories:*** Monster options are divided into four categories: combat, magic, social, and universal.",
			"",
			"*Combat options* are the most numerous, and most monsters the PCs are meant to face in battle should have at least one combat option. These options are subdivided to make them easier to choose based on the monster's theme, though you can choose from any combat option subcategory. Decide whether the monster is primarily cunning, powerful, quick, or tough, and look in that subcategory first. These subcategories correspond roughly to physical ability scores-Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, respectively. One additional category, monstrous, lists options that are rarely appropriate for monsters of PC races, such as energy drain or regeneration.",
			"",
			"*Magic options* benefit monsters that cast spells, and are typically useful only to those with the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal monster option. They also include some options that mimic PC class features of a magical nature. These options are divided into the creature, offensive, support, and versatile subcategories.",
			"",
			"*Social options* give a monster advantages in interactions with other creatures. These are divided into the inspiration and miscellaneous subcategories. The inspiration subcategory includes mostly effects that bolster morale or cause fear.",
			"",
			"*Universal options* can be chosen as though they were listed in any category. This means you can use a combat, magic, social, or \"any\" option to take a universal option.",
			"",
			"***\"Any\" Options:*** When a graft or array tells you to choose \"any\" option, you can take an option from the combat, magic, social, or universal category.",
			"",
			"***Feats:*** If you're looking to replicate a certain feat, look for its name in Table 5-7. Note that many monster options use the same names as feats but have different mechanical effects. This is intentional. The power attack option adjusts the monster's statistics once, applying an effect similar to the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat, but making it simpler to use rather than having you choose each time the monster attacks. In a case like this, if you prefer to have the added complexity and flexibility, you can use the feat's rules instead.",
			"",
			"***Universal Monster Rules:*** As with feats, many of these options mimic but simplify universal monster rules. Other monster rules, such as senses, can be used as-is and aren't repeated in this section.",
			"",
			"***Duplicate Options:*** Generally speaking, you can choose an ability more than once when it makes sense and is useful. For example, you might give a monster the extra attack option twice because it fights with two weapons, one of which is a [speed](magic-enhancement/speed) weapon. Use your best judgement to determine whether it's a good idea to do so.",
			"",
			"***Damage:*** Many options say to use the high or low attack or damage value from the monster's array. Use the values from the high or low weapon attack and damage columns, not the natural attack values (even if the option is more like a natural attack thematically). You can choose to use a lower value if the ability would deal too much damage otherwise.",
			"",
			"### Universal Monster Rules",
			"",

Often these refer to the entry in the appropriate Bestiary volume, sometimes with notes on how to simplify the ability.

			"#### Substitutions",
			"",
			"Some universal monster rules are very similar to other combat options, but the combat options use a different name because they're meant to be easier to understand with a quick look.

			"#### Unmodified Rules",
			"",
			"Most universal monster rules not mentioned herein can be used as written. Unless they have a major effect on the monster's combat abilities, it's not worth counting them against the suggested number of options the monster can take. Senses, for example, are not covered in this section, and can be used as-is without costing the monster any options. Assume that weaknesses (such as [light blindness](umr/light_blindness) or vulnerabilities) also fall into this category and can be used unmodified.",

All of these changes are fair game! Just keep an eye out for balance when you deviate from the baseline, and compensate elsewhere if necessary.

			"The GM wants to create a monster much like the traditional medusa: a humanlike creature with serpents for hair and the ability to turn her enemies to stone. He also wants to make her a skilled archer and focus on that set of abilities. He wants to use the medusa at the same level that she'd normally appear, so he chooses CR 7 (and the medusa's Hit Dice are treated as 7 as well).

			"",
			"***Step 1:*** Array",
			"",
			"This medusa should be a formidable enemy, so the GM chooses the combatant array. He fills out her statistics from the CR 7 entry on [Table 5-1](rule/combatant_array). She has AC 22, touch 13, flat-footed 16. Her saving throw bonuses are: Fortitude +8, Reflex +8, and Will +6. Her CMD is 24, and she has 93 hit points. The GM makes a note of all these statistics, and won't need to change any of them unless a later graft or option alters them.",
			"",
			"Next, the GM makes a note of the remaining values he'll be deciding on later. The monster's special abilities will have a DC of 15. He doesn't plan to give her spells, so he skips the spell DC column. Since he's already pretty sure how he wants the medusa's ability modifiers to shake out, he gives her a +6 Dexterity modifier, a +4 Constitution modifier, and a +2 Charisma modifier. Her initiative ends up being +6, matching her Dexterity modifier. He marks down that he'll later pick one master skill with a +15 modifier and two good skills with +12 modifiers. In Step 7, he'll also pick one combat option and one option from any category.",
			"",
			"The last things to record from the arrays are the medusa's attacks. He wants her to be best at ranged attacks, so he uses the high weapon attack column for a longbow attack, marking down attack bonuses of +13/+8 and noting that he'll later pick a value adding up to 22 points of damage. For her melee attacks, she uses the snakes that make up her hair, and the GM decides that she uses the low weapon attacks table since she's primarily focused on ranged attacks. He marks down a +10/+5 attack bonus that deals 16 points of damage.",
			"",
			"Her attacks and damage are significantly stronger than those of the monster in the Bestiary. The GM decides to leave them this way for now, planning to compensate by weakening some of her other abilities in later steps.",
			"",
			"***Step 2:*** Creature Type or Class Graft",
			"",
			"Since the medusa is a monstrous humanoid, the GM applies the automatic traits for that creature type graft, giving her darkvision 60 feet. After toying with using the ranger class graft, he decides that doesn't really fit with his concept for the monster. Instead, he uses the monstrous humanoid graft, increasing the medusa's Reflex to +10 and Will to +8, and increasing her attack bonuses to +12/+7 for her snake hair attack and +15/+10 for the longbow. He looks at the elective adjustment of one additional good skill and decides not to give her the extra good skill.",
			"",
			"***Steps 3-6:*** Skipped Steps",
			"",
			"The medusa doesn't need a subtype, isn't based on a template, is size Medium, and doesn't have spells, so the GM skips steps 3 through 6. Most monsters created using this system will skip at least one or two steps of the monster creation process.",
			"",
			"***Step 7:*** Monster Options",
			"",
			"The GM is sure that he wants the medusa to have a petrifying gaze attack. Because the gaze option uses the same rules as the pre-existing [universal monster rule](umr/gaze), the GM writes down a gaze with a 30-foot range that turns targets to stone permanently. He uses the ability DC from the combatant array: 15. This ability uses up the medusa's one combat option, leaving her with one option from any category. The GM adds poison to the snake bite attack, and decides that the medusa can apply it to her arrows too. Choosing the poison option gives him the base statistics of the poison plus two advantages, plus an additional two advantages since the medusa is CR 7. He ends up with a poison that is: type injury, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d3 Str, cure 2 consecutive saves. This is pretty close to the poison in the Bestiary, though with a lower DC, which is what the GM wants. Though an ability such as all-around vision could be replicated by giving the medusa unflankable as a bonus monster option, the GM decides against that to help compensate for the medusa's stronger attacks.",
			"",
			"***Step 8:*** Skills",
			"",
			"The medusa will have one master skill and two good skills. The GM picks Perception as the master skill instead of leaving it at its default of good, since that fits an archer. The medusa now has Perception +15. For the good skills, he wants one social skill and one physical skill that uses the medusa's Dexterity, so he gives her Intimidate +12 and Stealth +12.",
			"",
			"***Step 9:*** Damage",
			"",
			"The longbow attack will deal a total of 22 points of damage, using a d8 damage die (since it's a longbow). The GM finds the 21-23 row and 1d8 column on Table 5-9: Damage Dice Values, learning that the attack should deal 1d8+18 points of damage. Thinking about it further, the GM wants to roll more damage dice, just to make the monster's damage a little more variable and sort of like the [Manyshot](feat/manyshot) feat. So instead, he uses 2d8+12. The melee attack will deal 16 points of damage using a d4, which turns out to be 1d4+14.",
			"",
			"### Reality Check",

			"Looking back over the monster, the GM thinks that the petrifying gaze plus the powerful attacks make the medusa too powerful. He decides that the part that seems strangest is the damage, particularly since the medusa uses a longbow and gets to deal poison with all her attacks.

			"***Options:*** For the three combat options given by its array, the pit fiend has constrict, damage reduction, and improved combat maneuver (grapple), which also gives it bonuses on CMB checks made to grapple and to CMD against grapple checks.

These advantages are removing the onset, changing the frequency to 1/round for 6 rounds, increasing the ability damage three times, increasing the cure to 2 consecutive saves, and two advantages invented specifically for this monster: increasing the frequency to 1/round for 10 rounds, and increasing the cure to 3 consecutive saves. As a nod to classic pit fiends, the monster can regenerate from wounds, but the regeneration amount is so low for its level that it doesn't cost an option. Its diseased bite is also free, since it won't matter much in high-level combat. The devil has a bonus option for its fear aura, and doesn't spend any options for its spells, but these additions are reasonable for a high-level villain such as the pit fiend.

			"The piecemeal armor system splits up armor into three general types of armor pieces. An armor piece is a small group of armor parts, rather than simply being any discrete part of the armor. A single armor piece comprises the armor parts one needs to protect its corresponding area-either the arms, the legs, or the torso (including the head); a single arm or leg armor piece provides armor for both arms or both legs, respectively. A plate arm armor piece typically consists of pairs of pauldrons, gardbraces, rerebraces, vambraces, and gauntlets along with bits of chainmail and padded armor, while a chain lamellar arm armor piece consists of two chain sleeves, gauntlets, and perhaps pairs of pauldrons and couters. Both protect the arms, though they have a different number of specific parts and types of overall components.",

			"The protective qualities of each individual piece of armor are listed in Table 5-7: Arm Armor Pieces, Table 5-8: Leg Armor Pieces, and Table 5-9: Torso Armor Pieces. If a character has only one armor piece, that piece is considered the totality of her armor, and she uses the statistics of that piece as her armor. If a character is wearing more than one armor piece, she add the armor costs, armor bonuses, and weights of the armor pieces, and takes the worst maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and speed limitations from among the various armor pieces to determine the full statistics and qualities of the armor she is wearing. As long as she is wearing a single armor piece, she is considered to be wearing armor for any effects that rely on wearing armor (such as the fighter class's armor training and armor mastery).",
			"",
			"If a character is wearing all three categories of armor pieces, she is wearing a suit of armor. Suits of armor can have all armor pieces of the same type (all three plate pieces make a suit of full plate), or a mixture of armor pieces (a plate arm armor piece and torso armor piece combined with a chainmail leg armor piece creates a suit of half-plate).",
			"",
			"Wearing an entire suit, whether its pieces are mixed or the same type, grants a +1 armor bonus on top of the protection the combination of pieces already grants the wearer. Wearing a mixed suit of armor increases the arcane spell failure chance by 5% because of the awkwardness of the design. Wearing less than a full suit of mixed armor does not increase the wearer's arcane spell failure chance. For example, if you wear a breastplate with a plate arm armor piece and a chain leg armor piece, you should consult Table 5-5: Half-Plate Suit Pieces for your armor's statistics. The top line lists the cost, bonuses, penalties, and so on for the half-plate suit as a whole, and the lines below list the statistics for the component pieces, as well as the benefits that result from the pieces constituting a suit.",

			"Hit points are an abstraction. When a fighter gains a level, his body does not suddenly become more resistant to damage. A sword's strike does not suddenly do proportionately less damage. Rather, hit points suggest that the fighter has undergone more training, and while he may have improved his ability to deal with wounds to a small degree, the hit points gained at higher levels reflect less his capacity for physical punishment and more his skill at avoiding hits, his ability to dodge and twist and turn. Each loss of hit points, in this case, suggests that he is becoming progressively less nimble over the course of combat-in other words, that the decreasing hit points are a marker for his overall endurance and condition.

For these creatures, the flesh of a creature that has been dead for more than 1 hour staves off withdrawal but does not grant any other benefits, such as feeding bonuses (see below).",
			"",
			"If an undead creature can sate its hunger by feeding on a living creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher, it gains the following benefits from the feeding. These benefits are in addition to any listed in the creature's feeding-related ability.",
			"",
			"The first benefit - deeply desirable even to barely sentient undead - is the euphoric rush of feeding, which fills the feeder with a sense of power, domination, and focus. The undead gains a +1 resistance bonus on Will saves for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"The undead gains a +2 resistance bonus on all saves against spells and effects from creatures that have the same alignment as the target of the feeding. It is because of this effect that vampires so often feed on the innocent and pure, since most of their would-be slayers are of a similarly noble and good disposition.",
			"",
			"The undead gains a +4 competence bonus on Survival checks to track creatures of the same type as the target of the feeding. This bonus increases to +8 when the undead is tracking the specific creature on which it fed. The target creature is considered \"very familiar\" for the purposes of divination spells and effects cast by the undead."
