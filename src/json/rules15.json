Since a character's subsequent attacks have a bonus that's so much lower, this can lead to a lot of time spent on missed attacks. With this new system, an entire full attack resolves with a single d20 roll. Other sorts of attacks (such as attack actions, attacks of opportunity, and attacks granted by the [Whirlwind Attack](feat/whirlwind_attack) feat) are resolved as normal."

Effects that trigger on a hit do not trigger on a glancing blow. If your attack result equals or exceeds the target's AC, you score a hit, plus one additional hit for every 5 by which your roll exceeds that target's AC, up to your maximum number of hits. At first level, you can score a maximum of only one hit, but at base attack bonus +6 and at every +5 to your base attack bonus thereafter, you can score another.

When attempting to move through your foe's space, your foe can choose to allow you to pass through and let you continue your movement. If the foe doesn't choose to or can't let you move past, you attempt an overrun combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you move through the target's space. If your check exceeds your foe's CMD by 5 or more, you move through the target's space and the target is knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, it gains a bonus to its CMD against overrun combat maneuvers equal to +2 for each additional leg it possesses. If you fail this check, your movement stops in the space directly in front of the opponent.",

			"**Spell Combat (Attack, Complex):** You make an attack roll with a light or one-handed melee weapon, then cast a spell on the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action. You take a -2 penalty on the melee attack, but the spell is cast regardless of whether the attack hits. If you cast the spell defensively, you can subtract your Intelligence bonus from the result of the attack roll to add the same value as a circumstance bonus on the concentration check. You must have the [spell combat class feature](class/magus) to take this action, and can take this action only once per turn. To take this action, you must have one hand free.

As long as you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can draw a weapon as a free action at any point during the charge. At the end of the charge, you gain a +2 bonus on any melee attacks, bull rush combat maneuver checks, or overrun combat maneuver checks you attempt until the end of your turn, as long as those attacks or combat maneuver checks are made against the creature you designated when you charged.",
			"",
			"**Concentrate to Maintain an Active Spell (2 Acts):** You concentrate to maintain an active spell.",

			"**Continue a Grapple (2 Acts):** You continue a grapple. If you initiated the grapple, you must either take this action at the start of each subsequent turn or end the grapple as a free action.

			"",
			"**Disable Device (Complex; At Least 3 Acts):** You attempt to unlock a lock or disable another device. For every round the action takes, you must commit 3 acts. These acts may or may not need to be consecutive based on the nature of the device. For example, acts committed to open a lock or disable a trap must nearly always be consecutive. The GM may rule that some complex devices take more than 3 acts to disable; for example, a complex arcane machine that will cause a devastating calamity in 1 minute could take 10 acts to disable, though the acts may not need to be consecutive.",

			"",
			"**Provide First Aid, Treat a Wound, or Treat Poison (Complex; 2 Acts):** You provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison using the Heal skill.",
			"",
			"**Push an Animal (3 Acts):** You attempt a Handle Animal check to get an animal to perform a trick it doesn't know but is physically capable of doing, or to push the animal to its limits.

Characters with animal companions, such as druids or rangers, can push their companions as simple actions instead.",
			"",
			"**Reposition (Combat; 2 Acts):** You attempt a reposition combat maneuver check against a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you.

			"",
			"**Spellstrike (Complex; 2 Acts):** You cast a spell from the magus spell list with a range of touch, but instead of making a touch attack, you make a melee attack with a weapon you are wielding.

			"",
			"**Steal (Combat; 2 Acts):** You attempt a steal combat maneuver check against a foe within your melee reach (not counting expanded reach from reach weapons). You must have at least one hand free, and must select the item to be stolen before attempting the check.

If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power.

This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4)."

			"To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.",
			"",
			"**Pricing the Base Item:** First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the [normal rules for creating magic items](unknown/normal_rules_for_creating_magic_items). Then, using the column on [Table 4-13](unknown/table_4-13) that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level.",
			"",
			"**Adding Scaling Abilities:** Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.",
			"",
			"**Adding Unlockable Abilities:** Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) so well.",
			"",
			"**Adding Spells:** Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. Table 4-14: Spell Prices includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does [fireball](spell/fireball)), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for [fireball](spell/fireball). Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.",
			"",
			"Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.",
			"",
			"**Assigning an Unlock Level:** Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).",

Commanders of undead legions often wield such rods as symbols of authority. Changing the weapon's type can be used to signal a change in strategy for the undead horde, with the mace indicating a steady march, the morningstar calling for an aggressive assault, a flail indicating a retreat, and so on.",

This array provides moderate statistics in most areas, but strong skills and extensive monster options. The expert array is the ideal way to replicate skill-based NPCs such as rogues or bards. In many cases, expert monsters are more likely to attempt tricking or befriending the PCs than fight.",
			"",
			"**Spellcaster:** If a monster relies primarily on spells, it uses the spellcaster array. Though the monster's statistics are typically weak overall, it gains access to a sizable number of spells from the lists in [Step 6](rule/step_6_spells). Because this system uses benchmark numbers instead of calculating individual statistics, a monster that uses its spells primarily to increase its own abilities (so that it can become a strong melee combatant, for instance) should use the array that best matches the way it will be used in the game rather than using the spellcaster array just because it can cast magic."

			"You might create a monster that should use the statistics for a character class, either because the monster would normally be created by adding class levels to the monster or because you think the monster's abilities are similar enough to those of a character class that it would be quicker to start with the class. In this case, look ahead to the [class grafts](rule/class_grafts) and use the array required by the class you desire. Keep in mind that a monster with class levels typically has a CR equal to its class level - 1, so if you want your monster to have particular level-dependent class abilities, you'll want to use the statistics for a CR that's 1 lower than the target class level.",

			"In the simple monster creation system, you don't use the normal calculations to generate your monster's final statistics. Instead, you take the numbers directly from the array, then make a few adjustments based on grafts and monster options later along in the process. In other words, if the array says the monster's Fortitude saving throw bonus is +11, that number is its total bonus-it's assumed to already include all bonuses from Hit Dice, classes, Constitution modifier, and magic items, regardless of later adjustments.",
			"",
			"Each array consists of two tables: the first contains most of the monster's statistics and choices, and the second contains the array's options for attacks and damage values. To start creating your monster's statistics, find the table with the appropriate array and go to the row for your monster's desired CR. Record the statistics from that row according to the following guidelines.",
			"",
			"CR, AC, Saving Throws, CMD, hp, and DCs: Record these numbers as they appear on the table. A few of these might change in later stages, but there aren't any additional choices to make for these numbers during this step of the process. Note that for AC, the first number is the normal AC, the second is touch AC, and the third is flat-footed AC. For saving throws, you can swap one save with another to better suits your monster. The two DC columns are used for all the monster's abilities and spells. For any ability that isn't a spell, use the ability DC listed. For any spell the monster can cast, add the spell's level to the number from the spell DC column. Use the spell's cleric or sorcerer/ wizard level if multiple classes can cast it. If neither of those classes has the spell, use the highest spell level listed in the spell's description.",
			"",
			"**Ability Modifiers:** For this step, you'll assign the modifiers for the monster's three most important ability scores. You can use whatever criteria you like to assign the ability modifiers; each array's section gives suggestions for typical choices. All other abilities have a modifier of +0, though you can give the monster a penalty if thematically appropriate. Note that these entries are the ability modifiers, not the ability scores, since you'll primarily use them as the default modifiers for skill checks and ability checks. Write down the ability modifier assignments you've chosen.",
			"",
			"**Skills:** All skills are divided into two categories, representing those the monster has mastered and ones it's merely good at. The number with the plus before it is the skill's bonus, and the number in parentheses indicates how many skills the monster gets at that level of expertise. For instance, a master entry of -+11 (2)- means that the monster gets two skills at +11, and any other \"master skills\" that grafts provide will also be at +11. These bonuses are assumed to include the monster's ability score bonuses, ranks, feats, and racial modifiers as appropriate to get the value given here. Write down the monster's good and master bonuses, and note how many skills it has with each bonus. Because grafts can alter a monster's number of skills or bestow or deny specific skills, you'll decide on specific skills in [Step 8](unknown/step_8).",
			"",
			"**Options:** Most of a monster's abilities beyond its base statistics come from monster options. There are four categories of options: combat, magic, social, and universal. Each entry lists how many options of a given category that monster can take, with \"any\" meaning that there's no category restriction for those options. Make a note of how many options of each type the monster gets. You define the options in [Step 7](unknown/step_7).",
			"",
			"**Attacks and Damage:** The second table shows four options for a monster's attacks. Two columns show weapon-based attacks, one with a high bonus and one with a low bonus. Use the higher attack and damage values for the monster's main attack. If the monster has additional attacks that are less powerful, use the lower attack and damage values for those attacks-a creature that's primarily a ranged attacker would use high values for its longbow attacks and low values for its longsword attacks. You can mix and match these values. For example, since ranged attacks typically deal less damage, you might have a longbow attack use the high attack value but the low damage value.",
			"",
			"The remaining two columns are for natural attacks' either two attacks (two slam or claw attacks, for example) or one powerful primary attack and two weaker secondary attacks (such as a bite and two claws). At some levels, a monster might have a negative number for an attack bonus; this means that number of attacks is probably too strong for a monster of that CR. These entries are included for completeness.",
			"",
			"The number in parentheses indicates the amount of damage each attack deals. For example, an entry that reads -+10/+5 (10)- means that when the monster makes a full attack, it makes one attack at +10 and one at +5, and that each attack deals an average of 10 points of damage. An entry reading -1 at +10 (10), 2 at +5 (5)- indicates that the monster would make one attack at +10 that deals 10 points of damage and two at +5 that deal 5 points of damage each.",
			"",
			"Write down the attack bonuses and the damage for the monster's attacks. In [Step 9](rule/step_9_damage), you'll assign dice to the damage values. If your monster should have a number of attacks different from what you see here (four tentacle attacks, for example), that section includes advice for how to alter the monster's attacks using [Table 1-1](rule/step_2_target_statistics).",

That's because such spells are often cast before combat, and the simple monster creation system assumes the effects of those spells are already in the monster's base numbers.",

			"Options are the main way to specialize your monster. They represent feats, universal monster rules, magic items, and all the other abilities a monster has at its disposal beyond its statistics. There are a large number of monster options to choose from, especially compared to the number of choices you make during the other steps of the simple monster creation process. Some are active abilities (such as those that give the monster a special attack), others adjust statistics (such as the power attack option, which has the same purpose as the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat), and still others grant conditional modifiers (such as combat casting's bonus to concentration checks). Unless specified otherwise, saving throw DCs in this section use the Ability DC from the monster's array, modified by the monster's grafts."

			"",
			"Look at the number of monster options you're supposed to choose based on the monster's array and grafts. You should have a list saying how many to pick of each category. When you pick an option, write down the option's name and effects. Adjust any statistics the option's entry tells you to. After you've selected all the monster options you're supposed to, look at the list carefully. Does the monster do everything it needs to do? Does it seem like it has too few or too many options? Using your best judgment, add or remove options as necessary.",
			"",
			"**Categories:** Monster options are divided into four categories: combat, magic, social, and universal.",
			"",
			"*Combat options* are the most numerous, and most monsters the PCs are meant to face in battle should have at least one combat option. These options are subdivided to make them easier to choose based on the monster's theme, though you can choose from any combat option subcategory. Decide whether the monster is primarily cunning, powerful, quick, or tough, and look in that subcategory first. These subcategories correspond roughly to physical ability scores' Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, respectively. One additional category, monstrous, lists options that are rarely appropriate for monsters of PC races, such as energy drain or regeneration.",
			"",
			"*Magic options* benefit monsters that cast spells, and are typically useful only to those with the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal monster option. They also include some options that mimic PC class features of a magical nature. These options are divided into the creature, offensive, support, and versatile subcategories.",
			"",
			"*Social options* give a monster advantages in interactions with other creatures. These are divided into the inspiration and miscellaneous subcategories. The inspiration subcategory includes mostly effects that bolster morale or cause fear.",
			"",
			"*Universal options* can be chosen as though they were listed in any category. This means you can use a combat, magic, social, or \"any\" option to take a universal option.",
			"",
			"**\"Any\" Options:** When a graft or array tells you to choose \"any\" option, you can take an option from the combat, magic, social, or universal category.",
			"",
			"**Feats:** If you're looking to replicate a certain feat, look for its name in Table 5-7. Note that many monster options use the same names as feats but have different mechanical effects. This is intentional. The power attack option adjusts the monster's statistics once, applying an effect similar to the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat, but making it simpler to use rather than having you choose each time the monster attacks. In a case like this, if you prefer to have the added complexity and flexibility, you can use the feat's rules instead.",
			"",
			"**Universal Monster Rules:** As with feats, many of these options mimic but simplify universal monster rules. Other monster rules, such as senses, can be used as-is and aren't repeated in this chapter.",
			"",
			"**Duplicate Options:** Generally speaking, you can choose an ability more than once when it makes sense and is useful. For example, you might give a monster the extra attack option twice because it fights with two weapons, one of which is a [speed](magic-enhancement/speed) weapon. Use your best judgement to determine whether it's a good idea to do so.",
			"",
			"**Damage:** Many options say to use the high or low attack or damage value from the monster's array. Use the values from the high or low weapon attack and damage columns, not the natural attack values (even if the option is more like a natural attack thematically). You can choose to use a lower value if the ability would deal too much damage otherwise.",
			"",
			"### Universal Monster Rules",
			"",
			"Some options listed in this section grant a monster the use of a universal monster rule. Often these refer to the entry in the appropriate Bestiary volume, sometimes with notes on how to simplify the ability. When a universal monster rule is gained through this system, use the ability DC from the monster's array instead of calculating the DC by the formula listed in the rule's entry in the Bestiary.",
			"",
			"If you want to give a particular universal monster rule to a monster, look for it in the lists below. Most universal monster rules that aren't appropriate for player races appear in the section of monstrous combat rules.",
			"",
			"#### Simplified Rules",
			"",
			"The following universal monster rules have been recreated as options in this system, typically to simplify them or give concrete values for numbers that aren't defined in the original universal monster rule.",
			"",
			"These rules are: [bleed](umr/bleed), [blood drain](umr/blood_drain), [breath weapon](umr/breath_weapon), [channel resistance](umr/channel_resistance), [constrict](umr/constrict), [damage reduction](umr/damage_reduction), [disease](umr/disease), [distraction](umr/distraction), [energy drain](umr/energy_drain), [engulf](umr/engulf), [fast healing](umr/fast_healing), [frightful presence](umr/frightful_presence), [immunity](umr/immunity), [incorporeal](umr/incorporeal), [natural attacks](umr/natural_attacks), [poison](umr/poison), [poisonous blood](umr/poisonous_blood), [powerful charge](umr/powerful_charge), [rake](umr/rake), [regeneration](umr/regeneration), [rend](umr/rend), [rock throwing](umr/rock_throwing), [sound mimicry](umr/sound_mimicry), [spell resistance](umr/spell_resistance), [stench](umr/stench), [telepathy](umr/telepathy), [trample](umr/trample).",
			"",
			"#### Substitutions",
			"",
			"Some universal monster rules are very similar to other combat options, but the combat options use a different name because they're meant to be easier to understand with a quick look. The following list describes these, and shows in parentheses the name of the monster option to use instead: [ability drain](rule/ability_score_damage,_penalty,_and_drain) (ability damage), [all-around vision](umr/all-around_vision) (unflankable), [blood rage](umr/blood_rage) (rage), [fear](umr/fear) (fear aura/fear attack), [grab](umr/grab) (improved combat maneuver), [natural invisibility](umr/natural_invisibility) (constant invisibility), [powerful blows](umr/powerful_blows) (power attack), [pull](umr/pull) (repositioning attack), [push](umr/push) (repositioning attack), [resistance](umr/resistance) (energy resistance), [rock catching](umr/rock_catching) (rock throwing), [spell-like abilities](umr/spell-like_abilities) (either the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal option), [summon](umr/summon) (summon allies).",
			"",
			"#### Unmodified Rules",
			"",
			"Most universal monster rules not mentioned elsewhere in this sidebar can be used as written. Unless they have a major effect on the monster's combat abilities, it's not worth counting them against the suggested number of options the monster can take. Senses, for example, are not covered in this section, and can be used as-is without costing the monster any options. Assume that weaknesses (such as [light blindness](umr/light_blindness) or vulnerabilities) also fall into this category and can be used unmodified.",
			"",
			"Other universal rules that can be used without modification, but which should be counted against the monster's number of options are [attach](umr/attach), [burn](umr/burn), [capsize](umr/capsize), [change shape](umr/change_shape), [curse of lycanthropy](umr/curse_of_lycanthropy), [fast swallow](umr/fast_swallow), [ferocity](umr/ferocity), [fortification](umr/fortification), [gaze](umr/gaze), [pounce](umr/pounce), [web](umr/web) (using the monster's CR as its Hit Dice to determine the web's hit points), [whirlwind](umr/whirlwind)."

Additionally, choose one physical ability modifier. This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks, skill checks, and ability checks that use that ability modifier.",
			"",
			"**Constant Invisibility:** Because of its natural appearance or an exterior effect, such as a cloak of invisibility, this monster is invisible at all times. If this ability is used below CR 10, it should be for monsters that aren't focused on combat.",
			"",
			"**Fast Feint:** The monster can attempt a Bluff check to feint as a move action.",

If you do, whenever the monster hits with an attack of that type, it can automatically attempt a combat maneuver of the type chosen with this option.",

			"**Mage Punisher:** Whenever an enemy within the monster's reach successfully casts a spell defensively, that enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster after the spell is complete.",
			"",
			"**Poison:** The monster uses poison with its attacks, either through a natural weapon or by applying the poison to a particular manufactured weapon. The target of a successful attack with the chosen weapon must attempt a Fortitude save to resist the poison. The basic poison is type injury,",
			"",
			"onset 1 minute, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, effect 1d2 points of damage to any one ability score (chosen when the monster gains this option), cure 1 save.

			"",
			"**Repositioning Attack:** When it hits a creature of its size or smaller with a certain type of attack, the monster can immediately attempt a reposition combat maneuver check to push or pull that creature. Its CMB for this check increases by 4. The distance the monster pushes or pulls the creature can increase under certain conditions, such as if the monster has special appendages.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack:** When flanking or attacking a foe denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, this monster deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 CR the monster possesses. Decrease the base damage of the monster's attacks by 2 points for every 1d6 of sneak attack it has.",
			"",
			"**Team Fighter:** The monster gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against targets that are threatened by one of the monster's allies (other than itself ). This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 CR the monster possesses.",

			"**Trap Squares:** The monster can trap any square adjacent to it as a standard action.

Start by combining the damage values in the monster's array: a monster that deals 20 points of damage with two natural attacks should deal 40 points of damage total. If the monster has a large number of secondary attacks (which are less likely to hit), increase the total damage value by 25% or 50%. Finally, divide the total among all attacks before using the table. You don't have to distribute it evenly if some attacks should deal less damage.",

			"",
			"### The Golden Rule",
			"",
			"This system lets you quickly design a monster that's ready for use at the table, so it cuts some corners so that creating the monster doesn't require as many steps or calculations. This means you won't always get exactly what you want, and you'll need to eyeball the monster as it comes along to make sure it fits your concept. The golden rule of creating monsters is that you can change whatever you need to if it helps make the monster work the way you want.",
			"",
			"If a monster needs more combat options than the grafts suggest, give it more. Give the monster extra spells if it's meant to have a more versatile selection. The natural attacks columns of the array tables go up to only three attacks, so if you have a creature with six tentacles, give it six attacks and use the average damage value from Table: Monster Statistics by CR to calculate the damage for each. All of these changes are fair game! Just keep an eye out for balance when you deviate from the baseline, and compensate elsewhere if necessary. The guidelines from Table: Monster Statistics by CR still apply for monsters created using this system."

			"This long-form example gives a detailed breakdown of monster creation from start to finish, resulting in a new medusa archer. This illustrates the steps of the process, and shows how to think about creating a monster using this variant system. Throughout, it compares the new medusa to the [original](monster/medusa).",
			"",
			"### Monster Concept",
			"",
			"The GM wants to create a monster much like the traditional medusa: a humanlike creature with serpents for hair and the ability to turn her enemies to stone. He also wants to make her a skilled archer and focus on that set of abilities. He wants to use the medusa at the same level that she'd normally appear, so he chooses CR 7 (and the medusa's Hit Dice are treated as 7 as well). He knows some other basic details: the medusa is a lawful evil monstrous humanoid, her size is Medium, and she has a base speed of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Step 1:** Array",
			"",
			"This medusa should be a formidable enemy, so the GM chooses the combatant array. He fills out her statistics from the CR 7 entry on [Table 5-1](rule/combatant_array). She has AC 22, touch 13, flat-footed 16. Her saving throw bonuses are: Fortitude +8, Reflex +8, and Will +6. Her CMD is 24, and she has 93 hit points. The GM makes a note of all these statistics, and won't need to change any of them unless a later graft or option alters them.",
			"",
			"Next, the GM makes a note of the remaining values he'll be deciding on later. The monster's special abilities will have a DC of 15. He doesn't plan to give her spells, so he skips the spell DC column. Since he's already pretty sure how he wants the medusa's ability modifiers to shake out, he gives her a +6 Dexterity modifier, a +4 Constitution modifier, and a +2 Charisma modifier. Her initiative ends up being +6, matching her Dexterity modifier. He marks down that he'll later pick one master skill with a +15 modifier and two good skills with +12 modifiers. In Step 7, he'll also pick one combat option and one option from any category.",
			"",
			"The last things to record from the arrays are the medusa's attacks. He wants her to be best at ranged attacks, so he uses the high weapon attack column for a longbow attack, marking down attack bonuses of +13/+8 and noting that he'll later pick a value adding up to 22 points of damage. For her melee attacks, she uses the snakes that make up her hair, and the GM decides that she uses the low weapon attacks table since she's primarily focused on ranged attacks. He marks down a +10/+5 attack bonus that deals 16 points of damage.",
			"",
			"Her attacks and damage are significantly stronger than those of the monster in the Bestiary. The GM decides to leave them this way for now, planning to compensate by weakening some of her other abilities in later steps.",
			"",
			"**Step 2:** Creature Type or Class Graft",
			"",
			"Since the medusa is a monstrous humanoid, the GM applies the automatic traits for that creature type graft, giving her darkvision 60 feet. After toying with using the ranger class graft, he decides that doesn't really fit with his concept for the monster. Instead, he uses the monstrous humanoid graft, increasing the medusa's Reflex to +10 and Will to +8, and increasing her attack bonuses to +12/+7 for her snake hair attack and +15/+10 for the longbow. He looks at the elective adjustment of one additional good skill and decides not to give her the extra good skill.",
			"",
			"**Steps 3-6:** Skipped Steps",
			"",
			"The medusa doesn't need a subtype, isn't based on a template, is size Medium, and doesn't have spells, so the GM skips steps 3 through 6. Most monsters created using this system will skip at least one or two steps of the monster creation process.",
			"",
			"**Step 7:** Monster Options",
			"",
			"The GM is sure that he wants the medusa to have a petrifying gaze attack. Because the gaze option uses the same rules as the preexisting [universal monster rule](umr/gaze), the GM writes down a gaze with a 30-foot range that turns targets to stone permanently. He uses the ability DC from the combatant array: 15. This ability uses up the medusa's one combat option, leaving her with one option from any category. The GM adds poison to the snake bite attack, and decides that the medusa can apply it to her arrows too. Choosing the poison option gives him the base statistics of the poison plus two advantages, plus an additional two advantages since the medusa is CR 7. He ends up with a poison that is: type injury, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d3 Str, cure 2 consecutive saves. This is pretty close to the poison in the Bestiary, though with a lower DC, which is what the GM wants. Though an ability such as all-around vision could be replicated by giving the medusa unflankable as a bonus monster option, the GM decides against that to help compensate for the medusa's stronger attacks.",
			"",
			"**Step 8:** Skills",
			"",
			"The medusa will have one master skill and two good skills. The GM picks Perception as the master skill instead of leaving it at its default of good, since that fits an archer. The medusa now has Perception +15. For the good skills, he wants one social skill and one physical skill that uses the medusa's Dexterity, so he gives her Intimidate +12 and Stealth +12.",
			"",
			"**Step 9:** Damage",
			"",
			"The longbow attack will deal a total of 22 points of damage, using a d8 damage die (since it's a longbow). The GM finds the 21-23 row and 1d8 column on Table 5-9: Damage Dice Values, learning that the attack should deal 1d8+18 points of damage. Thinking about it further, the GM wants to roll more damage dice, just to make the monster's damage a little more variable and sort of like the Manyshot feat. So instead, he uses 2d8+12. The melee attack will deal 16 points of damage using a d4, which turns out to be 1d4+14.",
			"",
			"### Reality Check",
			"",
			"Looking back over the monster, the GM thinks that the petrifying gaze plus the powerful attacks make the medusa too powerful. He decides that the part that seems strangest is the damage, particularly since the medusa uses a longbow and gets to deal poison with all her attacks. He decides to trim the damage down as though the medusa were 2 CR lower. The longbow attack now deals 2d8+6 points of damage, and the snake bite deals 1d4+8 points of damage.",
