The rod can contain one spell at a time; casting a new spell into it replaces the older one. As long as a spell is contained within the rod, the brass cage glows as brightly as a candle. The wielder of a rod of perilous pits can use the rod when casting a pit spell (create pit, hungry pit, and similar spells with \"pit\" in their names). Doing so changes that spell's casting time to a full-round action (or adds 1 round, if the casting time is already at least 1 full round). After successfully casting the pit spell, the rod's wielder can choose to manifest the contained spell inside the summoned pit. The contained spell manifests at the bottom of the pit, but does so after creatures have attempted their initial saves to avoid falling in. This allows the caster to center spells with a duration of instantaneous (such as fireball) or spells with longer durations (such as stinking cloud) within the pit.",

				"This white, slender rod is engraved with decorative emblems of elephants, jackals, alligators, and other wild beasts, and is worth 2,000 gp because of its masterful craftsmanship. The wielder can command the obedience of golems within 120 feet when she activates the device (a standard action), bypassing their immunity to magic and any other resistances to magic they may possess. Up to 300 Hit Dice worth of golems can be ruled at once with an ivory baton. Ruled golems obey the wielder as if she were their creator. Still, if the wielder attacks a ruled golem or gives it a command that is obviously harmful to it, the magic is broken. An ivory baton can be used for 500 total minutes before crumbling to dust. This duration need not be continuous. For each golem ruled beyond the first, multiply the number of minutes expended by the number of golems ruled (so, for example, a creature wielding an ivory baton to control three golems effectively expends 3 minutes of the rod's total duration every minute).",

Once she does, she discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter her body. This flame persists inside of her for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving her the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, she feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using any means at her disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils.
