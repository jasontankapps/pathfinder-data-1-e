For example, such a creature can use [earthquake](spell/earthquake) to disturb an earthbound ward set against it because the spell targets an area, not the markings itself.

As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash.

With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane.

If she already has this feat, she gains a +20 competence bonus on skill checks to harvest material components from the specific creature or haunt and the gp value of those components doubles.

Once a creature's true name is divulged by the manifestation of the Book of the Damned's list of true names, the caster can use that information how he sees fit, but abuse of the information will likely have repercussions. For example, a caster who gains a reputation for spreading a powerful fiend's true name far and wide could find himself hunted by a wide range of powerful fiends, all eager to see the caster destroyed. Such reprisals rise not out of any sort of familial devotion to the inconvenienced fiend but purely from self-defense, for who is to say which fiend's true name might next be publicized by such a careless caster?"

Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses. Heavily fortified stone structures, such as castles and city walls, are sturdy enough to withstand this ritual. Any magical building or room receives a Fortitude save to repel the plants."

During the ritual, the primary caster reveals meticulous details about the victim's demise to the secondary casters, describing in anatomical detail the damage done to the individual and pointing out visual cues on the corpse, all while connecting the methods of execution to the teachings of the mantis god [Achaekek](faith/achaekek), patron of the assassin order. During the ritual, the secondary casters must use a giant mantis claw to draw blood from themselves in a place where the corpse was damaged; in the case of poisons and similar effects, the location can be symbolic. If the corpse took damage in many different locations, the secondary casters must draw blood from themselves in the place where the victim sustained the most damage.",

An assassinated body used in a failed scarlet vigil occult ritual cannot subsequently be used in another such ritual. Since failing to correctly perform this ritual unravels the primary caster's assassination and puts all casters at risk, high-level Red Mantis members choose their secondary casters carefully, sometimes watching them for months to determine whether they are worthy of participating, as well as seeking guidance from senior leadership and Achaekek concerning which novices are the best choices."

The seal must already be affixed to the object to be animated (usually a mannequin or statue), and the outsider must be available within the ritual area and contained (via [binding](spell/binding), a [magic circle](spell/magic_circle_against_evil), or similar magic). Upon successful completion of the ritual, the outsider is bound to loyal service within the seal for a year and a day, losing access to most of its powers and memories and treating the object to which the seal is affixed as its new body. Such animated servitors were most often used as guardians or bodyguards, but also sometimes served as assassins.",

A trusted minion or ally can cast this spell on the caster's behalf; it's common for a spellcaster to gain a [cacodaemon](monster/cacodaemon), [imp](monster/imp), or [quasit](monster/quasit) familiar so that it can use its [commune](spell/commune) spell-like ability for this purpose.

At any point thereafter but before a year has passed, the caster must offer a significant sacrifice to her fiendish patron as a burned offering in a temple consecrated to the fiend. This offering can be either living or dead, but the burned offering must be of someone who is related to the caster by blood or family (such as a spouse or an adopted parent or child) and the caster and the offering must once have shared a positive emotional connection such as love or pride. If this ritual fails, the caster can try again, although the number of attempts she can make is limited in that each new attempt requires a burned offering of a different relative. Once the second apotheosis is successful, part of the caster's body transforms into something fiendish as proof of her patron's favor. Use the various [fleshcraft](unknown/fleshcraft) grafts to model these partial transformations; the specific transformation granted is up to the GM, but typical results include claw gauntlet or wings of darkness.

Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).",
			"",
			"Life Force: A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested &times; 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp.",
			"",
			"Age: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.",
			"",
			"Flavor: As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of Desna might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way."

			"At some point after the primary caster contacts her fiendish patron (typically after she succeeds at the [second ritual](spell/second_apotheosis), but sometimes before), the fiend sends the primary caster a vision of a task she must complete (such as freeing a bound evil outsider from a Material Plane prison or assassinating a powerful cleric of a good-aligned religion). This task is typically one of significance to the fiend, and in many cases it is one that the primary caster has no hope of completing until she grows more powerful. There is no time limit for how long the primary caster has to complete this task, but she must perform weekly devotions to her fiendish patron in the intervening time in the form of regular worship and continued atrocities in the fiend's name. Additional burned offerings to the demon, assaults on innocents, and betrayals of allies are popular choices. Once the assigned task is completed, the primary caster can perform the third apotheosis. Unlike the first and second rituals, the third apotheosis allows for the use of secondary casters, yet it carries a much greater risk for failure. If the primary caster succeeds, she permanently gains the [half-fiend template](template/half-fiend) and becomes eligible to undertake the [fourth apotheosis](spell/fourth_apotheosis)."
