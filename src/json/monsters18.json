			"Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places, which they protect from the depredations of predators and careless humanoids.

Nixies are 4 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds.",
			"",
			"Nixies avoid combat if possible, using charm person to lead humanoids away from their lairs. They sometimes use this ability to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast water breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming small communities if their numbers are great enough. Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location.",

			"In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous waters.

The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out.",

			"**Child-Scent (Ex)** A nochlean has the [scent](umr/scent) ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, the nochlean could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but it could not sniff out the child's parents or the den mother.",
			"",
			"**Music Susceptibility (Su)** A nochlean is sensitive to music of all kinds, and different styles of music affect the nochlean in different ways. A creature within 20 feet of a nochlean can attempt to affect the creature with a Perform (keyboard, percussion, sing, string, or wind) check made as a standard action or when used to initiate another effect, such as a bardic performance. The nochlean must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the result of the Perform check or become affected by the music for as long as the music persists. The nochlean is sickened by keyboard instruments, shaken by percussion instruments, enraged (per the [rage](spell/rage) spell) by singing, staggered by string instruments, and confused by wind instruments. The nochlean can be affected by only one type of music at a time; if it fails its saving throw against multiple types of music, only that with the highest Perform check result applies.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Predatory fey that delight in vandalizing homes, murdering pets, and stealing children, nochleans resemble incredibly thin, gangly humanoids with coarse black hair, large yellow eyes, and wickedly sharp claws. Their most recognizable features, however, are their extraordinary large ears. A nochlean's earlobes are several feet long, and it usually keeps them wrapped around its neck like a scarf or draped over its hands to conceal its claws from casual notice.",
			"",
			"Nochleans enjoy their wicked activities, frequently tittering from the shadows as they plan to raid a home, murder livestock, or lure away a lonely child. Nochleans are bold and crafty schemers who attack only when they feel like they have the advantage. A nochlean's careful plans evaporate in the presence of music, however, as the notes echoing around in their large ears affect them in erratic ways. Most nochleans flee from any source of music, and many tales tell of lone travelers unknowingly repelling the lurking creatures with casual whistling.",
			"",
			"A nochlean stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"Nochleans have lived at the edges of humanoid societies for millennia, their predations serving as a warning to children of all races and creeds to stay with their protectors and be wary of strangers. Nochleans are aware that humanoids use tales of their presence to frighten others, and they revel in the role thrust upon them and the depth of fear it can instill.",
			"",
			"Nochleans are gaunt and eerily slinky, as though perfectly built to hug shadowed corners, slither through windows, or extend a gangly arm from under a bed. They rely on stealth, suspense, and their alien appearance to frighten foes, as their build is narrow and hardly imposing. Still, to a child, nochleans stand frightfully tall. Nochleans usually wear simple clothes stolen from humans, but they generally have little use for propriety or modesty. Their long ears twitch frequently, particularly in response to sudden noises. When tracking by scent, a nochlean bends low to the ground, its dragging ears funneling odors toward its sniffing nose. A nochlean's claws are long and sharp, although its hands have a supernaturally narrow appearance. Their claws are remarkably agile despite their size, and nochleans use them to pry up windows, undo locks, or curl delicately around sleeping infants.",
			"",
			"Every few centuries, a nochlean develops a large cyst on its back, forcing it to give up its hunting for about a week as it sits hunched and uncommonly ponderous. The cyst grows quickly, soon becoming nearly as large as the nochlean itself. After a week, the cyst ruptures, and a fully formed duplicate of the \"parent\" nochlean emerges. This new nochlean understands how to hunt and how to speak Sylvan, although it picks up other languages it hears (usually, languages spoken in nearby humanoid communities) very quickly. The older nochlean typically drives the duplicate out of its hunting grounds to cut down competition, as nochleans are unwilling to work together even if they are copies of one other.",
			"",
			"Nochleans make their homes in small, rotten groves, which they fill with decaying plant matter, strung-up animal carcasses, and bedding that consists of soft but putrefying materials. A nochlean desires little else by way of physical comforts and eats very little. A nochlean might stay away from its lair for days at a time as it stalks a nearby settlement, returning to its putrefying bed to consume a rotting animal carcass and sleep for a few scant hours before leaving again. Although nochleans are unquestionably evil, many forest guardians who simply wish to see the forest thrive rarely trouble a nochlean or its lair. Despite their putrescent beds, nochleans subsist on decay; as they amass rotted vegetation and animal remains, they do actually beautify and aid the forest as a whole.",
			"",
			"Nochleans have an exceptionally long lifespan, although measuring a single nochlean's age is difficult when younger and nearly identical duplicates inhabit nearby lairs and might overlap in hunting areas. Most nochleans die at the hands of angry parents or forest guardians before reaching old age, but a nochlean surviving more than 500 years finds its black claws slowly whitening- the only indication of its advanced age.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nochleans can be found in any lush forest with plenty of undergrowth, particularly where humanoid settlements are near. Several nochleans live around the gnome community of Whistledown, although the cacophony of wind chimes placed on eaves and posts in that town usually keeps the nochleans at bay. To many in Whistledown, tales of big-eared child snatchers are mere fancy, as they don't realize how much their custom of hanging chimes to ward away \"evil spirits\" legitimately protects them from these evil fey.",
			"",
			"Nochleans lead solitary lives, aware that too many of their kind hunting in the same area would draw undue attention. Nochleans know they are safest when they are unnoticed by anyone other than their targets, and when frustrated farmers or grieving parents don't know whether to blame accident or malice for mysterious disappearances. No nochlean has a proper name; instead, each of them answers to the name \"Nochlean,\" although a few revel in epithets such as \"Snatcher\" or \"Shadowman\" bestowed upon them by frightened settlements where they hunt.",
			"",
			"Nochleans rely on subterfuge and a carefully studied knowledge of terrain to run or hide from confrontations, and some nochleans know the shadowed corners and overlooked hiding places around a settlement much better than the settlement's inhabitants do. Nochleans rarely enter a fight unless they feel they have the upper hand. In any confrontation, nochleans are notoriously difficult to pin down; they dart around attackers rather than stay put and, if pressed, teleport away from attackers that corner them. An endangered nochlean thinks nothing of abandoning its home or a fruitful hunting ground to find another, and the most fortunate hunters might find a kidnapped child trussed up but alive inside a lair a nochlean elected to abandon out of self-preservation.",
			"",
			"When they need to interact with humans in ways other than terrorizing or attacking them, nochleans prefer to disguise their distinctive appearance. They pull their common caps low, wrapping their distinctive ears around them like a scarf or a cloak, and remain in shadow to conceal their facial features. Certain unsavory traders strike deals with nochleans, as the fey monsters are skilled at procuring children useful for ransom, slavery, or darker purposes. Although nochleans like magic items that can aid them in their dark endeavors, they prefer to trade in favors, which they greedily hoard. A nochlean finds the mere presence of a musical instrument to be an unforgiveable offense, and a prospective negotiator might provoke a nochlean into a blind fury simply by failing to conceal a flute or fiddle."

According to these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a once-strong and proud target that has been brought low by its debilitating attacks.",

Nukkefeens' eyes are glazed and unnatural, and though they are quite limber, their knocked knees make their gait seem uneven and stiff. Most nukkefeens resemble human men or women, though many appear androgynous.",

They are likely to settle in abandoned homes, which they take care of in their own peculiar way."

			"The tremendously dangerous nulmind is a fungal creature believed by many sages to have extraterrestrial origins. It is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while slowly wearing down the inhabitants' mental faculties with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of psychic magic prove to be favored targets, as their mental energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature that succumbs to a nulmind's mind drain aura might eventually become enslaved to the fungus's alien will, the nulmind using such unfortunate creatures to draw in further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple extension of the nulmind's need to feed.",
			"",
			"Left unchecked, a nulmind rapidly depletes the local wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and a nulmind inevitably works to find richer sources of intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles. Because of this, druid enclaves often actively hunt and destroy these creatures before they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Despite the fungi's plantlike nature, most druidic communities view nulminds as anathema to the natural order.",
			"",
			"Nulminds are fortunately rare, with no documented culture or organization. These creatures rarely work well in concert, as each is ultimately selfish and sees only to its own needs, draining even its fellows without hesitation. Despite their insatiability, nulminds seem to lack a taste for the mental energy of fey creatures. While the fungi still defend themselves against fey creatures, they go out of their way to avoid areas where such creatures live.",

Nycars live in the frigid, desolate moors and marshes of colder climates where their cruel and savage activities often escape unnoticed. A nycar relishes the hunt and often stalks a creature for hours before finally inflicting a single savage bite, then withdraws to safety to wait for its prey to sicken and die. Nycars often kill wastefully, attacking creatures much larger than they can eat. The opportunity to eat a human or other intelligent creature is a rare treat, as a nycar's uninviting habitat usually prevents much interaction with all but the most isolated people.",
			"",
			"A nycar keeps a small subterranean lair, often accessed from an underwater entrance similar to the entrance to a beaver's den. Like a linnorm, it seeks treasure and hoards it in its lair. Much of its treasure is worthless trinkets and shiny baubles of little value, but by random chance one may discover a few valuable items over the course of its lifetime. A nycar usually sets simple traps and snares to protect its lair and treasure hoard while it is away or sleeping.",
			"",
			"A nycar is about 2-1/2 feet long with two diminutive legs that it uses to pull its serpentine body along with deceptive speed. Nycars are jealous creatures and usually hunt alone, although a mated pair may stay together until the female lays her eggs. Nycar eggs are black and about the size of an adult human's fist; a female will feed and look after hatchlings for up to a year, so long as they remain in her territory. Upon reaching adulthood, a nycar weighs about 12 pounds, and can live up to 90 years.",
			"",
			"Nycars have been known to partner with humans or other intelligent creatures, provided they are offered easy kills and the occasional shiny bauble. A chaotic neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a nycar as a familiar at 7th level."

			"**Annihilation (Su)** Any spaces an oblivion moves through are left fallow and lifeless in its wake. Ground that it moves over using its base speed becomes barren and is treated as if affected by a diminish plants spell to stunt growth. Dead bodies that the oblivion moves through immediately crumble into dust. Any constrict damage an oblivion deals to a creature automatically bypasses all damage reduction. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this constrict damage is immediately slain and its remains (but not its gear) are disintegrated. Once per round as a free action, an oblivion can target a single object in its space. A non-magical object so targeted is immediately destroyed. A magical item must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Dubiety (Su)** An oblivion's presence is anathema to the gods and the forces that bind creation together. Its presence warps divine magic and severs living beings from the power of life. Any living creature that begins its turn within range of an oblivion's aura of dubiety takes 2d6 points of negative energy damage. This negative energy has no beneficial effect on undead. A creature attempting to cast a divine spell within 60 feet of an oblivion must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively (DC = 15 + double the spell level) or the spell is automatically subverted, allowing the oblivion to decide the spell's target and effect as if it were the original caster. If the affected spell uses positive energy, the subverted spell instead uses negative energy.",
			"",
			"**Immunity to Annihilation (Ex)** An oblivion is immune to destruction spells, disintegrate effects, spheres of annihilation, and similar effects that completely destroy living creatures.",
			"",
			"**Immunity to Banishment (Ex)** An oblivion is never treated as having the extraplanar subtype, regardless of what plane it currently inhabits, rendering it immune to banishment, dismissal, and similar effects. In addition to this, effects that force the oblivion onto another plane (such as plane shift or the violet beam of a prismatic spray) do not function against an oblivion unless the effect comes from an artifact, a creature capable of granting spells to its worshipers, or a mythic source.",
			"",
			"**Master of Annihilation (Ex)** An oblivion can establish control over a sphere of annihilation as far away as 100 feet. When an oblivion controls a sphere of annihilation, it does so through force of will and an inborn understanding of the sphere's reality-the oblivion's control check is 1d20 + the oblivion's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier (the typical oblivion has a control check bonus of +31, and thus can never fail to control a sphere of annihilation unless control of the sphere is opposed). When an oblivion establishes control, it can maintain control at a distance of 100 feet + 20 feet per Hit Die (620 feet for the typical oblivion), and the sphere's speed under the oblivion's control is 20 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the oblivion's control check result in that round exceeded 30.",
			"",
			"**Servants of Entropy (Su)** As a full-round action, an oblivion can reform any living creature it has slain within the past hour, forging an obedient duplicate from its own dark mass. Servants created in this manner are identical to their original forms, with all their associated memories, racial abilities, and class abilities, except the duplicate loses any divine spellcasting ability its original form had. A servant's alignment changes to neutral evil, its type changes to native outsider (do not recalculate hit points, saving throws, or similar abilities), and it gains negative energy affinity. An oblivion can communicate telepathically with its servants anywhere on the same plane and can destroy a servant as a free action. An oblivion can manifest a total number of Hit Dice worth of servants equal to twice its own Hit Dice (52 for a typical oblivion), but no single servant can have more Hit Dice than the oblivion's CR. An oblivion cannot manifest more than one copy of any given creature at one time.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Creation (Ex)** An oblivion is a manifestation of disbelief and decay, and the forces of compassion and creativity are anathema to it. It is vulnerable to positive energy, taking damage as if it were undead, though it retains its control over any divine spells, allowing it to often usurp and corrupt cure spells and similar curative magic. An oblivion loses its regeneration any round in which it either takes damage from positive energy or is within 30 feet of a creature that succeeds at a DC 35 Perform check. Creatures under the effect of a good hope spell, an inspire courage bardic performance, or any spell effect of 5th level or higher that grants a morale bonus gain immunity to the negative energy damage dealt by an oblivion's slams and aura of dubiety.",
			"",
			"**Talisman of the Sphere (Ex)** The talisman of the sphere is anathema to an oblivion. A character who carries a talisman of the sphere can penetrate an oblivion's damage reduction with ease, ignores its spell resistance, is immune to its aura, and gains a +10 bonus on saving throws against the oblivion's special attacks and spell-like abilities.",

			"#### Description",

			"Rare and powerful denizens of the Negative Energy Plane, oblivions are void and nothingness given terrible will. They lurk among crystalline sheets of accumulated entropy that line their home plane's darkest interior, hungering to unmake the walls of reality and drag all of the cosmos down to its eventual end, allowing themselves to also finally end. Once unleashed upon mortal worlds, oblivions crisscross the globe, destroying its denizens and laying waste to the land until destroyed themselves or until they strip a planet bare of substance, life, and heat. Despite its vast bulk, a single oblivion must often dedicate years or even centuries to ending a world, and each is so adept at scrubbing away all traces a being leaves upon the cosmos that people, nations, and entire worlds annihilated by an oblivion are soon forgotten by outsiders. Some gods claim that the brutal efficiency of the oblivions are intended to someday be released upon the multiverse to cleanse away creation so a new cycle of life can begin from chaotic nothing, while other deities insist the oblivions' work is nearly complete, leaving only isolated specks of life floating in a vast, unfeeling void.",
			"",
			"Unlike nightshades or other noteworthy denizens of their dark realm, oblivions serve no masters or agendas. They believe themselves to be the way all things must end. Though cunning, they rarely find reason to communicate with other creatures, leaving much of their motives, origins, and philosophy in the cosmos a mystery.",
			"",
			"Like grim doll makers, oblivions can recreate slain victims from their own dark substance, transforming a world's heroes and villains into hollow pawns they can dispatch to slay would-be heroes or undermine organized resistance. Lacking any inherent ability to traverse the planes, most oblivions rely on such servants created in the shapes of powerful spellcasters or outsiders to provide routes to new worlds. These hollow reproductions know little of their masters' will beyond sharing comfort in the coming end of days, and most desperately fill in the gaps with appealing philosophies. Some of the most powerful servants form doomsday cults on distant planets to prepare them for an oblivion's arrival.",
			"",
			"Oblivions share a symbiosis with the artifacts known as spheres of annihilation, coveting their powerful, highly destructive magic. The towering oozes are unaffected by the artifact's destructive powers, and can move them as easily as a child might carry a toy. Some speculate that the spheres are in fact the eggs or spores of these apocalyptic beings, as rare survivors recount tales of spheres spontaneously birthing the roiling, devouring entities.",
			"",
			"Oblivions typically measure several dozen feet across, though their presence corrupts and consumes life, making the roiling darkness that most people mistake for their bodies seem much larger. Despite their size, oblivions have no mass. Upon destruction, an oblivion collapses thunderously into nothing"

This practice protects items entombed with the body (which is quickly reduced to nothing but a polished skeleton), and the creature's essence, it is believed, still rides along with the living jelly.",

			"Stories are told of ogres-horrendous stories of brutality and savagery, cannibalism and torture. Of rape and dismemberment, necrophilia, incest, mutilation, and all manners of hideous murder. Those who have not encountered ogres know the stories as warnings. Those who have survived such encounters know these tales to be tame compared to the truth.",
			"",
			"An ogre revels in the misery of others. When smaller races aren't available to crush between meaty fists or defile in blood-red lusts of violence, they turn to each other for entertainment. Nothing is taboo in ogre society. One would think that, left to themselves, an ogre tribe would quickly tear itself apart, with only the strongest surviving in the end-yet if there is one thing ogres respect, it is family.",
			"",
			"Ogre tribes are known as families, and many of their deformities and hideous features arise from the common practice of incest. The leader of a tribe is most often the father of the tribe, although in some cases a particularly violent or domineering ogress claims the title of mother. Ogre tribes bicker among themselves, a trait that thankfully keeps them busy and turned against each other rather than neighboring races. Yet time and again, a particularly violent and feared patriarch rises among the ogres, one capable of gathering multiple families under his command.",
			"",
			"Regions inhabited by ogres are dreary, ugly places, for these giants dwell in squalor and see little need to live in harmony with their environment. The borderland between civilization and ogre territory is a desperate realm of outcasts and despair, for here dwell the ogrekin, the deformed offspring and results of frequent ogre raids against the lands of the smaller folk.",
			"",
			"Ogre games are violent and cruel, and victims they use for entertainment are lucky if they die the first day. Ogres' cruel senses of humor are the only way their crude minds show any spark of creativity, and the tools and methods of torture ogres devise are always nightmarish.",
			"",
			"An ogre's great strength and lack of imagination makes it particularly suited for heavy labor, such as mining, forging, and clearing land, and more powerful giants (particularly hill giants and stone giants) often subjugate ogre families to serve them in such regards.",

			"**White Hairs (Su)** An ohancanu has 2d4 white hairs that connect not only to its head, but to its essence. If one of these hairs is plucked with a successful steal combat maneuver, the ohancanu gains 2 negative levels. The ohancanu automatically regrows the lost white hair and recovers the negative levels after 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are massive, brutal forest creatures that delight in destruction. Appearing as giant humanoids, ohancanus are thick and powerfully muscled, with simian arms that reach nearly to the ground. Although ohancanus have a single eye in the center of their foreheads, they are fey creatures and unrelated to the ancient cyclops race. Ohancanus have wide noses and large mouths filled with blunt teeth. All ohancanus are hirsute; males have full, thick beards and the rare females (called ohancanas) have long, unruly hair on their heads. All ohancanus have dark hair with a few white strands; on males, these white strands grow in their beards, while on females, they sprout from their heads. The white strands anchor the ohancanu's essence, so pulling out these strands causes the fey to weaken and die.",
			"",
			"An ohancanu stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are rapacious and destructive, befouling the forests in which they live. They block up streams in order to grab trapped fish, cause rockslides to wound prey, and hew down healthy trees just for the joy of killing. Ohancanus like to hunt, but they don't have the patience to set traps or wait in ambush; instead, they charge at their prey with their axes held high. Ohancanus kill far more game than they eat and leave the carcasses to rot.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus often live for centuries, spending their years ranging throughout large forests. They prefer to keep on the move and rarely stay in one location for more than a few days unless a need arises, such as manufacturing a new axe or waiting out a fierce and lengthy storm. Because they are so long-lived, ohancanus develop good instincts for where to find the easiest prey and how to avoid the few predators they can't simply slaughter.",
			"",
			"Despite their brutal disregard for the forest and its creatures, ohancanus' life cycle is inherently tied to old trees in deep forests. Ohancanus do not conceive or bear young. Instead, they murder the old and feeble among their kind and carve out their organs to bury among the roots of the oldest tree they can find. A year later, a young ohancanu bursts free from the earth in the same spot. If the burial tree is particularly vigorous, it might spawn twin or triplet ohancanus. Ohancanus emerge with rudimentary survival skills and the ability to speak; most dimly recall learning these skills from the spirit of their butchered \"parent\" while developing underground.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are born with a full head of hair (and, for males, a beard), including the white hairs that are so debilitating when plucked. Ohancanus emerge with only a few white hairs, but an ohancanu that survives a nearfatal experience (such as a long fall or a lightning strike) might sprout an additional white hair. An ohancanu with many white hairs is called a \"death dodger\" by admiring companions. Pulling out an ohancanu's white hair is not only enervating, but also painful and demoralizing; an ohancanu with a plucked hair is likely to flee to a place of safety until the white hair regrows.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are surprisingly nimble, given their great size, and are naturally athletic. They are agile climbers, can swim well, and can walk at a constant, plodding pace for days without tiring.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ohancanus inhabit old-growth forests such as the Verduran Forest and the Fangwood. They wander the forest throughout their lives, searching for civilized structures to destroy, creatures to terrorize, and food to sate their prodigious appetites. Ohancanus prefer a diet of nuts, berries, and fresh meat (particularly humanoids and game animals such as deer and rabbits), but they can draw sustenance from most organic matter, including bark and carrion.",
			"",
			"Though they wander too much to establish true lairs, ohancanus sometimes form campsites in shallow caves or on small islands. These sites are marked by years of occasional occupation by wandering ohancanus and often contain old bones, forgotten trinkets, and simple whetstones to keep axes sharp. A traveler discovering an unoccupied ohancanu campsite is well advised to move on, as one of these itinerant brutes might return to the campsite at any time.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus take great joy in destroying things, particularly things built by humanoids. They eagerly demolish bridges, cottages, fences, and other structures with a compulsion that borders on fanaticism. They gleefully attack humanoid defenders as well, in order to fill their bellies after the effort of wanton destruction. If a structure is too well defended for an ohancanu to overcome alone, he retreats only long enough to gather allies before returning to attack again.",
			"",
			"Despite their brutish malevolence, ohancanus are social creatures and enjoy the company of their own kind. Ohancanus often congregate to form small hunting groups, although such groups rarely work well together. If the group corners appetizing prey, such as a large deer or a plump gnome, the ohancanus often fall to bickering over who claims it. Wily prey can turn the greedy ohancanus against each other long enough to flee. In the face of serious danger, ohancanus value their own lives over all other concerns, trampling their companions in a rush to escape. The only time ohancanus collaborate well is when destroying a large structure such as a dam, fort, or small settlement.",
			"",
			"Once every 4 years, the ohancanus of a forest gather in a large moot to exchange information, settle grudges, butcher the elderly, and participate in brutal sports. Although wrestling and sparring are popular pastimes, no ohancanu will pull the beard or hair of another. Pulling out the white hair of another ohancanu, even by accident, is one of the few taboos among these brutal fey.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are not religious, but they have a deep respect for dramatic natural phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and forest fires. When a storm approaches, ohancanus collect prisoners to \"sacrifice\" to the storm by lashing them to the tops of windblown trees or pinning them beneath boulders in the path of flash floods.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus particularly enjoy riddles, although their limited intellect means that they have difficulty making up new riddles and that even their hardest riddles would be generally considered quite simple. Ohancanus typically see other creatures as prey to consume or predators to avoid, but a canny traveler can offer a riddle to an ohancanu to quell its bloodlust. Ohancanus' patience for exchanging riddles only extends so far, though, as they get frustrated when they cannot answer a riddle and angry when their simple riddles are easily answered. Most travelers seek to distract an ohancanu just long enough to plan an escape or lure the creature into squatting low enough to yank out one of his white hairs and send him fleeing. Discovering just the right level of difficulty to appease ohancanus without frustrating them enough to trigger their attacks is a puzzle of a higher order than most riddles!"

A creature 5 feet away in the mist has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

While an oneirogen is immune to the effects of these vapors, any creature that enters the mists within 5 feet of the oneirogen is affected (see below). These fumes don't impede vision any more than the oneirogen's obscuring fog ability already does. They can also be blown or burnt away (and recover) in the same manner. ",

The creature can attempt another Will save every round to wake up and can be woken up as if it had been affected by the spell sleep. Creatures that succeed at the save to resist this effect are immune to that oneirogen's veil of mists for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

What little remains of their minds is bent on self-preservation, even as they are locked at the center of storms of strange powers endlessly streaming from their mouths and nostrils. The death of their personalities might be a mercy, but what lingers on are primal beings, slaves of uncontrolled planar might.",

As mortal minds already drift toward that realm, breaches between the waking and unconscious worlds might occur when potent magics attempt to tamper with the boundaries of dream. The notorious tome, The Chain of Nights, is just one grimoire known to plumb the depths of thought and nightmare.

			"",
			"Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical guise of ettins. Combining oni's trademark guile with ettins' unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inflict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style.",
			"",
			"Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"While many might think an atamahuta possesses two heads and is therefore made up of two distinct oni, each being is composed of only one oni spirit. When an atamahuta takes form, it divides its powers into two parts, granting one half of its being its ingenuity and magical prowess and the other its anger and savage strength. An ettin's body is the most suitable for this division of powers, which manifests itself physically as one head having a seeming dominance over the other. The atamahuta's right head most directly controls its actions in physical combat, and is also the only one that talks; the left head, meanwhile, constantly spills nonsense words and mutterings under its breath, and is the source of the oni's arcane power. Oni scholars have speculated that an individual atamahuta's underlying, unvoiced wishes and desires are encoded in the gibberish that burbles from its left head, and that by listening closely enough, one can garner valuable information about the oni spirit, but few have survived an atamahuta encounter long enough to test this theory. Regardless of whatever babbling the left head produces, most witnesses agree that atamahuta strive for power and fear-induced respect more than anything else, and will go to grotesque lengths to garner them, through means both violent and utterly despicable.",
			"",
			"Atamahuta possess the ability to change shape just as other oni, but the visage of an uncontrollably violent ettin is often even more horrifying to civilized creatures than that of an oni, whom most regard as equally evil but at least somewhat reasonable. Thus, most atamahuta find it beneficial to procure a silver-tongued ally who can act as a gateway to the more powerful and wise oni itself. Once they have established control over a certain realm, atamahuta will usually either kill or enslave their allies, seeing the beguilers as potential threats to their rule. Atamahuta have little patience for any individual that wastes their time, and oversee their domain with an unforgiving and steadfast fist. Oni who inhabit the form of an ettin usually possess violent and unruly dispositions to begin with, but most know better than to act brashly when they first arrive in their physical forms and keep their rage at bay-at least until they establish their dominion over the lesser beings around them.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Oni](family/oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Atamahuta resemble ettins in both temperament and physical form, but their similarities end here. Most atamahuta look down upon the monstrous giants as barbaric, imperfect versions of an ideal form, and impose their superior strength and intellect upon the creatures in order to enslave them. While a single atamahuta can easily coerce and garner the aid of several ettins, the oni tend to establish elaborate slave rings in order to most effectively \"recruit\" high numbers of individuals, including ettins as well as other intelligent humanoids. Several atamahuta oversee the operation, while their shackled minions act as both enforcers of the slavers' rules and prisoners themselves, hoping to garner some miniscule form of freedom through cooperation. Their sheer cunning allows atamahuta to trick their prisoners into thinking this, when in reality the only escape an atamahuta's slave can hope to achieve is through transfer to another owner or death.",
			"",
			"When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants' guilds and other such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them. With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit an oni or an ettin into their ranks, and even then, many guilds have imposed strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place.",
			"",
			"Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other oni, as they see them as potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker oni such as yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful oni recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate the beings for their strength, tricking the ettin-shaped oni into thinking they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful oni has used the atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly discarded."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of stone giants, earth yai scorn that race's humble ambitions, and instead prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power. This belief doesn't necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages, though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power, leading many to become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace more subtle, longterm machinations in their pursuit of gradual and farreaching ruin.",
			"",
			"In its natural form, an earth yai stands 16 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the stone giants their otherworldly shapes mimic. While stone giants often appear to be sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no impact on their formidable resilience.",
			"",
			"Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of a catapult shot. Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy bridge supports.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Oni](family/oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Earth yai dream of conquest like many other oni, but how they pursue victory tends to vary from individual to individual. While all would agree that victory is only attained when one's foes are crushed and shattered, the methods used to accomplish this goal range from brute displays of power to the slow erosion of a foe till nothing remains. The scope of an earth yai's ambitions also seems largely dependent on its age, with younger oni proving content to raid territories and subjugate peasant villages, while older individuals seek greater conquests and the destruction of whole lands.",
			"",
			"Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim. Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these oni would never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek new challenges-if such opportunities don't present themselves during the oni's rule. These oni might move on to find new opponents, but still regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and instill dread among their prisoners.",
			"",
			"While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and centuries of experience. An oni who finds itself bested time and time again might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait before a threat to them passes-perhaps with the help of a few inconvenient disasters to accelerate an enemy's decline.",
			"",
			"When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in such conflicts, but they are never exploited. These oni see a final battle between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred.",
			"",
			"Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs in mazelike mountain ravines and in large caverns near the earth's surface. These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the oni often make use of their passwall ability to sink through solid barriers or walk past gates that don't appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their liking. If any creature interrupts an oni in its lair, the oni violently attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they trespass upon the oni's private home. This obsession with privacy extends not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they themselves demand the lesser creatures' presence.",

			"### Earth Yai Daifu",

Known as daifus, such earth yai have Charisma scores of at least 20 and can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: stoneskin, summon monster XI (earth elementals only), wall of stone. Most earth yai daifus are sorcerers or oracles with abilities tied to the earth or destruction. Earth yai daifus add +1 to their CRs."

			"A ja noi is an oni spirit that takes the form of a hobgoblin, and differs physically from the hobgoblins in a variety of ways, most notably its unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi's skin blazes a fiery red rather than a drab gray, and the oni bears prominent ridges on its brow and forehead.",
			"",
			"Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most oni, ja noi nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue the trials of battle and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi's skin provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within typical hobgoblins, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in their conquests.",
			"",
			"Towering over the hobgoblins it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds.",
			"",
			"All oni believe the Material Plane's inhabitants fail to take advantage of the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenes-manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for them-ja noi take a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering any who would stand against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter, and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a war-ravaged battlefield. These hardened oni often recognize the inevitable outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else while on the battlefield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn club, the spray of dying foes' blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers.",
			"",
			"Like other oni, ja noi possess the ability to change shape, and often use this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe's head before the victim knows what's happened. This brutish trickery is usually the extent of a ja noi's guile, however, as the hobgoblin oni are hardly known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to take the brunt of an opposing army's blow while they target the commanders, always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one's life. The most powerful ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other oni to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both humanoid and goblinoid.",
			"",
			"Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on the Material Plane, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this regard. They either die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is constantly playing. Thus, most of these oni practice their battle skills constantly against one another, their strongest hobgoblin followers, and their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order to inflict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out magical items to bolster their strength.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Oni](family/oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Whereas many oni prefer to act alone and in secret, ja noi recognize the concept of strength in numbers, and understand that banding together is often a surer way to glorious victories than lone pursuits. The rare lone ja noi may seek out renowned heroes and martial senseis to challenge in one-on-one combat, but most of these creatures know the best way to demonstrate their prowess is in the midst of the chaotic battlefield in front of other oni, especially fellow ja noi. Often, when ja noi work together to bring carnage to the field of war, they keep track of each other's kills, ranking one another in terms of strength and skill. An individual who shows cowardice repeatedly or does not prove a useful ally swiftly meets the blade of a supposed comrade, as ja noi have little patience for weak accomplices.",
			"",
			"Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other oni, but they possess immense amounts of authority among the lesser hobgoblins around them, and so they surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi's amateur hobgoblin warriors combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly benefits the oni and they have the mortals' unquestioning loyalty. More often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle.",
			"",
			"In rare cases, more powerful oni ask ja noi to lead armies against particularly stubborn groups of opponents. Ja noi rarely refuse such requests, knowing that much blood will be shed in the ventures-and that denying the requests of stronger oni is a sure path to a quick death. Like all oni, ja noi despise and seek out kami, reveling in the destruction of minor spirits and hunting the more powerful individuals for the sheer challenge of it. Because of the strictures of the Laws of Golden Perfection, ja noi cannot directly slay kami, and so they work to direct their vicious hobgoblin armies to complete the task instead.",
			"",
			"In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no humanoid enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as bulettes and owlbears can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it doesn't take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering entire hobgoblin tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny hobgoblins in service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the oni to battle, that the resulting conflict might temporarily sate the ja noi's incessant desire for war."

			"**Grasping Eddy (Su)** As a standard action, a kigyo can create a powerful underwater eddy that holds its enemies in place. The oni selects a grid intersection within 30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy. The oni can attempt an immediate grapple combat maneuver check against any enemies within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach. As a swift action in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the oni can maintain the grapple on those targets caught within the eddy's grasp (attempting a separate combat maneuver check for each target). In order to pin a target or deal damage with this effect, the oni must take a standard action as normal. The eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take at least a swift action on its turn to maintain a grapple. The effect immediately ends if all targets escape the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls unconscious or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddy's center. The kigyo can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.",
			"",
			"**Trident Mastery (Ex)** Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as deadly weapons.

			"**Underwater Grappler (Ex)** Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their underwater environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes. A kigyo gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks while it or its target is at least partially underwater. This bonus also applies to grapple combat maneuver checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The kigyo gains no bonus to its CMD against grapple attempts.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Oni are most often found in Tian Xia on the opposite side of the world from ancient Azlant, though some, such as the powerful [ogre mage](monster/ogre_mage), have expanded their influence to include other continents including Avistan and Garund. Not all oni live on land, however, and the vengeful spirits have been known to take the form of humanoid species that dwell mostly or entirely underwater. While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though [locathahs](monster/locathah), [merfolk](monster/merfolk), and other aquatic races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling oni than they are to meet ogre mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine oni is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a merfolk.",
			"",
			"Like merfolk, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an aquatic lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a merfolk, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.",
			"",
			"A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.",
			"",
			"As with many types of oni, kigyos are hateful, vengeful creatures that prey upon mortals not out of necessity but out of spite and malice. Kigyos enjoy seeing their victims drown, and they are said to be drawn to the sites of shipwrecks or tragic deaths at sea where mortals met their end in the unforgiving ocean. While this may not be true, plenty of kigyos have been the cause of such deaths, either in combat or by manipulating their victims into dangerous situations from which they could not escape. Kigyos have the ability to create powerful underwater currents that swirl in tight eddies, latching on to multiple creatures and holding them in place until they either drown or fall victim to the oni's other attacks.",
			"",
			"In the same way that a kigyo draws a sense of accomplishment from drowning a victim, it also feels a sense of superiority at making an enemy willingly give up something of incredible value in exchange for its life or that of a loved one. To oni, life and mortality are foreign concepts, and they can derive only so much pleasure out of seeing a living creature's essence snuffed out by death. As jealous and possessive beings, however, kigyos can more easily comprehend the sacrifice of giving up something other than one's life. Many kigyos develop obsessions with a single type of ransom they demand, such as firstborn children, spouses, a victim's reproductive or sensory organs or lungs, or even (in rare cases) pure material wealth. Those who hunt kigyos or research kigyo activity across the world can sometimes follow a single oni from nation to nation and from ocean to ocean by the specifics of what it demands of its victims. Thus have specific kigyos developed almost mythic status while victims across both distance and time suffer the same sadistic fate at the oni's hands.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Oni](family/oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kigyos rarely congregate with others of their kind, preferring instead solitary lives in the forms of aquatic elves, gillman, locathahs, merfolk, or other aquatic or shore-dwelling humanoids. In these forms, kigyos attempt to seduce unsuspecting mortals, and trick them into bringing the oni-who usually pretend to be castaways or injured victims-onto their vessels or into their seaside communities. Once in these societies, kigyos bed unsuspecting mortals who take pity on them and then abscond with items of value while their partners are sleeping. After amassing particularly valuable or numerous prizes, a kigyo reveals itself to its victims and demands a ransom of something far more precious for the items' return.",
			"",
			"Like all oni, kigyos are filled with hatred, especially for their uncorrupted kami counterparts. Kigyos see [suijins](monster/suijin) in particular as contemptible, and they are known to form elaborate hunting parties to seek out the benevolent nature spirits and destroy them and the untainted waters they protect. These raiding bands constitute the few large groups of kigyos on Golarion, and they can present deadly threats to those who encounter them, be they kami or other creatures. The oni fight tactically in tandem, half of the kigyos using their grasping eddy abilities to hold their foes in place while the other half surround and stab at them with their tridents. Even when encountered alone, a kigyo presents a formidable challenge to even the most adept underwater fighters, as it can hold an entire party in one of its powerful whirlpools, reducing its foes' ability to conduct their own group fighting tactics."

			"While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and thus often end up having associations with giants and other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni who clothe themselves in human flesh. While their true forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin, claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns, kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans. As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind, and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves' guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of command, but avoid positions so important that they have too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste, and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa increases its opportunities for such abuse.",

Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsune's suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature under the nogitsune's compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune's compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of hours equal to its Hit Dice.

			"Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox's head. A nogitsune's fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Oni manifest themselves in different ways based on the creatures they take as vessels for their depraved wrath. They take particular joy in corrupting kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy, such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics (when available). Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than the ground. Still others claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of water and disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use to escape pursuit, even when running full speed.",
			"",
			"Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of infiltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery.",
			"",
			"A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Oni](family/oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the oni in the midst of people who society generally doesn't miss if and when a contract doesn't slake the creature's bloodlust.",
			"",
			"Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But many who foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses.",
			"",
			"Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other oni, or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conflicted and turbulent anger within the creatures, as if the once-righteous kitsune within a nogitsune constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such a reversal occurring, many believe that these malevolent oni drown themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges of the creatures they were before."

			"The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of \"void\" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race.",
			"",
			"Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.",

A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes.",

Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible.",

When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai's caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the result of this check is hurled 1d6 &times; 10 feet straight up, and lands prone in a spot 1d4 &times; 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.",

This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8 points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature.",
			"",
			"Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes.",
			"",

			"",
			"A wind yai does not appear to walk upon the ground so much as glide across it-but even then, its exaggerated movements and overbearing demeanor make every footstep a thunderous stomp. An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural acts of destruction.",
			"",
			"Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring them crashing back to the earth.",

			"Cloud giants possess one other thing wind yai yearn to claim mastery over-their instruments. But rather than use such delicate tools to create melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate, they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare, magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies.",
			"",
			"Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the more satisfying."

This prevents the use of any spell with verbal components and the use of command-word- activated magic items, among other difficulties. The yamabushi tengu's voice changes to match the one stolen. The victim's voice remains stolen until the oni steals another voice, until the oni agrees to give the stolen voice back (a standard action requiring the oni to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any effect that removes curses (such as remove curse or break enchantment) can restore a stolen voice (DC for success equals the save DC of the steal voice ability-DC 16 for most yamabushi tengu), as does the death of the oni who stole the voice in the first place.

			"Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery, wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since it's easy to be seen in such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where it can skulk in the shadows when it's unsure of its surroundings.",

			"While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles, peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and other billed avians (like geese) are notably absent from yamabushi tengus. In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducks-they find these birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks. The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Many extend this obsession to clothing (favoring brightly colored silks) and armor (preferring light armor over medium or heavy armor). Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian humanoids-particularly tengus, dire corbies (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Misfit Monsters Redeemed) and garudas (see Pathfinder Module: Cult of the Ebon Destroyers). Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters (monstrous humanoids and outsiders respectively) are in strange ways both similar and quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creatures' feral natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control of-although in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a yamabushi tengu's minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the garuda prisoner.",
			"",
			"Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thieves' guilds-particularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other races (such as humans), a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably the shapechanged oni's nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally don't think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others."

			"**Attach (Ex)** When an onwu azu hits with a bite attack, it automatically grapples its foe, though the target isn't considered to be grappling the onwu azu. Each round the onwu azu is grappling its foe, it automatically deals its bite damage.",
			"",
			"**Glide (Ex)** An onwu azu can launch itself into the air and glide for up to 1 minute (depending on water and weather conditions, at the GM's discretion). When gliding, it has a fly speed of 60 feet with clumsy maneuverability and gains Flyby Attack.",
			"",
			"**Keen Scent (Ex)** An onwu azu can notice creatures by scent within a 180-foot radius underwater and can detect blood in the water at ranges of up to 1 mile.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Onwu azus are a species of saltwater flying fish that grow to a hefty size and have a taste for the blood of warmblooded animals. They're similar to giant flying piranha, and their name roughly translates to \"flying death\" in the dialect of Polyglot spoken along the coasts of the western Mwangi Expanse.",
			"",
			"Like salmon, onwu azus are born in rivers and migrate downstream to the ocean during their adolescence. There, they grow to their adult size and develop the ability to swim at incredible speeds and use their wing-like pectoral fins to glide above the waves. Onwu azus return to the river where they were born to reproduce, and die shortly afterward.",
			"",
			"Onwu azus use their glide ability to hunt prey, and although they are capable of subsisting on smaller fish and other marine animals, they prefer the blood and meat of land-dwelling creatures. After spotting a target, schools of onwu azus soar over the waves at great speeds, hurling themselves at their preferred food sources and biting with their incredibly sharp teeth, employing a suction grip that is difficult to break. Once attached, the onwu azus continue biting until their prey is killed. Their bites cause continuous bleeding, and most of their victims die from shock and blood loss long before the onwu azus reach vital organs. These fish can survive for up to 5 minutes out of the water, and if they succeed at killing their prey on land, they briefly feed before flopping back into the water to look for their next meal.",
			"",
			"More than one pirate has been knocked from his ship by a surprise onwu azu attack. Rather than just leaping to take a bite of air-breathing prey, the fish will often bull rush prey on either a coast or ship's deck, intending to knock it into the waiting mouths of the school below. Shallow inlets and river mouths in the paths of spawning onwu azus are often littered with the remains sailors and explorers who ran afoul of these deadly fish. Adventurers who find treasure in such areas would do well to wonder what killed any corpses lying beside loot and take appropriate precautions.",
			"",
			"Onwu azus grow to over 4 feet in length with fin-spans of over 6 feet, and can weigh close to 90 pounds. Their skin is generally dark blue or brown, and their pectoral fins are a scintillating red that shimmers in the sun with a kaleidoscope of colors."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mischievous menaces of the streets, onyvolans are gangly, humanlike creatures with grotesquely long limbs that end in peculiar keratinous wheels, which the creatures use to roll along at high speeds. Onyvolans enjoy creating mayhem by roaming around in gangs and terrorizing a city's residents, especially in older, rundown districts. Pure troublemakers at heart, onyvolans prefer mischief to actual violence, and they show their cowardly side whenever their quarry stands up to them. They trawl dump sites and trash piles in search of food and clothing, which is their primary means of obtaining both; however, they occasionally attack victims who seem to be carrying-or wearing-items of particular interest. Onyvolans love garish clothing that most people wouldn't wear, and they especially adore ostentatious hats.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans' arms are roughly the same length as their legs, allowing the creatures to reach the ground easily with their front wheels and roll on all fours, which is their natural stance. Onyvolans are eerily pale-skinned, and their mouths are nearly always twisted into a disturbing grin that reveals their pointed teeth; they find that their frightful countenances aid in putting their targets on edge.",
			"",
			"A typical onyvolan is about 7 feet tall from head to back wheel when upright and weighs about 170 pounds.",
			"",
			"The most curious aspect of onyvolan physiology is the strange wheels the creatures have where one would expect hands and feet. These wheels are made of a hard, keratin-like substance, and they are connected to the onyvolans' arms and legs with an axle and fork composed of the same material. This substance makes the wheels extremely durable, and they typically withstand the onyvolan's rolling locomotion with surprisingly minimal wear and tear; most onyvolans' wheels remain in good shape for the creatures' entire lifespans. The hardness of the wheels also makes them useful as bludgeoning weapons in combat. An onyvolan usually rolls on all fours, but it occasionally uses just its back wheels when it needs its arms for other tasks. The wheels spin surprisingly smoothly, allowing for the onyvolan to move at high speeds on packed dirt and even well-cobbled streets without producing much noise.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans typically wear garish, multicolored clothing, which the creatures tend to favor over all other garments. Due to their lack of hands, these creatures find it nearly impossible to create clothing for themselves; they scavenge what they can after it has been discarded by those with more conventional fashion sense. Since most humanoid apparel was not designed for such long-limbed wearers, clothing the onyvolans wear tend to be ill-fitting at best. The creatures do not seem to mind for the most part, and they wear their strange outfits with a misguided sense of pride. Onyvolans are particularly fond of hats, and gangs of the creatures are more often than not found wearing an eclectic set of headwear.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Onyvolans are nearly always found in cities, most often lairing in back alleys and sewers. The creatures establish bases that they consider permanent homes, which they use mainly for storing their scavenged spoils. Onyvolans spend little time in their home bases, however, as they are usually out and about either scavenging for clothing and food or otherwise causing trouble, returning home only when they have found sufficient supplies. Onyvolans are most commonly found in large metropolises-notably Oppara and Cassomir in Taldor, as well as in Absalom- but they have been seen in smaller settlements, especially those with an outsize number of clothiers and tailors.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans rarely venture far from cities, as their wheels tend to get stuck in mud and undergrowth. However, rumors suggest that lone onyvolans may tough out treks into the wilderness to hide particularly desirable treasures from others of their kind. These would be exceptionally strong and resourceful members of their species, as navigating forests or swamps is nigh impossible for ordinary onyvolans.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans traditionally form gangs that live and scavenge together. These gangs typically operate relatively close to the creatures' home base, and they send out individual scouts that venture to farther reaches of their city in search of new sources of clothing and food. The leader of an onyvolan gang almost always has the most stylish clothing of the lot, at least in the eyes of its peers, as they consider it an indication of exceptionally resourceful scavenging. When there isn't enough loot to go around-either because the gang has become too large or because of unsuccessful scavenging-unrest begins to stir. This often opens up opportunities for onyvolans to split off from the group to form a new gang, recruiting others to their side by filling potential recruits' heads with promises of fancy clothes and bountiful vittles.",
			"",
			"Onyvolan gangs get in minor scuffles over clothing finds, food sources, and scavenging areas. The gangs' leaders are nearly always former members of other gangs, and because there is inevitably bad blood between the old and new groups, onyvolan gangs rarely coexist in complete peace. Nonetheless, fights between such groups rarely escalate to any substantial level of violence; instead, two quarreling clans scream and yell as the groups circle one another-much to the dismay of any residents of nearby buildings-until the onyvolans get bored or distracted and roll away in opposite directions.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans tend to rove back alleys and darkened streets for fun, where they can terrorize those unfortunate individuals who find themselves trapped in a corner with no help in sight. The bullies find particular joy in scaring pedestrians with their creepy cackles and eerie grins, knocking victims to the ground and rolling in circles around them while taunting them with grating voices. Although they are rather fearsome in appearance and their behavior is off-putting, onyvolans are more often than not looking to scare people for the fun of it rather than to inflict any actual major physical harm, although if an onyvolan gang spots someone vulnerable-looking wearing colorful clothing or a fancy hat (or transporting a large quantity of food), they may end up resorting to violence to claim such a prize. A target of an onyvolan attack can sometimes get out of trouble simply by standing up to the creatures and attempting to intimidate them, as the creatures are prone to cowardice. However, if a target has something the onyvolans strongly desire and doesn't prove overly threatening, the wheeled creatures gleefully attempt to bowl him over and take what they want."

			"Onyx scourges are vicious brutes from the Plane of Earth that revel in their deadly power. They resemble elder earth elementals with striations of red and black onyx. Negative energy pulses and flows through the streaks of onyx like blood through exposed veins. The hollows and depressions that serve as an onyx scourge's eyes and mouth are deep voids warped into expressions of rage and hatred.",
			"",
			"Negative energy flows through each strike an onyx scourge makes, disrupting living and unliving matter alike. Onyx scourges can also unleash this energy in a devastating blast, which they enjoy using to inflict damage on multiple opponents at once. They gleefully wade into battle whenever given the opportunity.",
			"",
			"An onyx scourge is 40 feet tall and weighs 70,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The endless tunnels on the Plane of Earth are home to wondrous creatures. Elementals dwelling there are formed from the plane's very substance, displaying limitless variations in combinations of different ores, minerals, and materials. In most cases, elementals gain no special benefit from their constituent minerals other than distinctive coloration. In rare situations, however, an elemental encounters a phenomenon that interacts with its physical makeup in strange and terrible ways. Legends circulated among the shaitan posit that one such occurrence gave rise to the first onyx scourges.",
			"",
			"Shaitan tales say that, in the distant past, the elder earth elemental Ozusteg discovered a strange anomaly: a sphere of black onyx the size of a small mountain exuding wisps of chill, dark power. Curious about the object's nature, Ozusteg entered the sphere to explore its interior, but discovered too late that the onyx sphere surrounded a breach between the Plane of Earth and the Negative Energy Plane.",
			"",
			"Planar scholars theorize that the onyx sphere formed around the breach as a defense mechanism, to contain the destructive power of the Negative Energy Plane. Ozusteg should have been annihilated by its exposure to the negative energy of the breach, but its body absorbed the onyx to likewise contain the negative energy. The elemental survived the ordeal but emerged from the sphere radically changed-a twisted elemental creature infused with the essence of entropy and filled with the desire to destroy.",
			"",
			"Ozusteg gathered other elementals through coercion, trickery, or promises of power, and then forced them to enter the onyx sphere just as it had done. Only the most powerful elementals survived, similarly transformed into creatures like Ozusteg. Infused with destructive energy and feeling no loyalty to each other nor to Ozusteg, these creatures spread ruin across the Plane of Earth and eventually into other planes. They came to be called onyx scourges, after the pulsing energy in their onyx striations and the devastation they leave in their wake.",
			"",
			"No shaitan claims to know how many onyx scourges exist, or if they were all created by Ozusteg. Explorers have never found Ozusteg's planar breach on the Plane of Earth or even definitive proof that Ozusteg existed at all. It is possible that more than one breach exists, each with the ability to create onyx scourges from elementals that venture too close yet are powerful enough to survive the exposure.",
			"",
			"Tracing the origin of onyx scourges is difficult for several reasons. First, onyx scourges are truculent, prone to answering questions with lies if they deign to answer them at all. Second, the creatures are by nature powerful and incredibly destructive; they generally attack any creatures in their path and are disinclined to leave survivors. Finally, the creatures constantly wander until they find a territory to call their own and so are likely encountered far from whatever their point of origin might have been.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Onyx scourges are most often found on the Plane of Earth. They are generally solitary creatures that lay claim to a certain region of the plane- usually several miles wide-and viciously attack elementals and other denizens of that region. After dwelling in one area for a time, a scourge moves to a new area and wages war on whatever creatures happen to reside in its new chosen territory. If a scourge's domain encompasses a major trade route on the Plane of Earth, shaitan merchants soon dispatch agents to destroy or relocate the creature.",
			"",
			"Although some scholars dispute the details of the story of Ozusteg, others believe there is a grain of truth within the tale and seek the fabled onyx sphere. Necromancers desire the negatively charged onyx to enhance their vile experiments or to create powerful new undead monsters and constructs. Forbidden tomes theorize that the black onyx can be used to unlock greater powers from the legendary Shadowstaff and other necromantic artifacts. The promise of such power has led many wizards to spend their fortunes and their lives to find Ozusteg's domain.",
			"",
			"Onyx scourges on the Plane of Earth make terrifying predators. Although their primary motive is to wage war against all creatures in the territories they have claimed as their own, onyx scourges sometimes venture into other earth elementals' territories to capture prey, which is very rarely seen again. Ayrzul, the Fossilized King of the Plane of Earth, is mostly indifferent to his elemental subjects but appreciates the destructive power of the onyx scourges and plots ways to use them as weapons against his rival, Ymeri, and her minions on the Plane of Fire. However, Ayrzul hasn't yet figured out how to compel the cruel and chaotic creatures to help him in any significant way.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, onyx scourges present an even greater danger to mortals. Their destructive power is compounded by their ability to bolster nearby undead, creating devastating juggernauts that would be prized weapons in a necromancer's army. Onyx scourges can heal undead forces while annihilating living troops and their defensive fortifications. Thankfully, only the most powerful spellcasters can bring an onyx scourge through a gate, and the creatures are too strong to be magically controlled by normal means. That doesn't stop ambitious spellcasters from making the attempt, and the cleverest of them might even use the onyx scourges' love of destruction to convince one to join a campaign."

They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits them to do so.",

			"The gorthek is, without a doubt, one of the crankiest beasts found roaming in the wilderness. Appearing as a strange combination of primeval bison and ornery rhinoceros, but with a leonine head crowned with ramlike horns, a gorthek is both immensely powerful and preternaturally hard to injure. Its thick, battering-ram head and powerful body make it a fearsome opponent, particularly when it's riled up and in full charge.",
			"",
			"Gortheks tend to travel in small herds, grazing across remote temperate grasslands or sparsely wooded hills. When a gorthek perceives a threat-which to the gorthek includes just about everything, often even other gortheks-it launches itself into a full charge, intent on sending the enemy flying.",
			"",
			"Orc tribes have made a practice of raising the beasts from infancy to serve as living siege engines during warfare. Future gorthek riders bond with the creatures from a very young age, and if possible use gorthek masks to make that bond stronger. When riding into battle, one orc sits astride the gorthek in a specially crafted saddle secured behind its massive horns and guides the beast using spiked reins.",
			"",
			"An adult male gorthek stands about 7 feet high at the shoulder and weighs around 9,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Gorthek Companions",
			"",
			"An orc who takes the Beast Rider feat can choose a gorthek as an animal companion or mount."

			"**Bone Chariot (Su)** An ostovite presented with a corpse that in life had 2 Hit Dice or fewer (not counting Hit Dice from class levels) and that contains a skeletal structure can spend 1 hour extracting the bones and then softening and reweaving them around itself, creating a deformed and skeletal version of the original creature. This \"bone chariot\" functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the skeleton template, but gains the construct type instead of the undead type and has no will of its own-it moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center. An ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the skeleton crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal. Multiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate the skeletons of larger creatures, so long as they all ride within the same bone chariot-each additional ostovite increases the maximum Hit Dice of the corpse that can be animated by this ability by 2.",

			"Tiny Abyssal scavengers, ostovites skitter across demonic battlefields, amid charnel pits, and through that plane's festering sewers looking for corpses on which to feed. When they find these morsels, they use their acidic saliva to digest the flesh, taking what they need for sustenance. Yet what ostovites truly desire is not food, but self-improvement.",
			"",
			"Though only barely intelligent, ostovites have a deepseated jealousy of larger races, as well as an instinctive shame regarding their own forms, which resemble silverfish made out of thin, compressed bones. When an ostovite locates the corpse of a larger creature- particularly that of a humanoid or other intelligent being-it doesn't stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the creature's bones, drawing them out and reconstructing them into a twisted parody of their original configuration, with the ostovite resting in a nest-like structure in the sculpture's center. Once it's finished, the ostovite magically animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at last experiencing the thrill of being larger and-to the ostovite's mind-more important. These ghastly creations are generally more disturbing than normal undead, as ostovites' understanding of biomechanics is often crude, potentially resulting in humanoid skeletons that move around on all fours or drag themselves along like landbound octopuses. Like hermit crabs changing shells, ostovites regularly replace their chariots in order to increase their social status and impress potential mates. Though they often squabble over smaller skeletons, when a particularly prime corpse is located, an entire nest of ostovites may band together to create a single bone chariot of epic proportions.",
			"",
			"Adult ostovites are 2 feet long and weigh 3 pounds. Natural cowards except when enshrined in their chariots-at which point most believe themselves invincible- ostovites have a species-wide hatred of the more powerful vermlek demons, with whom they often compete for quality corpses."

Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs.

These smaller serpents can split from the whole and lash out at the ouroboros's enemies. An ouroboros can make up to 8 bite attacks each round. As the ouroboros is uniformly composed of serpents, it can even target creatures it has swallowed whole with these bite attacks, the serpents lining its stomach lashing out at the swallowed creature.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Coils (Su)** The mere sight of an ouroboros overwhelms the minds of lesser creatures. Any creature within 100 feet that can see an ouroboros must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds, watching its endless consumption and churning coils. Any creature that begins its turn paralyzed by this ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage as it slowly loses its grip on reality. Every time a creature takes Wisdom damage from this ability, it can immediately attempt a new DC 27 Will save; on a success, the paralysis effect from the hypnotic coils ends. Once a creature recovers from the hypnotic coils' paralysis effect, it is immune to further paralysis from that particular ouroboros's coils for 24 hours. This is a vision-based mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",

			"**Maw (Ex)** An ouroboros gains a powerful bite attack while not engaged in self-consumption. This is a primary attack that always applies 1-1/2 times the ouroboros's Strength modifier to the damage roll. When it bites with its maw, its regular bite attacks become secondary attacks.",
			"",
			"**Perpetual Renewal (Su)** An ouroboros continually consumes and regrows itself. The duration of any spell or effect that causes an ouroboros to be dazed, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, or stunned can never have a duration of longer than 1 round. Any ability damage or drain an ouroboros receives is automatically healed at a rate of 1d4 points per round per ability. Perpetual renewal functions only while the ouroboros consumes itself.",
			"",
			"**Ruinous Blood (Su)** The blood that sprays from the ragged stump of an ouroboros's tail is so potent with positive energy that it warps the flesh of those exposed to it, transforming them into fractured pieces of the ouroboros itself. Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, an ouroboros can spray a 60-foot line of blood from the stump of its tail. Creatures caught in this area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be permanently transformed into a venomous snake swarm that retains no memories of its previous life, as per baleful polymorph when the target fails its Will save to resist the spell's secondary effect. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Self-Consumption (Su)** An ouroboros continuously eats its own tail. So long as the ouroboros continues its self-consumption, its regeneration cannot be suppressed by any form of attack and it benefits from the effects of perpetual renewal, but it cannot use its maw attack or its ruinous blood ability. Any effect that would kill the ouroboros outright merely halves the ouroboros's remaining hit points. Once an ouroboros's hit points are reduced to less than half its normal maximum (198 hit points for a typical ouroboros), the monster ceases its self-consumption, loses its perpetual renewal ability, and gains its maw and ruinous blood abilities. All its movement speeds are doubled when the ouroboros is in this state, but its regeneration can now be suppressed via damage caused by mythic weapons or spells. An ouroboros can resume self-consumption as a standard action as long as it has more than half its hit points. An ouroboros need not eat or drink to survive-its own body is all the sustenance it needs.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The ouroboros-the serpent that eternally consumes itself- occupies a place in the mythology of many civilizations, yet few suspect that these legends are inspired by a real and terrifying race of creatures. Living ouroboroses dwell on the Astral Plane, where they are content to drift aimlessly through the silvery void.",
			"",
			"Ouroboroses are capable of tremendous devastation, yet they have little reason to seek out such violence. They are each a world unto themselves, autonomous and reliant on no other creature for their sustenance or livelihood. An ouroboros can exist forever, constantly eating itself and replenishing its body with its own infinity. Barely sentient, an ouroboros has a powerful, almost pathological will to survive, which drives it to destroy any and all creatures that pose even the slightest threat to its well-being. This propensity to attack without clear provocation or warning has given ouroboroses a reputation for being engines of mindless destruction.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros might appear to be a single creature, but closer inspection reveals the truth: its body is formed from a myriad of smaller entwined serpents, which are not independent creatures and become lifeless once separated from the main body. Those who have examined serpents detached from an ouroboros report that these creatures too are formed from smaller serpents that, when inspected under magnification, prove to be composed of tinier serpents still.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which has many miraculous properties. Many have tried to harness the healing powers of the ouroboros's blood to restore life to the dead or regenerate grievous wounds. While such treatments can be successful, given the application of the correct but obscure occult rituals, ouroboros blood is uniquely suited to the generation of ouroboros flesh and no other. Patients treated in this way typically suffer the fate of those exposed directly to the ouroboros's blood and transform into serpents.",
			"",
			"While ouroboroses seem mindless, they have crude intellects and can understand speech. Yet whatever motives the ouroboroses have for hiding away on the Material Plane are unclear. Most find their way to this reality by accident, tumbling through rents in reality from the Astral Plane or perhaps conjured here by powerful magic wielded by mad spellcasters eager to unleash devastation upon the world.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros is usually coiled into a circle roughly 50 feet in diameter. It weighs 260 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ouroboros Blood Ritual",
			"",
			"The most common ritual that utilizes ouroboros blood is detailed [here](spell/ouroboros_blood_ritual); full rules for rituals are [here](rule/occult_rituals)."

Known as owb prophets, these god-touched beings grant spells to faithful worshippers on behalf of their Forsaken patrons. Unfortunately for the Forsaken, owb prophets don't pass along this divine energy gladly, always seeking a way to hoard it for themselves. The most cunning owb prophets develop long-term plans to ascend to the status of demigod independently and join the ranks of the Forsaken. No owb prophet has yet acquired sufficient spiritual energy to make this leap, but the first to succeed would be more than a peer to the distant Forsaken-it would be the only active Forsaken in the multiverse.",
			"",

Enkaar's owb prophets are immune to petrification and paralysis, gain two wing attacks as natural attacks, and can use [excruciating deformation](spell/excruciating_deformation) at will as a spell-like ability. Enkaar's symbol is a pus-encrusted fetter, and its favored weapon is the spiked chain.",
			"",
			"**Eyes That Watch (NE Forsaken of feelings of inferiority, felines, and strangers):** None can fully describe the Forsaken known as Eyes That Watch, as it appeared only as a trio of feline eyes staring from shadows with an arrogant gaze. Eyes That Watch's owb prophets gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet, can always act in the surprise round, and can use [burning gaze](spell/burning_gaze) at will as a spell-like ability. The flames from this spell-like ability are always a dull yellow and never shed more than dim light. Eyes That Watch's symbol is three feline eyes, and its favored weapon is the dagger.",
			"",
			"**Grasping Iovett (CE Forsaken of accidents, parasites, and reckless lust):** Clad only in heavy black silks that shifted to reveal sensual forms of an indescribable variety, Grasping Iovett's touch left painful welts and tick infestations. Iovett's owb prophets are immune to disease and poison, cannot be grappled unless they choose to be, and automatically succeed at combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks to escape a grapple or pin. They can use [eruptive pustules](spell/eruptive_pustules) at will as a spell-like ability. Iovett's symbol is a stylized tick on a swatch of silk, and its favored weapon is the short sword.",
			"",
			"**Husk (NE Forsaken of emptiness, loneliness, and narcissism):** Husk was an attractive, androgynous humanoid whose joints were gaps that revealed the Forsaken to be entirely hollow beneath paper-thin skin. Husk's owb prophets are immune to bleed, disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison, and they can use [silence](spell/silence) at will as a spell-like ability. Husk's symbol is an empty humanoid outline with hands outstretched, and its favored weapon is the short sword.",
			"",
			"**Lady Razor (NE Forsaken of family strife, suspicion, and vengeance):** A stern magistrate among the Forsaken, Lady Razor forbade showing kindness or mercy to family members. Lady Razor's owb prophets are proficient with all slashing weapons, never take penalties on attack rolls when fighting with multiple slashing weapons, and can use [keen edge](spell/keen_edge) at will as a spell-like ability. Lady Razor's symbol is a gavel crossed with a bloody razor, and her favored weapon is the dagger.",
			"",
			"**Reshmit of the Heavy Voice (CE Forsaken of broken things, forgetting, and unexpected violence):** Reshmit was a Gargantuan shadowy form whose softest touch landed like a hammer blow and whose rumbling voice could shred steel. Reshmit's owb prophets emanate an aura of forgetfulness within 30 feet; each creature in the aura other than owb prophets must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half the owb prophet's Hit Dice + the owb prophet's Charisma modifier) each round or lose one prepared spell or available spell slot. They can use [shatter](spell/shatter) at will as a spell-like ability. Reshmit's symbol is a torn steel plate, and his favored weapon is the morningstar.",
			"",
			"**Thalaphyrr Martyr-Minder (LE Forsaken of failed heroics, imprisonment, and squandered time):** Thalaphyrr guarded the prisons where the Forsaken kept their would-be usurpers and destroyers. Creatures within 30 feet of Thalaphyrr's owb prophets cannot benefit from morale bonuses. In addition, his owb prophets can use [slow](spell/slow) at will as a spell-like ability. Thalaphyrr's symbol is a pair of hands grasping a set of prison bars, and his favored weapon is the spear."

			"The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite well-established in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.",
			"",
			"Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.",
			"",
			"Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs.",
			"",
			"Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets.",
			"",
			"While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult).",

It is not considered to be wielded or worn, and the item functions as though in an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field) while embedded in the paguroida's shell. A paguroida that has embedded magic items with a total caster level that is at least equal to its Hit Dice (11 for a typical paguroida) gains a +4 deflection bonus to its AC and a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A paguroida with embedded magic items whose total caster level is at least twice the creature's Hit Dice doubles these bonuses and gains the advanced creature simple template.

Creatures or objects revealed to a spellcaster who succeeds at this caster level check remain detectable for 24 hours to that spellcaster, even if the creature or item exits and reenters the aura.

			"Believed to have been created by the [aboleths](monster/aboleth) in ages long past as part of the alghollthus' experiments on the [murajau](monster/murajau), paguroidas are reclusive, hermit crab-like monstrous humanoids who live in hidden grottoes and seaside estuaries, typically on isolated or remote coastlines. One of their upper limbs terminates in a humanoid hand, while the other ends in a large pincer capable of gripping and crushing prey. A paguroida's face is similar to that of a crab, with protruding eyestalks and a wide mandible-filled mouth, though its torso is distinctly humanoid in shape and size. A typical paguroida stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Paguroidas live solitary but long lives-their isolation and extreme paranoia about interaction with other species precludes many unnatural causes of death. In most cases, a paguroida eventually succumbs to old age after having lived for as many as a dozen centuries. Despite their longevity, paguroidas are not fecund, and they reproduce only once every 200-300 years after reaching reproductive maturity at the age of 150. Female paguroidas each lay a single egg in a secluded location, which they abandon among a small cache of magical items from their shells. Nearby male paguroidas locate the eggs by following the unique magical aura they exude, as well as the magical auras of the items in the eggs' cache-nests. Once fertilized, an egg ceases to emit such an aura, but the male that fertilized it remains nearby to protect it during the 6 months it gestates before hatching.",
			"",
			"Hatchlings are incredibly vulnerable, their shells taking as many as 5 years to harden. Paguroida fathers often give their offspring one or more magical items from their own shells, and they assist the offspring in embedding them and the items from their mothers' cache-nests into their soft shells to bolster their defenses in their first year.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Paguroidas live almost entirely alone, only rarely congregating in groups, generally for purposes of defense or to consolidate resources. Even then, these groups almost never exceed 10 members, as paguroidas have an innate understanding that the valuable items embedded in their shells would draw more treasure hunters to them, negating the advantages of greater numbers.",
			"",
			"Typically making their lairs near ancient ruins filled with long-abandoned magical relics, paguroidas prefer to dwell in underwater grottoes inaccessible from the surface. They protect these lairs with powerful illusions and abjurations, counting on remaining hidden to protect themselves and their treasures from potential thieves. A paguroida who encounters an intelligent interloper first attempts to trick the creature into leaving its territory, preferring to avoid conflict altogether. If discovered and unable to persuade the trespasser to leave, a paguroida may offer one of the magic items from its shell as a bribe to send the unwanted guest on its way. This is often a last resort, however, as most paguroidas know that once granted a single item of power, most creatures will seek more and respond with force if their demands are denied.",
			"",
			"Because of their mutual penchant for hoarding wealth, dragons are a paguroida's primary threat, and the crabfolk avoid even good and neutral dragons out of a strong sense of self-preservation. Only when offered substantial magical wealth as signs of good faith do paguroidas cooperate with dragons, and even then they do so warily."

			"",
			"The average pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Created by Urgathoa as mockeries of true angels, pallid angels strongly resemble the celestial beings for which they were named, and if cleansed of the stains of their hedonism they can often pass for such goodly creatures. Pallid angels particularly enjoy such deceptions, taking advantage of gullible mortals to revel in their adulation and spread the indulgent ways of the Pallid Princess. However, unlike true angels, pallid angels are universally female, with bodies resembling those they had or most desired in life.",
			"",
			"As outsiders, pallid angels have no need to eat or sleep; however, befitting their nature as favored servants of the goddess of indulgence, they seek out and revel in the pleasures of the flesh. Though any act of carnal pleasure is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.",
			"",
			"In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid angels' love of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse, and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp. Pallid angels take great pleasure in tormenting hostages and prisoners of war, and they occasionally spare unconscious foes for this purpose. A pallid angel denied such victims eventually sates her violent urges upon her companions and servants.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"If the daughters of Urgathoa are the goddess's most favored servants in life and unlife, pallid angels are her most favored in what comes after both. Pallid angels are created by Urgathoa from the souls of her greatest female worshippers, given bodies capable of enjoying all the pleasures of the flesh as reward for their service. In Urgathoa's domain on Abaddon, pallid angels spend much of their time indulging their desires, though most also serve as governors, arbiters, and vicious defenders against psychopomp raids.",
			"",
			"Pallid angels are often sent in response to planar ally spells or called by planar binding spells; a wise caller is ready to satisfy the angel's hedonism, such as by casting heroes' feast for the angel's exclusive benefit. Pallid angels are often conjured to serve as generals of great armies, particularly those heavy with undeath. Several pallid angels served the Whispering Tyrant as commanders in his initial conquest of Ustalav; at least one remains somewhere in the mountains of Virlych, magically entrapped by Arazni before her death at the Tyrant's hands.",
			"",
			"In addition to the angels' role as military leaders, small cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to share in their pleasures. Urgathoa sometimes sends pallid angels to such pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and ensures the cult's corruption to Urgathoa's service.",
			"",
			"Pallid angels and daughters of Urgathoa both hold great authority and honor among the faithful of the Pallid Princess, and many of those who eventually became pallid angels were first elevated to be daughters of Urgathoa upon their mortal deaths. When brought together, pallid angels serve as a martial counterpart to the more ecclesiastical role played by daughters, much like the paladins and clerics of good faiths. In such cases, pallid angels and daughters cooperate in service to the goddess's will, though their relationship is often strained. Pallid angels often treat daughters with subtle pity and condescension for their reduced access to physical pleasures and their less direct relationship to Urgathoa, while daughters frequently hold angels in quiet contempt for their status as living-and thus less perfect-beings."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The panotti are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for one startling difference: their enormous ears. A panotti's ears are attached to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang loosely, like an elephant's, but extend almost the length of their bodies. These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but appearances are deceiving. Panotti possess remarkably smooth muscle control along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control their ears at will.",
			"",
			"Even though panotti look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary. Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in panotti children.",
			"",
			"Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the company of their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally hearty and capable warriors.",
			"",
			"On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan."

If the target forgoes an attack of opportunity provoked by this maneuver, it can try to avoid the pard by attempting a DC 19 Reflex save; if successful, it takes only half damage. The pard can only deal phasing attack damage to each target once per round, no matter how many times its movement takes it over a target creature. When using this ability, the pard can move through up to 5 feet of any solid object, barrier, or difficult terrain as if it were a normal open square.

Adult pards are 6 feet long and weigh 100 pounds.",

Smarter than common beasts, pards are semi-intelligent, mate for life, and have a complex social structure. Pards also possess a form of telepathy they use to communicate amongst themselves, and can use this on a limited basis to confront intruders or create mutually beneficial alliances."

A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one-before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle's straps interfere with the creature's wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount.",
			"",
			"Pegasi lay eggs-they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies.",

These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes."

			"Roosting on statuary and eaves, pest drakes are the bane of masons and carpenters across Golarion. By itself, a single pest drake is a tolerated nuisance, eating insects and other vermin in the city. Its distinctive song-like chirp greets passersby and thanks those who throw it scraps of food. When pest drakes gather, however, they become much more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups, becoming deadly, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.",
			"",
			"Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just under a foot in length and weigh 1-2 pounds. They live approximately 10-15 years.",
			"",
			"Centuries ago, a wizard who was jealous of his colleague's bond with a pseudodragon captured a clutch of pseudodragons, determined to create his own draconic familiar. He drained his family's fortune in countless experiments to create a less intelligent and more obedient dragon. His experiments routinely failed, with many of the resulting offspring unable to properly bond as familiars or so frail they died within days of hatching. Decades later, a young paladin of Apsu discovered the wizard's atrocities against dragonkind and confronted the wizard. The wizard's daughter, who had cared for the failed experiments all of her life, released them from their cages, attempting to spare them from her father's magic and the paladin's ire.",
			"",
			"Not long after the paladin left the wizard's mansion, the drakes returned to their pen. The daughter, intending to grant them freedom, released them further and further away from her home, only to discover them back in her courtyard each time she returned. Unable to \"free\" the drakes, she instead created a messenger service with them in an attempt to recover her family's fortune. Her plan did not work quite as intended. The drakes became a decades-long fashion fad that spread like wildfire across Golarion's nobility, especially after it was discovered that the creatures could be easily bred to exhibit a variety of colors, spikes, and frill styles. By the time the drakes fell out of fashion, they had become too embedded in their urban homes to ever be fully removed.",
			"",
			"Unlike their draconic cousins, pest drakes are highly fertile and mature quickly. Mated pairs lay clutches of two to three eggs each year in the spring and fall. The eggs incubate for 2 months, and a hatchling reaches physical and sexual maturity within 5 months. A mated pair of pest drakes remains together while incubating eggs and raising the hatchlings, but they often find new mates within the flock after those young mature. Each adult in the flock takes at least some role in a hatchling's growth, often teaching it which places to frequent for food and which to avoid due to danger. Some smaller flocks have been known to follow people who feed them, even as those people age and move to different homes within the city, passing the tribal knowledge of previous kindness from one generation of pest drakes to the next.",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are not as vicious as their drake cousins, and they rarely attack creatures larger than themselves. They are omnivorous, subsisting primarily on berries, seeds, insects, and small rodents, though those that inhabit cities get the majority of their diet from scraps dropped by the city's inhabitants. Many pest drakes perch patiently in parks where citizens are likely to rest and eat, waiting for a dropped scrap or the opportunity to steal an untended meal. Some pest drakes have learned that chirping, dancing, and other displays often delight the local populace, leading to the drakes getting more scraps of food.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are social, communal creatures that exist almost entirely within cities. Flocks within cities tend to claim sections of the city as their territories and defend these territories from outside menaces, whether those menaces are other flocks of pest drakes, an invasion of stowaway rats on the docks, or new construction in the nobles' district that disrupts their nests. Flocks of pest drakes found outside of cities still frequently gravitate toward humanoid settlements, latching onto tribes or villages. Pest drakes communicate with each other through a mixture of body language, chirps, clicks, and whistles. They can understand basic words and simple commands in the languages of the humanoids around them, but they lack the ability to fully understand or speak a language.",
			"",
			"Masons despise pest drakes. The drakes' acidic biology eventually permeates their roosting places, slowly eating away at the structure beneath. Their acid erodes details on statues, inscriptions on walls, and designs on column capitals. Buildings and statuary made of marble or painted in lighter colors are particularly susceptible to this corrosion, as it slowly darkens the stone and dissolves the paint. Once established, these pests have proven difficult to remove, as they are often too numerous and too prolific to fully exterminate, especially when the local populace so regularly feeds the friendly creatures. In poorer areas where vermin are more prevalent, the citizens often encourage the habitation of pest drakes to help keep the populations of other pests down.",
			"",
			"Many minor nobles still collect and breed pest drakes for racing stock due to their innate ability to always find their way home. Some pest drakes are bred for speed, others for endurance. These races are collectively referred to as \"Rainbow Races\" due to the bright streaks of color that fill the sky when the pest drakes are released. Owners keep racing drakes in housing that limits the drakes' ability to form a bond with others of their kind. Current Rainbow Races have regulations limiting how many pest drakes can be raced at the same time after the Great Drake Disaster in Taldor, in which thousands of half-starved pest drakes were released for a race and subsequently bonded into a flock that decimated the nearby farmland."

			"Enormous winged snakes, peuchens range in color from violet to vibrant green to glossy black; the most commonly encountered peuchens are a dark, tawny brown. Those in jungles tend to match the patterns found on local pythons. Rarely, they sport a series of red, white, and black bands, with the thin white band sandwiched between the thicker red and black bands. When peuchens are not flying, their leathery, batlike wings lie folded along their bodies, matching the coloration of the hides below. Their eyes are a brilliant green, with snakelike pupils. Peuchens have a smooth, dry texture to their diamond-shaped scales and smell faintly of nutmeg. Their fangs fold up into their jaw, but snap into place to bite prey with lightning speed.",
			"",
			"When they hunt, peuchens take on the form of livestock, such as sheep, goats, and cattle, and they prefer to stalk places suffering from drought or famine. These ambush predators often trick shepherds or lone farmers into bringing them back to farms, homesteads, and towns, where they can slip out each night to prey on any creatures they can find. They ambush their prey by coiling up and lunging with their strikes from a distance father than their prey usually expects. Peuchens prefer to drain the blood of humanoids, but they will eat sheep, goats, cats, dogs, or poultry if they fail to capture their favorite prey. They happily lair in haylofts or open attics, but also create nests in large trees or rock formations. Peuchens lay 6-inch eggs in scattered groups of eight to 12, and leave the young to fend for themselves.",

			"A peuchen measures around 12 feet long and 1 foot in diameter at its thickest point, with a wingspan of 8 feet; it weighs nearly 250 pounds."

An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss chance).

When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if possible-characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud attacks (such as bards or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter creatures.",
			"",
			"The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This \"mouth\" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to siphon away nutrients.",

In such a case, the betraying worshiper may not have the luxury of living the rest of his life and putting off divine punishment until some point after death. Sometimes, the god is so offended that the infidel is transformed into a pharmakos. While a pharmakos has much power, the metamorphosis into such a cursed creature is rarely one a worshiper seeks, for the pain and humiliation of the punishment is significant. That the altered worshiper can go on to serve the deity as a powerful guardian is of a secondary concern to the god in most cases, and regardless, when a pharmakos finally meets the end of its pain-filled life, then true divine punishment begins."

Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape.",

Vast, complex nests of semisolid ether float idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, each supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures enjoy each other's company, but have no real concept of family-a newborn phase spider is fully capable of fending for itself and is treated no differently by its parents or siblings than any other.",

Numerous mushrooms sprout from the main body-vile green stalks topped with purple or red caps that seem to steam with rank-smelling smoke. This smoke is in fact vapor escaping from the numerous globs of acid the plant produces as a method of both self-defense and reproduction.",

Less fortunate encounters are typically marked by large infestations of phycomids growing among a scattered collection of dead bodies.",

			"Because of the filthy environment in which this fungus thrives, goblins are one of the few races that have learned to coexist with phycomids. Not content to simply give the fungi a wide berth, these foolish goblins actually harvest the phycomids, prodding them into positions in their warrens where they can serve as guards and sentinels, utilizing long poles they call \"slime sticks\" or placing delicious-smelling carrion to attract the fungus to a desired position. Although phycomids are deadly to eat, many goblin tribes view those who eat a phycomid mushroom and survive as great heroes. Needless to say, most goblin lairs that attempt to utilize phycomids as guardians eventually become nothing more than phycomid lairs-a goblin tribe's luck can only hold up for so long, after all."
