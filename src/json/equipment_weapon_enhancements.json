When activated, the cleric charges the weapon with positive or negative energy (as appropriate) so it deals extra damage when it hits a target. This functions like the [Channel Smite](feat/channel_smite) feat, except the additional damage is equal to half the cleric's channel energy damage (the target makes a Will save as normal, based on the cleric's channel energy DC). The weapon remains charged with this energy until it successfully strikes a creature or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first. Creatures other than the cleric are able to use the charged weapon and this ability."
