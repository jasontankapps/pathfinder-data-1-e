			"Though all faiths have their dedicated priests and righteous warriors, gods inspire devotion from a wide range of individuals. Rogues who specialize in stealth and poisons might swear allegiance to Norgorber, while wandering bards sing songs in praise of Desna. Even the most powerful deity is not too proud to turn such followers aside, for the worship of passionate acolytes is precious regardless of their backgrounds, professions, races, or ages, and they might lead others to the faith by example. These unusual but skillful followers of the gods are called evangelists.",

She may follow one path strictly or dabble in multiple professions. She may be of any race and pledge her faith to any of the core deities. Of all the preeminent followers of the core deities, the evangelist is the hardest to predict and shows the most variety in her abilities.",

			"The following are class features of the genie binder prestige class.",
			"",
			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A genie binder gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.",
			"",
			"**Binding Pool (Su):** Using a combination of blackmail, contracts, magical finesse, and negotiation, a genie binder can command genies and channel their magic. A genie binder has a binding pool equal to twice her genie binder class level, and the pool recharges each day, typically after she gets a restful night's sleep. As a free action before attempting a Charisma check or Charisma-based skill check to interact with a genie, the genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool to add 1d6 to the result.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Seal (Sp):** By expending 1 point from her binding pool, a genie binder can touch a creature or solid surface to create a powerful rune known as an elemental seal. At 1st level, a genie binder can create a seal of air. At 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels, she learns how to create seals of earth, fire, and water, respectively. Creating an elemental seal requires a standard action, and placing it on an unwilling target requires a successful melee touch attack. An elemental seal is a writing-based magical effect whose caster level is equal to the genie binder's character level, and any associated saving throw is equal to 10 + the genie binder's class level + the genie binder's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"At 1st level, a genie binder can maintain only one elemental seal at a time. If she creates another seal beyond that limit, she chooses one of her seals to end immediately. Otherwise, an elemental seal lasts for 24 hours, and a genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool each day to extend the duration of an existing seal by 24 hours.",
			"",
			"An elemental seal has a different effect depending on whether it's placed on a genie, a non-genie creature, or a solid surface. If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a genie with a matching subtype (such as a seal of air on a djinni), the genie must succeed at a Will save or be affected by charm monster as long as the seal lasts.",
			"",
			"If a genie binder places an elemental seal on a non-genie creature, that creature gains several constant benefits, including resistance 10 to one energy type based on the seal's element. A seal of air grants electricity resistance and feather fall. A seal of earth grants acid resistance and barkskin. A seal of fire grants fire resistance and causes one weapon the creature wields to gain the flaming weapon special ability. A seal of water grants cold resistance, freedom of movement, and water breathing. At 5th level, the granted energy resistance increases to 20.",
			"",
			"When placed on a solid surface, an elemental seal functions as a glyph of warding. The seal can duplicate only the effects of a blast glyph and deals a specific type of damage based on the seal: acid (seal of earth), cold (seal of water), electricity (seal of air), or fire (seal of fire).",
			"",
			"**Genie Mastery (Su):** At 1st level, a genie binder must decide whether to bind a genie minion or pursue spellcasting power. Once this decision is made, it can't be changed. If she selects a genie minion, she gains an eidolon with the genie subtype, treating her genie binder level as her effective summoner level; her genie binder levels stack with any summoner levels she has for this purpose, but only for an eidolon with the genie subtype. If she selects spellcasting, she gains the benefits of her aligned spellcasting class feature (see below) at 3rd level, in addition to the other indicated levels.",
			"",
			"**Spells per Day:** At the indicated levels, a genie binder gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a genie binder, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Genie Summoner (Su):** At 2nd level, a genie binder adds several types of genie to the creatures she can summon using the indicated summon monster spells: djinni (summon monster V), efreeti or shaitan (summon monster VI), or marid (summon monster VII). Each time she summons a genie in this way, she must expend 1 point from her binding pool, and summoned genies cannot cast wish.",
			"",
			"**Extra Seal (Su):** At 3rd level, a geniebinder can maintain up to two elemental seals at a time. At 5th level, she can maintain up to three elemental seals.",
			"",
			"**Unstoppable Seal (Su):** At 5th level, when placing an elemental seal on a genie, the genie binder can expend 1 point from her binding pool to increase the saving throw DC to resist the effect by 2."

			"Within Andoran's borders, Golden Legionnaires operate independently alongside the nation's armed forces as members of elite military units. These highly capable field commanders and training officers adjust to suit the needs of a particular region, often developing specialized talents to counter specific threats found nearby. Angry fey in the Verduran Forest, tricky kobold traps near the Candlestone Caverns, and dangerous werewolves in Darkmoon Vale all threaten the Golden Legionnaires and their mission to safeguard their homeland. In Andoran's towns and cities, teams of Golden Legionnaires work to thwart spies and sinister agents of foreign powers, such as devious Taldan poisoners, Chelish diabolists, and Okeno bounty hunters.",
			"",
			"Above all else, the Golden Legion's duty is domestic security; the Legion extensively trains its soldiers in defensive tactics and strategies that ensure the protection of both Andorens and other members of the Legion. That said, a typical Golden Legionnaire exhibits audacious courage and unflinchingly puts himself between those he protects and possible threats. An ambush or unprovoked attack incenses a Golden Legionnaire and propels him to acts of selfless bravery and daring prowess. Even when they are hundreds of miles away from their homes, Golden Legionnaires use their skills and combat prowess to protect their allies and Andoran's ideals.",
			"",
			"While a large proportion of Golden Legionnaire candidates enlist from within the ranks of the Andoren military, the Legion recruits a number of nontraditional soldiers for their special skills. Applicants must demonstrate their devotion to the Andoren ideals of equality, freedom, and justice, as well as obtain a written recommendation from a senior Eagle Knight-or, under unusual circumstances, the personal recommendation of a member of the People's Council, Andoran's legislative body.",

			"**United Defense (Ex):** At 2nd level, a Golden Legionnaire can select one ally as a swift action. While he is adjacent to this ally, the Golden Legionnaire takes a -1 penalty to his Armor Class and the selected ally receives a +2 dodge bonus to his Armor Class for 1 round.

When a Golden Legionnaire does this, he gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against the designated adversary for a number of rounds equal to his class level. A Golden Legionnaire can have a number of designated adversaries up to one-third his class level. If he already has his maximum number of designated adversaries selected, he can end the effects of his allied retribution against one of his previously designated adversaries and select a new one. The Golden Legionnaire can reselect a creature that is already a designated adversary if it attacks an ally or a friendly creature again, allowing him to restart the effect's duration. At 7th level, the morale bonus increases to +2.",

			"The Gray Corsairs existed for some time before the Eagle Knights officially formed. While they've focused on fighting slavery from the start, they did so in their early days as true pirates rather than privateers. Their assimilation into the Eagle Knights as the naval arm of the Steel Falcons gave the organization a surprisingly strong presence in the Inner Sea, and with Andoran's direct support, these privateers have become a force to be reckoned with.",

Swift and agile combatants are in high demand on Gray Corsair ships, as are spellcasters with the ability to command elemental forces or magical transport, and the prestige class plays to this, offering such characters an opportunity to choose an area of specialty while bolstering their nautical skill and knack for rescuing slaves.",

In addition, in such circumstances he doesn't take a penalty when using the accelerated climbing option, doesn't lose his Dexterity bonus to AC, and doesn't need to attempt a Climb check to avoid falling when he takes damage.",

The DC of this save is equal to 10 + the Gray Gardener's class level + the Gray Gardener's Wisdom modifier. A Gray Gardener can use this ability once per day.",

			"**Final Demise (Su):** At 10th level, once per week, when a Gray Gardener kills a creature with a melee weapon, he can draw the soul out of the dead body and imprison it in his weapon as if using a soul bind spell (caster level equal to the Gray Gardener's character level). Destroying the weapon or dispelling this effect frees the soul. After spending 24 hours in the weapon, the captured soul escapes. However, by touching the weapon holding a captured soul to a final blade, the Gray Gardener can transfer the soul into the magical guillotine to remain trapped inside indefinitely. In addition, at 10th level, a Gray Gardener receives initiation in the secret rituals that can release a soul from a [final blade](magic/artifact/final_blade).",
			"",
			"**True Death (Su):** At 10th level, anyone slain by a Gray Gardener becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Attempts to use raise dead or similar magic to resurrect such a creature require a successful DC 25 caster level check, or the spell fails and any material components are wasted."

Shamelessly willing to take advantage of their foes, they can instantly assess a situation in order to find a way to turn it to their own benefit. When a giant swings his club, the halfling opportunist leaps onto it and uses the momentum to make her jump go that much further. When a spellcaster hurls a bolt of magical energy, the halfling opportunist steps in front of a door and uses the power to help her to smash through so she can make her escape. When a courtier tries to blacken her name, the halfling opportunist lets loose such a stream of cheeky accusations that the courtier ends up looking like the traitor instead. Halfling opportunists' ability to exploit their enemies gives them a breezy selfconfidence and the sheer audacity to take risks few others would dare. Perhaps because of this brazenness, they seem blessed by amazing strokes of good fortune. However, they rarely take their luck for granted. Instead they rely upon their keen senses to sidestep danger and their adaptability to carry them through both combat and social settings.",

The enemy must be able to reach the opportunist, and the opportunist must activate this ability as an immediate action and succeed at a combat maneuver check against the enemy's CMD; at the GM's discretion, the opportunist can substitute another ability score modifier for her Strength modifier when making her combat maneuver check (such as using Dexterity for an agility-related action or Charisma for a social-related action). If the halfling succeeds at this combat maneuver check, she adds the aid another bonus to her action on her next turn and subtracts that bonus from the enemy's roll for that action. Note that if the combat maneuver check is successful, the outcome of the enemy's roll is irrelevant to this ability-a halfling opportunist can use a giant's swinging club to jump farther whether the giant hits or misses with its attack roll.",

The GM decides this is a reasonable use, has the player make a combat maneuver check against the giant's CMD, and allows her to use Piria's Dexterity bonus in place of her Strength bonus in the check. She succeeds and will gain the aid another bonus on her Climb check on her next turn. The GM rolls the ogre's attack with a -2 penalty, hits Piria, and deals damage, but Piria still gets the aid another bonus on her next Acrobatics check- perhaps as the ogre's club hit her, she grabbed it, flipped onto it, and on her turn can jump from the swinging club using the +2 bonus from aid another.",

This enables her to act as if she belongs in any situation, whether an aristocratic garden party or an evil cult's inner sanctum. She can make a Disguise check in lieu of a Diplomacy check to influence the initial attitudes of NPCs. She does not need to change her appearance to make this check-this ability relies on instinctively knowing how to act to make it appear she belongs. If multiple creatures with differing views of appropriate behavior are present, she cannot simultaneously affect them and must choose a target creature or group to influence-she can't pretend to be a guest at a fancy party to impress the nobles and pretend to be a maid to mingle with the servants at the same time.",

They serve as faceless enforcers of order and use their magical powers to relentlessly root out and punish criminals to the letter of the law. They wear masks' often featureless-to mark themselves as impersonal agents of order, unswayed by empathy, detached from emotion, and dedicated to passing impartial judgment upon all lawbreakers. A signifer's distinctive mask is a symbol of his devotion to the precepts of law and exacting justice, and it serves as the focus for several of his signifer powers. Traditionally, signifers are arcane or divine spellcasters. As a signifer must be lawful, clerics who take this prestige class generally worship lawful deities, with the majority being worshipers of Abadar or Asmodeus. Despite trends toward diabolism, overall a signifer's views of good and evil are defined by his Hellknight order first and everything else second. While it's certainly possible for a psychic spellcaster to become a Hellknight signifer, to date, such examples are relatively rare among the various Hellknight orders.

As a standard action he may announce he is bringing Iomedae's judgment upon a target who is accused of a crime, lie, or other affront to justice; the crusader makes a melee attack with his sword against the target as part of this judgment. If the target is innocent of what he is accused, the attack stops just short of striking him, as if hitting an invisible wall; if the target is guilty, the attack automatically hits with a flash of white light. This attack requires no attack roll and cannot critically hit. If the target is protected by an effect that inhibits divinations (such as mind blank), the attack bounces off the target with an unpleasant metallic hiss, like quenching a red-hot blade in water. The crusader may use this ability once per day; each additional use beyond the first drains him, causing him to become fatigued. He cannot use this class ability if he is exhausted. He may expend a use of channel energy or lay on hands while activating this ability to prevent fatigue. Sometimes people wrongly accused of great crimes beg for the intercession of an Inheritor's crusader, knowing this power will exonerate them."

They arbitrate disputes, deal with criminals, and establish law where there is none. In pleasant times they are diplomats, in dangerous ones they are judge, jury, and executioner. Their feet leave trails destined to become great roads, and their decrees carry the force of law. Being a justiciar is a serious duty and is not taken lightly-they tend to wear down over time, weathered not from travel and sunlight but from the heavy burden of carrying civilization forward into the future. A rare few pursue heretics of their own religion, keeping the faith stable and weeding out unruly elements. Each is sworn to uphold a religious or secular code.",

			"**Aura of Law (Ex):** The power of a justiciar's aura of law (see the detect law spell) is equal to her character level. If the justiciar has cleric or paladin levels, the power of her aura of law is equal to her character level +4.",
			"",
			"**Authority (Su):** A justiciar serves a religious or legal code and has absolute authority (granted by a higher-ranking agent of that code) to enforce it. This means that if the justiciar catches criminals, she may judge them guilty (given sufficient proof ) and order their execution, or do it herself if need be. Because the justiciar must act within the law, there is rarely any friction between her and established authorities other than disputes about jurisdiction and challenges from other forms of authority. (A religiously endorsed justiciar, for example, might come into conflict with secular governors who take exception to the execution of their subjects.) A justiciar may deputize others to aid her in her tasks, although she is responsible for their actions in her name.",
			"",
			"As part of a Diplomacy and Intimidate check regarding matters of the law and her authority, a justiciar may exert her authority to grant herself a +4 bonus on these checks. This ability negates any need to carry a badge or writ of office, and is mainly used to convince those unfamiliar with the justiciar of her legal powers. For example, a justiciar can use this ability to check an angry mob intent on lynching a jailed prisoner, or convince a stubborn mayor that interfering with the justiciar's efforts is likely to anger the lord they both work for. Even against individuals who don't acknowledge his code of laws (such as thieves or warriors from other lands), the justicar's fervor still grants these skill bonuses. She does not, however, gain these bonuses in situations where her code of laws would not apply or hold no bearing (like against monsters or savages). The GM ultimately adjudicates who the justiciar's authority applies against.",
			"",
			"In addition, a justiciar's knowledge of her code is magically flawless, as if she were mentally reviewing a perfect copy of the code. If the source of the code changes (such as a decree from the church's high priest or a new law created by a king), she instantly knows it. This perfect knowledge means she immediately recognizes any misquoting of the law (deliberate or accidental), and many justiciars consider it their duty to review the law book in remote settlements to make sure there are no errors in transcription or translation. A justiciar may always take 10 on Knowledge checks regarding the code, even when rushed or threatened.",
			"",
			"**Lawkeeper:** Justiciars are not allowed to violate their code or any oath or contract they willingly agree to, nor can they go against the spirit of it while holding to the letter. A justiciar who willingly does so loses all prestige class abilities until she receives an atonement spell from her religious superiors or an official pardon from her secular superiors.",
			"",
			"**Sure Shot:** A justiciar is skilled with crossbows. At 2nd level, she gains the ability to make a sure shot. A number of times per day equal to her class level, a justiciar may add her Charisma bonus on an attack roll made with a crossbow and deal 1 extra point of damage per justiciar level.",
			"",
			"**Oathmark (Su):** This ability magically seals an oath or agreement between two people. The justiciar chooses two willing creatures and presses her authority upon them. By accepting her authority and stating their agreement on something (whether a verbal promise, written contract, treaty, or the like), the two creatures are magically linked so that if one breaks the agreement, the other knows it. The expiration of the link does not explain the exact nature of the betrayal, only that it has occurred. If one target dies, the link ends and the other target knows the other party is dead.",
			"",
			"Direct and indirect attempts to violate the agreement end the link; swearing not to kill someone and then hiring someone else to do it is a violation, as is hiring assassins before the agreement with the orders to kill the person later. The link cannot penetrate other planes, areas where magic does not function, or spells such as mind blank that block mind reading. Once the interference ends, the link resumes and determines if the agreement has been broken. The other person in the link knows if the link is blocked, but not why.",
			"",
			"The creature who breaks the agreement is cursed with a raised physical mark on the forehead (or other obvious place) indicating his willing violation of the agreement. The target takes a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when dealing with those who dislike oathbreakers. Magical attempts to remove the mark-such as via remove curse-require a successful caster level check (DC 10 + justiciar's character level). Even if the curse is removed, the other party in the agreement still knows of the betrayal. The mark is colored and textured as the justicar chooses, and cannot be hidden with makeup, tattoos, or scars, although greater physical obstructions (such as a long wig or low-hanging hat) can conceal it.",
			"",
			"This is a permanent divination effect. Creating a link is a standard action. The justiciar may use this ability up to three times per day."

Arazni's death at Tar- Baphon's hands and the demise of Aroden at the start of the Age of Lost Omens caused the order to transfer its allegiance to Aroden's inheritor-the goddess Iomedae, herself a heroine of the Shining Crusade.

			"",
			"**To the Rescue (Su):** The sight of a liberator staging a daring rescue proves inspirational to his allies. As a standard action, the liberator can shout an encouraging phrase or raise a rallying cry to bring hope to those awaiting rescue. All allies within 30 feet of the liberator gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, a +4 morale bonus on Escape Artist checks, and a +4 morale bonus on saving throws made against fear effects. These bonuses persist for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the liberator's Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).",
			"",
			"**Poison Resistance (Ex):** Slavers often make liberal use of poison and drugs to keep their captives lethargic and under control. A liberator purposefully exposes himself to a variety of venoms in order to build up a resistance to such toxins, should he ever fall victim to those he opposes. He gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made against poisons. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level.",
			"",
			"**Lockbreaker (Ex):** Starting at 2nd level, a liberator receives a competence bonus equal to half his class level on all Open Lock checks. He also gains this bonus on all Escape Artist checks made to escape bindings, shackles, and other restraints.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Feat:** At 3rd level, the liberator gains a bonus feat. He must qualify for the feat, and it must be from the following list: Blind-Fight, Iron Will, or Skill Focus (any class skill).",
			"",
			"**Silent Sunder (Ex):** At 3rd level, a liberator learns methods of applying force and striking objects in such a way as to minimize noise. He can choose to make no more noise than people talking when making a sunder attack action or attempting to break an object with a Strength check.",
			"",
			"**Slaver's Ruin (Ex):** The sight of imprisonment and slavery can drive a liberator into a righteous frenzy. A liberator of at least 5th level can designate one creature engaged in such acts as the target of his wrath. The designated foe is considered flat-footed against the liberator's next attack. Opponents who cannot be caught flat-footed (such as through improved uncanny dodge) are immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"**Greater Sunder (Ex):** Beginning at 6th level, a liberator ignores half of an object's hardness when making a sunder attack or attacking an object. He also gains a +2 morale bonus on his opposed attack roll when making a sunder attempt (but not when defending against a sunder attempt).",
			"",
			"**Steely Resolve (Ex):** A liberator fears magical domination more than anything else, for the enslavement of the mind is difficult to detect and remove. At 7th level, whenever a liberator is targeted by a charm or compulsion effect and fails his saving throw, he may attempt his saving throw again 1 round later at the same DC to resist the effect. He gets only this one extra chance to throw off any one effect.",
			"",
			"**Darkvision (Su):** At 8th level, a liberator has spent so much time sneaking through the dark to free the victims of unjust imprisonment that he develops darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If the liberator already possesses darkvision, the range of his darkvision increases by 60 feet.",
			"",
			"**Quick Pick (Ex):** There's not always time to properly pick a lock, and sometimes liberators have to improvise. At 9th level, a liberator has perfected the art of lockpicking to such an extent that he may attempt an Open Locks check as a move action instead of a full-round action without any additional penalties.",
			"",
			"Freedom of Movement (Su) At 10th level, the liberator's focus against slavery and restriction to mobility develops into a potent resistance to restraint. He is now treated as if under the effects of a freedom of movement spell at all times. This ability cannot be dispelled. Once per day, he can also use freedom of movement as a spell-like ability (caster level equals his class level) to share this benefit with others."

They prefer to fight in crowded urban areas and are masters of motion, controlling both their own movement and those around them. With the flick of a blade, they can slow their enemies to a crawl and then step into a crowd and disappear from sight. Lion Blades are typically recruited out of the famous bardic colleges of Oppara, as the Shadow Schools want intelligent, flexible trainees. A Lion Blade usually spends at least a year in training before taking on missions for the Taldan Empire and various non-governmental organizations. Lion Blade PCs are often on extended loan for a specific purpose or given permission to adventure in order to perfect their art in real-world settings. A rare few Lion Blades shirk their responsibilities and work independently or even serve the enemies of Taldor- Cheliax particularly values these turncoats.",

			"",

Once a target's speed has been reduced to 0 feet, it is immobilized (but not helpless). A target's fly speed can be reduced this way only if it uses wings to fly. The movement penalties imposed by slowing strike can be removed by healing the affected target to full hit points or a lesser restoration spell.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Unexpected Suggestion (Su):** At 3rd level, once per day, a Lion Blade can use suggestion on a flat-footed target. Her caster level is equal to her Lion Blade level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Lion Blade's ranks in Bluff + her Intelligence modifier.",

			"**Cloud the Mind (Su):** At 7th level, whenever a Lion Blade's opposed Disguise or Stealth check is exceeded by one or more observers' Perception checks, she can trick the observers into thinking they imagined noticing anything wrong as an immediate action. She attempts a Bluff check opposed by the targets' Sense Motive checks. Each target who fails this opposed check ignores the fact that he saw her. The Lion Blade also gains an amount of spell resistance equal to 10 + her class level against divination spells.

Yet the Magaambyan arcanist does not merely copy the magic of the natural world-she expands upon it. She simultaneously respects the traditions from which this magic stems while exploring it in ways that druids, who view their magic as a result of their faith, rarely consider. This method of converting druidic spells to arcane spells is taxing to the mind, however, and since each Magaambyan arcanist must create her own such translations, the school has not made arcane versions of druidic spells available to all arcane spellcasters. In fact, most students of the Magaambya are opposed to such an endeavor, for as intrigued as they are by this magic, they respect its traditions and do not wish to see these secrets made freely available to those who may not share their respect.",

			"The following are class features of the master chymist prestige class.",
			"",
			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A master chymist gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.",
			"",
			"**Extracts per Day:** At the indicated levels, a master chymist gains new extracts per day as if she had also gained a level in alchemist. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for extracts per day and an increased effective caster level for extracts.",
			"",
			"**Bomb-Thrower (Ex):** The destructive power of bombs appeals to the violent urges of a master chymist. Add the character's alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine the damage done by her bombs.",
			"",
			"**Mutagenic Form (Ex):** A master chymist's mutagenic form is an alter ego that has a different personality than her normal form, an outgrowth of the mental changes caused by the mutagenic potions she has consumed over the course of her career. The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Example:** Darabont is a neutral good gnome alchemist 7/master chymist 4. Her mutagenic form is a deformed, twisted creature called Butcher. Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a detect good spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.",
			"",
			"**Mutate (Su):** At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an antimagic field), or she expends another use of her mutate ability.",
			"",
			"A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability).",
			"",
			"At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th level and five times per day at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Advanced Mutagen (Su):** At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power. The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form. She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level. The chymist cannot select the same advanced mutagen more than once.",
			"",
			"**Burly (Ex):** In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks, Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.",
			"",
			"**Disguise (Ex):** When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Draconic Mutagen (Su):** When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she gains dragon-like features-scaly skin, reptilian eyes, and so on, resembling a half-dragon. The chymist chooses one dragon type (see the draconic bloodline) when selecting this advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type. The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16, must know the form of the dragon I extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Dual Mind (Ex):** The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Evasion (Ex):** This mutagen functions as the rogue ability of the same name, except that it only applies in the chymist's mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Extended Mutagen (Ex):** The duration of the master chymist's mutation is doubled.",
			"",
			"**Feral Mutagen (Ex):** This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens.",
			"",
			"**Furious Mutagen (Ex):** The damage dice for the feral mutagen's bite and claw attacks increase by one die step. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 11 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Grand Mutagen (Ex):** This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Greater Mutagen (Ex):** This mutagen is identical to the alchemist discovery of the same name and counts as that discovery for the purpose of qualifying for other discoveries or advanced mutagens. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 12 and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Growth Mutagen (Su):** When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she increases one size category, as if under the effects of an enlarge person spell. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus chymist level) of at least 16 and must know the enlarge person, giant form I, or polymorph extract to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Night Vision (Ex):** The chymist gains darkvision 60 feet and low-light vision in her mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Nimble (Ex):** The master chymist's lithe physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on all Dexterity checks, Dexterity skill checks, and CMD, and a natural armor bonus to her Armor Class. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.",
			"",
			"**Restoring Change (Su):** When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form or returns to her normal form from her mutagenic form, she heals a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + her character level.",
			"",
			"**Scent (Ex):** The master chymist gains the scent ability in her mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Brutality (Ex):** At 3rd level, a master chymist's taste for violence leads her to strike more powerful blows with weapons easily mastered by her bestial mind. At 3rd level, a chymist in her mutagenic form deals +2 damage when attacking with simple weapons and natural attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 7th level and to +6 at 9th level."

			"Unparalleled practitioners of deception, master spies rely on deceit and trickery over brawn and spells. A master spy is an expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection, and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation. Master spies may serve countries or private interests, or sell their services to the highest bidder without a thought to long-term loyalty.",
			"",
			"Bards and rogues, with their wide range of skills, are particularly well suited for the demands of spying. Rogues can easily pass themselves off as members of most nonmagical professions (though playing an armored warrior impedes their natural abilities), while bluffing bards can impersonate a wide range of other spellcasters well enough to fool a casual observer. Versatility and adaptability are the watchwords for espionage, and successful master spies let others complete their deception for them, subtly drawing targets into their machinations.",
			"",
			"**Role:** Master spies rarely work with others unless they are under cover. The special skills that serve them so well in the field ironically make them exceptional leaders, but a master spy's natural inclination toward secrecy pushes her away from the limelight. Note that a master spy among adventurers may not intend to betray them; armed heroes provide excellent cover for a master spy's true mission, whether or not they know the spy's intent.",

			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.",
			"",
			"**Glib Lie (Su):** A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.",
			"",
			"**Mask Alignment (Su):** A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.",
			"",
			"**Nonmagical Aura (Sp):** At 3rd level, a master spy can use magic aura twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical.",
			"",
			"**Superficial Knowledge (Ex):** A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained Knowledge and Profession checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained Knowledge (history) checks about the kingdom and Knowledge (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained Knowledge (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.",
			"",
			"**Concealed Thoughts (Su):** A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using detect thoughts or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts.",
			"",
			"**Quick Change (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on her Disguise check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.",
			"",
			"**Elude Detection (Sp):** At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a nondetection spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the nondetection for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Slippery Mind (Su):** At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round.",
			"",
			"**Shift Alignment (Su):** Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by holy smite with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.",
			"",
			"**Death Attack (Ex):** At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy.",
			"",
			"**Fool Casting (Su):** A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as charm person, dominate person, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Mind (Sp):** At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant mind blank spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the mind blank for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Assumption (Su):** The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination effects and spells, even ones as powerful as discern location, such that they register the spy as being the creature she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action) or she uses the ability on another creature."

He still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features of his chosen class at the specified levels.",
			"",
			"**Nosoi Plague Mask (Su):** At 3rd level, a mortal usher can conjure or dismiss a [nosoi](monster/nosoi) plague mask as a free action. This plague mask is a physical manifestation of the mortal usher's soul and cannot be destroyed or stolen, though its magic can be suppressed by an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field) or similar effect.

Creatures are entitled to a new saving throw each time they reenter the area of the aura after leaving it, and a creature who successfully saves against the aura's effects is immune to it for 24 hours. The mortal usher can suppress or resume this aura as a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Morrigna Wrappings (Su):** At 7th level, a mortal usher gains the ability to designate any cloak, scarf, robe, or shirt in his possession as his wrappings, granting it unique powers in addition to any abilities or enchantments it may already have. The wrappings grant the mortal usher a natural armor bonus equal to half his class level as long as it is in his possession, and they can be used as a magic whip that can be wielded even if the mortal usher's hands are full. When used as a whip, the wrappings gain an enhancement bonus equal to the mortal usher's class level. These bonuses can be added to the whip to increase its enhancement bonus to a maximum of +5 (minimum +1), or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: [brilliant energy](magic/enhancement/brilliant_energy), [disruption](magic/enhancement/disruption) (this supersedes the normal requirement that a disruption weapon must be a bludgeoning weapon), [flaming](magic/enhancement/flaming), [flaming burst](magic/enhancement/flaming_burst), [frost](magic/enhancement/frost), [holy](magic/enhancement/holy), [icy burst](magic/enhancement/icy_burst), [shock](magic/enhancement/shock), [shocking burst](magic/enhancement/shocking_burst), [unholy](magic/enhancement/unholy), or [vorpal](magic/enhancement/vorpal).

			"**Vanth Wings (Ex):** At 9th level, a mortal usher gains a 60-foot fly speed with good maneuverability and resistance to cold equal to 10 + his class level. The mortal usher gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks and on concentration checks attempted while casting a spell.",
			"",
			"**Yamaraj-Feather Cloak (Su):** At 10th level, a mortal usher becomes immune to electricity and death effects, and whenever he is struck by an attack or effect dealing electricity damage, he regains 1 hit point per 3 points of electricity damage the attack or effect would normally deal. If the amount of healing would cause the mortal usher to exceed his maximum hit points, he gains any excess as temporary hit points (maximum 50) that last for 1 hour."

Her features radiate with divine beauty, but the force of her presence can be frightening to others. The mystery cultist gains a +4 sacred bonus to her Charisma score and radiates a 10-foot aura of terrible awe. Creatures within the aura must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + the mystery cultist's class level + the mystery cultist's Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1d4 rounds.

This effectively extends the period in which she can be affected by a raise dead spell indefinitely. Finally, this ability prevents the mystery cultist from ever being transformed into an undead creature by any means short of a wish or miracle.",

A room is set aside for her at her patron's place of residence on the celestial planes (if her patron has no permanent residence, the room stands alone in a quiet spot on the celestial planes). Once per day, the mystery cultist can teleport herself and one willing creature per mystery cultist level to this sacred haven as per plane shift, except she always arrives exactly at the threshold of her haven.

She cannot thereafter gain levels as a mystery cultist until she atones for her deeds (see the atonement spell description). This is the only route a mystery cultist can take to switch to a different celestial patron-the atonement must come from a worshiper of the new empyreal lord."

			"**Disciple of Vigor:** By spending an hour hanging by the wrists from a tree, crossbeam, or any other support structure, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength for 24 hours.

			"**Deep Pockets (Ex):** A Pathfinder chronicler collects items as well as lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into a backpack, including potions and scrolls (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds.

Finally, the Pathfinder chronicler gains a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal small objects on her person.",
			"",
			"**Master Scribe (Ex):** A Pathfinder chronicler adds her class level as a bonus on all Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, as well as Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls or other written magical items. A Pathfinder chronicler can make Linguistics checks to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, even if distracted or endangered.",
			"",
			"**Live to Tell the Tale (Ex):** At 2nd level, once per day per two class levels, a Pathfinder chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects.",
			"",
			"**Pathfinding (Ex):** Beginning at 2nd level, a Pathfinder chronicler develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A Pathfinder chronicler gains a +5 bonus on Survival checks made to avoid becoming lost and to Intelligence checks to escape a maze spell. In addition, she always uses the \"road or trail\" overland movement modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With a DC 15 Survival check, the Pathfinder chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class level.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Performance (Su):** At 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler gains this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard level.",
			"",
			"**Improved Aid (Ex):** Pathfinder chroniclers frequently serve as the companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler using the aid another action grants a +4 bonus, rather than the normal +2.",
			"",
			"**Epic Tales (Su):** A 4th-level Pathfinder chronicler can inscribe a tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of bardic music through the written word. To create an epic tale requires the pathfinder chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her bardic performance ability equal to twice the duration of the epic tale (maximum duration of 10 rounds), and any relevant Performance skill check is made with Profession (scribe) instead. An epic tale affects only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a performance. A Pathfinder chronicler may apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds expended during its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed.",
			"",
			"**Whispering Campaign (Ex):** Pathfinder chroniclers influence the world through their control of information and ability to shape public perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the Pathfinder chronicler can create the effect of a doom spell as cast by a sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a language-dependent effect.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of bardic music creates the effect of the enthrall spell, but at the end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction of the Pathfinder chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level.",
			"",
			"**Inspire Action (Su):** As a special use of bardic music, a 6th-level Pathfinder chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn.",
			"",
			"At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a standard action instead.",
			"",
			"**Call Down the Legends (Su):** At 7th level, once per week as a full-round action, a Pathfinder chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human barbarians, as if she used a bronze horn of Valhalla; these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive with the normal starting equipment for barbarians and attack anyone the chronicler designates.",
			"",
			"**Greater Epic Tales (Su):** At 8th level, the Pathfinder chronicler's written word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's Charisma score where applicable.",
			"",
			"**Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su):** Once per week as a full-round action, a 10th-level Pathfinder chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human barbarians, as if she used an iron horn of Valhalla. The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are constructs, with the incorporeal subtype (they take 50% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing +2 studded leather and wielding +1 ghost touch greataxes (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at Will saves or become shaken for 1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the Pathfinder chronicler's Charisma modifier)."

Some are most at home treading ground untouched in years or even centuries, in search of the next challenge, the next dungeon, or the next ancient treasure.

Often they're accompanied by a cohort or other companion who might not have the bravery (or foolhardiness) to go it alone on a grand adventure, but is more than willing to chronicle the exploits and adventures of another. For many in the Pathfinder Society, the delvers represent a frustrating combination-on the one hand, their eagerness to explore helps the Society reach areas and learn secrets that may otherwise go undiscovered.

			"",
			"**Thrilling Escape (Ex):** At 3rd level, a Pathfinder delver can attempt to delay a trap immediately after triggering it. To use this ability, he attempts a Disable Device check as an immediate action against the trap's Disable Device DC; if he's successful, the trap's activation is delayed until the end of his next turn. The Pathfinder delver can attempt this check even if the trap was triggered by a failed Disable Device check. The Pathfinder delver can do this once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 7th level, and three times per day at 9th level.",
			"",
			"**Guardbreaker (Ex):** At 3rd level, a Pathfinder delver's familiarity with the strange guardians often left in tombs allows him to attack them more effectively. He can treat his trap sense bonus as if it were a favored enemy bonus against constructs, oozes, and undead; this bonus stacks with any favored enemy bonuses gained from ranger levels or similar class features.",

			"**Left for Dead (Su):** At 5th-level, a Pathfinder delver can cheat death once per day. If he would be killed by a melee attack, ranged attack, or effect that requires a saving throw, he is instead reduced to -1 hit points and knocked unconscious, but is stable. He appears dead (though a character who succeeds at a DC 25 Heal check or who uses an ability such as deathwatch can tell he is not) for 1 minute, after which he regains 1 hp and becomes conscious (unless healed sooner).",
			"",
			"**Fortunate Soul (Su):** Once per day at 6th level, the Pathfinder delver can reroll any saving throw he has just attempted. He must choose to use this ability before the results are revealed and must take the second result even if it's worse. He can use this ability twice per day at 10th level.",

			"Pathfinder savants are specialists in the theory and practice of magic, illuminating mysteries of the eldritch fabric that permeates existence. The path of the savant brings expertise in the lore of glyphs and sigils, knowledge of exotic spells, and the power to unlock the full potential of magical devices. This skill also makes savants quite valuable to adventuring parties, both in their mastery over ancient traps that utilize old magic and in their skill at identifying and utilizing magic items found in the field. Of course, with their focus on the intellectual portions of adventuring, Pathfinder savants are often ill-equipped to handle the tougher, more excruciating parts of a typical dungeon delve; melee combat, wrenching open stuck doors, and enduring dangerous and unhealthy environments are not the savant's forte. As a result, they rarely undertake solo missions, instead allying with wellrounded groups of fellow adventurers in order to interact with history and strange archaic wonders without dealing with the grislier portions of exploration all on their own. To the Pathfinder savant, this is merely a logical extension of their preferred role in exploration, but that doesn't protect them from periodic sneers and veiled insults from more physically focused companions. Of course, most such associates are quick to beg forgiveness when, inevitably, the savant is needed to decipher the workings of a strange magical device or to call upon their significant magical power to solve problems that cannot be dealt with through brawn alone.",

			"**Esoteric Magic (Ex):** At each class level beyond 1st, the Pathfinder savant chooses a spell from any class's spell list and thereafter treats that spell as if it were on the spell list of the base spellcasting class for which he has the most levels; if this base spellcasting class could not normally cast that spell, it is treated as 1 level higher than it is on the original class's spell list. If he could cast the spell using his base spellcasting class, the spell's level does not increase. The spell is cast as if its type (arcane, divine, or psychic) were that of his base spellcasting class, and save DCs function as normal for spells of that class.

			"**Sigil Master (Su):** A 5th level, a Pathfinder savant receives a bonus equal to his class level on saving throws against writing-based magical traps, and if he succeeds at the save, he does not trigger the trap. Such a trap is not disabled, and if he leaves the trap's area and then reenters it, the trap can trigger again. A Pathfinder savant also receives this bonus on saving throws against the effects of such traps triggered by others.",

			"**Silence Master (Su):** A 6th-level Pathfinder savant can to activate spell-trigger, spell-completion, and command-word items silently, substituting a magical gesture for the necessary words.

			"**Dispelling Master (Su):** At 7th level, if the Pathfinder savant prepares and casts spells like a wizard, he can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into dispel magic or any 6th-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into greater dispel magic, as a good-aligned cleric converts prepared spells into cure spells.

Once per day as an immediate action, the Pathfinder savant can double the bonus granted by his sigil master ability when he attempts a saving throw against a symbol.

A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a saving throw against a symbol effect on a natural 1.",

			"**Spellcasting Master (Ex):** At 9th level, a Pathfinder savant can focus his mind three times per day as a swift action. Once he's focused in this way, any spells he casts for the remainder of that round do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Spells with a duration of concentration that he casts in this round persist for a number of rounds after the Pathfinder savant ceases concentrating equal to his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).",
			"",
			"**Item Master (Su):** At 10th level, a Pathfinder savant can spend an hour focusing his energies on a single noncharged magic item that requires an action to activate. At the end of this hour, that item becomes attuned to the Pathfinder savant, and from that point on, that specific item can use the Pathfinder savant's caster level to resolve its effects rather than the item's caster level. A Pathfinder savant can change which item is attuned to him by repeating the attunement ritual, but he loses attunement to the previous item. A Pathfinder savant can have only one item attuned to him at a time."
