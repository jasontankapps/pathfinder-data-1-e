			"On their twisted route to immortality, adherents of the Whispering Way learn secret rites that aid them on their path. Every step brings a member that much closer to the final secret. Particularly promising members earn invitations to join an elite group within the organization. In their role as agents of the grave, these members serve the desires of the current leadership, yet more often than not, agents of the grave act solely for one cell or faction.",
			"",
			"Agents of the grave learn the deepest arcane secrets of the Whispering Way in their quest for undeath, gaining undeadlike traits before their final elevation to a state beyond death. These vile powers, paired with the ability to veil their intentions and increased breadth of knowledge, make agents of the grave perfect members for the task of turning powerful wizards and clerics to the path of the Whispering Way, as well as collectors of the foul relics, components, corpses, and morbid secrets that lie scattered across Golarion.",
			"",
			"**Role:** Agents of the grave master the necromantic arts, yet instead of controlling hordes of undead minions, they instead seek ultimate enlightenment, and possess subtle and murderous skills to help them attain it. Agents of the grave infiltrate other organizations to glean their magical secrets and have an interest in turning talented members to their own blasphemous discipline.",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** Agents of the grave are devoted to gaining personal power through the transition into undeath and advancement within the Whispering Way's macabre hierarchy. Callous to the needs and agendas of others, these elite servants of death are unwaveringly evil in their pursuit of an ascended death.",
			"",

			"**Spells per Day/Spells Known:** When a new agent of the grave level is gained, the character gains new spells as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character has more than one spellcasting class before becoming an agent of the grave, he must decide which class he adds the new level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Necromancy (Ex):** When determining the maximum number of Hit Dice of undead he can control with spells like animate dead, a character counts his agent of the grave levels twice. This ability does not factor into how many undead he can create with a single casting of a spell. Thus, a cleric 7/agent of the grave 3 would be able to control 52 Hit Dice worth of undead with animate dead.",
			"",
			"**Lich's Touch (Su):** At 1st level, the agent of the grave becomes a conduit for negative energy and the chill powers of death, allowing him to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of damage from negative energy per level of the agent of the grave class he attains. This ability allows him to heal undead minions, and himself upon attaining the negative energy affinity ability at 4th level. He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma bonus.",
			"",
			"**Unholy Fortitude (Su):** At 1st level, the agent of the grave can tap into his conviction and bolster his health. Starting with the hit points he rolls for gaining his first agent of the grave level and every time he gains a level in any class thereafter, the character may choose to add either his Constitution bonus or his Charisma bonus to the number of new hit points he gains for that level.",
			"",
			"**Undead Manipulator (Ex):** At 2nd level, the agent of the grave gains great insight into the minds and necromantic forces controlling undead creatures. An agent of the grave's spells and spell-like abilities with mind-affecting effects treat undead creatures as their original type. Thus, an agent of the grave can use charm person against a humanoid zombie or confusion against a horde of skeletal champions.",
			"",
			"Negative Energy Conduit (Ex) At 3rd level, an agent of the grave bolsters undead around him. As a standard action, an agent of the grave manifests an aura identical to the desecrate spell, except this foul aura has a duration of 10 minutes per level. An agent of the grave can use this ability once per day. In addition, any undead the agent of the grave creates is treated as having been created within the area of a desecrate spell.",
			"",
			"**Death's Shroud (Su):** As an agent of the grave gains power within the organization, he often must infiltrate other groups to gain further knowledge. At 4th level, he learns how to cloak his true intentions, gaining the ability to use nondetection or undetectable alignment once per day. The caster level for this ability is equal to the agent of the grave's highest caster level.",
			"",
			"**Negative Energy Affinity (Ex):** At 4th level, the agent of the grave, while still technically alive, reacts to positive and negative energy as if he were undead-positive energy harms him, while negative energy heals him. If the agent of the grave is already undead, this ability grants no additional benefit.",
			"",
			"**Secrets of Death (Ex):** At 5th level, an agent of the grave draws upon secrets held by the Whispering Way to gain insights into necromancy. At the time he gains this ability, the character may add a number of necromancy spells that are not normally a part of his class's spell list to his spell list. The number of spells that the character may add is equal to his Intelligence modifier. For example, an agent of the grave with levels of wizard might choose to add spells like death watch, inflict critical wounds, and slay living to his spell list, while an agent of the grave with levels of cleric might choose to add spells such as enervation, magic jar, and vampiric touch. An agent of the grave may choose to add spells he cannot yet cast-this does not allow the agent of the grave to cast spells of a higher level than he normally could, but rather merely grants him access to those spells when he reaches the level required to cast them.",
			"",
			"**Undeath Initiate (Ex):** At 5th level, an agent of the grave has prepared his body and mind for the transition into undeath. He gains a +5 bonus on any ability check, skill check, or saving throw related to the process of transforming into an undead creature. This bonus can be used on any check related to becoming a creature like a lich (the process of which is largely left up to the GM's discretion). Additionally, if slain by an undead creature with the create spawn ability, the agent of death retains his Intelligence (regardless of the type of undead he is transformed into) and free will (he is never under the control of the creature that killed him). Unless otherwise noted by the undead creature's create spawn ability, the newly created undead agent of the grave loses all of his class levels. This makes transformation into a lich and vampire among the most appealing options for an agent of the grave seeking undeath."

			"The Aldori swordlords follow no singular path to dueling mastery-some of those who take up the blade only dabble in its use, while others explore swordplay with the dueling weapon in unconventional ways. But those who seek to most closely emulate the traditions created by Sirian Aldori usually do so by taking levels in the Aldori swordlord prestige class. When one hears of an Aldori swordlord traveling the back roads, confronting bandits and defeating braggarts by challenging them to single combat, that swordlord has very likely pursued this path.",
			"",
			"Due to this prestige class's emphasis on mastering numerous feats, Aldori swordlords often have levels in the fighter class; many of these are humans with above-average intelligence, which helps them swiftly fulfill the skill requirements, but this is far from the only route available. Rangers, rogues, slayers, and swashbucklers also seek to master this signature swordfighting art by gaining levels as an Aldori swordlord, even though, in most cases, they must wait longer to qualify for the class than fighters. Many of an Aldori swordlord's abilities rely or build on rules presented in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat, which includes rules for duels. This prestige class also works well in conjunction with the Aldori defender archetype presented on page 22, though neither the archetype nor the prestige class require the other.",

This bonus on damage rolls applies whether the swordlord is wielding an Aldori dueling sword one-handed or two-handed. An Aldori swordlord cannot use this ability if he is wielding a shield or using an off-hand weapon (including armor spikes, unarmed strikes, or natural weapons).",
			"",
			"**Quick Draw:** An Aldori swordlord gains Quick Draw as a bonus feat. If the character already has this feat, he instead gains Aldori Dueling Mastery (see page 24). If he already has both feats, he instead gains a combat feat of his choice as a bonus feat. The Aldori swordlord must meet all prerequisites of the selected combat feat.",
			"",
			"**Display Weapon Prowess (Ex):** At 2nd level, an Aldori swordlord adds a bonus equal to half his class level on Intimidate checks while using Dazzling Display with an Aldori dueling sword. He also gains an additional +1 bonus on these Intimidate checks for each of the following feats he has with the Aldori dueling sword: Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Weapon Focus, or Weapon Specialization. The bonuses stack with each other (the total bonus is considered a competence bonus).",

			"When involved in a duel, an Aldori swordlord's mastery of elaborate strikes and stances grants him a bonus equal to half his class level on performance combat checks (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 154). These tricks can also be of great help in countering an enemy during a duel, granting him a bonus equal to half his class level on rolls to attempt a dueling parry or to use dueling resolve (Ultimate Combat 152).",
			"",
			"**Defensive Parry (Ex):** At 3rd level, an Aldori swordlord gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC when making a full attack with an Aldori dueling sword. This AC bonus increases to +2 at 7th level. If an Aldori duelist is also a fighter with the Aldori defender fighter archetype (see page 22), levels in this class stack with his fighter levels when determining the AC bonus from this ability.",
			"",
			"**Adaptive Tactics (Ex):** At 4th level, an Aldori swordlord learns to adapt his fighting style to counter his enemy's strengths. An Aldori swordlord reduces the attack roll penalty for fighting defensively or using Combat Expertise by 1 at 4th level and by 2 at 8th level. In addition, after an Aldori swordlord uses his Aldori dueling sword to attack a creature he attacked during the previous round, as a swift action he can attempt a Sense Motive check (DC = 10 + the opponent's base attack bonus). If successful, the swordlord gains a +2 circumstance bonus either on attack rolls or to his AC against that creature until the beginning of his next turn.",
			"",
			"**Shatter Confidence (Ex):** At 5th level, an Aldori swordlord can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize his target as a swift action after he confirms a critical hit or succeeds at a disarm, reposition, or sunder combat maneuver with an Aldori dueling sword. If his target is already shaken, the swordlord can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize the target as a swift action after any successful melee attack or combat maneuver. If he succeeds at this check, any morale bonuses the target has are suppressed for a number of rounds equal to the Aldori swordlord's class level. Suppressed effects are not dispelled, and they resume after this time elapses if their duration has not expired. Suppressed morale bonuses include those gained from a barbarian's rage ability; however, this ability doesn't end rage, nor does it suppress other effects of rage or rage powers that do not provide morale bonuses (thus, it doesn't cause a barbarian to become fatigued unless the barbarian chooses to end the rage during the suppressed duration, in which case fatigue from rage affects the barbarian normally).",
			"",
			"**Saving Slash (Ex):** At 6th level, when wielding an Aldori dueling sword, an Aldori swordlord can use an immediate action to try deflecting a melee critical hit targeting him, reducing its damage to that of a normal hit, with a 25% chance of success. This does not stack with the fortification special ability of magical armor or similar effects.",
			"",
			"**Dexterous Duelist (Ex):** At 7th level, an Aldori swordlord with at least one free hand is not denied his Dexterity bonus when attempting Acrobatics or Climb checks, nor does he provoke attacks of opportunity when standing up from prone.",
			"",
			"**Greater Saving Slash:** At 9th level, an Aldori swordlord's saving slash has a 50% chance of reducing a melee critical hit to a normal hit. In addition, he can attempt a saving slash against ranged critical hits, including those from rays and other ranged touch effects, with a 25% chance of success.",

When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range.

The DC of this save is equal to 20 + the arcane archer's Charisma modifier. It takes 1 day to make a slaying arrow, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it.

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** An asavir is proficient with simple weapons, martial weapons, and all forms of armor and shields (except tower shields).",
			"",
			"**Camaraderie (Ex):** An asavir is skilled at forging those who battle by her side into a loyal and well-coordinated team and exhorting them to fight bravely. As long as the asavir can speak aloud, the bonus she grants to any allies within 30 feet when she takes the aid another action in combat increases by 1. At 5th level, the bonus instead increases by 2, and at 9th level, it instead increases by 3. These bonuses do not stack with other abilities that enhance the aid another action.",
			"",
			"**Equine Bond (Ex):** An asavir gains a horse as a loyal steed. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the asavir's level + 2 as her effective druid level (for example, at 3rd level, the asavir's mount functions as a 5th-level druid's animal companion). The companion must be a horse or pony, though the GM might approve other equine animals as suitable mounts (especially in the case of unusually large or small asavirs). If the asavir has a horse companion from another class that grants a similar ability (such as cavalier, druid, or ranger), her asavir levels stack with levels from one of these other classes (her choice) for the purposes of determining her mount's statistics and abilities-she does not gain a second companion for having this ability from a different class. Her total effective druid level for determining her mount's statistics can never exceed her total character level. An asavir doesn't take an armor check penalty on Ride checks while riding her mount, and her mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"**Shaitan's Blessing (Su):** When an asavir reaches 2nd level, her mount receives the blessing of the shaitans. It receives a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting and fear effects. When the asavir reaches 9th level, this bonus increases to +4.",
			"",
			"**Thunderous Charge (Su):** At 2nd level, a number of times per day equal to her asavir level, an asavir and her mount can make a charge that causes the ground to shake. This is a full-round action and works as a normal charge, except the asavir's mount can move only up to its move speed (not double its move speed, as in a normal charge). Creatures within a 5-foot radius of the charge's ending point must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the asavir's class level + the mount's Strength modifier) or fall prone. For every asavir level above 2nd the character has, she can exclude one creature from the effects of her thunderous charge (one creature at 3rd level, up to a maximum of eight creatures at 10th level). The asavir can resolve her attack at the end of her charge either before or after determining which creatures fall prone. At 6th level, the radius of thunderous charge increases to 10 feet, and at 10th level it increases to 20 feet.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Courage (Su):** At 3rd level, an asavir gains an aura of courage like that of a 3rd-level paladin.",
			"",
			"**Flank Breaker (Ex):** At 3rd level, if an asavir successfully damages a foe that is flanking an ally, she can attempt a special combat maneuver check against the target's CMD as a swift action. If she succeeds, that foe is unable to flank with any creature for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Controlled Charge (Ex):** At 4th level, an asavir learns to attack with greater accuracy from the back of a charging mount. She gains a +4 bonus on melee attacks on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2) and does not take a penalty to her AC after making a charge attack while mounted.",
			"",
			"**Djinni's Blessing (Su):** When an asavir reaches 4th level, her mount receives the blessing of the djinn, making it swift and tireless. The mount's speed increases by 10 feet, it doesn't take movement penalties from wearing barding, and it can carry a second rider without penalties. When the asavir reaches 8th level, her mount's speed increases by an additional 10 feet.",
			"",
			"**Marid's Blessing (Su):** At 6th level, an asavir's mount receives the blessing of the marids, making it an agile partner with a flowing pace. Anyone riding the mount does not need to attempt concentration checks normally required because of the mount's movement. The mount gains a +2 racial bonus on Reflex saves.",
			"",
			"**Trampling Gallop (Ex):** At 6th level, an asavir's mount gains the trample universal monster ability, but only when commanded by the asavir as a full-round action. Damage dealt by the trample is equal to that of the horse's hoof attack plus 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier.",
			"",
			"**All Eyes on Me (Su):** At 7th level, three times per day as a swift action, an asavir can call out a challenge. Each opponent within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + the asavir's character level + the asavir's Charisma bonus) or be distracted by the display until the beginning of the asavir's next turn. Any creature that fails is considered to be flat-footed and takes a -2 penalty to AC against attacks from the asavir's allies. This is a mind-affecting, visual effect.",
			"",
			"**Efreeti's Blessing (Su):** When an asavir reaches 8th level, her mount receives the blessing of the efreet, gaining fire resistance 5. It also deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with its hoof attacks.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Leader (Su):** At 9th level, an asavir can call out encouragement to her allies as a move action, bolstering their courage. Allies within 60 feet of the asavir who can hear her receive a morale bonus equal to the asavir's Charisma bonus on attack and damage rolls with weapons for 1 round. An asavir can use this ability three times per day. This is a mind-affecting, language-dependent effect.",
			"",
			"**Janni's Blessing (Su):** At 10th level, when an asavir rolls a d20 to resolve an attack, saving throw, or skill check, she can roll twice and choose the better result. The asavir can use this ability once per day for herself and once per day for her mount. Both the asavir and her mount gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws."

He can also use rounds of bardic performance gained from bard levels to perform Ashavic performances, and vice versa. Starting an Ashavic performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. If the Ashavic dancer has bardic performance, he can also start bardic performances as a move action instead of a standard action even if he does not have sufficient bard levels to do so. The performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the dancer is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. The performance counts as a bardic performance for the purpose of determining how many performances the dancer can have in effect at one time. The performance has visual components but not audible components. At 7th level, an Ashavic dancer can start an Ashavic performance or a bardic performance as a swift action. The save DC against an Ashavic dancer's performance is equal to 10 + the Ashavic dancer's class level + his Charisma modifier. The performance abilities that an Ashavic dancer gains are noted below.  ",
			"**Deathwaking Dance (Su):** At 1st level, an Ashavic dancer can unravel undead and haunts.

A successful Will save negates this damage.",
			"",
			"**Untethering Steps (Su):** At 3rd level, an Ashavic dancer can use his performance to hinder one or more undead creatures within 30 feet to which the dancer has line of sight. For every 2 class levels the Ashavic dancer has attained beyond 3rd, he can target one additional creature. Each round he maintains the performance, the Ashavic dancer attempts a Perform (dance) skill check and compares the result to all of the targets' CMD scores. Any target whose CMD is equaled or exceeded by the result of the Perform (dance) check becomes sickened by the dancer's movements for 1 round. Any target with a CMD that is exceeded by 10 or more also becomes staggered for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Soothing Performance (Su):** At 6th level, an Ashavic dancer gains the soothing performance bardic performance.",
			"",
			"**Exorcist's Waltz (Su):** At 7th level, an Ashavic dancer can use his Ashavic performance to attempt to end an ongoing compulsion or possession effect. Using this ability requires 4 rounds of consecutive performance, and the target must be able to see the dancer perform and be within 30 feet. If the target is possessed, the target gains a new saving throw to end the possession effect; otherwise, this functions as break enchantment, using the Ashavic dancer's caster level for the effect. Any possessing entity cast out in this manner cannot attempt to possess that target again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**True Spark's Guidance (Su):** At 10th level, an Ashavic dancer can lure the dead back into their graves. He can target one undead creature within 60 feet each round he maintains this performance-the targeted undead can resist the effects with a successful Will save. If the creature first became undead within the affected area, or if an open grave under the effects of hallow or consecrate is in the area, the undead takes a -4 penalty on this saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the target's speed is halved for 1 round (this includes all forms of movement such as fly or swim). If the undead fails its save, it immediately takes 10 points of damage per class level of the Ashavic dancer and is staggered for 1 round, and it takes a -4 penalty on future saving throws against this performance for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Ashavic Rites (Su):** At 2nd level, an Ashavic dancer's mind-affecting Ashavic performances overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects, even if the undead is mindless. While maintaining any Ashavic or bardic performance, he can spend 1 additional round of the performance when he casts a mind-affecting spell to allow that spell to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects as well.",
			"",
			"**Peerless Dancer (Ex):** At 2nd level, an Ashavic dancer gains versatile performance, as per the bard class feature. He must choose Perform (dance) as his Perform skill with this ability. If he had versatile performance in Perform (dance) before adding his first level in this prestige class, he gains Skill Focus (Perform [dance]) as a bonus feat instead.",
			"",
			"At 6th level, an Ashavic dancer chooses one of the following skills and adds it to the list of skills that are associated with Perform (dance) for the purpose of versatile performance: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive. He chooses a second skill at 8th level and a third skill at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Ghostly Grace (Su):** At 4th level, during an Ashavic dancer's Ashavic performance, all weapon attacks he makes are treated as if they had the ghost touch weapon special ability, and his spells have their full effect against incorporeal creatures, as per the Ectoplasmic Spell feat. At 9th level, allies within 30 feet also receive these benefits during his Ashavic performance."

			"**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 2nd level, an assassin cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. An assassin with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.",
			"",
			"If an assassin already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Weapons (Ex):** At 4th level, an assassin becomes a master at hiding weapons on his body. He adds his assassin level to all Sleight of Hand skill checks made to prevent others from noticing them.",
			"",
			"**True Death (Su):** Starting at 4th level, anyone slain by an assassin's death attack becomes more difficult to bring back from the dead. Spellcasters attempting to bring a creature back from the dead using raise dead or similar magic must make a caster level check with a DC equal to 15 + the assassin's level or the spell fails and the material component is wasted. Casting remove curse the round before attempting to bring the creature back from the dead negates this chance. The DC of the remove curse is 10 + the assassin's level.",
			"",
			"**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 5th level and higher, an assassin can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the assassin by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has assassin levels.",
			"",
			"If a character already has uncanny dodge from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.",
			"",
			"**Quiet Death (Ex):** At 6th level, whenever an assassin kills a creature using his death attack during a surprise round, he can also make a Stealth check, opposed by Perception checks of those in the vicinity to prevent them from identifying him as the assailant. If successful, those nearby might not even notice that the target is dead for a few moments, allowing the assassin to avoid detection.",
			"",
			"**Hide in Plain Sight (Su):** At 8th level, an assassin can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, an assassin can hide himself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind. He cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.",
			"",
			"**Swift Death (Ex):** At 9th level, once per day, an assassin can make a death attack against a foe without studying the foe beforehand. He must still sneak attack his foe using a melee weapon that deals damage.",
			"",
			"**Angel of Death (Su):** At 10th level, the assassin becomes a master of death. Once per day, when the assassin makes a successful death attack, he can cause the target's body to crumble to dust. This prevents raise dead and resurrection (although true resurrection works as normal). The assassin must declare the use of this ability before the attack is made. If the attack misses or the target successfully saves against the death attack, this ability is wasted with no effect."

In addition to utilizing their powers of mercantilism, balanced scales seek out lost, unclaimed, or wrongly seized wealth among the many tombs and ruins of the Katapesh desert. Balanced scales of Abadar develop unique powers that afford them the ability to enter dangerous areas where lost treasure can be restored to the light or hidden goods can be returned to their rightful owners. A balanced scale finds the most satisfaction in discovering long-lost treasures hidden in unmarked strongholds, owned by now nameless individuals of the past. A balanced scale can claim such wealth for her own and use it to further the strength of her church.",

She adds the level of balanced scale of Abadar to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has for the purposes of determining her caster level.",
			"",
			"**Bypass Ward (Ex):** Ancient ruins often contain locked and sometimes warded doors; as such, a balanced scale can pick the lock of even a magically locked door (such as one sealed by arcane lock or hold portal). The Open Lock DC for the door is considered 10 higher than normal due to the effect of the warding spell. A balanced scale also gains a +2 sacred bonus to Open Lock checks. As a full-round action, a balanced scale can make an Open Lock check to disable a magical trap (such as a glyph of warding) for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Appraising Eye (Ex):** A balanced scale must estimate value quickly and accurately, particularly when in a dangerous environment such as an underground tomb. She gains a +2 sacred bonus to all Appraise checks, and can appraise an item with 1 full-round action, instead of 1 minute, if she takes a -10 penalty.",
			"",
			"**Bottomless Bag (Su):** Sometimes a balanced scale finds an unexpected treasure too large to transport. Once per day she can turn any ordinary sack, backpack, or other container into a bag of holding type II. The container remains a bag of holding for 1 hour per class level; after the duration expires, the container resumes its normal properties, and any items too large to fit within its true dimensions immediately and harmlessly fall out of the opening. Unlike a permanent bag of holding, the bag created by this ability cannot be overloaded or ruptured, nor does it have any special interaction with other kinds of extradimensional spaces.",
			"",
			"At 6th level, the balanced scale's bottomless bag increases to the size of a bag of holding type III. Alternately, she can create two bags of holding type II, though their extradimensional spaces are not linked in any way.",
			"",
			"**Eloquent Bargainer (Ex):** Getting permission to enter treasure-laden ruins sometimes requires talking to the right people and handing around a few coins for bribes, \"finder's fees,\" and so on. At 4th level, a balanced scale learns which palms to grease and what promises to make, gaining a +2 bonus to Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when she offers an appropriate bribe (minimum 10 gp &times; the level of the recipient) during the interaction. In addition, she receives a +2 sacred bonus on Charisma checks made to compel a bound creature to perform a service when using the lesser planar binding and greater planar binding spells.",
			"",
			"**Access the Vault (Su):** At 3rd level, a balanced scale gains the power to access the First Vault, Abadar's planar repository for perfect versions of every item ever made. Once per week a balanced scale can summon a copy of any one nonmagical item (normal or masterwork) as long as its market price is equal to or less than 500 gp per divine caster level and its volume is less than 1 cubic foot per caster level. The item remains with the balanced scale for 1 minute per class level, after which it returns automatically to the First Vault. Consumable items vanish once used but function for their normal duration or 1 minute per class level, whichever is less. Even if an item is destroyed while in the balanced scale's possession, a new copy appears in the First Vault. At 5th level, a balanced scale can use this ability to summon a magic item from the First Vault. Items with charges always arrive fully charged, and the price limit applies to this fully charged version (for example, a fully charged wand of cure serious wounds costs 11,250 gp, putting it out of reach of anyone caster level 22 or lower).",
			"",
			"Items taken from the First Vault are obviously of exceptional quality and radiate magic (even if not normally a magic item, such as a chair or table), and their unearthly perfection is enough to make any intelligent potential buyer suspicious. The church of Abadar frowns on selling items from the First Vault, as it is essentially stealing from the buyer (as the items vanish shortly thereafter), which disrupts faith in fair trade and the church; balanced scales who abuse this ability lose access to the First Vault until they have atoned for their transgression.",
			"",
			"Because there is only one perfect copy of each item in the First Vault, there is a remote chance (approximately 1%) that the item the character wants is unavailable because another person has borrowed it. If this happens, it does not expend the balanced scale's ability, and she may try again next round to summon that or another item.",
			"",
			"Some religious scholars theorize that this power does not actually draw items from the First Vault, as Abadar would not lend out his true perfect copies, and that the items are actually copies of the perfect items, perhaps placed in another divine vault created for this purpose or as a backup.",
			"",
			"**Vault Jump (Sp):** Those who drive hard bargains and search for lost treasures sometimes bite off more than they can chew, and a quick exit is often the only way to escape a bad situation alive. Once per day, a balanced scale can create a one-way portal through the First Vault, which has one of two effects. First, she may use the portal as if it were a dimension door, but can only travel to areas within range and to which she has been (for example, she cannot use it to get past a sealed door into the unknown room beyond). Second, she may use the portal as if she were casting word of recall, but instead of returning to her sanctuary she always returns to the closest active temple of Abadar. The balanced scale's caster level for this ability is equal to her divine caster level, and she can bring others with her as defined in the spell descriptions.",
			"",
			"Travel through the First Vault is uncomfortable and disorienting, possibly because the Vault rejects imperfect mortal flesh in an attempt to protect itself, or because the aura of so much perfection is overwhelming to mortal senses. Regardless of the distance traveled, the balanced scale (and anyone traveling with her) arrives 1d4+1 rounds later and is nauseated for 1d4+1 rounds after arriving (Fortitude DC 15 negates).",
			"",
			"As with the balanced scale's ability to access the First Vault, some scholars believe this ability transports the user through a space other than the First Vault. Their reasoning is that, if a balanced scale were mind-controlled or otherwise compromised, this ability might allow thieves to access the First Vault and steal the priceless, perfect items stored there."

Charged with freeing slaves from the infernal nation's many plantations and escorting them to the safety of Andoran and Rahadoum, Bellflower tillers are a constant thorn in the side of House Thrune and its diabolical minions. These elite liberators practice their craft all across Cheliax, from the darkened streets of Egorian and Westcrown to the wilds of the Whisperwood. Bellflower tillers employ farming euphemisms to mask their activities from unfriendly ears' referring to their secret hideouts as \"barns,\" the slaves they escort as their \"crops,\" and the secret paths they take as \"rows.\" Excessive contact between Bellflower tillers is discouraged by the Bellflower Network's leadership, lest they risk exposing the organization to the authorities. Despite this, they often meet in secret to discuss which routes are safest to take, how much to bribe certain officials, and what tactics for organizing groups of slaves work best, and so improve chances of evading capture.",

Vigilantes are also a natural fit as Bellflower tillers. Non-halflings are usually admitted only after proving their allegiance to the anti-slavery movement and their goodwill toward halflings, but once they join the cause, they are incredibly valuable to the organization for the simple fact that their race does not immediately raise suspicion in areas where the Bellflower Network is active.",

Many pose as traveling merchants or tinkerers-occupations that give them the freedom to get where they need to, when they need to-and have alibis for their presence on the road if confronted by Chelish patrols.

Even more significant than any cosmetic changes, the stresses on a bloatmage's body can prove dangerous to both them and those around them, for if the cephalic pressure on a bloatmage's brain becomes too great, she flies into a murderous rage before falling unconscious and quickly bleeding out. Such obvious drawbacks keep most from walking the path of the bloated ascetics, but the bloatmages dismiss those detractors who lack the courage to follow in their footsteps, noting that in the pursuit of power and self-perfection, all other concerns are secondary.",

She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a bloatmage, she must decide which class she adds the new level to for the purpose of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Blood Pool:** At 1st level, a bloatmage gains a pool of blood points, representing an overload of her system with excess blood to extend her arcane abilities beyond their normal level. A bloatmage's normal pool of blood points is equal to her bloatmage level. Blood points can be spent at the time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell's spell slot. The spell slot remains unused (for spontaneous casters), or the spell is recalled as if it had not been cast (for spellcasters who prepare spells). Retaining a spell or spell slot in this manner costs a number of blood points equal to the spell's level, and these points must be spent at the time of casting. Blood points do not give spellcasters access to spells they don't already know or have prepared.",
			"",
			"In addition, the bloatmage may push herself via her bloat ability in order to gain a number of extra blood points, but such exertion is a dangerous gamble. If the bloatmage's current number of blood points is greater than her class level but less than or equal to twice her class level, she gains the sickened condition. If her exertions push her beyond twice her normal blood point level, she immediately flies into a homicidal rage, striking out randomly with her most damaging attacks and abilities at friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until her blood pool is reduced to 0 (whichever comes first). At the end of the rage, her blood points drop to 0, her hit points drop to -1, and she begins dying.",
			"",
			"Each day, when the bloatmage rests to regain spells, she regains blood points up to her class level but not beyond (so if her bloatmage level is 5 but she currently has 8 points, she remains at 8 until she spends the extra points).",
			"",
			"Some bloatmages conduct constant rituals involving leeches or exsanguination in an attempt to regulate their systems. These rituals, which must be undertaken daily during spell preparation, give the bloatmage the option of subtracting 1 point from any bloating rolls (see below) after the results are known, but at the price of a non-cumulative -2 penalty to Constitution. This penalty cannot be removed, save by the bloatmage abandoning the rituals for a day (also during spell preparation), which removes it immediately.",
			"",
			"**Bloat:** A bloatmage can exert herself as a free action to instantly gain extra blood points, but doing so puts her at risk of a dangerous collapse. At 1st level, the bloatmage can bloat once per day to gain 1d4 points. At 4th, she can bloat twice per day, and the die roll becomes 1d8. At 8th, she can bloat three times per day, and the roll becomes 1d12.",
			"",
			"**Hemophilia:** Bloatmages are particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of any Heal check made to stop a bleed effect is 5 higher than normal. In addition, anytime a bleeding wound is inflicted on a bloatmage, she loses 1 blood point. This loss of blood points is cumulative for multiple bleed attacks, but not each time she takes damage from the same attack.",
			"",
			"**Corpulence:** At 3rd level, a bloatmage becomes so massive that her rolls of fatty, blood-laden flesh grant her a +1 natural armor bonus. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +2 but reduces her speed by 10 feet. This penalty stacks with the penalty from the Bloatmage Initiate feat. This reduction in speed can never reduce the bloatmage's speed below 5 feet, nor does it affect magical flying effects.",
			"",
			"**Absorb Bloodline:** At 10th level, a bloatmage can temporarily access all of the bloodline powers of a given sorcerer bloodline as if she were a sorcerer of a level equaling her total arcane spellcaster level (including bloatmage levels) by consuming blood tied to that bloodline. By drinking 1 pint of fresh blood (which inflicts 1 point of Constitution damage) from a sorcerer with the given bloodline or from a creature affiliated with that bloodline, the bloatmage gains the ability to use the bloodline powers (but not bonus spells, proficiencies, and so on) as appropriate to her level for 1 hour. This ability is usable once per day and drinking the blood normally requires a full minute, but bloatmages with the Brew Potion feat can distill the blood into a potion-sized draught that can be stored and consumed as a standard action.",
			"",
			"Any bloodlines absorbed are in addition to the original bloodline of a bloatmage with sorcerer levels. Though the bloatmage gains no physical nourishment from drinking blood, this practice is likely responsible for many of the stories linking bloatmages and vampires.",

			"",
			"**Discover Omen (Su):** All Brightness Seekers know how to interpret the omens the natural world presents to them in order to discover lucky or unlucky actions for themselves and others. Once per day per class level, a Brightness Seeker may attempt to forecast the future of herself or a creature within 30 ft.",
			"",
			"Searching for an omen takes 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation; the Brightness Seeker rolls 1d20 and adds her class level and Charisma modifier to determine the omen check result. She may add a +3 to her roll if she knows the target's birthday and birth month, the target's true name or birth name, or his city of birth (or similarly specific geographic area); these bonuses stack if she knows more than one of these things. If the check result is 20 or higher, she learns an omen regarding that creature's next 24 hours. She may perform multiple forecasts for the same creature if the initial check fails to reveal an omen, but once she achieves a result, she cannot forecast for that creature again until a day has passed.",
			"",
			"A creature who knows his omen may utilize a onetime insight bonus equal to the Brightness Seeker's class level. This bonus may be used on any single attack roll, ability check, skill check, or saving throw made by the creature. Alternatively, he can apply the insight bonus to his AC against a single attack targeting them (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; the character can even activate the bonus on another creature's turn if needed. The character must choose to use this bonus before making the roll it is to modify. Once used, the effect of the omen ends.",
			"",
			"**Favored Pilgrim (Ex):** Most elves revere Brightness Seekers, and will often do whatever they can to help them complete their personal journeys through their current incarnations. Elves who believe in the Brightness who normally would have an initial attitude of hostile, unfriendly, or indifferent toward the character instead start as one step closer to friendly when dealing with the character.",
			"",
			"**Channel Past Incarnation (Su):** At 2nd level, Brightness Seekers establish a mystical connection with their previous lives spent as simple creatures of the forest or field. Once per day, a Brightness Seeker may spend 1 hour meditating to manifest one of the special qualities detailed below. This special quality remains for 1 day or until the Brightness Seeker changes form or dismisses it.",

			"- Thick hide (+3 natural armor bonus to AC)",
			"- Waterborn (swim speed 40 ft., can breathe water and air)",
			"- Wings (average maneuverability, fly speed 40 ft.)",
			"",
			"**Tranquility (Ex):** At 2nd level, Brightness Seekers awaken memories of their past incarnations and realize that even death is merely a threshold to another existence rather than something to be feared. They gain a +10 resistance bonus on saves against fear effects.",
			"",
			"**Common Ground (Ex):** At 3rd level, Brightness Seekers discover ways to make natural creatures accept them as kindred spirits. They gain the wild empathy ability; to use this ability they roll 1d20 and add their class level and Charisma bonus. This ability stacks with class levels from classes that also provide wild empathy.",
			"",
			"**Wild Shape (Su):** At 3rd level, Brightness Seekers develop an even stronger capacity to call upon the forms of their prior animal incarnations, which manifests as the ability to wild shape as a druid once per day. At 5th level, this increases to twice per day. If a Brightness Seeker has the ability to wild shape from another class, the uses per day stack. Class levels in Brightness Seeker stack with druid levels and other class levels that grant wild shape for the purpose of determining what size and type of creature the character can change into.",
			"",
			"**One With Nature (Sp):** At 4th level, a Brightness Seeker forms a personal relationship with the living world. Brightness Seekers may cast commune with nature as a spell-like ability usable at will (though it still requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to activate, just like the spell).",
			"",
			"**Tranquility Aura (Ex):** At 4th level, all friendly creatures within a 10-foot radius of a Brightness Seeker gain a +10 resistance bonus on saves against fear effects.",
			"",
			"**Rebirth (Su):** At 5th level, Brightness Seekers gain the ability to return from the grave if they die through violence or any other sort of unnatural end. A slain Brightness Seeker may activate this ability any time between 10 minutes and 1 week after death occurs, at which point their soul reincarnates in the form of a healthy adult animal the same size as the previous body and of a type common to where the previous body died. The character's ability scores do not change, but she gains all abilities associated with her new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like. The character gains a negative level, which cannot be removed by any means, but goes away automatically when the character achieves a new experience level or dies. This ability doesn't work if the character was killed by a death effect or she was turned into an undead creature.",
			"",
			"Each time a Brightness Seeker in animal form gains a new experience level, she may attempt a DC 20 Will save; success means she regains her previous race and appearance. If a Brightness Seeker is killed in animal form, she cannot use this ability to reincarnate again, though normal methods of reviving the dead still work. A miracle or wish can restore a living or dead animal Brightness Seeker's original form (and bring her back to life, if dead)."

For centuries, this portal has been safeguarded by an order of monks known as the Brothers of the Seal, ensuring that none disturbed the mighty vault and unleashed what powers lay locked within. With the passage of time, however, the truth of what the seal hid was lost even to its guardians. As secret-keepers disappeared and records were lost, the Brothers of the Seal maintained their vigil but began to wonder what they guarded, and for whom, and realized that no one truly knew the answers anymore.",

			"**Awesome Blow (Ex):** At 4th level, a Brother of the Seal gains Awesome Blow (Bestiary 314) as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites, adding his Wisdom modifier on awesome blow combat maneuver checks and dealing damage to his target equal to that dealt by his unarmed strike.

			"**Unsealing (Su):** At 5th level, a Brother of the Seal can attempt to breach magical wards or protections, including abjurations, glyphs, runes, symbols, and other magical writings. He must touch the warded object, creature, or area-which can be done as part of an unarmed strike for normal damage or as a melee touch attack that deals no damage-and expend one use of Stunning Fist to dispel the effect (as dispel magic, caster level equal to his character level). If the unsealing is successful, the effect is destroyed and the Brother of the Seal suffers no harm from it, even if it normally harms those who touch it. If the unsealing fails, the Brother of the Seal suffers any normal effects for touching the warded area, object, or creature, and it remains intact unless it would normally be destroyed upon being interacted with.",

If successful, the Brother deals his unarmed strike damage to this second target (rather than the normal damage for striking an obstacle) and knocks that target back 10 feet. The Brother of the Seal can make additional awesome blow combat maneuvers each time a target strikes a creature behind it, with a cumulative -2 penalty for each additional target. All targets must be in a straight line. If a target is knocked simultaneously into several smaller creatures, the Brother can choose only one of them to affect with cascading strike.",

In some regions, it is a faith that seeks little more than the succor and relief of suffering wherever it can be found, a warming and cleansing flame that banishes chill, darkness, and despair. Elsewhere, Sarenrae's faith is a flame that not only cleanses but scourges the wicked, seeing injustice and cruelty as a wound that must be cauterized. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a faith built upon such incandescent passion and verve, the servants of Sarenrae don't always agree on the best methods to carry out their goddess's will, and their disagreements become heated, often to the point of violent conflict.",

Doing so requires a Bluff check opposed by the attacker's Sense Motive check. The attacker gains a bonus equal to its base attack bonus on this Sense Motive check.

At the beginning of his next turn, his spirit returns in the form of a phoenix (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 227) that fights as he directs for up to 1 minute and then disappears. This phoenix is not considered called or summoned. The Dawnflower dissident is reborn (as resurrection) 1d4 rounds after it disappears in a random location within 1 mile, with his gear intact but with two permanent negative levels. If the phoenix is killed before it disappears, the Dawnflower dissident cannot be reborn via this ability, though other methods of raising him still work."

Even the gods themselves must face death, as evidenced by the death of the god Aroden a century ago. Creatures that attempt to avoid death through any means mock the order all living things must submit to, and as such mock the sacred act of assassination. Undead are particularly upsetting to some members of the Red Mantis, and death slayers are trained as specialized agents for missions where the target of an assassination is undead, or when an assassinated target returns from death as one of the undead.",

They focus instead on eliminating specific targets they've been hired to destroy, and they take special satisfaction in destroying those who were assassinated in life by one of their colleagues. A death slayer may even take a contract from one undead client to destroy another, such as two vampires squabbling over territory that holds increasingly sparse human chattel. Death slayers also have a situational exception regarding the prohibition on targeting monarchs. Should a rightful monarch become an undead creature of any sort- whether intentionally (to extend his reign), via a curse, or by other means-this negates the monarch's previous divine mandate, and the death slayer is not restrained by the Red Mantis's taboo against killing rightful monarchs for this particular target. Of course, a monarch who becomes undead does not earn the enmity of the Red Mantis simply through the act of becoming undead: an outside agent must still hire the Red Mantis to take out the monarch.",

The death slayer must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.",

			"**Favored Enemy (Ex):** At 2nd level, a death slayer gains undead as a favored enemy. This ability functions as the ranger class feature of the same name and stacks with similar bonuses from other classes. (This doesn't increase existing favored enemy bonuses against any other creature types.) At 6th level, the death slayer's favored enemy bonus against undead increases to +4.",
			"",
			"**Swift Smite (Su):** At 3rd level, a death slayer can use her Channel Smite feat an additional number of times per day equal to her death slayer level without expending a use of her total channel energy uses per day. She cannot use these additional uses of Channel Smite to use channel energy in the regular way.

This creates a dim crimson glow around the death slayer. Each undead creature within the aura at the start of its turn takes 4d6 points of positive energy damage. While this aura is active, the death slayer has fast healing 10. A death slayer can activate this aura for up to 10 rounds per day.

			"**Demonic Mark (Ex):** A demoniac bears the sign of her demon lord as a tattoo-like brand somewhere on her body. Once per day, a demoniac can call upon the profane magic of this mark to power a spell as she casts it. Doing so causes the spell to gain the chaotic and evil descriptors, and it causes the spell not be expended as it is cast, allowing the demoniac to cast the spell again at a later point in the day.",

			"**Obedience (Ex):** In order to maintain her demoniac abilities (including all spellcasting abilities that have been augmented by the class), a demoniac must indulge her chosen demon lord with a daily obedience. This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the demoniac uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demon lord, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of demoniac, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her demonic patron.

A demoniac can prevent or end the confusion side effect by using one of these spells, but being affected by such a spell before the energumen has run its course also causes the benefits granted to end prematurely.",
			"",
			"**Demonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su):** As a demoniac gains levels, she gains boons from her demonic patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with demonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the demoniac's chosen demon lord and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each demon lord grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the demoniac gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the demon lord and nascent demon lord descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a demonic boon grants a spell-like ability, the demoniac's caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a demoniac to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.",

			"**Summon Demon (Sp):** Once per day at 4th level, a demoniac can cast summon monster VI to conjure one succubus, 1d3 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraksB6 to serve her. At 8th level, the demoniac also gains the ability to cast summon monster VIII once per day to conjure one hezrou, 1d3 vrocks, or 1d4+1 succubi to serve her.",
			"",
			"**Demonic Form (Su):** At 10th level, a demoniac can undergo a temporary transformation into a unique demon as a standard action. Her type changes to outsider with the chaotic, demon, evil, and native subtypes. She gains damage reduction 10/good and cold iron, resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and telepathy to a range of 100 feet. When she first gains this ability, she chooses to gain one additional physical transformation from the following when she transforms: wings (fly speed of 40 feet with good maneuverability), gills (ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet), or a single natural attack (bite, claw, gore, slam, or tail sting; damage dealt as appropriate for the demoniac's size). Once this additional physical transformation is chosen, it can never be changed. The newly created demon's natural weapons and any weapon it wields are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The demoniac can remain in this form for a number of minutes per day equal to her character level; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Returning to her normal form is a free action."

			"",
			"**Artful Defense (Ex):** When wearing light or no armor and not using a shield, a devoted muse adds 1 point of her Charisma bonus (if any) per class level as a dodge bonus to her Armor Class. If she is caught flat-footed or otherwise denied her Dexterity bonus, she also loses this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Deeds (Ex):** This ability functions exactly as the swashbuckler ability of the same name with two exceptions. First, the devoted muse qualifies for and benefits from deeds as if she were a swashbuckler 3 levels lower than her class level (minimum 1). Second, the devoted muse doesn't gain the opportune parry and riposte deed until 4th level. For the purpose of this ability, a devoted muse's class levels otherwise stack with levels in any other class that grants the deeds ability.",
			"",
			"**Panache (Ex):** This ability functions exactly as the swashbuckler ability of the same name. For the purpose of this ability, a devoted muse's class levels stack with levels in any other class that grants the panache ability.",
			"",
			"**Artistic Flourish (Su):** At 2nd level, when a devoted muse has at least 1 panache point and successfully feints against an opponent in combat, instead of denying the opponent its Dexterity bonus, she can instead create one of the following effects (all of which are mind-affecting effects). A creature can be affected by only one such effect at a time, and imposing a second effect immediately ends the first. The DC of any saving throws to resist these effects is equal to 10 + the devoted muse's class level + her Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"**Distracted:** The target treats all other creatures as though they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls (even if the creature has blindsight). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the devoted muse's Charisma modifier, though a successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Confused:** At 5th level, the devoted muse can cause the target to be confused for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic flourish again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Staggered:** At 5th level, the devoted muse can cause the target to be staggered for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic flourish again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Dazed:** At 8th level, the devoted muse can spend 1 panache point to cause the target to be dazed for 1 round (Will negates). Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this artistic flourish again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Harmonious Strike (Su):** At 2nd level, when a devoted muse hits a creature affected by her artistic flourish ability, she can spend 1 panache point to perform an especially elegant attack. She selects one of the effects below to modify this harmonious strike.",
			"",
			"**Circling Strike:** After the attack, the devoted muse can move 5 feet as a free action as long as she ends her movement within the target's reach (or former reach, if the attack incapacitated it). This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and does not count as a 5-foot step. If she attacked with a weapon whose critical multiplier is &times;3 or higher, she can instead move 10 feet in this way. Deadly Strike: The attack deals an additional 1d4 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 1d4 every 2 devoted muse levels after 2nd level (maximum 5d4). This is precision damage and isn't multiplied on a critical hit. If her weapon's critical multiplier is &times;3, the size of these bonus damage dice increases by one step to 1d6. If her weapon's critical hit multiplier is &times;4, the die size increases to 1d8.",
			"",
			"**Inspirational Strike:** At 6th level, the devoted muse can inspire her comrades with her attack, granting her allies (including herself ) within 30 feet a competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls until the end of her next turn. This bonus is equal to her weapon's critical modifier (i.e., +2 for &times;2, +3 for &times;3, etc.). If her attack was a critical hit, these benefits last a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"**Masterful Strike:** At 10th level, the devoted muse can feint against one creature within her reach as a free action after resolving the attack. If she performs an artistic flourish with this feint against a distracted target, the target's miss chance against the devoted muse increases by an amount equal to 5 &times; her weapon's critical multiplier.",
			"",
			"**Feinting Feat:** At 3rd level and every 3 class levels thereafter, a devoted muse gains one of the following as a bonus feat: Disengaging Feint, Disengaging Flourish, Feint Partner, Greater Feint, Improved Feint Partner, Passing Trick, Skill Focus (Bluff ), Twinned FeintACG, or Wave Strike. The devoted muse must meet the prerequisites for the feat selected.",
			"",
			"**Limitless Art (Ex):** At 4th level, a devoted muse starts each day with 1 additional panache point, and her maximum number of panache points increases by 1. At 7th level and again at 10th level, the number of additional panache points increases by 1."

She can do this as a free action a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Spells altered to use hellfire gain the lawful and evil descriptors.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Bargain (Ex):** At 2nd level, a diabolist making use of planar ally (or a similar spell) can attempt an opposed Charisma check against a called (but not summoned) devil. If she succeeds, the devil reduces the price it demands to serve her by half.",
			"",
			"**Augment Summoning (Ex):** At 3rd level, a diabolist gains the Augment Summoning feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.",

			"**Diabolic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su):** As a diabolist gains levels, she gains boons from her infernal patron. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the diabolist's chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each diabolic patron grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the diabolist gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the archdevil, infernal duke, and malebranche descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a diabolic boon grants a spell-like ability, the diabolist's caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a diabolist to access these boons earlier than normal; it doesn't grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.",

If killed by any means outside of the will of Asmodeus, the archdevils, or another influential force in Hell, the diabolist can be resurrected as normal.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Transport (Sp):** At 6th level, a diabolist can transport herself through Hell in a burst of flames. She can use this ability twice per day as per dimension door, or she can expend both uses to travel as per teleport. She cannot use this ability to enter or leave areas warded against evil creatures.",

If the dragon disciple does not have levels of sorcerer, he instead gains bloodline powers of the draconic bloodline, using his dragon disciple level as his sorcerer level to determine the bonuses gained. He must choose a dragon type upon gaining his first level in this class and that type must be the same as his sorcerer type. This ability does not grant bonus spells to a sorcerer unless he possesses spell slots of an appropriate level. Such bonus spells are automatically granted if the sorcerer gains spell slots of the spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Natural Armor Increase (Ex):** As his skin thickens, a dragon disciple takes on more and more of his progenitor's physical aspect. At 1st, 4th, and 7th level, a dragon disciple gains an increase to the character's existing natural armor (if any), as indicated on Table: Dragon Disciple. These armor bonuses stack.",

This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the dragon disciple is Small), plus 1-1/2 times the dragon disciple's Strength modifier. Upon reaching 6th level, this bite also deals 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage dealt is determined by the dragon disciple's bloodline.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su):** At 3rd level, a dragon disciple gains the breath weapon bloodline power, even if his level does not yet grant that power. Once his level is high enough to grant this ability through the bloodline, the dragon disciple gains an additional use of his breath weapon each day. The type and shape of the breath weapon depends on the type of dragon selected by the dragon disciple, as detailed under the Draconic sorcerer bloodline description.",
			"",
			"**Blindsense (Ex):** At 5th level, the dragon disciple gains blindsense with a range of 30 feet. Using nonvisual senses the dragon disciple notices things he cannot see. He usually does not need to make Perception checks to notice and pinpoint the location of creatures within range of his blindsense ability, provided that he has line of effect to that creature.",

At 10th level, the range of this ability increases to 60 feet.",
			"",
			"**Dragon Form (Sp):** At 7th level, a dragon disciple can assume the form of a dragon. This ability works like form of the dragon I. At 10th level, this ability functions as form of the dragon II and the dragon disciple can use this ability twice per day. His caster level for this effect is equal to his effective sorcerer levels for his draconic bloodline. Whenever he casts form of the dragon, he must assume the form of a dragon of the same type as his bloodline.",

At any time before her next turn, she can attempt to parry an attack against her or an adjacent ally as an immediate action. To parry the attack, the duelist makes an attack roll, using the same bonuses as the attack she chose to forego during her previous action.

The target is filled with ecstatic pleasure for 1d4 rounds. The pleasure suppresses all pain effects during this time. The target must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 20 + the enchanting courtesan's Wisdom modifier). If it succeeds at this saving throw, the target is staggered for the duration. If it fails, it is stunned instead. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. Any effect or immunity that prevents precision damage negates this ability."

If she has the spontaneous casting class feature, she is no longer restricted by the choice made at 1st level to convert prepared spells into cure or inflict spells. Each time the envoy of balance converts a spell, she can choose to convert it into a cure spell or an inflict spell.

Treat the envoy of balance's effective cleric level as 2 lower than normal for the amounts of damage and the DC to halve damage taken.

She doesn't trigger glyphs, symbols, magical traps, or magical sensors set to activate based on a creature's alignment or religion. She counts as the most favorable alignment or faith for the purposes of any harmful effects these alignment- or faithbased spells or abilities may have, but doesn't gain benefits these effects might grant those of a particular alignment or faith unless she is actually of that alignment or faith.",

			"",
			"**Scales of Mortality (Su):** At 10th level, once per day as a standard action, an envoy of balance can make a melee touch attack, delivering a killing touch against a living creature. If the attack hits and the target is not neutral, the target is subject to a power word kill spell. If the attack misses or the target is neutral, this ability is wasted. If the target dies, its bodily remains (but not its equipment) turn to dust, as disintegrate. If this ability kills the target, the envoy of balance becomes aware of that creature's alignment and may then touch the remains of another dead creature with fewer Hit Dice than or Hit Dice equal to the slain creature's and with an alignment opposite to the slain creature's on the good-evil axis, the lawful-chaotic axis, or both. This revives the second dead creature as if via true resurrection. The envoy of balance can delay using this reviving touch for up to 1 hour after successfully using the killing touch, but after that time the reviving power dissipates. The envoy doesn't need to provide the material component for true resurrection; the caster level for both the power word kill and the true resurrection effects is equal to her character level.",

			"**Religious Speaker (Ex):** Through her intense studies, meditation, and discussions with other worshipers, the exalted has mastered the art of speaking about her faith. At 4th level, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Perform (oratory) checks while her divine brand is visible.",
			"",
			"**Expanded Portfolio (Su):** At 5th level, the exalted further increases her already impressive knowledge of her chosen deity's faith and is rewarded with increased powers in one of the spheres over which her deity holds sway.

These physical traits vary by individual and deity; examples include hair with the appearance of fire or water, scaled or metallic flesh, talons, reptilian or glowing eyes, or a faint and colorful aura. The traits may be obvious or subtle, but in any case they confer no special attacks or abilities and impose a -4 penalty on Disguise checks.",
			"",
			"In addition, the exalted gains a permanent protection from chaos/evil/good/law effect with a caster level equal to her character level. She must select one alignment from which her aura protects her, and the chosen alignment must be opposed to the exalted's alignment (and therefore her deity's). An exalted who is neutral chooses any of the four alignments. Once the exalted makes this choice, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"**Ardent Vision (Sp):** At 8th level, the exalted can always discern the enemies of her faith. She gains the ability to cast detect chaos/evil/good/law at will, with a caster level equal to her character level. The exalted must choose one alignment to detect that is opposed to her alignment (or one of her choice is if she is neutral), and once this choice is made it can't be changed.",

			"- Duplicate any cleric spell of 6th level or lower.",
			"- Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.",
			"- Potentially undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity, that require miracle to counteract. To attempt to undo such a spell, the exalted must make a caster level check using her level in the spellcasting class to which she added her exalted levels (including the increases in spellcasting from her exalted levels) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the targeted effect. On a success, the exalted counters the spell or effect. On a failure, the exalted does not counter the spell or effect, though she can try again after 24 hours.",
			"- Make a request of her chosen deity in line with the above effects. Doing so requires a sacrifice of 10,000 gp in powdered diamond or another appropriate precious material based on the teachings of the deity's faith. Examples of potential effects include returning a fallen ally to life and full health, teleporting the exalted and her allies to a location with no chance of error, or protecting a town from a wildfire. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's nature is refused.",
			"",
			"A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are calculated as if it were a 7th-level spell. When an exalted uses this ability to duplicate a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, she must provide that component."

			"Scourge of the seaborne slaver, Gray Corsairs augment existing class skills with specializations that suit them well for their long tours of duty at sea. Yet Gray Corsairs must also be able to operate with skill on land, for they are often expected to mount marine-based raids on island strongholds or other remote locations used by slavers as markets or staging areas for their cruelty.",
			"",
			"The Gray Corsairs existed for some time before the Eagle Knights officially formed. While they've focused on fighting slavery from the start, they did so in their early days as true pirates rather than privateers. Their assimilation into the Eagle Knights as the naval arm of the Steel Falcons gave the organization a surprisingly strong presence in the Inner Sea, and with Andoran's direct support, these privateers have become a force to be reckoned with.",
			"",
			"The freedom fighters who take this prestige class exemplify the call to action to fight slavery in a more violent and aggressive manner than do their allies in the Bellflower Network, and they focus not on mainland slavery but upon the disruption of sea trade of slaves. Swift and agile combatants are in high demand on Gray Corsair ships, as are spellcasters with the ability to command elemental forces or magical transport, and the prestige class plays to this, offering such characters an opportunity to choose an area of specialty while bolstering their nautical skill and knack for rescuing slaves.",

He need not pay for room and board in a favored port. At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Gray Corsair can select another favored port.

			"",
			"**Know the Ropes (Ex):** Gray Corsairs spend a lot of time in the rigging of their ships, as this affords them the best view. At 2nd level, while climbing ropes or rigging, a Gray Corsair gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and needs only one hand free to do so. In addition, in such circumstances he doesn't take a penalty when using the accelerated climbing option, doesn't lose his Dexterity bonus to AC, and doesn't need to attempt a Climb check to avoid falling when he takes damage.",
			"",
			"**Slaver Slayer (Ex):** At 3rd level, a Gray Corsair gains a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against targets he knows to be slavers or to own slaves. This bonus increases to +4 at 6th level and +6 at 9th level. A Gray Corsair automatically confirms critical hits against such targets.",
			"",
			"**Breathe Easy (Sp):** Desperate slavers sometimes throw their living cargo overboard, so a Gray Corsair must help slaves stay alive until they can be plucked from the waves. At 4th level, a Gray Corsair can cast water breathing once per day as a spell-like ability (CL = the Gray Corsair's class level). The Gray Corsair can use this ability as a move action or an immediate action if he so chooses. When used as a move action, the ability can affect only one creature, but can do so at a range of 120 feet. When used as an immediate action, the ability can affect only one creature, but can do so at a range of 60 feet, and its duration is reduced to 1 minute per level. A Gray Corsair can use this ability twice per day at 7th level, and up to three times per day at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Grim Resolve (Ex):** A Gray Corsair has seen more suffering aboard a single slave ship than many will in their entire lives, but this only hardens his resolve-he knows all too well that there are fates worse than death. At 5th level, a Gray Corsair becomes immune to fear effects and adds his Wisdom bonus to attempts to stabilize when his hit points are reduced to below 0.",
			"",
			"**Grant Freedom (Sp):** At 9th level, a Gray Corsair gains the effects of freedom of movement as a constant spell-like ability (his effective caster level equals his class level). As a swift action, he can transfer this effect to a creature by touch, but in this case the effect persists for only 1 minute per effective caster level. When he does so, he regains the benefits of this ability 24 hours later.",
			"",
			"**Whisk to Freedom (Sp):** A Gray Corsair spends enough time harnessing the wind that he learns to become one with it. At 10th level, a Gray Corsair gains wind walk and word of recall as spell-like abilities (caster level 10th), each usable once per day. Word of recall must return the Gray Corsair to a Gray Corsair ship."

He can reroll any Sense Motive check that opposes someone's Bluff check before the results of the check are revealed, but must take the result of the reroll, even it's worse than the original.",
			"",
			"**Second Judgment (Su):** At 4th level, whenever a Gray Gardener uses his judgment or harsh judgment ability, he selects two different judgments. This consumes only one use of this ability. As a swift action, he can change one of these judgments to another type.",

If the attack hits, it deals damage normally and the creature must make a Fortitude saving throw as if struck by a slaying arrow of its creature type.

Destroying the weapon or dispelling this effect frees the soul. After spending 24 hours in the weapon, the captured soul escapes. However, by touching the weapon holding a captured soul to a final blade, the Gray Gardener can transfer the soul into the magical guillotine to remain trapped inside indefinitely. In addition, at 10th level, a Gray Gardener receives initiation in the secret rituals that can release a soul from a final blade (The Inner Sea World Guide 300).",

Shamelessly willing to take advantage of their foes, they can instantly assess a situation in order to find a way to turn it to their own benefit. When a giant swings his club, the halfling opportunist leaps onto it and uses the momentum to make her jump go that much further. When a spellcaster hurls a bolt of magical energy, the halfling opportunist steps in front of a door and uses the power to help her to smash through so she can make her escape. When a courtier tries to blacken her name, the halfling opportunist lets loose such a stream of cheeky accusations that the courtier ends up looking like the traitor instead. Halfling opportunists' ability to exploit their enemies gives them a breezy selfconfidence and the sheer audacity to take risks few others would dare.

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Halfling opportunists gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.",
			"",
			"**Exploitive Maneuver (Ex):** A halfling opportunist can use an enemy's actions in combat for her own gain, as if the opponent were using aid another to assist the opportunist, giving her a bonus on her next skill check, attack roll, or to AC against the next attack (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 86 and 197). The enemy must be able to reach the opportunist, and the opportunist must activate this ability as an immediate action and succeed at a combat maneuver check against the enemy's CMD; at the GM's discretion, the opportunist can substitute another ability score modifier for her Strength modifier when making her combat maneuver check (such as using Dexterity for an agility-related action or Charisma for a social-related action). If the halfling succeeds at this combat maneuver check, she adds the aid another bonus to her action on her next turn and subtracts that bonus from the enemy's roll for that action. Note that if the combat maneuver check is successful, the outcome of the enemy's roll is irrelevant to this ability-a halfling opportunist can use a giant's swinging club to jump farther whether the giant hits or misses with its attack roll.",
			"",
			"The GM decides whether the enemy's action can benefit the opportunist in the desired manner. Circumstances occurring between the enemy's turn and the halfling's turn may prevent her from following through with the desired action); if this occurs, she loses the bonus from aid another but can take her turn normally.",
			"",
			"**Example:** Piria is a halfling opportunist battling an ogre in a walled arena. On the ogre's turn, it swings at her with its club; Piria's player wants to use her exploitive ability to catch the club and use its movement to boost her toward the top of the arena wall, giving her a bonus on her Acrobatics check to jump. The GM decides this is a reasonable use, has the player make a combat maneuver check against the giant's CMD, and allows her to use Piria's Dexterity bonus in place of her Strength bonus in the check. She succeeds and will gain the aid another bonus on her Climb check on her next turn. The GM rolls the ogre's attack with a -2 penalty, hits Piria, and deals damage, but Piria still gets the aid another bonus on her next Acrobatics check- perhaps as the ogre's club hit her, she grabbed it, flipped onto it, and on her turn can jump from the swinging club using the +2 bonus from aid another.",
			"",
			"**Trap Spotter (Ex):** A halfling opportunist has a keen ability to notice and react to danger. She gains the trap spotter rogue talent.",
			"",
			"**Excellent Aid (Ex):** A halfling opportunist has an amazing talent for getting the most out of those who assist her. Increase the bonus she gets from aid another by +1. This increases by another +1 at 3rd level and again at 5th level. This increase does not apply to when she uses aid another to help others, only when others aid her.",
			"",
			"**Exceptionally Lucky (Ex):** At 2nd level, a halfling opportunist learns how to squeeze even more from her innate luck. Her halfling racial bonus on saving throws increases to +2. This bonus increases to +3 at 4th level.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** This is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 for every even level (2nd and 4th). If a halfling opportunist gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on the damage stack.",
			"",
			"**Improved Trap Spotter (Ex):** At 2nd level, the range of the opportunist's trap spotter ability increases to 20 feet.",
			"",
			"**Fit In (Ex):** At 3rd level, a halfling opportunist masters the art of sending out nonverbal cues that suggest agreement and affiliation. This enables her to act as if she belongs in any situation, whether an aristocratic garden party or an evil cult's inner sanctum. She can make a Disguise check in lieu of a Diplomacy check to influence the initial attitudes of NPCs. She does not need to change her appearance to make this check-this ability relies on instinctively knowing how to act to make it appear she belongs. If multiple creatures with differing views of appropriate behavior are present, she cannot simultaneously affect them and must choose a target creature or group to influence-she can't pretend to be a guest at a fancy party to impress the nobles and pretend to be a maid to mingle with the servants at the same time.",
			"",
			"**Opportunity Attacker (Ex):** At 5th level, a halfling opportunist masters the art of striking foes when they are at their most vulnerable. When making an attack of opportunity, she deals her sneak attack damage even if her target is not flat-footed or otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC."

			"Hellknight signifers form the spellcasting arm of the Hellknight orders. They serve as faceless enforcers of order and use their magical powers to relentlessly root out and punish criminals to the letter of the law. They wear masks' often featureless-to mark themselves as impersonal agents of order, unswayed by empathy, detached from emotion, and dedicated to passing impartial judgment upon all lawbreakers. A signifer's distinctive mask is a symbol of his devotion to the precepts of law and exacting justice, and it serves as the focus for several of his signifer powers. Traditionally, signifers are arcane or divine spellcasters. As a signifer must be lawful, clerics who take this prestige class generally worship lawful deities, with the majority being worshipers of Abadar or Asmodeus. Despite trends toward diabolism, overall a signifer's views of good and evil are defined by his Hellknight order first and everything else second. While it's certainly possible for a psychic spellcaster to become a Hellknight signifer, to date, such examples are relatively rare among the various Hellknight orders. Yet in time, as such magic spreads and gains acceptance, psychic Hellknight signifers may well grow more common.",

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A horizon walker gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.",
			"",
			"**Favored Terrain:** At 1st level, a horizon walker may select a favored terrain from the ranger Favored Terrains table (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 65). This works exactly like the ranger favored terrain ability. The horizon walker gains an additional favored terrain at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th and 10th level, and he can increase the bonus from an existing favored terrain as described in the ranger ability. If the horizon walker has abilities from other classes that only work in a favored terrain (such as a ranger's camouflage and hide in plain sight abilities), those abilities work in favored terrains selected as a horizon walker.",
			"",
			"**Terrain Mastery:** At 2nd level, a horizon walker selects a favored terrain to master. When within this terrain the horizon walker may, as a move action, grant a +2 bonus on Climb, Stealth, Perception and Survival checks made by all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the horizon walker's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). The character masters one additional terrain at 4th, 6th, and 8th levels.",
			"",
			"Mastery of each terrain has additional benefits, outlined below; these benefits apply to the horizon walker at all times whether or not he is in the relevant terrain.",
			"",
			"**Astral Plane:** The horizon walker's fly speed increases by +30 feet on planes with no gravity or subjective gravity.  ",
			"**Cold:** The horizon walker gains cold resistance 10.  ",
			"**Desert:** The horizon walker gains immunity to exhaustion; anything that would cause him to become exhausted makes him fatigued instead.  ",
			"**Ethereal Plane:** The horizon walker ignores the 20% concealment miss chance from fog and mist, and treats total concealment from these sources as concealment.  ",
			"**Forest:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Stealth checks.  ",
			"**Jungle:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks and increases his CMD against grapple maneuvers by +4.  ",
			"**Mountain:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Climb checks and does not lose his Dexterity modifier to AC while climbing.  ",
			"**Plains:** The horizon walker's movement is not reduced by wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load.  ",
			"**Plane of Air:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Fly checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against flying creatures. He gains the ability to breathe air if he cannot already do so.  ",
			"**Plane of Earth:** The horizon walker gains DR 1/adamantine.  ",
			"**Plane of Fire:** The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10.  ",
			"**Plane of Water:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures. He gains the ability to breathe water if he cannot already do so.  ",
			"**Plane, aligned:** If the horizon walker selects a plane with an alignment trait, he can choose to detect as that alignment (fooling all forms of magic divination) as an immediate action; this benefit lasts until he dismisses it (a free action).  ",
			"**Swamp:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks.  ",
			"**Underground:** The horizon walker gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.  ",
			"**Urban:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks.  ",
			"**Water:** The horizon walker gains a +4 competence bonus on Swim checks and +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against swimming creatures.",
			"",
			"**Terrain Dominance:** At 3rd level, a horizon walker learns total dominance over one terrain he has already selected for terrain mastery. When dealing with creatures native to that terrain, the horizon walker treats his favored terrain bonus for that terrain as a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class feature) against those creatures.This bonus overlaps (does not stack with) bonuses gained when fighting a favored enemy.",
			"",
			"Each terrain dominance grants additional abilities, detailed below. When the horizon walker gains a new terrain dominance he may, if he prefers, instead pick an additional terrain mastery.",
			"",
			"**Astral Plane:** The horizon walker gains a +1 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders. He gains dimension door as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).  ",
			"**Cold:** The horizon walker gains cold resistance 20 (this replaces the character's cold resistance from mastery of the cold terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls against creatures of the cold subtype.  ",
			"**Desert:** The horizon walker gains fire resistance 10 and immunity to fatigue.  ",
			"**Ethereal Plane:** The walker gains ethereal jaunt as a spell-like ability once per day (caster level equal to the character's level). He must be at least 7th level before selecting this power.  ",
			"**Forest:** The horizon walker gains hallucinatory terrain as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). The horizon walker can only use this ability to create illusory forests.  ",
			"**Jungle:** The horizon walker gains charm monster as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level). This charm only affects animals, magical beasts, and creatures primarily found in the jungle.  ",
			"**Mountain:** The horizon walker gains DR 2/adamantine.  ",
			"**Plains:** The walker's base speed increases by +10 feet.  ",
			"**Plane of Air:** The horizon walker gains fly as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).  ",

			"**Plane of Fire:** The horizon walker gains fire resistance 20 (this replaces the character's file resistance from mastery of the Plane of Fire terrain) and a +1 competence bonus on all attack and damage rolls again creatures of the fire subtype.  ",
			"**Plane of Water:** The horizon walker's movements and actions are not hampered when underwater. This allows him to speak, make attacks, and cast spells normally underwater (as if using freedom of movement).  ",
			"**Plane, aligned:** For the purpose of bypassing damage reduction, the horizon walker's manufactured and natural weapons count as the opposite alignment of his chosen plane of dominance. If his chosen plane has more than one alignment type, he must choose one of those types for this ability. For example, if he selects \"Hell\" (an evil, lawful plane) for his terrain dominance ability, he may choose \"evil\" or \"lawful,\" which means his attacks bypass good or chaotic damage reduction, respectively. Alternatively, if native creatures of his chosen plane are vulnerable to a particular special material (such as cold iron or silver), he may choose to have his weapons bypass damage reduction as if they were that special material. If he selects this plane more than once for his terrain dominance ability, his attacks count as an additional alignment or special material (such as \"good and silver\" or \"chaotic and good\").  ",
			"**Swamp:** The horizon walker gains tremorsense with a 30-foot range. He must be 5th level before selecting this power.  ",
			"**Underground:** The horizon walker gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision 60 feet, its range extends by 60 feet.  ",
			"**Urban:** The horizon walker gains charm person as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + the character's Wisdom modifier (caster level equal to the character's level).  ",
			"**Water:** The horizon walker gains a swim speed of 20 feet. If he already has a natural swim speed, his swim speed increases by +20 feet.",
			"",
			"**Master of All Lands (Su):** At 10th level, the horizon walker becomes familiar with and comfortable in all possible terrains. His terrain bonus in all favored terrains increases by +2, and he treats all other terrains as if they were favored terrains (+2 bonus). If a naturally occurring condition of temperature or weather requires a check or saving throw, he automatically succeeds. All allies within 60 feet of him gain a +2 bonus on these checks and saves; if the horizon walker is in a mastered terrain, this bonus increases to +4."

It is in their blood and constantly at the forefront of their thoughts. The teachings of this once small, exclusive group of knights have inspired others, and now heroes all across Golarion take up swords in the name of these ideals. Most crusaders spend their time advancing the cause of the downtrodden, freeing the oppressed from tyranny and injustice, or helping the timid rise up in the face of evil, though their powers also make them suited for hunting down criminals, breaking the mental shackles of brainwashing and witchcraft, and destroying monsters that pierce the bravest hearts with fear.",

He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If the crusader has levels in cleric and paladin, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Champion of Honor:** An Inheritor's crusader follows a code of conduct identical to that of a paladin, with the same penalties. A crusader's class levels stack with paladin class levels for the purpose of determining the effects of the paladin's smite evil ability.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Great Courage (Su):** At 1st level, the crusader gains an aura of courage equivalent to that of a 3rd-level paladin. If the crusader already has this ability, the aura's range increases to 20 feet.",
			"",
			"**Destroyer of Tyranny (Su):** At 2nd level, a crusader can shatter the oppressive influence of others. Any creature targeted by a crusader's channel positive energy ability or lay on hands gains a new saving throw against any ongoing charm or compulsion effect upon him. At the GM's discretion, this can also allow the target a new saving throw against effects brought on by the power of belief, intimidation, or trickery, even if not actually a charm or compulsion.",
			"",
			"A crusader under one of these effects can expend a use of channel energy or lay on hands to attempt another saving throw against the effect; he can do this once per round as a swift action, and may use this ability even if doing so is contrary to the charm or compulsion effect; for example, a crusader charmed to defend an enemy against his own allies can use this ability to break the effect and turn on the enemy who charmed him. The crusader may indirectly benefit from this ability; for example, if the aforementioned enemy asks the crusader to heal him with channel energy, all creatures in the area (including the crusader) may attempt new saving throws against the controlling effects.",
			"",
			"**Sword Against Injustice (Su):** At 3rd level, a crusader may use his power to judge the guilty and absolve the innocent. As a standard action he may announce he is bringing Iomedae's judgment upon a target who is accused of a crime, lie, or other affront to justice; the crusader makes a melee attack with his sword against the target as part of this judgment. If the target is innocent of what he is accused, the attack stops just short of striking him, as if hitting an invisible wall; if the target is guilty, the attack automatically hits with a flash of white light. This attack requires no attack roll and cannot critically hit. If the target is protected by an effect that inhibits divinations (such as mind blank), the attack bounces off the target with an unpleasant metallic hiss, like quenching a red-hot blade in water. The crusader may use this ability once per day; each additional use beyond the first drains him, causing him to become fatigued. He cannot use this class ability if he is exhausted. He may expend a use of channel energy or lay on hands while activating this ability to prevent fatigue. Sometimes people wrongly accused of great crimes beg for the intercession of an Inheritor's crusader, knowing this power will exonerate them."

They arbitrate disputes, deal with criminals, and establish law where there is none. In pleasant times they are diplomats, in dangerous ones they are judge, jury, and executioner. Their feet leave trails destined to become great roads, and their decrees carry the force of law. Being a justiciar is a serious duty and is not taken lightly-they tend to wear down over time, weathered not from travel and sunlight but from the heavy burden of carrying civilization forward into the future. A rare few pursue heretics of their own religion, keeping the faith stable and weeding out unruly elements. Each is sworn to uphold a religious or secular code.",

			"**Authority (Su):** A justiciar serves a religious or legal code and has absolute authority (granted by a higher-ranking agent of that code) to enforce it. This means that if the justiciar catches criminals, she may judge them guilty (given sufficient proof ) and order their execution, or do it herself if need be. Because the justiciar must act within the law, there is rarely any friction between her and established authorities other than disputes about jurisdiction and challenges from other forms of authority. (A religiously endorsed justiciar, for example, might come into conflict with secular governors who take exception to the execution of their subjects.) A justiciar may deputize others to aid her in her tasks, although she is responsible for their actions in her name.",

			"As part of a Diplomacy and Intimidate check regarding matters of the law and her authority, a justiciar may exert her authority to grant herself a +4 bonus on these checks. This ability negates any need to carry a badge or writ of office, and is mainly used to convince those unfamiliar with the justiciar of her legal powers. For example, a justiciar can use this ability to check an angry mob intent on lynching a jailed prisoner, or convince a stubborn mayor that interfering with the justiciar's efforts is likely to anger the lord they both work for. Even against individuals who don't acknowledge his code of laws (such as thieves or warriors from other lands), the justicar's fervor still grants these skill bonuses. She does not, however, gain these bonuses in situations where her code of laws would not apply or hold no bearing (like against monsters or savages). The GM ultimately adjudicates who the justiciar's authority applies against.",
			"",
			"In addition, a justiciar's knowledge of her code is magically flawless, as if she were mentally reviewing a perfect copy of the code. If the source of the code changes (such as a decree from the church's high priest or a new law created by a king), she instantly knows it. This perfect knowledge means she immediately recognizes any misquoting of the law (deliberate or accidental), and many justiciars consider it their duty to review the law book in remote settlements to make sure there are no errors in transcription or translation. A justiciar may always take 10 on Knowledge checks regarding the code, even when rushed or threatened.",
			"",
			"**Lawkeeper:** Justiciars are not allowed to violate their code or any oath or contract they willingly agree to, nor can they go against the spirit of it while holding to the letter. A justiciar who willingly does so loses all prestige class abilities until she receives an atonement spell from her religious superiors or an official pardon from her secular superiors.",
			"",
			"**Sure Shot:** A justiciar is skilled with crossbows. At 2nd level, she gains the ability to make a sure shot. A number of times per day equal to her class level, a justiciar may add her Charisma bonus on an attack roll made with a crossbow and deal 1 extra point of damage per justiciar level.",
			"",
			"**Oathmark (Su):** This ability magically seals an oath or agreement between two people. The justiciar chooses two willing creatures and presses her authority upon them. By accepting her authority and stating their agreement on something (whether a verbal promise, written contract, treaty, or the like), the two creatures are magically linked so that if one breaks the agreement, the other knows it. The expiration of the link does not explain the exact nature of the betrayal, only that it has occurred. If one target dies, the link ends and the other target knows the other party is dead.",
			"",
			"Direct and indirect attempts to violate the agreement end the link; swearing not to kill someone and then hiring someone else to do it is a violation, as is hiring assassins before the agreement with the orders to kill the person later. The link cannot penetrate other planes, areas where magic does not function, or spells such as mind blank that block mind reading. Once the interference ends, the link resumes and determines if the agreement has been broken. The other person in the link knows if the link is blocked, but not why.",
			"",
			"The creature who breaks the agreement is cursed with a raised physical mark on the forehead (or other obvious place) indicating his willing violation of the agreement. The target takes a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks when dealing with those who dislike oathbreakers. Magical attempts to remove the mark-such as via remove curse-require a successful caster level check (DC 10 + justiciar's character level). Even if the curse is removed, the other party in the agreement still knows of the betrayal. The mark is colored and textured as the justicar chooses, and cannot be hidden with makeup, tattoos, or scars, although greater physical obstructions (such as a long wig or low-hanging hat) can conceal it.",

			"Guardians of a sacred trust, the Knights of Ozem are a chivalrous order based out of Lastwall and dedicated to guarding against the return of Tar-Baphon, the dreaded Whispering Tyrant. They also fight against the schemes of all undead creatures and any plots to increase the power of undeath, especially those associated with the Whispering Way.",
			"",
			"The order is deeply religious, composed of devoted worshipers of their current patron deity, Iomedae. At the height of the Shining Crusade, the Knights of Ozem venerated Aroden and summoned Arazni, demigod and warrior-herald of Aroden, to aid them in their battle against the Whispering Tyrant. Arazni's death at Tar- Baphon's hands and the demise of Aroden at the start of the Age of Lost Omens caused the order to transfer its allegiance to Aroden's inheritor-the goddess Iomedae, herself a heroine of the Shining Crusade. The Knights of Ozem hold a particular grudge against the ghostly wizardruler Geb, who stole Arazni's corpse and reanimated her as a lich, taking her as his Harlot Queen. They pursue Arazni in her new form, in hopes of destroying her and giving her soul eternal rest.",

He counts as having these feats for the purposes of qualifying for feats or other abilities. If he already possesses the Disruptive and/or Spellbreaker feats, the effects do not stack. When he threatens any spellcaster (not just an undead spellcaster), the concentration check DC increases by 2 if the spell being cast is from the necromancy school, has the death descriptor, or has the evil descriptor. For the purpose of this ability, the Knight of Ozem counts as having automatically identified the effect as if he had made a Spellcraft check. This increase only applies if the Knight of Ozem is aware of the spellcaster's location and is capable of making an attack of opportunity.",

			"",
			"**Purge Malevolence (Su):** At 7th level, a Knight of Ozem can attempt to dispel an ongoing spell effect from the necromancy school or one with the death or evil descriptor as part of a melee attack against a creature or object. The Knight of Ozem must declare the attempt before making the attack, and if he misses, the attempt is wasted. If the attack hits, eligible effects on the target are subject to a targeted dispel magic effect (caster level equal to the Knight of Ozem's total character level). He can use this ability on any melee attack, but only once per round.",
			"",
			"**Foil Deathcaster (Ex):** At 9th level, once per day as an immediate action, a Knight of Ozem can force an undead spellcaster he threatens to reroll a concentration check made to cast defensively. The spellcaster must take the lower result.",
			"",
			"**Raiment of Righteousness (Su):** At 10th level, once per day as a standard action, a Knight of Ozem can transfigure his gear into the Iomedaean embodiment of virtuous valor. His armor (if metallic) turns silver-gray, gaining the material properties of adamantine in addition to any other material properties it may have. His shield (if he wears one) glows like a torch and gains the blinding special ability in addition to any other special abilities it has. The shield's blinding ability has a saving throw DC of 19 (21 vs. undead). His cloak (if he wears one) turns bright red, becoming a cloak of resistance +5 in addition to any other properties it has. His sword (if he wields one) acts as if it has a holy sword spell cast upon it with caster level equal to his class level. These effects last for 1 minute, and only function while the Knight of Ozem wields or wears these items. A dropped or removed item ceases granting its abilities, but resumes if returned before the duration expires."

This ability is similar in effect to a druid's woodland stride ability, but its benefits extend to magical effects as well. She takes no damage from moving through spiky vegetation, briars, or even a wall of thorns, but harmful gases and other detrimental effects, such as fire damage from an incendiary cloud, still affect her as normal.

This functions as word of recall, but the Lantern Bearer can transport only herself plus 50 pounds of objects.",

			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** At 2nd level, a Lion Blade gains sneak attack +1d6, as the rogue ability. This extra damage increases by 1d6 at both 6th level and 10th level. These increases stack with sneak attack damage granted by other sources.",
			"",
			"**Unexpected Suggestion (Su):** At 3rd level, once per day, a Lion Blade can use suggestion on a flat-footed target. Her caster level is equal to her Lion Blade level. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Lion Blade's ranks in Bluff + her Intelligence modifier.",

Apply this bonus before modifying the Lion Blade's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Surprise (Ex):** At 4th level, a Lion Blade can deliver a devastating blow to anyone she catches unaware. Whenever she hits a foe with a sneak attack at the end of a charge or while using Spring Attack, she can make the blow a perfect surprise as an immediate action. The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + the Lion Blade's class level + her Intelligence modifier) or fall unconscious for 1 round per Lion Blade level. Once targeted by this ability, a victim is immune to perfect surprise for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Crowd Strike (Ex):** When a Lion Blade reaches 6th level, all crowd squares (Core Rulebook 436) count as enemies threatening adjacent squares for the purpose of determining whether the Lion Blade is flanking an opponent. In addition, she can use the Stealth skill to snipe at foes even when making melee attacks as long as she attacks from a square containing at least one other creature within one size category of her.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Cloud the Mind (Su):** At 7th level, whenever a Lion Blade's opposed Disguise or Stealth check is exceeded by one or more observers' Perception checks, she can trick the observers into thinking they imagined noticing anything wrong as an immediate action. She attempts a Bluff check opposed by the targets' Sense Motive checks. Each target who fails this opposed check ignores the fact that he saw her. The Lion Blade also gains an amount of spell resistance equal to 10 + her class level against divination spells. If a spell is foiled by her spell resistance, she learns the spell's normal effect and can choose a substitute result for the divination rather than causing it to obviously fail.",

			"",
			"**Grandmaster of Disguise (Ex):** At 9th level, a Lion Blade can improvise a disguise using materials on hand that is as effective as one crafted using an actual disguise kit. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks (this does not stack with the bonus from an actual disguise kit). She can attempt a Disguise check at a -20 penalty to create a disguise as a full-round action.",
			"",
			"**Silent Soul (Ex):** At 10th level, a Lion Blade has mastered the ability to still her thoughts and her movements to an amazing degree. The Lion Blade gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. She also gains spell resistance 20 against mind-affecting effects. If a spell is foiled by her spell resistance, she learns the spell's normal effect and can make it appear as if she were affected by it rather than causing it to obviously fail. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but she can disregard whichever commands she desires."

Often rejecting what he views as the pointless affectations and transitory pleasures of his short-sighted neighbors, the loremaster believes that the only worthwhile goal in life is the acquisition of intellectual might.

Some loremasters actively deride those of their kind who fear to leave the safety of the temple or library, pointing out that only old lore can be discovered in books-new lore must be sought out in the world.

			"A Magaambyan arcanist studies and follows traditions of magic originally discovered by Old-Mage Jatembe himself, and uses these arcane secrets to continue Jatembe's quest to bring decency and integrity to civilization. Despite the name of the class, any arcane spellcaster can expand her powers via this prestige class, not only arcanists. Most Magaambyan arcanists consider their studies to be a sacred duty and a tradition that spans the ages. As a Magaambyan arcanist learns the deeper meanings locked within the academy's wisdom, she discovers the true enlightened and philanthropic purpose of the Magaambya.",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most unusual facet of the Magaambyan arcanists' magical techniques is their method of interpreting and using magic of a druidic nature as arcane power. This unusual combination allows the Magaambyan arcanist incredible versatility in her studies, for the secrets of druidic magic are normally beyond the ken of arcane spellcasters. Yet the Magaambyan arcanist does not merely copy the magic of the natural world-she expands upon it. She simultaneously respects the traditions from which this magic stems while exploring it in ways that druids, who view their magic as a result of their faith, rarely consider. This method of converting druidic spells to arcane spells is taxing to the mind, however, and since each Magaambyan arcanist must create her own such translations, the school has not made arcane versions of druidic spells available to all arcane spellcasters. In fact, most students of the Magaambya are opposed to such an endeavor, for as intrigued as they are by this magic, they respect its traditions and do not wish to see these secrets made freely available to those who may not share their respect.",

			"",
			"**Halcyon Magic (Su):** At each class level, a Magaambyan arcanist chooses a spell from the druid spell list and treats it as if it were on the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. A Magaambyan arcanist must choose a druid spell at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level spell she can currently cast. The spell's type becomes arcane and its save DC functions as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds it to. The Magaambyan arcanist automatically learns this spell, adding it to her spellbook or familiar as appropriate for the class of the spell list to which she added the spell.",
			"",
			"**Superior Spell Mastery (Ex):** At 2nd level, by spending a total of 24 hours studying over a maximum of 3 days, a Magaambyan arcanist can change the spells she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can choose a number of spells she knows up to her Intelligence modifier (which can have a maximum combined spell level equal to or less than her caster level) to be her Spell Mastery spells in place of the same number of spells she previously selected for her Spell Mastery feat.",

			"**Intoned Recollection (Ex):** At 3rd level, by performing a special ritual lasting 1 minute, a Magaambyan arcanist can prepare a spell into an open arcane spell slot. The open spell slot must have purposefully been left empty at the beginning of the day when the Magaambyan arcanist prepared her spells. She must be able to read her spellbook or have mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat to prepare it with this ability. She doesn't need to rest for 8 hours beforehand, but all other requirements of the preparation process still apply. At 9th level, she can do this as a full-round action, provided she has her spellbook in hand or has mastered the spell with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"**Lasting Goodness (Su):** At 3rd level, all of a Magaambyan arcanist's spells with the good descriptor have their durations extended by a number of rounds equal to her class level. A spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent isn't affected by this ability.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Spell Mastery (Ex):** At 4th level, a Magaambyan arcanist can lose any prepared spell to cast a spell of the same spell level or lower that she has mastered with the Spell Mastery feat. She can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 8th level.",

This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the Magaambyan arcanist, but can't be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.",

			"",
			"**Holy Arcana (Ex):** At 9th level, a Magaambyan arcanist expands her skill at translating divine magic into arcane spells. She adds all the bonus spells from the Good cleric domain to the spell list of one of her arcane spellcasting classes. These spells' type becomes arcane and the save DCs function as normal for the arcane spellcasting class list she adds them to.",
			"",
			"**Altruistic Guardian (Su):** At 10th level, once per day when a spell or supernatural effect that allows spell resistance targets a Magaambyan arcanist's allies or if they are within its area of effect, as an immediate action she can redirect the effects to herself. She can do this for a number of allies up to her Intelligence modifier, provided they are within 30 feet of her. The Magaambyan arcanist must attempt the appropriate saving throws for each ally, possibly attempting multiple saving throws against the same spell or effect. She takes all damage and suffers all conditions and other effects that her allies would have taken, possibly taking these multiple times. This protects allies only from damage and conditions they'd take at the time she spends the immediate action, not from any they might later suffer from a noninstantaneous spell or effect.",

Both the hulking \"mutagenic form\" of alchemical prowess and the original alchemist who created it think of themselves as the true form, and they must learn to work together to achieve their joint goals. More often than not, master chymists eventually become their mutagenic form, and the original alchemist's body and mind may only be brought forth when required by social custom or a need for obscurity and stealth arises. Unfortunately, the mutagenic form of a master chymist is often a more violent, unforgiving personality (which can lead to conflict between the two versions of the same character).",

Adventuring is one of the few activities that their monstrous form can be useful for, leading many to constantly explore dangerous areas on the edge of civilization. A master chymist's resilience and ability to combine bomb-throwing mayhem with up-close melee carnage is a great benefit to many adventuring parties, buying the master chymist allies who are at least willing to overlook her more distasteful features.",

The mutagenic form shares memories and basic goals with the chymist's normal personality but goes about meeting those goals in a different manner. The mutagenic form is often ugly and monstrous and may even appear to be a different race or gender than her normal form; they may look as different as two unrelated people. Indeed, the mutagenic form often has his or her own name, and may attempt to maintain independent relationships and strongholds (though the alter ego's limited time in existence often makes this difficult). The mutagenic form even has his or her own alignment (which is selected by the player, but must be different from the master chymist's normal alignment). The change in alignment only affects the master chymist while in her mutagenic form.",

Butcher is neutral, and more interested in seeing the world kept in balance than promoting the greatest good. Butcher is aware she exists only when called on by Darabont, but seeks to build her own circle of like-minded friends during the hours she exists. Butcher does not dislike Darabont, but feels her gnome form is too soft and innocent to survive in the harsh world the chymist lives in. As Darabont, the character detects as good and is affected as a good character by spells with effects that vary by alignment; as Butcher, the same character is neutral, is not revealed by a detect good spell, and is treated as neutral for all spells and effects.",
			"",
			"**Mutate (Su):** At 1st level, as a result of repeated exposure to her mutagens, the master chymist can now assume a mutagenic form twice per day without imbibing her mutagen. In this form, she gains all the bonuses and penalties of her mutagen and adds together her alchemist and master chymist levels together to determine her effective alchemist level for the duration of this form. Using a mutagen also forces the chymist into this form. Taking a mutagen or using the mutate ability again while in her mutagenic form works normally (with the new mutagen's modifiers replacing the current modifiers, and the longer duration taking precedent). The chymist remains in her mutagenic form until its duration expires, her magic is interrupted (as with an antimagic field), or she expends another use of her mutate ability.",
			"",
			"A chymist may be forced to take her mutagenic form against her will by stress or damage. Anytime the character is in her normal form and has daily uses of the mutate ability available, she may be forced to switch after suffering a critical hit or failing a Fortitude save. In these situations the chymist must make a DC 25 Will save; if she fails, on her next turn she uses a standard action to change to her mutagenic form (which counts as a use of the mutate ability).",

			"At 5th level, the master chymist can assume her mutagenic form three times per day; this increases to four times per day at 8th level and five times per day at 10th level.",

			"**Advanced Mutagen (Su):** At 2nd level, the mutagenic form of the master chymist continues to evolve and develop as she grows in power. The master chymist selects an advanced mutagen, a power that changes how her mutagen form works or can only be accessed in her mutagenic form. She gains additional advanced mutagens at 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level. The chymist cannot select the same advanced mutagen more than once.",
			"",
			"**Burly (Ex):** In her mutagenic form, the master chymist's heavy physical frame gives her an alchemical bonus on Strength checks, Constitution checks, and Strength-based skill checks as well as a bonus to CMB and CMD. The bonus is equal to half the master chymist's class level.",
			"",
			"**Disguise (Ex):** When in her mutagenic form, the chymist can temporarily change her appearance to her normal form and still retain most of the abilities of her mutagenic form. As a standard action, she may make a Will saving throw (DC 20) to assume the appearance of her normal form for one minute. Each additional minute beyond the first requires a new saving throw with a +1 increase to the DC. Failure means the chymist assumes her normal form (as if ending the use of mutagenic form) or reverts fully to her mutagenic form. At any time while using this ability, the chymist can resume her normal form as a standard action or relax her will and revert to her mutagenic form as a free action. Once this ability ends, the chymist cannot use it again until 10 minutes have passed. Obvious physical changes in mutagenic form such as draconic mutagen, feral mutagen, and growth mutagen do not work while the chymist is disguised in her normal form. Time spent disguised counts toward the chymist's time in her mutagenic form.",
			"",
			"**Draconic Mutagen (Su):** When the chymist assumes her mutagenic form, she gains dragon-like features-scaly skin, reptilian eyes, and so on, resembling a half-dragon. The chymist chooses one dragon type (see the draconic bloodline) when selecting this advanced mutagen; once selected, this choice cannot be changed and determines her draconic resistances and breath weapon type. The chymist gains resistance 20 to the dragon's energy type. The chymist's breath weapon deals 8d8 points of energy damage (Reflex half, DC 10 + the chymist's class level + the chymist's Intelligence modifier); she may use her breath weapon once per transformation into her mutagenic form. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 16, must know the form of the dragon I extract, and must have the feral mutagen discovery or advanced mutagen to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Dual Mind (Ex):** The chymist's alter ego gives her a +2 bonus on Will saving throws in her normal and mutagenic forms. If she is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC; if she succeeds, she is free of the effect (as if she had made her original save) and immediately changes to her mutagenic form or back to her normal form. If she has no more uses of the mutate ability remaining for the day, she cannot use dual mind. The character must have an effective alchemist level (alchemist level plus master chymist levels) of at least 10 to select this ability.",

			"Unparalleled practitioners of deception, master spies rely on deceit and trickery over brawn and spells. A master spy is an expert at both magical and nonmagical means of evading detection, and quick-witted when it comes to improvisation. Master spies may serve countries or private interests, or sell their services to the highest bidder without a thought to long-term loyalty.",
			"",
			"Bards and rogues, with their wide range of skills, are particularly well suited for the demands of spying. Rogues can easily pass themselves off as members of most nonmagical professions (though playing an armored warrior impedes their natural abilities), while bluffing bards can impersonate a wide range of other spellcasters well enough to fool a casual observer. Versatility and adaptability are the watchwords for espionage, and successful master spies let others complete their deception for them, subtly drawing targets into their machinations.",
			"",
			"**Role:** Master spies rarely work with others unless they are under cover. The special skills that serve them so well in the field ironically make them exceptional leaders, but a master spy's natural inclination toward secrecy pushes her away from the limelight. Note that a master spy among adventurers may not intend to betray them; armed heroes provide excellent cover for a master spy's true mission, whether or not they know the spy's intent.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Master of Disguise (Ex):** A master spy can create a disguise in half the time normally required. In addition, any penalties from assuming a disguise of a different gender, race, age, or size are reduced by 1.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt increases by +1d6 at every third level (1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th). If a master spy gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack.",
			"",
			"**Glib Lie (Su):** A master spy of 2nd level or higher can deceive truth-detecting magic. A creature using this sort of magic against the spy must succeed on a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the master spy's class level to succeed (as if she were under the effect of a glibness spell); failure means the magic doesn't detect the spy's lies or force her to speak only the truth. This ability does not give the master spy the glibness spell's bonus on Bluff checks.",
			"",
			"**Mask Alignment (Su):** A master spy of 2nd level or higher can alter her alignment aura to deceive spells that discern alignment (such as detect evil). She may choose to detect as any specific alignment, or to detect as no alignment at all. This ability does not protect against spells or effects that cause harm based on alignment. Masking her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.",
			"",
			"**Nonmagical Aura (Sp):** At 3rd level, a master spy can use magic aura twice per day, but only for the purpose of making an object appear nonmagical.",
			"",
			"**Superficial Knowledge (Ex):** A master spy gives the appearance of knowing more than she actually does. Starting at 3rd level, she can make untrained Knowledge and Profession checks pertaining to her cover or assumed identity as if she were trained and gains a bonus equal to half her level on these checks. For example, a master spy masquerading as a noblewoman can make untrained Knowledge (history) checks about the kingdom and Knowledge (nobility) checks about its noble and royal families as if she were trained, but she cannot make untrained Knowledge (nature) skill checks to identify herbs.",
			"",
			"**Concealed Thoughts (Su):** A 4th-level master spy can conceal her schemes from mind-reading magic. When a creature is using detect thoughts or similar magic to read her mind, she decides what surface thoughts her opponent detects, and her true surface thoughts remain private. This ability does not protect against mental attacks or mind-reading that delves deeper than surface thoughts.",
			"",
			"**Quick Change (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, a master spy can assume a disguise in only 2d4 rounds by taking a -10 penalty on her Disguise check. This penalty drops to -5 at 8th level.",
			"",
			"**Elude Detection (Sp):** At 5th level, a master spy can befuddle divinations used against her as if she were under the effect of a nondetection spell with a caster level equal to her character level. She can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the nondetection for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Slippery Mind (Su):** At 5th level, a master spy can slip away from mental control. This functions as the rogue advanced talent of the same name. If the spy has the slippery mind ability from another class, these abilities stack, but she can still only use slippery mind once per round.",
			"",
			"**Shift Alignment (Su):** Starting at 6th level, a master spy's control over her aura improves. When she assumes a false alignment, she can choose to have all spells and magic items affect her as though she were that alignment; this includes helpful and harmful effects. For example, a neutral good master spy can shift her aura to lawful evil so she can pass through a doorway that shocks creatures that aren't lawful evil; if hit by holy smite with this shifted aura, she takes damage as if she were evil. A master spy can change her alignment aura from a masked alignment (as per her 2nd-level class feature, where effects still function based on her actual alignment) to a shifted alignment (as per this ability, where effects function based on her assumed alignment) as a standard action. Shifting her alignment aura is a standard action, and lasts until she changes it again or ends the effect.",
			"",
			"**Death Attack (Ex):** At 8th level, a master spy learns the art of killing or paralyzing a foe with a careful strike. This ability functions as the assassin's death attack ability. If the master spy has levels in another class that grants the death attack ability, these levels stack with her master spy level to determine the DC of her death attack, even if she has not yet reached 8th level as a master spy.",
			"",
			"**Fool Casting (Su):** A master spy of 8th level or higher can trick an opponent into believing that she has been charmed or dominated. When the master spy succeeds at a saving throw against a magical effect that provides ongoing control (such as charm person, dominate person, or a vampire's dominate ability), she can allow the spell to take partial effect. To the caster, it appears that the spy failed her saving throw, but the spy is not under the caster's control. If the spell provides a telepathic link, it functions normally, but the spy is under no obligation to follow the caster's commands. The master spy can dismiss a fooled spell as a standard action. Fooled casting can be used when the spy succeeds at a subsequent saving throw against an ongoing effect, such as that granted by slippery mind.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Mind (Sp):** At 9th level, a master spy gains the benefit of a constant mind blank spell at a caster level equal to her character level. The spy can suppress or resume this protection as a standard action. If dispelled, the spy cannot resume the mind blank for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Assumption (Su):** The ultimate ability of the master spy is to take over another persona entirely, making it her own. As a full-round action, the spy can touch a helpless creature and shift her aura to that of her target. This confuses divination effects and spells, even ones as powerful as discern location, such that they register the spy as being the creature she has touched. This ability is not proof against the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. The assumption of an identity lasts until the master spy ends it (a standard action) or she uses the ability on another creature."

If the mortal usher already has Vital Strike or Improved Vital Strike when he would gain it through this ability, he can immediately swap it for another feat for which he qualified at the level he first took it. For the purposes of qualifying for any feat that includes Vital Strike as a prerequisite, the mortal usher can use his class level in place of his base attack bonus, adding this value to his base attack bonus from any other classes he has as normal.",
			"",
			"**Mortal Talents:** At 2nd level, a mortal usher must choose a class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the mortal usher gains the class features of an additional level in his chosen class (for example, a [wizard](class/wizard) 5/mortal usher 4 would have the arcane bond benefits, caster level, and spells per day of a 7th-level wizard). He still retains the Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks of the prestige class, but gains all other class features of his chosen class at the specified levels.",
			"",
			"**Nosoi Plague Mask (Su):** At 3rd level, a mortal usher can conjure or dismiss a [nosoi](monster/nosoi) plague mask as a free action. This plague mask is a physical manifestation of the mortal usher's soul and cannot be destroyed or stolen, though its magic can be suppressed by an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field) or similar effect. As long as the mortal usher's nosoi plague mask is conjured, the mortal usher gains the ability to cast [invisibility](spell/invisibility) on himself as a standard action with a caster level equal to 5 + his class level.",
			"",
			"In addition, the mortal usher can activate the nosoi plague mask as a standard action, forcing all living and undead creatures within a 60-foot radius to attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 15 + the mortal usher's class level). Those that fail are fascinated; this effect continues for every round the mortal usher maintains the effect as a swift action and for 1 round thereafter. The mortal usher cannot use the [invisibility](spell/invisibility) effect of the plague mask while using its fascinate ability, and a creature that saves against the fascination effect is immune for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect; it can affect undead even though they would normally be immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"Catrina's Calm (Su) At 5th level, a mortal usher emits a 30-foot-radius aura that acts as a [calm emotions](spell/calm_emotions) spell on creatures within its area, with a DC of 16 + the mortal usher's class level. Creatures are entitled to a new saving throw each time they reenter the area of the aura after leaving it, and a creature who successfully saves against the aura's effects is immune to it for 24 hours. The mortal usher can suppress or resume this aura as a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Morrigna Wrappings (Su):** At 7th level, a mortal usher gains the ability to designate any cloak, scarf, robe, or shirt in his possession as his wrappings, granting it unique powers in addition to any abilities or enchantments it may already have. The wrappings grant the mortal usher a natural armor bonus equal to half his class level as long as it is in his possession, and they can be used as a magic whip that can be wielded even if the mortal usher's hands are full. When used as a whip, the wrappings gain an enhancement bonus equal to the mortal usher's class level. These bonuses can be added to the whip to increase its enhancement bonus to a maximum of +5 (minimum +1), or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: [brilliant energy](magic/enhancement/brilliant_energy), [disruption](magic/enhancement/disruption) (this supersedes the normal requirement that a disruption weapon must be a bludgeoning weapon), [flaming](magic/enhancement/flaming), [flaming burst](magic/enhancement/flaming_burst), [frost](magic/enhancement/frost), [holy](magic/enhancement/holy), [icy burst](magic/enhancement/icy_burst), [shock](magic/enhancement/shock), [shocking burst](magic/enhancement/shocking_burst), [unholy](magic/enhancement/unholy), or [vorpal](magic/enhancement/vorpal).

The mortal usher can change how these properties and enhancements are assigned, or designate a new item as his wrappings, after an 8-hour rest.",
			"",
			"**Vanth Wings (Ex):** At 9th level, a mortal usher gains a 60-foot fly speed with good maneuverability and resistance to cold equal to 10 + his class level. The mortal usher gains a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks and on concentration checks attempted while casting a spell.",
			"",
			"**Yamaraj-Feather Cloak (Su):** At 10th level, a mortal usher becomes immune to electricity and death effects, and whenever he is struck by an attack or effect dealing electricity damage, he regains 1 hit point per 3 points of electricity damage the attack or effect would normally deal.

			"Mystic theurges place no boundaries on their magical abilities and find no irreconcilable paradox in devotion to the arcane as well as the divine. They seek magic in all of its forms, finding no reason or logic in denying themselves instruction by limiting their knowledge to one stifling paradigm, though many are simply hungry for limitless power. No matter what their motivations, mystic theurges believe that perception is reality, and through the divine forces and astral energies of the multiverse, that perception can be used to manipulate and control not only the nature of this reality, but destiny itself.",

Mystic theurges travel the world in search of arcane and holy artifacts, magical lore, or divine revelations, and most have no qualms about teaming up with groups of adventurers so long as that group's goals do not directly conflict with their own.",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** The motivations of a mystic theurge rarely stem from a sense of altruism or philanthropy, so most tend to be neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. Lawful mystic theurges, whether good, neutral, or evil, are rarer, and often use their powers for either the benefit-or control-of society. Chaotic mystic theurges are rarer still, as the calling generally requires great personal discipline.",

He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that he adds the level of mystic theurge to the level of whatever other arcane spellcasting class and divine spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class or more than one divine spellcasting class before he became a mystic theurge, he must decide to which class he adds each level of mystic theurge for the purpose of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Combined Spells (Su):** A mystic theurge can prepare and cast spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the available slots from any of his other spellcasting classes. Spells prepared or cast in this way take up a slot one level higher than they originally occupied. This ability cannot be used to cast a spell at a lower level if that spell exists on both spell lists. At 1st level, a mystic theurge can prepare 1st-level spells from one of his spellcasting classes using the 2nd-level slots of the other spellcasting class. Every two levels thereafter, the level of spells that can be cast in this way increases by one, to a maximum of 5th-level spells at 9th level (these spells would take up 6th-level spell slots). The components of these spells do not change, but they otherwise follow the rules for the spellcasting class used to cast the spell.",

For example, a cleric/sorcerer/mystic theurge can use this ability to spontaneously cast a bless spell using a 2nd-level sorcerer spell slot, if the character had a prepared bless spell using a 1st-level cleric spell slot, even if that spell had already been cast that day.",
			"",
			"**Spell Synthesis (Su):** At 10th level, a mystic theurge can cast two spells, one from each of his spellcasting classes, using one action. Both of the spells must have the same casting time. The mystic theurge can make any decisions concerning the spells independently. Any target affected by both of the spells takes a -2 penalty on saves made against each spell. The mystic theurge receives a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance with these two spells. A mystic theurge may use this ability once per day."

Terrain hazards that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.",

The companion counts either as part of the warden or as an object with no weight, whichever is more favorable for the warden.",

			"**Ironpaw (Su):** At 8th level, a nature warden may grant her animal companion and any creature she summons with summon nature's ally DR/cold iron equal to her class level. In addition, their natural weapons are considered cold iron for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This ability does not stack with the silverclaw ability. The warden must decide at the time of summoning whether a summoned creature gains the benefits of silverclaw or ironpaw. She may change which ability applies to her animal companion by spending 1 hour in prayer and meditation with the companion within 100 feet.",
			"",
			"**Guarded Lands (Ex):** At 9th level, a nature warden may designate an area as her guarded lands, allowing her to treat it as her favored terrain or to enhance her bonuses if it is already in her favored terrain. The area must be no larger than 1 square mile, and the warden must spend 24 hours carefully studying the entire area. This period of study gives her a +2 favored terrain bonus in that area, which stacks with any favored terrain bonus for that area (for example, she also gets her forest favored terrain bonus if her guarded lands are part of a forest). She may also designate one creature type as her favored enemy within those guarded lands, gaining a +2 favored enemy bonus against the creature type that stacks with any favored enemy bonus she has against that type of creature. Allies who can see and hear the warden gain an initiative bonus equal to half the warden's favored terrain bonus for that terrain.",

			"**Companion Soul (Su):** At 10th level, a nature warden's bond with her animal companion is so strong that it transcends distance and even death. The companion's devotion ability increases to a +8 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects. The warden may scry on her animal companion once per day as if using the scrying spell, except she needs no focus or divine focus. She may view the area around her companion or see through its eyes. If her companion dies, she can revive it with an 8-hour ritual; this has the same effect as raise dead, except it doesn't require a material component and the companion does not gain any negative levels from the ordeal."

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A pain taster is proficient with all simple weapons, martial weapons, and whips. A pain taster gains no armor or shield proficiencies.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Pain (Su):** At 1st level, a pain taster can focus her agony through the use of six torture routines. Each routine grants her a different day-long benefit. The first time a pain taster performs a particular torture routine, she must spend 1 hour inflicting self-harm using materials that cost 2,000 gp. The method of self-torture is detailed in the routines below. After performing a routine for the first time, she can subsequently perform a less strenuous version of that routine to gain its benefits for 24 hours without needing to expend any further money on torture implements, ritual incense, and pain heightening drugs.",
			"",
			"If the pain taster wishes to change her routine, she must spend 2,000 gp when first performing the new ritual. She must pay this cost each time she changes her routine, even if returning to a routine she had previously paid for. A pain taster can benefit from only one routine at a time.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Acuity:** By spending an hour reciting a lengthy series of mantras while clutching a length of razor-edged metal, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves making dozens of arterial incisions and writing the mantras in blood.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Flexibility:** By spending an hour painfully hyper-extending each joint, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves tearing major tendons in each limb.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Insight:** By spending an hour whipping or bludgeoning herself while meditating on her failures and regrets, a pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves inserting a long needle directly into the heart, causing massive internal hemorrhaging.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Spirit:** By spending an hour splitting her tongue by cutting it centrally from the tip to the base, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves applying acid to a normally visible part of the body, inflicting extensive chemical burns.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Torment:** By spending an hour eating dirt, rocks, and other indigestible matter, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Constitution for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves slicing open the abdominal cavity with a blade, and then sewing up the wound.",
			"",
			"**Disciple of Vigor:** By spending an hour hanging by the wrists from a tree, crossbeam, or any other support structure, the pain taster gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength for 24 hours. The initial torture session for this routine involves breaking each rib by lying on the ground, and then repeatedly dropping a large rock directly on the ribcage.",
			"",
			"**Masochism (Ex):** At 1st level, a pain taster becomes empowered by pain, and is inured to its effects. She receives a +4 class bonus on saving throws made against pain effects.",
			"",
			"Additionally, a pain taster can deal lethal damage to herself at any time to gain a bonus on attack and damage rolls. Doing so is a swift action that deals 2 points of damage to the pain taster, does not require an attack roll, and bypasses any damage reduction the pain taster possesses. For 1 round, the pain taster gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage rolls. Every 3 levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th), the amount of damage the pain taster deals to herself increases by 2 and the resulting bonus she receives on damage rolls increase by 1 (to a maximum of 8 points of self-inflicted damage and 5 points of bonus damage to other targets at 10th level). At 7th level, the bonus on attack rolls gained when using this ability increases to +2.",
			"",
			"Scourge (Ex) Pain tasters are masters of torture, and at 1st level they receive Weapon Focus (whip) as a bonus feat. If the pain taster already has Weapon Focus (whip), she instead receives Whip Mastery as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"Cruelty (Ex) At 2nd level, a pain taster gains the sneak attack ability, but only when using a whip. This additional damage stacks with any sneak attack damage she possesses from other classes. The amount of damage dealt by cruelty increases by 1d6 every 2 pain taster levels thereafter.",
			"",
			"Damage Reduction (Ex) At 2nd level, the pain taster's incredible resilience grants her a modest amount of damage reduction (DR). Subtract 1 point from the damage she is dealt by any weapon or natural attack. The pain taster's damage reduction increases by 1 point every 2 pain taster levels thereafter. This ability stacks with any other damage reduction the pain taster might already have from other classes. The value of this damage resistance doubles when the pain taster is subject to nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"Blood Control (Ex) At 3rd level, the pain taster gains the ability to control the blood pressure throughout her body. Anytime the pain taster is dealt bleed damage, she reduces the amount of damage taken by 1 per pain taster level (minimum 0). When taking Constitution damage as a result of blood loss (such as a stirge or a vampire's bite), a pain taster reduces the amount of ability damage dealt by an amount equal to half the pain taster's class level (minimum 0).",
			"",
			"As an immediate action, a pain taster can delay the onset of injury or contact poisons by succeeding at a Will save. The DC of this check is equal to the poison's save DC. If the save is successful, the poison's initial and secondary damage are both delayed by 1 minute per pain taster level.",
			"",
			"Torturer's Mettle (Ex) At 3rd level, a pain taster can gain a number of temporary hit points equal to her pain taster level as a swift action. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute. This ability is a swift action that can be used once per day at 3rd level and an additional time per day every 3 levels thereafter (6th and 9th).",
			"",
			"Pain Mastery (Ex) At 5th level, when using her masochism ability, the pain taster can combine two of her daily routines into one. The pain taster must still selfinflict the combined amount of hit point damage for both routines, though she can perform both routines simultaneously in 1 hour. When she does so, she gains the benefits from both routines (a pair of +2 enhancement bonuses). To gain access to a second routine for the first time or to change out one of the paired routines, the pain taster must still perform the new routine's initial torture session in full, and must pay the cost for it.",
			"",
			"Exquisite Lash (Ex) At 7th level, a pain taster's aptitude with the whip increases. She receives Whip Mastery as a bonus feat. If the pain taster already has Whip Mastery, she instead receives Improved Whip Mastery as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"Sadism (Ex) At 9th level, a pain taster becomes worked into a frenzy when dealing damage to other targets. When she deals bonus damage to a target using her cruelty ability, she halves the number of points of damage she must self-inflict as part of her masochism ability until the end of her next turn."

			"",
			"**Deep Pockets (Ex):** A Pathfinder chronicler collects items as well as lore, picking up small amounts of this or that throughout her travels. As a result, she may carry unspecified equipment worth up to 100 gp per class level. This can be any kind of gear that can reasonably fit into a backpack, including potions and scrolls (but not any other sort of magic item). As a full-round action, the chronicler may dig through her pockets to retrieve an item she specifies at that time, deducting its value from the allocated amount of cost. This item cannot weigh more than 10 pounds. When the total remaining cost reaches 0, the chronicler can retrieve no more items until she refills her deep pockets by spending a few hours and an amount of gold to bring her total up to 100 gp per class level.",
			"",
			"In addition, if she takes 1 hour to pack her gear each day, she gains a +4 bonus to Strength to determine her light encumbrance. This does not affect her maximum carrying capacity. The efficient distribution of weight simply encumbers her less than the same amount of weight normally should. Finally, the Pathfinder chronicler gains a +4 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal small objects on her person.",
			"",
			"**Master Scribe (Ex):** A Pathfinder chronicler adds her class level as a bonus on all Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, as well as Use Magic Device checks involving scrolls or other written magical items. A Pathfinder chronicler can make Linguistics checks to decipher text as a full-round action and can always take 10 on Linguistics and Profession (scribe) checks, even if distracted or endangered.",
			"",
			"**Live to Tell the Tale (Ex):** At 2nd level, once per day per two class levels, a Pathfinder chronicler can attempt a new saving throw against any ongoing condition against which she failed a saving throw in a previous round, even if the effect is normally permanent. This ability has no effect on conditions that do not allow saving throws or against instantaneous effects.",
			"",
			"**Pathfinding (Ex):** Beginning at 2nd level, a Pathfinder chronicler develops an excellent sense of direction and skill at leading others through difficult terrain or by following ancient maps. A Pathfinder chronicler gains a +5 bonus on Survival checks made to avoid becoming lost and to Intelligence checks to escape a maze spell. In addition, she always uses the \"road or trail\" overland movement modifier even when in trackless terrain, whether on foot or mounted. With a DC 15 Survival check, the Pathfinder chronicler can extend this benefit to one companion per class level.",
			"",
			"**Bardic Performance (Su):** At 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler gains this ability, which functions like the bard class feature of the same name, except that the chronicler's effective bard level is 2 lower than her class level. Levels in this class stack with levels in any other class that grants a similar ability to determine her effective bard level.",
			"",
			"**Improved Aid (Ex):** Pathfinder chroniclers frequently serve as the companions of great heroes, standing by their sides and recording their deeds, but often lending a crucial helping hand. Starting at 3rd level, a Pathfinder chronicler using the aid another action grants a +4 bonus, rather than the normal +2.",
			"",
			"**Epic Tales (Su):** A 4th-level Pathfinder chronicler can inscribe a tale so evocative and so moving that it conveys the effects of bardic music through the written word. To create an epic tale requires the pathfinder chronicler to expend a number of rounds of her bardic performance ability equal to twice the duration of the epic tale (maximum duration of 10 rounds), and any relevant Performance skill check is made with Profession (scribe) instead. An epic tale affects only the reader, but it grants all the benefits that would normally apply for hearing a performance. A Pathfinder chronicler may apply the effects of any feats that affect bardic music to her epic tales. An epic tale retains its supernatural potency for 1 day per class level. It requires 1 hour to inscribe, a full-round action to activate, and has a duration equal to 1/2 the number of bardic performance rounds expended during its creation. Once activated, an epic tale's magic is consumed.",
			"",
			"**Whispering Campaign (Ex):** Pathfinder chroniclers influence the world through their control of information and ability to shape public perception. At 5th level, as a special use of bardic music, the Pathfinder chronicler can create the effect of a doom spell as cast by a sorcerer of her class level by denouncing a creature in person. This is a language-dependent effect.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, the chronicler can denounce a particular target (an individual or a definable group of creatures) to others. This form of bardic music creates the effect of the enthrall spell, but at the end of the performance all creatures who failed to save shift their attitude toward the target of the oration by one step (in the direction of the Pathfinder chronicler's choice) for 1 day per class level.",
			"",
			"**Inspire Action (Su):** As a special use of bardic music, a 6th-level Pathfinder chronicler can exhort any one ally within hearing to a sudden surge of action, allowing her ally to immediately take an extra move action. This does not count against the ally's number of actions on his own turn.",
			"",
			"At 9th level, she can enable an ally to immediately take a standard action instead.",
			"",
			"**Call Down the Legends (Su):** At 7th level, once per week as a full-round action, a Pathfinder chronicler can summon 2d4 4th-level human barbarians, as if she used a bronze horn of Valhalla; these summoned barbarians serve her with complete loyalty. The barbarians are constructs, not actual people (although they seem to be). They arrive with the normal starting equipment for barbarians and attack anyone the chronicler designates.",
			"",
			"**Greater Epic Tales (Su):** At 8th level, the Pathfinder chronicler's written word gains power. This ability functions like the chronicler's epic tales ability, except that if read aloud, the bardic music takes effect as if the author had used the ability, but the effects are targeted by the reader and use the reader's Charisma score where applicable.",
			"",
			"**Lay of the Exalted Dead (Su):** Once per week as a full-round action, a 10th-level Pathfinder chronicler can summon 1d4+1 5th-level human barbarians, as if she used an iron horn of Valhalla. The summoned barbarians serve her with complete and unquestioning loyalty. They are constructs, with the incorporeal subtype (they take 50% of the damage from corporeal sources, and no damage from nonmagical sources). They arrive wearing +2 studded leather and wielding +1 ghost touch greataxes (allowing them to deal full damage to corporeal creatures) and attack anyone the chronicler designates. To the chronicler and their allies, these exalted dead appear like a noble troop of spectral warriors. Her enemies, however, behold the terrible wrath of the ancient heroes and must succeed at Will saves or become shaken for 1 round per summoned barbarian (DC 15 + the Pathfinder chronicler's Charisma modifier)."

			"Not all Pathfinders are concerned with cataloging their exploits. Some are most at home treading ground untouched in years or even centuries, in search of the next challenge, the next dungeon, or the next ancient treasure. Pathfinder delvers prefer to leave the journaling to others and set off on a new grand adventure before the ink dries on the chronicles of their last. Often they're accompanied by a cohort or other companion who might not have the bravery (or foolhardiness) to go it alone on a grand adventure, but is more than willing to chronicle the exploits and adventures of another. For many in the Pathfinder Society, the delvers represent a frustrating combination-on the one hand, their eagerness to explore helps the Society reach areas and learn secrets that may otherwise go undiscovered. On the other hand, their tendency toward poor documentation worries many Society members, who fear that the bulk of what a delver might discover will go unreported.",
			"",
			"Pathfinder delvers run the gamut from dedicated archaeologists to thrill-seeking adventurers to unprincipled tomb robbers. Their choice of companionship is similarly varied; some travel with other Pathfinders, some take up with any who will join their quests, and some go it alone.

He can treat his trap sense bonus as if it were a favored enemy bonus against constructs, oozes, and undead; this bonus stacks with any favored enemy bonuses gained from ranger levels or similar class features.",

			"**Sneak Attack +1d6 (Ex):** This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. If the Pathfinder field agent gains a sneak attack bonus from another source, the bonuses on damage stack. A Pathfinder field agent must be at least 3rd level before selecting this training.",

			"**Trapfinding:** This training functions as the rogue class feature of the same name. Levels in Pathfinder field agent stack with levels from other classes that grant this ability for the purpose of determining a Pathfinder field agent's total trapfinding bonus.",
			"",
			"**Wayfinder Upgrade:** At 1st level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Pathfinder field agent can add an additional ability to her wayfinder. These abilities must be added to a standard wayfinder (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 299), not to a variant or modified wayfinder (though a Pathfinder field agent can possess more than one wayfinder at a time, if she chooses). If a Pathfinder field agent loses her upgraded wayfinder, she can purchase a new one at the normal cost plus 100 gp for each Pathfinder field agent level she possesses, keeping all previously selected upgrades. A Pathfinder field agent can choose from the listed wayfinder upgrades. Any upgrades that grant additional spell effects use the wayfinder's caster level or the Pathfinder field agent's class level (whichever is higher) to determine effects that depend on caster level.",

			"**Daylight:** Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can use her wayfinder to cast daylight. This upgrade can be selected more than once. Each additional time it's selected, the Pathfinder field agent gains another use of the spell per day.",
			"",
			"**Flask:** A hidden compartment is carved into the wayfinder's casing, allowing a single potion, oil, or dose of poison to be hidden within. This substance can be retrieved with a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity (as opposed to the normal move action required to retrieve a stored item). Drinking the potion or applying the oil or poison still requires a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The Pathfinder field agent gains a +2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks made to oppose the Perception check of someone observing or frisking her to detect items in the hidden compartment.",
			"",
			"**Hidden:** In order to hide her affiliation with the Pathfinder Society from potential enemies, a Pathfinder field agent with this upgrade can, three times per day, turn her wayfinder invisible and mask its magical aura as if it were under the effects of invisibility and magic aura. Each time this effect is used, it lasts for up to 1 hour per 2 class levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses (minimum 1 hour), and can be dismissed by the Pathfinder field agent as a move action.",
			"",
			"**Message:** In addition to the light spell-like ability, the wayfinder can be used to cast message at will.",
			"",

			"**Shielding:** Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can activate her wayfinder to gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC for a number of minutes equal to her Pathfinder field agent level. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the Pathfinder field agent possesses.",
			"",
			"",
			"**Silence:** Once per day, the Pathfinder field agent can use her wayfinder to emit an aura of silence, as the spell. The silence effect must be centered on the wayfinder. This upgrade can be selected more than once. Each additional time the upgrade is selected, the agent gains another use of the spell per day.",
			"",
			"**Stabilize:** The wayfinder can be used to cast stabilize at will.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Feat:** At 2nd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a Pathfinder field agent can select a bonus feat. Each of these bonus feats must be Skill Focus or a teamwork feat. The Pathfinder field agent must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.",
			"",
			"**Legends Uncovered (Su):** At 10th level, a Pathfinder field agent has the ability to uncover the secrets of the distant past. Once per day when studying or researching a person, place, or artifact of antiquity, the agent can dedicate herself to the task to gain benefits as though she were casting the spell legend lore."

			"Pathfinder savants are specialists in the theory and practice of magic, illuminating mysteries of the eldritch fabric that permeates existence. The path of the savant brings expertise in the lore of glyphs and sigils, knowledge of exotic spells, and the power to unlock the full potential of magical devices. This skill also makes savants quite valuable to adventuring parties, both in their mastery over ancient traps that utilize old magic and in their skill at identifying and utilizing magic items found in the field. Of course, with their focus on the intellectual portions of adventuring, Pathfinder savants are often ill-equipped to handle the tougher, more excruciating parts of a typical dungeon delve; melee combat, wrenching open stuck doors, and enduring dangerous and unhealthy environments are not the savant's forte. As a result, they rarely undertake solo missions, instead allying with wellrounded groups of fellow adventurers in order to interact with history and strange archaic wonders without dealing with the grislier portions of exploration all on their own. To the Pathfinder savant, this is merely a logical extension of their preferred role in exploration, but that doesn't protect them from periodic sneers and veiled insults from more physically focused companions. Of course, most such associates are quick to beg forgiveness when, inevitably, the savant is needed to decipher the workings of a strange magical device or to call upon their significant magical power to solve problems that cannot be dealt with through brawn alone.",

			"**Esoteric Magic (Ex):** At each class level beyond 1st, the Pathfinder savant chooses a spell from any class's spell list and thereafter treats that spell as if it were on the spell list of the base spellcasting class for which he has the most levels; if this base spellcasting class could not normally cast that spell, it is treated as 1 level higher than it is on the original class's spell list. If he could cast the spell using his base spellcasting class, the spell's level does not increase. The spell is cast as if its type (arcane, divine, or psychic) were that of his base spellcasting class, and save DCs function as normal for spells of that class. All other restrictions of his normal spellcasting class apply. This ability does not grant other spellcasters special allowance to prepare, cast, or use spell-trigger or spell-completion items of esoteric spells (such as a sorcerer using a cure light wounds scroll prepared by the Pathfinder savant).",
			"",
			"**Glyph-Finding (Ex):** At 2nd level, a Pathfinder savant can use Spellcraft to find writing-based magical traps (including glyphs, runes, sigils, and symbols) in the same way a rogue can use Perception to search for traps.",

Such a trap is not disabled, and if he leaves the trap's area and then reenters it, the trap can trigger again. A Pathfinder savant also receives this bonus on saving throws against the effects of such traps triggered by others.",
			"",
			"**Analyze Dweomer (Sp):** At 6th level, a Pathfinder savant can use analyze dweomer for up to 1 round per class level per day. He can use this ability in 1-round increments.",
			"",
			"**Silence Master (Su):** A 6th-level Pathfinder savant can to activate spell-trigger, spell-completion, and command-word items silently, substituting a magical gesture for the necessary words. He cannot use this ability in circumstances where he could not cast a spell with somatic components. He must know how to activate the item normally for this ability to work.

			"**Dispelling Master (Su):** At 7th level, if the Pathfinder savant prepares and casts spells like a wizard, he can spontaneously convert any 3rd-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into dispel magic or any 6th-level (or higher-level) prepared spell into greater dispel magic, as a good-aligned cleric converts prepared spells into cure spells. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds dispel magic and greater dispel magic to his list of spells known. Every time he successfully uses either of these spells to make a targeted dispel or counterspell, he heals a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect dispelled or counterspelled.",

Once per day as an immediate action, the Pathfinder savant can double the bonus granted by his sigil master ability when he attempts a saving throw against a symbol. He can activate this ability after he rolls the saving throw, but must do so before the results are revealed. A Pathfinder savant does not automatically fail a saving throw against a symbol effect on a natural 1.",

Once he's focused in this way, any spells he casts for the remainder of that round do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Spells with a duration of concentration that he casts in this round persist for a number of rounds after the Pathfinder savant ceases concentrating equal to his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).",
			"",
			"**Item Master (Su):** At 10th level, a Pathfinder savant can spend an hour focusing his energies on a single noncharged magic item that requires an action to activate. At the end of this hour, that item becomes attuned to the Pathfinder savant, and from that point on, that specific item can use the Pathfinder savant's caster level to resolve its effects rather than the item's caster level. A Pathfinder savant can change which item is attuned to him by repeating the attunement ritual, but he loses attunement to the previous item. A Pathfinder savant can have only one item attuned to him at a time."

When fighting a performance combat, the pit fighter can enter a rage (as per the barbarian class ability) during any round in which the crowd's attitude toward him is helpful. This is in addition to the normal bonuses the crowd's attitude provides. The pit fighter can maintain his rage each round so long as the crowd's attitude toward him remains helpful. If the crowd's attitude ever drops below helpful, the pit fighter's rage immediately ends (though if he possesses the rage ability from another class, he may expend a round of his rage to continue the effect as normal for that class feature).

			"**Spells:** A prophet of Kalistrade casts arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, but is limited to divination and enchantment spells. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To cast a spell, a prophet of Kalistrade must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level. His bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + the spell level + the caster's Charisma modifier (if any). His selection of spells is extremely limited-at each prophet of Kalistrade level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on the table on page 43. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, he can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows, provided the new spell is of the same level as the one he is replacing.",

At 6th level, he adds arcane lock and make whole to his spell list. At 8th level, he adds glibness and obscure object to his spell list. At 10th level, he adds discern lies and divination to his spell list.",

So long as the prophet wears 1,000 gp worth of purely decorative jewelry, clothing, or other adornments, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws. This bonus (and the necessary value of his accoutrements) increases as he gains levels, to +2 for 4,000 gp at 4th level, +3 for 9,000 gp at 7th level, and +4 for 16,000 gp at 10th level.",

If the spell has a material component cost, it is added to the base cost of this ability. Currency or gems used in this way must be on the prophet's person, and goods other than standard currency or precious gems cannot be sacrificed to use this ability.

The prophet must still find a spellcaster capable of casting the spell he desires (which usually means finding a large enough settlement), and must provide any expensive material components required by the spell at their full price.",
			"",
			"**Prophet's Chest (Sp):** At 8th level, a prophet of Kalistrade can hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane, as per the spell secret chest, except that the prophet does not need an expensive chest or replica-any chest will do. The prophet can summon the chest back to the Material Plane as a standard action up to three times per day. So long as the prophet accesses the chest once every month, it suffers no chance of being lost on the Ethereal Plane. A prophet of Kalistrade can have only one chest on the Ethereal Plane in this way.",

			"",

If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. Whenever he casts cure light wounds using this ability, the hit points healed are instead treated as temporary hit points that last 10 minutes per Razmiran priest level, although the subject of the spell does not notice this difference until the duration expires.

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence or Charisma modifier (whichever is higher). The hit points healed by this ability are treated as temporary hit points, and last for 10 minutes per Razmiran priest level. These hit points do not stack with themselves (although they do stack with those from cure light wounds cast using the first ritual class feature). This ability does not count for the purposes of meeting any prerequisites that call for the ability to channel energy. This ability cannot be used to harm undead creatures.",
			"",
			"**Master of Lies (Ex):** At 3rd level, a Razmiran priest adds his class level to any Bluff check made as part of a lie or deception. In addition, whenever he is subject to a spell or special ability that can discern whether or not he is telling the truth, he is automatically aware of such magic. He is not immune to such spells or abilities, but he can choose to remain silent or avoid answering questions.",
			"",
			"**Second Ritual (Su):** At 5th level, a Razmiran priest adds cure moderate wounds and spiritual weapon to one of his arcane spell lists, but treats them as if they were 3rd-level spells. If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. As with the first ritual, any hit points gained from cure moderate wounds are temporary hit points.

			"",
			"**Third Ritual (Su):** At 9th level, a Razmiran priest adds cure serious wounds and prayer to one of his arcane spell lists, but treats them as if they were 4th-level spells. If he is a spontaneous caster, they are also added to his list of spells known. As with the first ritual, any hit points gained from cure serious wounds are temporary hit points.

Whenever he uses false channel, he can spend two uses of that ability to heal damage to all living creatures in the area, instead of granting temporary hit points. In addition, when determining what spell trigger and spell completion magic items he can use, he acts as though all cleric spells were on his spell list. This makes it so that he does not need to make a Use Magic Device skill check when using such items, but he must still make Bluff skill checks when using False Casting with such spells."

			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A Red Mantis assassin is proficient with simple weapons, light martial weapons, and light armor, but not with shields. A Red Mantis assassin can cast Red Mantis assassin spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure.",
			"",
			"**Spells:** A Red Mantis assassin casts illusion and transmutation arcane spells drawn from the sorcerer and wizard spell lists. She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To cast a spell, she must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level, and her bonus spells are based on Charisma. Saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + the spell's level + the caster's Charisma modifier (if any). At each Red Mantis assassin level, she gains one or more new spells as indicated on the table below. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th level, she can learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, provided the new spell is of the same level as the one she is replacing.",
			"",
			"As she gains levels, a small number of additional spells that are not otherwise available to her are added to her list. She does not automatically learn these spells when they become available-they must be selected as part of her total spells known. At 2nd level, she adds obscuring mist and true strike to her spell list. At 4th level, she adds darkness and summon swarm to her spell list. At 6th level, she adds fog cloud and see invisibility to her spell list. At 8th level, she adds clairaudience/ clairvoyance and hold person to her spell list. At 10th level, she adds dimension door and modify memory to her spell list.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** This functions as the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt is +1d6 at 1st level and increases by 1d6 every 3rd level thereafter. If the Red Mantis assassin gets a sneak attack bonus from another source, the damage bonuses stack.",
			"",
			"**Sabre Fighting (Ex):** At 1st level, the Red Mantis assassin gains Weapon Specialization (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat and treats sawtooth sabres as a light weapon for all purposes, including being able to use a sawtooth sabre with Weapon Finesse. At 5th level, she gains Greater Weapon Focus (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat. At 7th level, she gains Greater Weapon Specialization (sawtooth sabre) as a bonus feat. She does not need to otherwise qualify for these feats by having the minimum number of fighter levels.",
			"",
			"**Prayer Attack (Su):** At 2nd level, a Red Mantis assassin learns her signature assassination style. To initiate a prayer attack, she holds her sawtooth sabre (or sabres) out, point down, and weaves the blade in the air. She must be within 30 feet of and visible to her victim. Beginning a prayer attack is a standard action that causes her victim to be fascinated unless he succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + the Red Mantis assassin's class level + her Charisma modifier; if she's wielding two sawtooth sabres, the DC increases by 2). The fascination effect is a mind-affecting effect. She can maintain the fascination effect by concentrating. The victim can attempt a new save to escape this fascination each time a threat (other than the fascinating assassin) appears. At any point after 3 rounds, she can deliver a coup de grace to the target, provided the target is still fascinated; the Red Mantis assassin maintains this fascination effect while delivering a coup de grace. Activating or concentrating to maintain a prayer attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Red Shroud (Su):** At 3rd level, a Red Mantis assassin can create a veil of red mist a number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum once per day) as a move action. The red shroud persists for 1 round per class level, granting the Red Mantis assassin a +1 dodge bonus to AC and fast healing equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). This mist cannot be dissipated by wind. If she is slain while this ability is active, she can choose whether to remain corporeal or to disintegrate into a cloud of red mist that leaves behind only her gear, depriving her enemies of access to her remains.",
			"",
			"**Summon Mantis (Sp):** Once per day at 4th level, a Red Mantis assassin can summon an advanced fiendish giant mantis, 1d3 fiendish giant mantises, or 1d4+1 giant mantises, as if using summon monster V. She can mentally direct the actions of these summoned vermin as a free action. All mantises summoned by this spell-like ability are blood red and gain no racial bonus on Stealth checks in forests.",
			"",
			"**Resurrection Sense (Su):** At 5th level, a Red Mantis assassin senses if a creature she has slain within the last year has been restored to life, as long as they are both on the same plane.",
			"",
			"**Mantis Form (Su):** At 6th level, a Red Mantis assassin can transform into a bloodred giant praying mantis once per day as a standard action, as if using vermin shape II (caster level equals her class level). In addition to the normal adjustments to Strength, Dexterity, and natural armor provided by this spell effect, she gains the giant mantis's darkvision 60 feet; its grab ability; and its lunge, mandibles, and sudden strike extraordinary abilities, but not its immunity to mind-affecting effects or its racial modifiers to Perception and Stealth. If she wields a magical sawtooth sabre in her hand when she transforms, the magical enhancements on that weapon apply to her corresponding claw attack-if she wields two of them, then the enhancements each apply to their respective claw attacks. As she gains levels, her mantis form gains additional powers, as detailed below.",
			"",
			"**Blood Mantis:** At 8th level, her claw attacks deal 1d6 points of bleed damage on a hit. She also gains damage reduction 5/good while in this form.",
			"",
			"**Death Mantis:** At 10th level, whenever she deals damage with a bite attack as part of her mandibles ability, she also inflicts 1 negative level. The save DC to remove each of these negative levels is equal to 20 + the Red Mantis assassin's Constitution modifier. Each negative level inflicted in this manner grants the Red Mantis assassin 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. In addition, her damage reduction increases to DR 10/good while in this form.",
			"",
			"**Fading (Su):** At 8th level, as an immediate action a number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1), the Red Mantis assassin can become ethereal for an instant as she is attacked by a weapon or is forced to attempt a Reflex saving throw. She must choose to activate this ability before the weapon's attack roll or the spell's effects are adjudicated. This grants the Red Mantis assassin a 50% chance to avoid taking damage from the attack or effect.",
			"",
			"**Mantis Doom (Sp):** At 9th level, a Red Mantis assassin can use creeping doom as a spell-like ability three times per day (with a caster level equal to her character level). This version of the spell summons swarms of venomous praying mantises, but the effects are otherwise the same as the spell."

When used this way, the summon monster spell is treated as though quickened to a swift action via the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, though its spell level is not increased, and it can be used only to counterspell.

These bonuses stack with similar bonuses from other classes, but unlike with a ranger's abilities, these bonuses do not escalate when new enemies or terrains are selected.",

			"**Planar Channel (Su):** At 2nd level, a Riftwarden can channel baneful energies against creatures with the extraplanar subtype, regardless of alignment or plane of origin, as the cleric's channel energy ability. The Riftwarden deals damage as a cleric of a level equal to her highest caster level. This energy can only harm, not heal. This ability cannot be used with feats, magic items, or other effects that modify channel energy. A Riftwarden can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her bonus for the relevant ability of the spellcasting class she selected.",
			"",
			"**Eradication (Su):** At 3rd level, a Riftwarden gains a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws against the spells and spell-like, supernatural, and extraordinary abilities of outsiders. In addition, she increases by 1 the save DC and caster level of any spell or spell-like or supernatural ability that she uses against outsiders, or that counters, dispels, or prevents planar travel or teleportation. These bonuses increase by +1 for every three levels after 3rd.",
			"",
			"**Counterport (Su):** At 4th level, a Riftwarden can ready an action to counterspell a teleportation effect that allows a creature to enter or exit an area within 30 feet of her. She can use Spellcraft to identify a teleportation effect immediately as creatures arrive and can counter the teleportation effect with an identical spell or with any conjuration spell of at least 1 spell level higher, returning teleporting creatures to their point of origin.",
			"",
			"**Planar Scourge (Su):** At 5th level, an extraplanar creature that fails its save against the Riftwarden's planar channel gains the panicked, sickened, or staggered condition, chosen by the Riftwarden, for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Improved Counterport (Su):** At 7th level, a Riftwarden can use her counterport ability to forcibly redirect a creature using a teleportation effect within 30 feet to a new valid destination within 30 feet of her. The wrenching redirection deals 1d6 points of damage per class level to the redirected creature. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the Riftwarden's character level + the Riftwarden's Cha modifier) halves the damage and negates the redirection. In addition, when a conjuration effect causes a creature to appear in a square threatened by the Riftwarden, that creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the Riftwarden.",
			"",
			"**Planar Purge (Su):** At 8th level, an extraplanar creature that fails its save against a Riftwarden's planar channel is banished to its home plane (as the banishment spell; no save). Extraplanar creatures with Hit Dice greater than twice the Riftwarden's class level are unaffected by this ability, but still take damage from planar channel as normal.",
			"",
			"**Greater Counterport (Su):** At 10th level, a Riftwarden can counter a teleportation effect as an immediate action, without the need to ready an action beforehand. In addition, as a full-round action, the Riftwarden can expend two uses of her planar channel ability to forcibly recall a creature that used teleportation to exit an area within 30 feet of the Riftwarden since the end of the Riftwarden's last turn. Planar channel deals damage equal to the amount normally dealt by one use of planar channel. This damage affects only that target, and affects it regardless of its current distance from the Riftwarden. If the target fails its save, the teleportation effect is reversed and the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied by another creature)."

Once per day when casting a ritual as the primary caster, the ritualist can reduce the casting time from 10 minutes per ritual level to 1 round per ritual level, or from 1 hour per ritual level to 1 minute per ritual level.

This original lore is all but lost, but within the city-states of Varisia (particularly in Magnimar), a small order of spellcasters seeks to reclaim the knowledge of those empowering virtues. With the might of virtuous runes, they protect their homes from the lingering evil of Thassilon and look to the guidance of Soralyon, the Mystic Angel, to aid them in their quest.

He must still provide the spell to be made permanent by other means, of course. Although a runeguard can use this ability once per day, he can only ever maintain a single spell effect, and upon using this ability, the previous permanent spell effect immediately ends."

			"Torag is thought of by many as a god of forging, but his primary areas of concern also include protection and strategy. Among the followers of Torag, some feel drawn to devote themselves to these later aspects of the Father of Creation. Known as sacred sentinels, these holy warriors view themselves as mortal shields of defense in Torag's service, and seek to place themselves where defenders are most needed. Many speak of themselves as pillars, strong structures that can hold up a vast building but only by supporting the other beams and supports needed. The pillar is the source of the strength, but its strength must serve to support a network of other beams or it accomplishes little.",
			"",
			"Sacred sentinels are always front-line combatants, and value mobility to ensure they can reach the places they are most needed. As a result they are most often cavaliers (especially of the order of the dragon, the order of the guard from Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Combat, or the order of the shield) or paladins with a mount as a divine bond. The majority of sacred sentinels are dwarves, but other races that worship Torag are sometimes called to serve. For example, in the frozen Lands of the Linnorm Kings, there exists a relatively obscure but long-standing order known as the \"Linnorm Guard.\" This small number of Ulfen fighters are unusually lawful in their outlook, considering the brutality and chaos their barbaric kin often embrace. The Linnorm Guard seeks to provide protection for both the Linnorm Kings and those they have allied with, be they visiting dignitaries, old but beloved boon companions, or even hidden lovers or paramours.",

Though not all sacred sentinels are paladins, they all must follow the paladin's code of Torag (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 150). Cavaliers who become sacred sentinels are given special dispensation by their cavalier orders to act as agents of Torag within their orders, and treat Torag's paladin code of conduct as their cavalier's edict (replacing the normal edicts for their orders).",
			"",
			"A sacred sentinel who violates this code loses all class features of this prestige class other than skill points and class skills for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Strategic Protection (Su):** As a move action, a sacred sentinel can establish a magic aura that protects one or more of her allies. When she establishes her aura, she selects a number of allies up to her Charisma bonus that she can see and that are within 20 feet. As long as these allies remain within 30 feet of the sacred sentinel, they gain a +3 bonus to their CMDs and on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying. The bonus increases to +4 at 4th level, to +5 at 7th level, and to +6 at 10th level. The radius of this aura increases by 10 feet at each of these levels. The bonuses from strategic protection last until the beginning of the sacred sentinel's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Renewed Bonds (Ex):** At 2nd level, a sacred sentinel is able to maintain strong bonds from her life before becoming a divine guardian. If the sacred sentinel has levels in a class with an animal companion, familiar, or a class feature with \"bond\" in the name (such as arcane bond, divine bond, or sacred bond), she selects one such class upon gaining her 1st level of sacred sentinel. Sacred sentinel levels stack with levels in the selected class when determining the effectiveness of her familiar, animal companion, or bond class feature. Whenever the sacred sentinel uses strategic protection, her familiar, animal companion, or bonded companion is automatically included in its protection if in range, without counting toward the maximum number of creatures the sacred sentinel can affect.",
			"",
			"A sacred sentinel without an appropriate class feature from another class instead increases the number of creatures she can protect with her bastion of protection by 1 upon gaining this class feature, and by another 1 at 6th level.",
			"",
			"If the sacred sentinel has cavalier, paladin, or warpriest class levels, she selects one of those classes and adds half her sacred sentinel level to those class levels to determine her effective class level for a specific class feature. For cavaliers, this determines the effectiveness of her challenge class feature. For paladins, this determines the effectiveness of her smite evil class feature. For warpriests, this determines how many times per day she can use her blessings.",
			"",
			"**Healing Touch (Su):** At 3rd level, a sacred sentinel can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by her touch. Each day, she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + 1/2 her sacred sentinel level. If she has established her strategic protection, she can use this ability on a selected ally within range of the aura without having to successfully touch the ally. This ability restores 3d8 hit points, increasing to 4d8 at 6th level, and 5d8 at 9th level. Healing touch qualifies as the lay on hands ability for the purpose of prerequisites requiring lay on hands, and abilities that work with lay on hands (such as mercies).",
			"",
			"**Tempering Touch (Su):** A sacred sentinel knows that the best way to defend allies is to temper them to be stronger. At 3rd level, when a sacred sentinel uses a spell or class feature (but not a magic item or the Heal skill) to heal an ally, the ally gains a defensive bonus. For a number of rounds equal to the sacred sentinel's class level, whenever the ally fights defensively, uses the full defense action, or uses Combat Expertise, the ally gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level and to +3 at 9th level.",
			"",
			"**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 5th level, a sacred sentinel gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She gains uncanny dodge, as per the rogue class feature. If the character gains uncanny dodge from another class, she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (as per the rogue talent).",
			"",
			"**Swift Shield Other (Sp):** At 8th level, a sacred sentinel can use shield other as a quickened spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum once per day).",
			"",
			"**Unyielding (Su):** At 10th level, a sacred sentinel's devotion to protecting those under her charge is great enough to temporarily hold off death. If the sacred sentinel has her strategic protection active and is killed through any means, she does not immediately die. Instead she remains alive and active until the beginning of her next turn, at which point she dies normally. Breath of life, if applied before this time runs out, can save the sacred sentinel, but other healing effects that restore hit points cannot hold off death."

At 7th level, a sanguine angel gains a +4 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks against targets of the same creature type as the sanguine angel. Once per day, the sanguine angel can use dominate person as a spell-like ability (CL = her character level).",

She gains fire resistance 30, telepathy with a range of 50 feet, and the see in darkness universal monster ability.

			"",
			"**Obedience (Ex):** In order to maintain the abilities granted by this prestige class, a sentinel must perform a daily obedience to his chosen deity (see page 10).",
			"",
			"**Symbolic Weapon (Su):** When wielding his deity's favored weapon, the sentinel gains a +1 sacred or profane bonus on attack and damage rolls. These bonuses increase by 1 for every 3 levels he has in the sentinel prestige class (maximum +4). His deity's favored weapon also functions as a holy (or unholy) symbol when wielded by a sentinel.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Feat:** At 2nd level and again at 7th level, the sentinel gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. Sentinel levels stack with fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats with a fighter level prerequisite. If the bonus feat selected requires the sentinel to select a specific weapon for the feat to apply to (such as Greater Weapon Focus), the sentinel must select his deity's favored weapon.",
			"",
			"**Divine Boon:** As the sentinel gains levels, he gains boons from his chosen deity. The nature of these boons varies depending on the sentinel's chosen deity. Each deity grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the sentinel gains the first boon. At 6th level, he gains the second boon, and at 9th level, he gains the third boon. Consult the Deific Obedience feat on page 210 and the core deity descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these divine boons. When a divine boon grants a spell-like ability, the sentinel's caster level for the spell-like ability equals his total character level. This ability allows a sentinel to access these boons earlier than with the Deific Obedience feat alone; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.",
			"",
			"**Divine Quickness (Ex):** Starting at 4th level, so long as the sentinel carries his deity's favored weapon, he gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on initiative checks. The weapon doesn't need to be carried in hand, but must at least be on his person and accessible enough that he can wield it with no greater than a move action. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +4.",
			"",
			"**Aligned Strike (Su):** The sentinel's righteous fervor allows him to cut through certain types of damage reduction. At 5th level, the sentinel gains the ability to bypass a specific type of damage reduction when wielding his deity's favored weapon. The type of damage reduction his weapon bypasses is based on his chosen deity's alignment. The sentinel chooses this type of damage reduction when he gains this ability and this choice can't be changed. He can choose only one of the aligned weapon types regardless of how many options he has based on his deity's alignment. For example, a sentinel of Iomedae can treat his weapon as axiomatic or holy, but not both. The choices are as follows.",
			"",
			"**Lawful:** The sentinel can treat his weapon as axiomatic if his deity is lawful.  ",
			"**Chaotic:** The sentinel can treat his weapon as anarchic if his deity is chaotic.  ",
			"**Good:** The sentinel can treat his weapon as holy if his deity is good.  ",
			"**Evil:** The sentinel can treat his weapon as unholy if his deity is evil.  ",
			"**Neutral:** The sentinel can choose one of the four other weapon alignment types if his deity is neutral.",
			"",
			"**Stalwart (Su):** At 5th level, the sentinel gains mental fortitude through his constant meditation and adherence to religious tenets. He gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws to resist divine spells.",
			"",
			"**Practiced Combatant (Ex):** At 7th level, the sentinel displays increased combat ability thanks to his extensive training and experience. He gains a +2 sacred or profane bonus on combat maneuvers he performs with his deity's favored weapon.",
			"",
			"**Righteous Leader (Ex):** At 8th level, the sentinel's commitment to his faith and the deeds he does in the name of his god add to his reputation. He gains Leadership as a bonus feat, and is considered to qualify for that feat's special power leadership modifier. He takes no penalty for moving around a lot (normally this imposes a -1 penalty to a character's leadership score) but he takes double the usual penalty for recruiting a cohort of a different alignment (-2 instead of -1).",
			"",
			"**Unstoppable Warrior (Su):** At 10th level, the sentinel becomes a stalwart paragon demonstrating incredible combat prowess. He gains damage reduction based on the alignment of his deity, as shown in the table.",

			"In addition, the sentinel no longer falls unconscious when reduced to a negative hit point total, though he can take only a single standard or move action while at negative hit points, and he continues to lose hit points normally if he is not stabilized. Taking standard actions after becoming stable causes the sentinel's wounds to reopen, and he begins losing hit points normally again.",

			"Once the Shackles pirate activates her shipmind, she can feel the ship as if it were an extension of her body. She can \"see\" from the ship anywhere she wants, and adjusting her point of view is a free action.

She and her ship can move forward and backward, make right angle turns, and come to a dead stop, despite the ship's size or the weather conditions.",

She may end the shipmind effect as an immediate action. This ability lasts for 1 round per class level.",

			"**Sure Shot:** A shieldmarshal reduces his miss chance with firearms due to concealment, blink, blur, or similar effects by 5% per two shieldmarshal levels (to a maximum reduction of 25% at 10th level). He must still target the correct square to hit a creature with concealment. This judgment can't decrease his miss chance to lower than 0%.",

In addition, within the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar, he gains a bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks equal to 1/2 his shieldmarshal level if he openly displays his shieldmarshal's badge.",
			"",
			"**Labyrinthine Cunning (Ex):** At 3rd level, a shieldmarshal never becomes lost in urban terrain, and he never takes penalties to movement for poor visibility in urban terrain, even while temporarily blinded. A shieldmarshal can open or close doors as a swift action instead of a move action.",
			"",
			"**Urban Commando (Ex):** At 5th level, a shieldmarshal treats urban areas as his favored terrain, as the ranger class feature. At 10th level, his favored terrain bonus increases to +4 but he does not gain a second favored terrain. If he already has a favored terrain bonus in urban terrain from another class, these bonuses stack but do not affect bonuses in other terrain types.",
			"",
			"**Gunhunter (Ex):** A shieldmarshal is well versed in covert operations, especially in urban settings. At 6th level, the shieldmarshal can move through crowds and difficult terrain without impediment in urban terrain. He can use Stealth to hide in urban terrain even without cover or concealment; if he has cover or concealment, he gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1/2 his class level.",
			"",
			"**Double Jeopardy (Ex):** At 8th level, whenever a shieldmarshal uses his legal judgment ability, he selects two different judgments, instead of one. This consumes only one use of his legal judgment ability. As a swift action, he can change one of these effects to another type.",

He can expend one use of his legal judgment ability to create a nonmagical effect equivalent to discern lies (caster level equal to his class level; DC = 20 + the shieldmarshal's Wisdom modifier), or expend one use as part of an initiative check or Charisma-based skill check to take 20 on that check."

			"Perhaps no event so shaped dwarven history or culture as the legendary Quest for Sky. Spurred by the words of their prophets, the ancient dwarves abandoned their homes deep within the subterranean realm of Nar-Voth and began the perilous search for the sky over 5 millennia ago. For 300 years, the dwarves fought their way upward, driving their hated enemies-the orcs' before them. When they finally breached the surface, these legendary heroes built 10 grand fortresses across the face of Golarion-the 10 magnificent Sky Citadels.",

Four of the fabled Sky Citadels were lost to history or destroyed, and a fifth is now held by the orc hordes in the Hold of Belkzen.

			"",
			"Those dwarves who commit themselves to making this dream a reality are known as the skyseekers. They travel the width and breadth of Avistan as well as Garund, unearthing every scrap of dwarven history and lore they can find. Many form expeditions to explore the dwarven ruins left behind by their ancestors during the migration, often battling the foul creatures that lurk beneath Golarion's surface in their search for knowledge.

When wielded by the skyseeker against a creature with the giant, goblin, or orc subtype, the weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful hit. As a free action, the skyseeker may also identify the weapon by name when making an Intimidate check against such creatures, granting him a competence bonus on his Intimidate check equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1).",

			"",
			"**Citadel Keeper (Sp):** A skyseeker has spent so much time studying the known Sky Citadels that he has memorized their locations by heart. He can determine the direction to the nearest known Sky Citadel at will, as though using the spell know direction.",
			"",
			"**Rune-Carved Armor (Su):** At 2nd level, a skyseeker learns how to imbue his armor with a small semblance of the magical resistance his dwarven ancestors were renowned for. Against spells and spell-like abilities, he gains a deflection bonus to touch AC equal to his armor bonus. This bonus can't exceed his skyseeker level. This ability functions only while the skyseeker wears armor.",
			"",
			"**Commune (Sp):** At 3rd level, a skyseeker's bond with the spirits of his ancestors grows stronger, allowing him to use the spell commune once per week as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to the skyseeker's class level). Dwarven Armor Training (Ex): By studying the arts of his ancestors, the skyseeker learns the secret techniques of his forebears' forges and fighting styles. At 4th level, the skyseeker gains heavy armor proficiency, and he still benefits from his ranger combat style (if he has one) while wearing heavy armor.",
			"",
			"**Darkvision (Ex):** At 5th level, a skyseeker grows more comfortable operating in the lightless depths of the dwarven ancestral homelands. He gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. At 7th level, the range of the skyseeker's darkvision increases by an additional 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Runes of Resistance (Su):** At 6th level, a skyseeker can use his armor to shrug off all manner of magical attacks for a short period of time. As a move action, the skyseeker can gain spell resistance equal to 5 + his Hit Dice if wearing light armor or 10 + his Hit Dice if wearing medium or heavy armor. Dismissing this ability is a swift action. A skyseeker can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his class level. These rounds need not be consecutive.",
			"",
			"**Paths of the Ancients (Ex):** Other labyrinths pale in comparison to the tangled maze of tunnels left behind by the ancient sky-seeking dwarves. At 8th level, a skyseeker gains immunity to the maze spell and cannot become lost while exploring subterranean environments.",
			"",
			"**Stalwart (Ex):** At 9th level, a skyseeker has honed his mental resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the skyseeker is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless skyseeker does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.",
			"",
			"**Call to Arms (Sp):** At 10th level, a skyseeker grows so attuned with the spirits of his ancestors that he can channel them into the physical world to battle his enemies. Once per day as a full-round action, he can summon up to 1d4+1 ghostly dwarven allies, who must appear within 60 feet of the skyseeker. These dwarves function exactly as an ally produced by the spell spiritual ally (caster level equal to the skyseeker's class level), except that they always appear as dwarves wielding warhammers and they share the skyseeker's favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses (if any). On subsequent turns the skyseeker can direct a single dwarven ally to move as a swift action, or he can direct multiple allies to move simultaneously as a move action."

			"**Forensic Thaumaturgy (Su):** A Sleepless detective can cast detect magic at will as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to her class level). When using detect magic (or spells that function as detect magic, such as arcane sight), the detective treats recently ended magical effects as though they were one category stronger when determining how long a lingering aura remains, and by concentrating for an additional round can determine exactly how long the lingering aura has been there (effectively allowing the Sleepless detective to learn when the spell or magic item that caused the aura was cast or destroyed, respectively).",

			"",
			"**Follow Clues (Ex):** At 2nd level, a Sleepless detective can use Perception to follow tracks as per the Survival skill, as though she possessed the follow clues rogue talent (Advanced Player's Guide 130). If the detective already has this ability from another class, she can move at her normal speed while tracking with the Perception skill without taking the usual -5 penalty on her Perception checks.",

			"**Eye for Detail (Ex):** At 4th level, a Sleepless detective's keen eye for detail helps her notice hidden traps, doors, and clues. The detective is entitled to an immediate Perception check to notice such features whenever she passes within 10 feet of them, whether or not she is actively looking. This check should be made in secret by the GM. If the detective would already receive such a check because of an ability from some other source (such as the trap spotter rogue talent), the GM should roll the Perception check twice whenever the Sleepless detective is within 10 feet of a trap and use the higher result.",
			"",
			"**Hematomancy (Sp):** At 5th level, a Sleepless detective learns to extract information from blood and other bodily fluids through extensive alchemical analysis. The detective can use the spell blood biography three times per day (caster level equal to her class level). When using this ability, any type of bodily fluid or part of a creature's body will suffice in place of blood.",
			"",
			"**Thoughtful Reexamining (Ex):** At 6th level, a Sleepless detective can reach new conclusions by reexamining the facts of her investigation. This functions as the advanced rogue talent of the same name (Advanced Player's Guide 132). If the detective has the thoughtful reexamining ability from another class, she can use the ability one additional time per day.",
			"",
			"**Discern Lies (Sp):** At 7th level, a Sleepless detective can use discern lies, as the spell, for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level (caster level equal to her class level). These rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is an immediate action.",
			"",
			"**Predictive Riposte (Ex):** At 8th level, a Sleepless detective's insight into human nature allows her to predict and counter her opponents' attacks. As a standard action, she can designate an opponent within 30 feet as the target of her predictive riposte, gaining a +4 insight bonus to AC against that opponent's attacks. Once per round, after a melee attack from the designated target misses her, the detective can spend an immediate action to make a single melee attack against that opponent as long as it is within her threatened area. This counts as her attack of opportunity for this round. If the detective's attack hits, she may add her sneak attack bonus on her damage roll. The bonuses from this ability last until the end of combat, or until the detective designates a new target of her predictive riposte.",
			"",
			"**Pierce Deception (Sp):** At 9th level, a Sleepless detective can see as though under the effect of the spell true seeing for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level (caster level equal to her class level). These rounds need not be consecutive. Activating this ability is a free action.",
			"",
			"**Reconstruction (Su):** At 10th level, once per day a Sleepless detective can combine her investigative insight with her magical senses to mentally reconstruct the recent history of an item or place. The detective must be able to examine the item or area for 10 minutes, after which she can view the events of the past 24 hours as though she had a scrying sensor present when those events took place. This ability shows her any events which took place within 60 feet of the examined area, or any creature or object that physically touched the item or area in question. Her vision is not obstructed by concealment, and she can see and identify magical auras as though under the effect of arcane sight. A reconstruction shows creatures and objects as they actually are, unobscured by even powerful illusion magic such as screen, though transmuted creatures and objects appear in their altered forms."

He does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained, except for additional spells per day, spells known (if he's a spontaneous caster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If he had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a soul warden, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for the purpose of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Channel Damage (Su):** At 1st level, a soul warden gains the power to harm undead with positive energy. This ability functions exactly like a cleric's ability to channel positive energy to deal damage to undead (but not to heal living creatures), and counts as channel energy for the purposes of qualifying for feats or determining effects that rely on channel energy. A soul warden uses his class level as his effective cleric level when channeling damage. He can channel damage a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Soul warden levels stack with levels in any class that grants channel energy for the purpose of determining the number of damage dice his channel energy ability deals to undead (if any).",

			"**Channel Casting (Su):** At 2nd level, a soul warden can expend a use of his channel damage ability to spontaneously cast from a select group of spells. At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, a soul warden gains access to a number of additional spells he can cast in this manner. The spells a soul warden can cast with this ability (and the soul warden level necessary to cast such spells) are listed below.",

			"**Bonus Feats:** At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter, a soul warden gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be chosen from the following: Channel Smite, Ectoplasmic Spell, Greater Channel Smite, Quick Channel, Threnodic Spell, Turn Undead, and Undead Master. The soul warden must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus feat.",
			"",
			"**Harvest (Su):** At 4th level, whenever a soul warden destroys an undead creature using channel positive energy, channel damage, or a spell with an instantaneous duration, he regains a use of channel damage. A soul warden can regain only one use of channel damage per round, and can regain a number of uses of channel damage per day up to his class level. A soul warden cannot use this to exceed his maximum number of uses of channel damage per day.",
			"",
			"**Undead Imposition (Su):** At 5th level, as a standard action a soul warden may expend one use of channel damage to control an undead creature within 30 feet. The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the soul warden's level + the soul warden's Cha modifier). Failure means the creature falls under the soul warden's control, obeying his commands to the best of its ability for a number of rounds equal to the soul warden's class level. This ability is otherwise identical to control undead.",
			"",
			"**Negative Energy Ward (Su):** At 7th level, once per day a soul warden can ward a 15-foot-radius area centered on himself to protect it against undead incursions. Any undead creatures with fewer Hit Dice than his caster level cannot enter the warded area. Undead with Hit Dice greater than or equal to the soul warden's caster level must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + soul warden's level) when entering the area. An undead that succeeds at its save is unharmed, and is immune to the soul warden's negative energy ward for 24 hours. Failure means the creature takes 3d6 points of positive energy damage when it enters the area and it becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once placed, a negative energy ward cannot be moved. The ward lasts 1 minute per soul warden level.",
			"",
			"**Necrotic Resistance (Su):** At 8th level, a soul warden becomes resistant to ability drain and negative levels. Whenever a soul warden is targeted by an effect that would result in ability drain or impose negative levels, he takes 1 point of ability drain fewer and gains 1 negative level fewer than he normally would (to a minimum of 0). At 10th level, he takes 2 fewer points of ability drain and gains 2 fewer negative levels than he normally would.",
			"",
			"**Life Shell (Sp):** At 10th level, a soul warden can create a dome of energy that repels undead creatures. This ability functions identically to antilife shell, except it hedges out only undead creatures and not creatures of any other type. Living creatures within the affected area gain fast healing 1 for the duration of the effect. A soul warden can activate this spell-like ability for up to 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be expended in 1-minute increments."

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an souldrinker, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for the purposes of determining spells per day.",
			"",
			"**Apocalyptic Vow (Ex):** At 1st level, the souldrinker must select one of the Four Horsemen or a daemon harbinger to which she makes an apocalyptic vow. When a souldrinker dies, the entity to which she made her apocalyptic vow claims her soul. A character attempting to resurrect a slain souldrinker must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the souldrinker's character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the souldrinker again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do.

			"",
			"**Cacodaemon Familiar (Ex):** At 1st level, the souldrinker gains a cacodaemon familiar, as if she had the Improved Familiar feat. If the souldrinker already has a familiar, the cacodaemon replaces that familiar by devouring the prior familiar (this does not penalize the souldrinker).

This ceremony is incorporated into whatever method the souldrinker uses to regain spellcasting abilities (such as meditating, praying to a demigod, or studying a spellbook). When a character takes her first level of souldrinker, she must decide whether she is an evangelist, an exalted, or a sentinel of her daemonic patron. This choice determines which category of boons she earns as she gains levels, and once made, it cannot later be changed.",
			"",

Her soul pool starts at 0, and at any one time, it can contain a maximum number of soul points equal to her souldrinker level. Every time a souldrinker inflicts a negative level on a creature other than herself, she gains 1 soul point. A souldrinker can expend soul points for the following.",

Protect Soul: A souldrinker can spend soul points to avoid gaining a negative level, at a rate of 1 soul point per negative level negated.",
			"",
			"**Daemonic Boon (Ex, Sp, or Su):** As a souldrinker gains levels, she gains boons from her patron as her body and soul become increasingly infused with daemonic energies. The nature of the boons granted varies, depending on the souldrinker's chosen patron and which category of boon she elects to embody. Each Horseman or harbinger grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the souldrinker gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third and final boon. Consult the Fiendish Obedience feat on page 178 and the Horseman and harbinger descriptions in Chapter 1 for details on these boons. When a souldrinker boon grants a spell-like ability, her caster level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a souldrinker to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally. Lesser Oblivion (Su): At 4th level, a souldrinker's apocalyptic vow invests her with a specific ability, depending on which Horseman she made her vow to, as listed below:",

Starting a starsong performance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. If the sphere singer has bardic performance, she can also start bardic performances as a move action instead of a standard action. A starsong performance cannot be disrupted, but ends immediately if the sphere singer is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, silenced, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A starsong performance counts as a bardic performance for the purpose of determining how many performances the sphere singer can have in effect at one time. A starsong performance has audible components but not visual components. At 7th level, a sphere singer can start a starsong performance or a bardic performance as a swift action. The save DC against a sphere singer's performance is equal to 10 + the sphere singer's level + her Charisma modifier.",

			"",
			"**Sweet Dreams:** At 3rd level, the sphere singer can spend 5 minutes performing and expend 5 rounds of starsong to protect sleepers. Any creature that remains within 30 feet of the sphere singer during the entire 5 minute performances becomes immune to nightmare and other effects that attack a sleeping target, such as a night hag's dream haunting ability, for one night's rest. In addition, those creatures gain the benefits of dream feast (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 232).",
			"",
			"**Butterfly:** At 5th level, the sphere singer's music lets her explore the skies. While she maintains this starsong, she gains the benefits of fly. Alternately, by spending 5 minutes performing and expending 10 rounds of starsong performance, she can gain the benefits of overland flight. Both of these effects manifest at a caster level equal to the sphere singer's total Hit Dice. While under either effect, the sphere singer grows large butterfly wings.",
			"",
			"**Guide My Steps:** At 7th level, the sphere singer learns to use song as a guide to her goal. To use this starsong, she must spend 3 rounds performing and expend 6 rounds of starsong performance. At the end of this performance, the sphere singer gains the benefits of find the path at a caster level equal to her character level.",

At the GM's discretion, the sphere singer may be guided to something particularly interesting, such as a new romantic opportunity, a good place to watch the sunset, or an exotic monster's den; otherwise, she merely wanders aimlessly until the effects end.",
			"",
			"**Fortune's Favor:** At 9th level, the sphere singer's song is so lively and delightful that Desna herself takes notice, blessing her with peerless luck. While she maintains this starsong, whenever the sphere singer rolls a d20 (but no more often than once per round), she can roll twice and take the more favorable result.",
			"",
			"**Versatile Performance (Ex):** At 2nd and 6th levels, the sphere singer gains versatile performance, as per the bard class feature. The sphere singer can choose only Perform (sing) or Perform (dance); once she has already chosen both of these, she can instead gain any other versatile performance. When the sphere singer gains this ability, she can retrain ranks in the associated skills at no cost.",

This functions as dream, except that the sphere singer must be very familiar with the recipient. Many sphere singers keep contact with distant family or lovers this way. At 6th level, this effect allows the recipient to enter the sphere singer's dreamscape, as per dream council (as if the recipient had cast dream in response).",
			"",
			"At 8th level, instead of contacting a familiar person, the sphere singer can travel to a creature's dream and leave a suggestion. This functions as demand, but modifying dream instead of sending. When used this way, the normal restrictions on dream's recipient apply. The sphere singer chooses which of these abilities to use (if any) when she goes to sleep.",
			"",
			"**Tapestry Traveler (Ex, Sp):** At 10th level, the sphere singer transcends mortality like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis, her essence infused with stardust and unearthly energies. Her type changes to fey, and she grows large butterfly wings, gaining a fly speed of 50 feet (good). In addition, she becomes immune to cold and gains the no breath universal monster ability."

For example, if she sets her landmark in Magnimar and later travels to Korvosa, she can determine that Magnimar is roughly west of her current location. The landmark doesn't have to be a city or any kind of recognizable site-it could be in the middle of the ocean or even midair. This is a scrying effect. A landmark location is one category more familiar for the purpose of teleporting (\"studied carefully\" becomes \"very familiar\" and so on). A spherewalker can have one landmark per class level. She can discard an existing landmark as a standard action and does not need to be at that location to discard it. Spherewalkers can take a minute to share a landmark with another spherewalker, and often do so to arrange meetings in unusual places without the need for maps or directions. A spherewalker can only detect the location of landmarks on her current plane, though they do not vanish if she leaves the plane and she can reference them if she returns to that plane.",
			"",
			"**Longstrider (Sp):** At 1st level, a spherewalker may use longstrider once per day. Her caster level is equal to her character level.",
			"",
			"**Spells per Day:** When a spherewalker gains a level, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of spherewalker to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.",

Her caster level is equal to twice her class level. With each new spherewalker level, she gains a new spell slot for a spell level equal to her class level. A 5th-level spherewalker would thus have a spell slot for one domain spell from 1st to 5th level spells. The number of bonus spells and spell save DCs are set by the spherewalker's Wisdom score.",

			"**Efficient Sleep (Su):** At 2nd level, a spherewalker gains a +4 sacred bonus to resist sleep effects and only needs 4 hours of sleep (or restful calm, for creatures that do not need actual sleep) instead of the normal 8 hours to become rested. Most spherewalkers prefer to sleep the normal amount, and if they use this ability they like to make up for it on later days by sleeping late.",

			"**Star Slinger (Ex):** At 2nd level, any starknife a spherewalker uses in combat is treated as if it had the returning magic weapon special ability. Such weapons gain no additional enhancement bonuses or magical properties beyond this effect.",
			"",
			"**Dream Link (Sp):** A 3rd-level spherewalker can form a mental bond with another willing intelligent creature as if using the telepathic bond spell. To do so, she and the target must spend at least 4 hours sleeping within 10 feet of each other. Either person in the link can end it as a standard action; otherwise it is permanent. If one person in the link dies, the other is stunned for 1 round and staggered until she can rest for 10 minutes. A spherewalker can only maintain one such link at a time, though she may be the recipient of multiple links. Married spherewalkers often link themselves to their spouses.",

			"**Divine Luck (Su):** At 4th level, a spherewalker can add a luck bonus equal to her class level on an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1/day). She may add this bonus after she has rolled but before she knows if the unmodified result is a success or failure.",

			"**Swarm Form (Su):** At 5th level, a spherewalker gains the ability to transform into a swarm of Diminutive butterflies. In swarm form, she has a space of 10 feet (roughly filling the entire area) but can shape this space to fill four contiguous squares (such as a 5-foot-by- 20-foot line, an L-shaped cloud, and so on) and can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of her component forms. The swarm can fly at a speed of 40 feet (good). Like any swarm, it can occupy the same space as another creature regardless of its size.",

Unlike most swarms, a spherewalker in swarm form does not do swarm damage to creatures she's swarming over. The swarm form is immune to weapon damage but is vulnerable to mundane fire attacks (torches, alchemical fire, burning oil, and so on), and energy attacks from weapon (such as flaming and frost) deal full damage even though the basic weapon damage has no effect. Although a swarm cannot make attacks, the spherewalker can cast spells as normal while in swarm form (although spells with material components could prove difficult).",

			"A spherewalker can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her class level and remain in this form for up to one minute. While in swarm form, she may expend one use of this ability as a free action in order to remain in swarm form for an additional minute (rather than changing back to her normal form and activating it again). Changing back to her natural form before the effect ends is a standard action."

			"",
			"**Defensive Stance (Ex):** At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends.",
			"",
			"The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.",
			"",
			"A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).",
			"",
			"**Defensive Powers (Ex):** As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once.",
			"",
			"**Bulwark (Ex):** The defender adds his armor check penalty as a bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to Bluff him and Acrobatics checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens.",
			"",
			"**Clear Mind (Ex):** The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Fearless Defense (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.",
			"",
			"**Halting Blow (Ex):** If a foe's movement in the defender's threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to selecting halting blow.",
			"",
			"**Immobile (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush, overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th level to select this power.",
			"",
			"**Increased Damage Reduction (Ex):** The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/-. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power.",
			"",
			"**Intercept (Ex):** Once a round as an immediate action, when a melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack.",
			"",
			"**Internal Fortitude (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.",
			"",
			"**Mighty Resilience (Ex):** The stalwart defender automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart defender takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level to select this power.",
			"",
			"**Renewed Defense (Ex):** As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Roused Defense (Ex):** The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Smash (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus -5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Unexpected Strike (Ex):** The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.",
			"",
			"**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flatfooted, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.",
			"",
			"If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).",
			"",
			"**Damage Reduction (Ex):** At 5th level, a stalwart defender gains DR 1/-. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/-, and at 10th level it increases to 5/-. Damage reduction from different sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full plate (DR 3/-) has DR 6/-.",
			"",
			"**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).",
			"",
			"If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.",
			"",
			"**Mobile Defense (Ex):** At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.",
			"",
			"**Last Word (Ex):** Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability."

Beyond the stargazers' interests in the heavens, though, they also train for the inevitable conflict with demons.

			"",

			"",
			"**Storm Shape (Su):** At 2nd level, a Storm Kindler becomes a physical embodiment of the fury of the storm. As a standard action, she can transform herself into a whirlwind (as per the universal monster rule, Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 306) for a number of minutes per day equal to her Storm Kindler level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. If the Storm Kindler is underwater when she uses this ability, she instead transforms into a vortex of the same size (this functions identically to the whirlwind ability, but can form only underwater and can't leave the water). The Storm Kindler can breathe water while in vortex form. If the Storm Kindler does not have a fly or swim speed, she gains one (as appropriate to her new form) equal to her base land speed while in storm shape.

At 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the size of creatures the Storm Kindler can affect increases by one step, to a maximum of Huge at 8th level.",

			"**Aura of Calm (Su):** At 3rd level, allies within 5 feet of a Storm Kindler (including herself ) are treated as one size category larger for the purpose of wind effects (this stacks with the bonus from Storm-Lashed), and they gain a +2 competence bonus on all saving throws to resist spells and effects with the air or water descriptors. At 5th level and every 2 levels thereafter, the Storm Kindler's aura of calm extends by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet at 9th level).

			"",
			"**Thunderstruck (Su):** At 5th level, a Storm Kindler becomes immune to the deafened condition.",
			"",
			"**Weather's Fury (Su):** At 6th level, a Storm Kindler can deal additional damage with her storm shape. In addition to her unarmed strike damage, she deals 3d6 points of electricity damage (while in whirlwind form) or cold damage (while in vortex form) to each creature that fails its Reflex saves. This damage increases to 4d6 at 8th level, and 5d6 at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Eye of the Storm (Su):** At 7th level, a Storm Kindler becomes immune to damage and detrimental effects from nonmagical wind and waves. In addition, she receives a +4 insight bonus on saving throws and to AC against spells and effects with the air or water descriptors.",
			"",
			"**Fickle Winds (Sp):** At 8th level, as a swift action, a Storm Kindler can call the winds to her defense, protecting her as per the spell fickle winds for a number of rounds per day equal to her level. These rounds need not be consecutive.",
			"",
			"**Echoing Thunder (Su):** At 9th level, anytime a Storm Kindler resists electricity or sonic damage with her oceanic spirit ability, she can spend an immediate action to redirect the damage to another creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the Storm Kindler's class level + the Storm Kindler's Wisdom modifier) or take an amount of electricity or sonic damage equal to the amount the Storm Kindler resisted.",
			"",
			"**Storm Mastery (Su):** At 10th level, a Storm Kindler becomes one with the relentless fury of the storm, allowing her to use her storm shape ability at will. In addition to this, she gains a fly speed equal to double her base land speed, and gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality. The Storm Kindler never takes the normal penalties on her attack or damage rolls for fighting underwater."

When it's chosen a third time, the mystic instead becomes invisible, as per the spell invisibility, until the beginning of his next turn.",
			"",
			"**Pouncing Beasts:** These bestial pictographs seem poised to leap off the mystic's skin. The mystic can cast summon monster and summon nature's ally spells of up to 3rd level as a standard action, rather than a full-round action, provided all the creatures summoned enter play adjacent to him. The maximum spell level the tattoo can affect increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.",
			"",
			"**Rune of Fangs:** These jagged runes cover the mystic's face, giving him a bestial expression. While polymorphed or otherwise transformed into a form with natural attacks, the mystic gains an enhancement bonus on his attack and damage rolls equal to 1/2 his level with one natural attack, chosen when he assumes that form. Each time he selects this tattoo, he can choose one additional natural attack to apply the bonus to.",
			"",
			"**Swallowing Glyph:** This ornate, shadowy glyph absorbs the souls of those the mystic slays. Any time the mystic slays a creature with a necromancy spell, he can spend a swift action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. Temporary hit points gained from subsequent uses of this ability do not stack. The second time this tattoo is selected, the number of temporary hit points increases to double the spell's level. The third time it's selected, the number increases to triple the spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Twisting Script:** The indistinct shapes that form this spiral tattoo twist into legible text when scrutinized. Creatures within 30 feet of the mystic that can see him are affected by his language-dependent enchantment spells, even if they do not understand the language he speaks. Creatures without a language are immune to this effect. The range of the effect increases by 30 feet each time this tattoo is selected, to a maximum of 150 feet.",

			"",
			"**Tattoo Mastery (Ex):** At 7th level, a tattooed mystic can use his own ability score modifier and relevant feats to set the DC for spell tattoos he crafts, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the spell tattoo he is crafting (similar to a caster using a staff ).",
			"",

Keeping the item working requires 1 hour of maintenance each day (this can overlap with the time needed to prepare spells), or the item reverts to a normal piece of timeworn technology and must be reconditioned again.

(Additional technology-related spells can be added to this list at the GM's discretion.) If the spell chosen isn't one that's normally on his class spell list, he adds it to his class spell list at the level a wizard casts the spell. The spell chosen must be of a spell level he would otherwise be able to cast. If he prepares spells, he can prepare this spell one additional time in excess of the normal maximum number of spells he can prepare. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds the spell to his spells known, and can cast this spell once per day without using a daily spell slot.",

			"",
			"**Arcane Battery (Su):** At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (if he prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by the technomancer must come from the device's own power reserves. He can use this ability to power timeworn technology. He can't power devices that don't use charges.",
			"",
			"**Study Technology (Ex):** At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. If he succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.",
			"",
			"**Recycle Technology (Ex):** At 4th level, a technomancer can dismantle existing technological items and construct new ones from the parts, though such creations are prone to malfunctioning. He trades in each item for an amount of crafting potential based on a fraction of its crafting cost (not price), as described below. He can use this potential and his technological crafting feats to make a new item. For example, a technomancer could use a broken laser pistol in place of 500 gp for crafting technological items (10% of the laser pistol's crafting cost of 5,000 gp). He then follows the normal rules for crafting a technological item (see page 16), except that he must pay at least 50% of the crafting cost using recycled technology. If he pays 100% of the cost in this fashion, he crafts the item at double the normal speed. In the process of cannibalizing the old items, the new items are destroyed and any excess gold value is lost. The item he creates is considered timeworn technology, even if new items were broken down to build it. Recycle technology cannot be used to build constructs, cybertech, pharmaceuticals, or technology that uses nanites.",

			"**Command Robot (Sp):** At 5th level, a technomancer can issue a command to a robot within 30 feet as a standard action once per day. The command must be in a language the robot can understand. The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer's class level + the technomancer's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as suggestion, save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.",
			"",
			"**Unified Energy (Su):** At 6th level, a technomancer can draw power from a technological device in his possession to cast a spell he knows (if a spontaneous caster) or a spell he currently has prepared (if he prepares spells) without expending a spell slot or prepared spell. He consumes 2 charges from the device for each spell level of the spell being cast. In the process of casting the spell, he can apply any of his metamagic feats, using a number of charges appropriate to the increase in spell level, but he cannot exceed the highest effective level of spell he is able to cast. He can use this ability multiple times per day, but never in excess of a number of charges equal to twice his technomancer level (so at 6th level, he can consume no more than 12 charges per day using this ability).",
			"",
			"**Applied Learning (Ex):** At 8th level, when a technomancer succeeds at a saving throw against a technological effect that has reduced effects on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless or flat-footed technomancer does not benefit from this ability.",
			"",
			"**Field Improvisation (Ex):** At 10th level, a technomancer can recycle technology with astounding speed. Each hour of crafting when using his recycle technology ability is equivalent to 8 hours of uninterrupted crafting; he can perform up to 8 hours of such amazingly efficient work per day. Any item he completes is treated as reconditioned for the remainder of that day. It can be added permanently to his group of reconditioned items if he has an available slot or stops maintaining one of his current reconditioned items."

The old ways nearly became extinct, yet the lore of the desert's delicate blooms never entirely disappeared.",

As a full-round action, she can convert the magical energies of two extracts or spells of 1st level into a special extract of cure light wounds. This acts as an infused extract, but it must be used before the end of her next turn or its power is lost.

The Thuvian alchemist must have the bottled ooze discovery and be at least 8th level before selecting this Thuvian discovery.",
			"",
			"**Capture Elemental (Sp):** A Thuvian alchemist can capture an elemental inside a specially prepared bottle, vial, or flask, as if using trap the soul as a spell-like ability, though this ability affects only elementals. Preparing the bottle costs 500 gp per Hit Die of the elemental to be trapped and takes 1 day per 1,000 gp of value. If the Thuvian alchemist tries to capture an elemental with too many Hit Dice, the bottle shatters. The Thuvian alchemist must have the bottled elemental discovery and be at least 12th level before selecting this Thuvian discovery.",

Only creatures that drink from the extract within 1 round of when the first imbiber starts drinking it are affected. A Thuvian alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",

Whenever the Thuvian alchemist creates a healing solution by expending two extracts or spells, she may reduce the amount of hit point damage cured by one step (reducing a healing solution of cure moderate wounds to one of cure light wounds, for instance) in order to apply any number of her curative enhancements to her healing solution. These enhancements can remove conditions caused by curses, diseases, or poisons even if they do not remove the underlying affliction itself; the conditions return after 1 hour unless the curative enhancement actually removes the affliction that causes the condition.",

			"Of all the members of the Eagle Knights, Twilight Talons often pay the highest price for the freedom the Eagle Knights work so hard to achieve, sacrificing years of their lives to serve as spies in nations whose cultures make their stomachs turn, and never receiving credit for or acknowledgment of their accomplishments-or even their existence. Perhaps even more exhausting are the moral and ethical choices a Twilight Talon has to make on so many of her missions. Often, such choices end up being difficult decisions made between two evils, and in many cases, a Twilight Talon ends up having to deal with the consequences of such decisions for months or even years to come. Yet to make no decision at all in such a time is perhaps the greatest evil of all, for to the Twilight Talon, acting in the best of intentions is always a better option than remaining quiet and allowing evil and cruelty to continue unopposed. Being selected to serve as a Twilight Talon is an honor bestowed on only the select few who Marshal Helena Trellis, head of the Talons, believes trustworthy enough to carry out the commitment and of strong enough character to be able to make morally difficult decisions for the best of Andoran-all without public recognition. To a Twilight Talon, a job well done is one that no one outside of the Talons ever knew occurred in the first place.",

When on a mission for the group, a Twilight Talon might tell friends and family that she's leaving under some false pretense, but more often she just disappears for months or even years at a time. When a Twilight Talon works with a group of like-minded allies (as is the case when one works with an adventuring group), she may or may not reveal her true allegiance to her companions, but if she does, she must be prepared for the repercussions if those she trusts as allies do not keep her secret.",

Instead, she becomes a master at maximizing the potential in everyday objects used as improvised weapons. At 2nd level, a Twilight Talon increases the amount of damage she deals with improvised weapons by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6).

			"**Dead Drop (Ex):** A Twilight Talon prepares for many contingencies and can tap her underground network for supplies, provided she pays into her dead drop fund beforehand. At 5th level, by spending an hour spreading around coin in any small town or larger settlement, the Twilight Talon gains the ability to access dead drops of equipment in the field. A Twilight Talon can pay any amount into her dead drop fund when she does so, but can never have more than a total of 100 gp per class level in her dead drop fund.",

At any point in a wilderness region, but no more often than once per day, the Twilight Talon can take 1d8 hours to seek out the closest dead drop, at which point she can purchase any item from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook from the dead drop, deducting the price from the amount of gold she has paid into the fund at that date. At the GM's discretion, gear from other sourcebooks may also be available in a dead drop. In particularly remote locations, a GM may rule that no dead drops can exist, but the GM should inform the Twilight Talon of this fact when expeditions to such areas are planned. Dead drops shift locations often, so each time a Twilight Talon seeks one out, she must spend the 1d8 hours to find it.",
			"",
			"At 8th level, it takes a Twilight Talon only 10 minutes to pay into her dead drop fund, it takes only 30 minutes to locate a dead drop in the wild, and her maximum dead drop fund increases to 2,500 gp. (This total does not increase when she gains additional levels.)",
			"",
			"**Unassuming Presence (Su):** A Twilight Talon learns to quickly direct attention away from herself using subtle physical cues. At 6th level, a Twilight Talon can attempt an opposed Bluff check as a swift action against each enemy creature within 30 feet. If she succeeds against every target, the Twilight Talon can immediately attempt a Stealth check as though she had concealment; she gains a bonus equal to her Twilight Talon class level on this Stealth check. She can use this ability up to three times per day."

			"After centuries of raiding and pillaging throughout Avistan, the Ulfen have earned their reputation for ferocity and fearlessness. Though seemingly at odds with this perception of barbarism, Ulfen are also known for their staunch loyalty, strong sense of honor, and unyielding resolve. The combination of these reputations is in large part why they have become desired as bodyguards throughout the region. Nowhere is this practice more pronounced than in Taldor, where Ulfen have become ensconced in the Taldan tradition and adopted as the elite bodyguards of Grand Prince Stavian III himself. Ulfen Guards, as outsiders, are generally thought to have no ulterior motives or secret loyalty to other Taldan families or political organizations; their honor keeps them loyal to the crown. An Ulfen Guard is required to be of at least half- Ulfen descent, with one or both parents hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Non-Ulfen may serve the organization in a support capacity, but may not be Ulfen Guards themselves. While the Ulfen Guards are officially Stavian III's personal bodyguards, he often has them perform other tasks that take them all over the Inner Sea region, protecting his interests as well as his person, or operating secretly under the auspices of traveling Ulfen merchants, raiding seafarers, or unaffiliated mercenaries, all the while serving the Taldan crown.",

This guard dedication can be chosen multiple times; each additional time allows the Ulfen Guard to select an additional teamwork feat at the start of her rage, thus granting her the use of more than one teamwork feat simultaneously.",

If the guard already has uncanny dodge from another source (or a previous instance of this dedication), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge. If she already has improved uncanny dodge, taking this dedication grants the effects of improved uncanny dodge to her chosen ally as long as the guard is adjacent to the ally.

			"",
			"**Reactive Strike (Ex):** At 8th level, an Ulfen Guard can make an attack of opportunity against an enemy that moves adjacent to or attacks the Ulfen Guard's chosen ally. The Ulfen Guard cannot make a reactive strike against a creature she has already made an attack of opportunity against during the round.",

			"Zon-Kuthon's agents in the mortal realm preserve the god's grip on the shadowy nation of Nidal through darkness and horror. The rare few Kuthites gifted with the right to rule are known as the Umbral Court, and Umbral Court agents are their enforcers. Officially, Umbral Court agents operate primarily in the blasted city of Ridwan or the capital of Pangolais. In truth, however, Umbral Court agents operate throughout all of Nidal and its neighboring nations. Some work in the open as diplomats and consuls, others in secret as spies, agitators, and agents provocateur. Most agents in Nidal spend their time hunting down apostates and heretics, seeking to purge the nation of inappropriate influences. Those acting abroad seek out positions in rival nations' halls of power. Regardless of their methods, all serve the greater glory of Nidal-and the will of their dark god-with blind devotion.",

These minor treacheries are overlooked, or even rewarded, by superiors, so long as they do not interfere with the relative peace and order of Nidal. Agents who thirst for power often make deals with dark entities in order to stay one step ahead of their so-called allies, and in Pangolais it is not uncommon for agents to transform themselves into vampires or other types of undead.",

Other creatures no longer get a Will save to recognize the effect as an illusion, though they can still make Perception checks to realize the veiled illusionist is using a disguise.",

			"The following are class features of the Westcrown devil prestige class.",
			"",
			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A Westcrown devil gains proficiency with longswords.",
			"",
			"**Classically Trained (Ex):** The god Aroden's return to Westcrown was long foretold, but when he died instead and prophecy proved unreliable, the citizens of Westcrown had to adapt. Today, Westcrown honors Aroden's legacy with memorial statues, cathedrals, and other remembrances. The Council of Thieves, for its part, trains its members with Aroden's favored weapon, the longsword-a weapon the god used to great effect by eschewing strength for finesse and expertise. A Westcrown devil can use Weapon Finesse with a longsword sized for him when he wields it one-handed, even though it is not a light weapon.",
			"",
			"**Founders' Favor (Su):** A group known as the founders of Aroden are the patrons of Westcrown. So strong are the traditions this group imprinted on the city that even Cheliax's relatively recent dedication to the Prince of Darkness has not effaced their mark upon the City of Twilight. A Westcrown devil learns to call upon the founders' spiritual power, enjoying a mastery of the city matched by few.",
			"",
			"At 1st level, a Westcrown devil gains a pool of favor points equal to his class level + his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). In addition to the powers inspired by specific founders (see below), the Westcrown devil can spend one favor point to add a bonus equal to half her class level (minimum +1) on a skill check without spending an action. The Westcrown devil must use this ability before learning the result of the check, and he can add this additional bonus only once per skill check. The pool of favor is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest.",
			"",
			"As the Westcrown devil gains levels, he learns to call upon powers inspired by specific founders. The caster level of spell-like abilities used this way is equal to the character's class level. Effects (including spell-like abilities) that allow a saving throw have a DC equal to 10 + the Westcrown devil's class level + the Westcrown devil's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).",
			"",
			"**Eye of Vadrus (Su):** The patron of glassmakers allows the Westcrown devil to turn walls to glass. At 1st level, as a fullround action that costs 1 favor point, the Westcrown devil can see the internal workings of a lock, trap, or similar device that he touches. He gains a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks to disable this device. At 4th level, he can use eye of Vadrus to see through a section of any door or wall he is adjacent to and touches, as though a section of that wall or door no larger than 5 square feet were transparent. This effect works only on walls or doors that are no thicker than 6 inches. This effect lasts 1 round per class level.",
			"",
			"**Crucisal's Guidance (Su):** The patron of navigation guides the Westcrown devil while hindering any pursuit. At 3rd level, when in an urban environment, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as a swift action to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed and a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks for 1 minute. Whenever the Westcrown devil spends favor to improve a skill check as part of a chase (GameMastery Guide 232) or pursuit (Ultimate Intrigue 142), he adds 2d6 to his check instead of 1d6.",
			"",
			"**Adel's Craftsmanship (Sp):** The patron of woodcraft imparts mastery over such creations. At 5th level, as a standard action, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use warp wood or meld into wood (as per meld into stone, except that the wood can be of any size or dimensions). If the Westcrown devil is 8th level or higher, he can use this ability as passwall through wooden barriers or statue to assume the form of a statue made of wood (hardness 5) instead.",
			"",
			"**Rixana's Bounty (Sp):** Calling upon the patron of the bounty of deep waters allows for safe navigation of underwater regions. At 7th level, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as an immediate action to grant the benefits of water breathing for 24 hours. When he activates this ability, he can affect other creatures he can touch by spending 1 additional favor point for each added creature.",
			"",
			"**Palmor's Recovery (Sp):** The patron of renewal grants access to powerful healing. At 8th level, as a standard action, a Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use cure serious wounds or lesser restoration. He can spend 3 favor points in a 1-minute ritual to use break enchantment or restoration (requiring expensive material components as appropriate).",
			"",
			"**Dotara's Shroud (Su):** Experienced Westcrown devils gain the favor of the patron of the dottari (city guard). At 9th level, the Westcrown devil gains a +5 insight bonus on all skill checks opposed by or targeting city guards, a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks from city guards, and a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects created by city guards. This ability is constant and applies only while the Westcrown devil has at least 1 favor point remaining.",
			"",
			"**Arodennama's Avatar (Su or Sp):** Westcrown's greatest monument, the Arodennama, symbolizes the dead god of humanity, and the Westcrown devil can draw inspiration from this towering statue to invoke Aroden's authority or mastery of the blade. At 10th level, the Westcrown devil can use his favor ability to improve attack rolls with longswords as if they were skill checks. In addition, as a full-round action, the Westcrown devil can spend 2 favor points to issue a suggestion, or spend 5 favor points to issue a mass suggestion. These function as the spells of the same name except that they affect only humans.",
			"",
			"**Council's Secret:** At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Westcrown devil gains a rogue talent, selected from those available to rogues. The Westcrown devil treats his character level as his rogue level for the purpose of determining the talents' effects. At 6th level, whenever the Westcrown devil would select a rogue talent, he can select an advanced talent instead.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, the Westcrown devil can focus on occult studies instead. If he chooses this option, when he would gain a talent via this ability, his spellcasting ability in a psychic spellcasting class he has increases by 1 level instead. The Westcrown devil can gain a level of spellcasting in this way once, plus one additional time at 6th and 10th levels.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** At 3rd level, a Westcrown devil gains sneak attack as per the rogue class feature. The extra damage is 1d6 at 3rd level, and it increases to 2d6 at 6th level, and to 3d6 at 9th level."

			"In the minds of the folk of the arctic north, the otherworldly powers of winter witches are inextricably linked with the frozen realm of Irrisen and its cruel aristocracy. These rulers, the Jadwiga, have the bitter blood of Baba Yaga running through their veins, and possess unique abilities that make them unparalleled in their power over ice, snow, and cold.",
			"",
			"Not all winter witches have a blood connection to the nobility of Irrisen. Some have their craft passed down to them by wizened mentors, and others hear their calling in the howling winds of a freezing winter's night. Of those winter witches who live outside Irrisen, many subsist on the fringes of civilization or in the wild, often concealing their powers lest they be seen as Irriseni spies. This is particularly true in the lands of the Linnorm Kings, where memories of the Winter War with Irrisen fuel long-held hatreds, as well as in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, whose superstitious tribespeople deeply distrust most forms of arcane magic.",

			"**Spells per Day:** At the indicated levels, a winter witch gains new spells per day and patron spells as if she had also gained a level in the witch class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day and an increased effective level of spellcasting.",
			"",
			"**Hyperboreal Patronage:** A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the listed class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice, 5th-icy prison, 7th-freezing sphere.",
			"",
			"**Winter Witchcraft:** Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when a witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.",
			"",
			"**Freeze and Thaw (Su):** At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or a 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% of the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water that is within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds.",
			"",
			"This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Unnatural Cold (Su):** At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining the damage dealt.",
			"",
			"**Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp):** At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Winter Hex:** Starting at 5th level, whenever a winter witch can choose a major hex, she must choose from the following hexes: ice tomb, hoarfrost, numbing chill (see below). Once the winter witch has selected all three winter hexes, she may thereafter choose any other hex she meets the prerequisites for.",
			"",
			"**Numbing Chill (Su):** Whenever the winter witch casts a spell that deals cold damage, she can imbue the spell with a debilitating eldritch chill as a swift action. She chooses one of the spell's targets or a creature within the spell effect. If that creature takes cold damage from the spell, it must also succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and be staggered for 1 round. The creature need only make this saving throw once per spell, even if the spell deals damage multiple times. If the target saves successfully, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.",
			"",
			"**Blizzard Sight (Su):** At 6th level, a winter witch can see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail, fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and similar weather conditions.",
			"",
			"**Unearthly Cold (Su):** At 8th level, a winter witch's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage become horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.",
			"",
			"**Iceglide (Su):** At 10th level, a winter witch can move effortlessly at her base land speed through ice or snow. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and doesn't create any ripple or other sign of passage. While icegliding, a winter witch can breathe normally. A control water spell cast on an area containing an icegliding winter witch flings her back 30 feet in a random direction, stunning her for 1 round unless she succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. A winter witch can use this ability for 10 minutes per day. This time need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Activating this ability is a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Inexorable Cold (Su):** At 10th level, a winter witch casts spells with the cold descriptor at +1 caster level. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to counterspell, dispel, or penetrate spell resistance with these spells, and the DC to counterspell or dispel these spells increases by 1."
