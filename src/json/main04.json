					["Kobold",[1,"Less Common"],"[Yes](monster/kobold)","Considering themselves the scions of dragons, kobolds have diminutive statures but massive egos. A select few can take on more draconic traits than their kin, and many are powerful sorcerers, canny alchemists, and cunning rogues."],
					["Orc",[1,"Less Common"],"[Yes](monster/orc)","Savage, brutish, and hard to kill, orcs are often the scourge of far-flung wildernesses and cavern deeps.

					["Tiefling",[1,"Less Common"],"[Yes](monster/tiefling)","Diverse and often despised by humanoid society, tieflings are mortals stained with the blood of fiends. Other races rarely trust them, and this lack of empathy usually causes tieflings to embrace the evil, depravity, and rage that seethe within their corrupt blood. A select few see the struggle to smother such dark desires as motivation for grand heroism."],
					["Undine",[1,"Less Common"],"[Yes](monster/undine)","Like their cousins, the ifrits, oreads, and sylphs, undines are humans touched by planar elements.

Though in many ways they appear nearly human, gillmen's bright purple eyes and gills set them apart from humanity.

					["Grippli",[2,"Uncommon"],"[Yes](monster/grippli)","Furtive frogfolk with the ability to camouflage themselves among fens and swamps, gripplis typically keep to their wetland homes, only rarely interacting with the outside world.

They can appear as a single human as well as their true form, that of a foxlike humanoid.

					["Strix",[2,"Uncommon"],"[Yes](monster/strix)","Hunted to dwindling numbers by humans, who see them as winged devils, strix are black-skinned masters of the nighttime sky.

					["Suli",[2,"Uncommon"],"[Yes](monster/suli)","Also called suli-jann, these humanoids are the descendants of mortals and jann. These strong and charismatic individuals manifest mastery over elemental power in their adolescence, giving them the ability to manipulate earth, fire, ice, or electricity. This elemental power tends to be reflected in the suli's personality as well."],
					["Svirfneblin",[2,"Uncommon"],"[Yes](monster/svirfneblin)","Gnomes who guard their hidden enclaves within dark tunnels and caverns deep under the earth, svirfneblin are as serious as their surface cousins are whimsical.

					["Astomoi",[3,"Rare"],"[Yes](monster/astomoi)","These mysterious humanoids require no food-indeed, they have no mouths-and they have no eyes with which to survey their environment. Instead, they rely on their powerful minds to sense the world around them, and subsist on nutrients absorbed from the air. This can turn against them, however, as powerful smells and inhaled poisons can render an astomoi helpless. Predisposed to asceticism, astomoi rarely wear more than rags, if they wear anything at all."],
					["Being of Ib",[3,"Rare"],"No","Living examples of this time-forgotten race may yet exist on distant worlds, or they could be resurrected by curious spellcasters. A living being of Ib is not a very dangerous creature, but those who gain levels in spellcasting classes can become quite formidable; they overwhelmingly prefer divine spellcasting classes and typically venerate Bokrug."],

					["Gathlain",[3,"Rare"],"[Yes](monster/gathlain)","According to some fey ballads, gathlains were one of the first peoples awakened in the First World, the primal realm of the fey. Gathlains grow from the seeds of an enormous magical tree-seeds that often drift for hundreds of miles before developing into adolescent gathlains, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh to form their strange wings. Despite being born with a basic understanding of their world, gathlains are inquisitive to a fault. They are known to be invaluable guides and knowledgeable explorers, if one can put up with their numerous questions and strange japes."],
					["Ghoran",[3,"Rare"],"[Yes](monster/ghoran)","The first ghorans came into being thousands of years ago during a great war between two nations ruled by rival archmages. When mighty necromantic curses blighted the lands of one nation, leaving its inhabitants on the brink of starvation, their canny leader cut a deal with the renegade druid Ghorus, bidding him to put his forbidden talents to use in saving the realm. The druid's solution was the creation of a race of hardy and fast-adapting plants that could thrive even upon the curse-blighted ground. These plants, which the druid named \"ghorans\" after himself, swiftly developed the ability to move on their own, searching out the most nourishing soil and continuously adapting themselves to survive in more and more dangerous environments. As they grew in intelligence, ghorans evolved humanlike forms as a defense mechanism to induce sympathy and prevent further butchery."],
					["Green Martian",[3,"Rare"],"No","Among the hardiest and longest-lived of Barsoom's savage races, the green men of Mars rove the planet's wastelands in brutal tribes of thousands of warriors, seeking their fortunes as nomads amid the crumbling ruins of ancient cities and the vast barren wildlands between them."],

This spirit journey frays the samsaran's connection to his past lives but strengthens his ability to read others' pasts and present."],
					["Shabti",[3,"Rare"],"[Yes](monster/shabti)","Death is more terrifying for those who have the best of life. Many rulers obsess over their mortality, the most brazen turning to the mystical arts, pouring their fears into splendid vessels, fashioning simulacra of themselves to bear the scourge of Pharasma's judgment. In the mortal world, these icons are nothing but gold with a ruler's face and name, but in death, they are shabti."],

					["Vine Leshy",[3,"Rare"],"No","Vine leshys are born by ritual, called forth when a druid channels a nature spirit into a plant's form. The nature spirit that answers the call for a vine leshy creation ritual is always one that has keenly felt the influence of mortal beings. Compared to other leshys, vine leshys have an easier time relating to non-plant creatures and a deeper sense of curiosity about the wonders of the natural world beyond those plants closely related to them, as well as a fascination with the societies of humans and other creatures."],

			"It's a common belief that only those initiated in the rites and practices of arcane, divine, or psychic magic can cast spells, but this is not strictly true. Hidden within dusty libraries and amid the ramblings of lunatics lie the mysteries of another form of spellcasting-occult ritual magic. These spells are rare, coveted by both those eager to gain their power and those wishing to hide their existence. Most traditional spellcasters consider these rituals dangerous and uncontrollable, something to be avoided or used as a last resort. They fear the power these ceremonies grant to the uninitiated, as the rituals allow those with only a glimmering of understanding the ability to interact with the underlying fabric of magic.",
			"",
			"While anyone can attempt to cast occult rituals, the process is fraught with peril. The strange and intricate incantations are often challenging to perform with precision, and failure can weaken the casters or even unleash horrors upon the world. Even when successfully performed, each occult ritual has a price-a backlash that affects at least the caster leading the ritual, and often those assisting in its performance.
