Example: If you're trying to find a +1 cloak of resistance (1,000 gp), you'd normally need to be in a small town (base value 1,000 gp) or larger to be able to find that item with little trouble. If you're currently in a hamlet, that's two community sizes away from a small town, so the Diplomacy DC is 30.
