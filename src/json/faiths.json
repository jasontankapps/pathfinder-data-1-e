When you perform your obedience, choose a single whip and a single light or heavy shield you have to become imbued. An imbued shield gains the animated special ability. An imbued whip can siphon magical energy from spellcasting foes it strikes: up to three times per day as a swift action as you strike such a foe, you can attempt to drain magic. When you do so, the target must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If the target succeeds, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score (whichever is highest). If the target fails, the whip deals 1d6 points of ability drain to this ability score instead, and it absorbs one spell from the target. If the target is a spontaneous caster, one of its highest-level available spell slots is expended, and you regain a spell slot of an equal or lower level (your choice; if you don't have the ability to spontaneously cast spells, you receive no benefit from this). If the target is a prepared spellcaster, one of its highest-level spells (determined randomly) is lost as if cast, and that spell becomes stored in your whip (as per a major ring of spell storing). Your whip can store only one spell at a time in this way; if you drain another spell while your whip already contains one, the contained spell is replaced by the new spell you drain.",

A creature can be affected in this way only once per round, even if you move into its space multiple times.",
			">3. **Flensing Storm (Sp)** Once per day, you can call out to Aldinach to conjure a deadly sandstorm from the Whispering Sands, which flenses those caught within down to nothing but bloody bones. This acts as an incendiary cloud spell, except that instead of fire damage it deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage; this Constitution damage can be negated with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier). As a move action, you can direct a flensing storm to move up to 60 feet in any direction; this need not be a straight line. You are immune to the effects of your flensing storms and can see through them without penalty.",

			">3. **Dehydrating Strike (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, when you deal damage to a creature, that creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) to avoid becoming instantly and painfully dehydrated. If the victim fails this save, it takes 1d10 points of Strength drain, is stunned for 1 round, and is then staggered for 1d4 rounds.

You gain a hidden strike, with which you deal an extra 2d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks or ranged attacks from within 30 feet against foes who are unaware of your presence or who consider you an ally. You can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that you are flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage is reduced to 2d4. You can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment). This stacks with other sources of hidden strike damage or sneak attack damage you already have. In addition, like a deadfall scorpion, you are adept at taking advantage of your foes' surprise. During a surprise round, you can take a full round's worth of actions, rather than a single standard action.",
			">3. **Sting of Aldinach (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, you can grow a golden-hued scorpion's tail, complete with stinger. This sting is a primary natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for a creature of your size (1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature). The sting is poisonous (injury; save DC 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 1 save). Like that of the immense black scorpion, your stinger strikes with blinding speed; you can make an attack with your stinger as a swift action (in addition to any other attacks or actions taken during that round). Once activated, your stinger remains for a number of minutes equal to your Hit Dice.",

After this, retrace your steps, but instead of plotting tactics, appreciate the beauty and scenery that you find along your way, and speak quiet prayers to or praises of the Waybringer, keeping in mind that none of what you've seen would exist were it not for Apsu.

Up to three times per day, as a standard action, you can touch a single weapon and grant it the dancing property for the next 3 rounds. A single weapon cannot be targeted by this effect more than once per day.",

Once per week, you can cast animate objects on a single object that you've created. The effect does not have a duration; the animated object remains indefinitely as a companion, following your commands as best it can. You cannot animate a new companion while one is already serving you, though as a full-round action you can dismiss a companion, reducing it to lifelessness. If your companion is destroyed, you cannot use this ability again for another week. You cannot affect an object animated in this way with a permanency spell.",

Anytime you use a teleportation effect to move, you can place an invisible magic sensor in the area from which you just departed. As long as you are on the same plane as the sensor, you can see and hear everything occurring within 30 feet of the sensor as a swift action. The sensor lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. You can have a maximum number of active sensors equal to your number of Hit Dice.",

Once per month, you can designate a location to be your refuge. Once per week as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can teleport yourself and any willing creatures within 30 feet of you to the safe home of your choice, regardless of distance, as long as it is on the same plane. You can have a maximum number of refuges equal to half your Hit Dice. As long as none of your allies are in a refuge, you can remove its designation as a safe home as a swift action, but if you do so, you can never again designate it as a safe home.",

			">3. **Fallen Crusader's Retaliation (Su)** The Red Queen's life is a painful example of the danger of falling prey to the arcane arts, and you have learned from this lesson. Ever wary of those who wield magic in battle, you hone your reflexes to strike when least expected. Creatures you threaten that fail their checks to cast spells defensively provoke attacks of opportunity from you.",

When you do, each enemy within 60 feet must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or its skin partially turns to scales. This painful process deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice you have, and the target is subject to the effects of a slow spell for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, a target takes only half the damage and negates the slow effect. Creatures need not hear you to be affected, but you must be able to speak to use this ability.

Once per day as a standard action, you can target a living good-aligned or neutral creature with a touch attack that briefly transforms its body into a mass of quivering worms and undulating flesh. This deals an amount of damage equal to 10 points per Hit Die you have (maximum 150 points of damage) and nauseates the target for 1 round.

Once per day as a standard action, you can target any creature within 100 feet. If the target fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), it is stunned for 1 round and then paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Each round on its turn while it is paralyzed, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the paralyzing effect; this is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature that recovers from this effect early after being affected by it for at least 2 rounds is staggered for 2d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its initial saving throw against this effect is merely staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",

Those who fail are frightened for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice and take an amount of sonic damage equal to 1d6 per Hit Die you have (maximum 20d6).

Three times per day, you can cast dismissal as a spell-like ability. When you do, you are immediately affected by protection from good if the dismissed outsider was good-aligned, or protection from evil if the outsider was evil-aligned, for a number of minutes equal to your Hit Dice.",

Once per day, you can open a gate to Avernus, as per the spell gate, and use it either for planar travel or to call a pit fiend to your service. If you use it to call a pit fiend, this functions like the gate spell's calling creatures effect, but you are not required to pay the 10,000 gp material cost. If the pit fiend has more Hit Dice than you, you can't control it (as normal), but pit fiends tend to gladly obey the requests of powerful minions of Barbatos.",

If that creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), it feels the emotional anguish of a beloved's betrayal.

The creature can take no other actions while it is affected by this ability. A creature that is restrained with a successful grapple or otherwise rendered immobile cannot damage itself for that round. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.

You do not gain any of this outsider's other statistics or abilities, and you only superficially appear to be the outsider, but you gain a bonus equal to twice your Hit Dice on Bluff checks to convince others that you are the outsider.

Once per day, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to bribe a target (treat as if you are attempting to improve an NPC's attitude toward you by one step) or an Intimidate check to coerce a target, you can use this ability to gain Besmara's blessing to ensure further cooperation. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on the Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and if you succeed, the target is immediately subject to a geas/quest effect.

Once per day as a standard action, you can summon one of the monsters Besmara has bribed or intimidated into aiding her followers. You must choose the monster from among the following list: adult sea dragon, sea serpent, or vouivre. The monster appears as if summoned via summon monster, and you must summon it into an appropriately watery environment. It follows your commands perfectly for 1 round per Hit Die you possess before vanishing. The monster doesn't follow commands that contravene Besmara's interests, such as blocking waterways or giving a navy better control of a sea region; issuing such untenable instructions, if they're egregious, could cause the monster to attack you.",

On any attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks benefiting from this morale bonus, your allies take no penalties due to the effects of water or weather.

Three times per day, you can channel a curse through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you make the attack roll. On a hit, the target is cursed unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The curse causes the target to be sickened for a number of days equal to your Hit Dice; furthermore, during this period, any creatures flanking the target or against which it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with every successful hit. This extra damage applies to the attack that delivers the curse. In addition, all creatures with a swim speed have a starting attitude of hostile toward the target. This is a 7th-level curse effect.

Favored projects among the church include useful gear, magic items, innovative toys, and contraptions invented primarily to see if they would work rather than to solve a specific problem. Share the knowledge you discover while working on this project. If no people are around to hear or read your observations, or you are incapable of communicating with anyone, instead write down notes about your work to publish or otherwise share with others later. If you can share these notes with someone but choose not to, your obedience is unfulfilled; the requirement to share a set of these notes needs only be met once for that set of notes.

You can affect constructs with magic as if they were living creatures.

As a swift action, you can alter your body to incorporate construct-like features that protect you from physical damage. The transformation is subtle, such as adding metal reinforcements along your bones or small, auxiliary clockwork counterparts to your vital organs. The transformation grants you DR 3/- and lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds need not be consecutive. Dismissing the effect is a free action.",

Your double acts on your initiative count, and can move up to your speed each round. It always attempts to flank with you against a single target you designate. If it must use Acrobatics to avoid an attack of opportunity during this movement, your double uses your bonus. Though your double can't attack, it is treated as threatening adjacent squares for the purposes of flanking with you. Anyone attacking your double or otherwise physically interacting with it can attempt a Will save (DC 25) to recognize the double as an illusion. The double has your AC, and if any hit would deal damage to it, the double dissipates. An opponent who recognizes your double as an illusion can't be flanked by it. The double lasts 1 round for every Hit Die you possess or until it is hit with an attack, whichever comes first.",
			">3. **Intoxicating Strike (Su)** Once per day, you can declare one of your attacks an intoxicating strike. You must declare your use of this ability before you attempt the attack roll. If your attack hits and you deal damage, your target immediately becomes intoxicated for 1 round for every Hit Die you possess. An intoxicated creature takes a -4 penalty to AC, on attack rolls, and on skill checks, and its movement is reduced by 10 feet.",

The bralanis follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to their home in Elysium. The bralanis don't follow commands that would cause them to commit evil acts or restrict freedom solely for the sake of law. Such commands not only earn refusal and scorn from the bralanis, but could cause the bralanis to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.",

A potion created in this way heals 3d8 points of damage plus 1 point of damage for every Hit Die you possess (to a maximum of 3d8+15). The holy water you create is more potent than usual, dealing 4d4 points of damage to an undead creature or evil outsider, and 2d4 points of splash damage to each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits. Holy water and potions created in this way last for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).",

If you use this ability for your own personal gain to the detriment of someone who is innocent or less fortunate than you are, you are likely to incur Chaldira's disfavor and lose the use of this boon until you atone, as set forth in the [atonement](spell/atonement) spell. When used to recover the use of this boon, an [atonement](spell/atonement) spell has an additional monetary cost equal to the amount you gained due to the misuse of this ability.

A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once per day), when you would normally roll a miss chance percentage, you can instead choose whether or not to hit. This ability manifests as a lucky turn of the blade or an awkward lunge that appears to be an overcorrection but actually places your attack right where it needs to be. Observers are likely to consider you exceptionally fortunate in your attacks, rather than suspect that you are supernaturally guided to bypass effects that would cause you to miss.",

The image of the Pale Horse ignores difficult terrain and can walk over water or other surfaces that would normally not bear a creature's weight, but it cannot fly. Any creature whose space the image of the Pale Horse passes through must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a -6 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, as if it had suddenly aged to become venerable. Creatures (like dragons) that normally gain benefits from aging do not gain any benefits, and they instead take the ability score penalties described above. These penalties do not stack with themselves or with existing penalties from aging. A creature can resist the effects of the Pale Horse with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A creature can be affected by the Pale Horse only once per round, regardless of how many times the Pale Horse moves through its space. This is an aging curse effect.",

While under this effect, your body takes on a slick, watery appearance and can stretch and shift with ease. You become mostly transparent, as if you were composed of liquid, granting you a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.

When you do so, the creature struck must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or take 2 points of Charisma drain. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma in this way is permanently transformed into a hideously deformed aquatic version of itself; it gains the mutant template, the aquatic subtype, and the amphibious quality, and its alignment becomes chaotic evil. When this transformation occurs, all Charisma damage the creature has suffered is instantly cured. Such mutants are initially friendly toward you. This transformation is a curse effect.",

In your hybrid form, you are immune to damage from water pressure, gain the ability to breathe water, and gain a swim speed equal to twice your base speed. Your head becomes that of a viperfish, granting you a bite attack that deals damage as for a creature two size categories larger than you (2d6 for a Medium creature). In addition, a single long tentacle sprouts from your body, granting you a tentacle secondary natural attack that deals damage as for a creature of your size category (1d4 for a Medium creature). This tentacle has the grab and constrict abilities; the constrict damage is equal to your tentacle damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. While grappling a creature with your tentacle, you are not considered grappled and do not take any of the penalties associated with that condition. You can maintain this form for 1 minute per Hit Die per day; this duration need not be consecutive but must be spent in 1-minute increments.",

Once per day as a standard action, you can create an effect similar to overwhelming presence as though you were a cleric with an effective caster level equal to half your Hit Dice. Creatures that fail their saving throws are staggered instead of helpless for the duration of the spell, and suffer no further effects upon a successful subsequent save.

			">2. **Planar Wound (Su)** You can cut through the fabric of reality, delivering foes to your master's embrace. Three times per day as a standard action, you can strike the ground with a scythe to open a fissure under your feet or the feet of an adjacent Medium or smaller creature (if you target yourself, the rift opens just enough to let you-and only you-through, regardless of your size). This fissure is a planar rift that sends the creature to the Rasping Rifts in the Abyss, as per plane shift, except the fissure can transport only one creature and closes instantly after doing so (or after being avoided). An unwilling target can attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) to evade the fissure and negate this effect. Flying and levitating creatures are immune to this effect, and a creature capable of flight that is standing on the ground can avoid this effect if it succeeds at a DC 20 Fly check (it can still attempt a Reflex save to avoid the spell if it fails this Fly check).",
			">3. **Welcome the Rasping Rifts (Sp)** You can cast rift of ruin once per day as a spell-like ability. When the rift closes, each creature still present within the rift must attempt a Will save (against the spell's save DC). Creatures that succeed at this save are expelled violently (as normal for the spell), while those that fail are expelled violently into the Rasping Rifts in the Abyss. If you close the rift early to summon creatures, you summon one additional creature of the same type.",

			">3. **Hell's Sadistic Angel (Sp)** Doloras is well versed in ways to cause unholy pain to even the strongest and most resourceful souls, and you have painstakingly studied her torturer's techniques. Once per day as a standard action, you can call down your evil goddess's dispassionate, unholy might upon all enemies in a 30-foot radius centered anywhere within 100 feet of you. When you do, otherworldly chains forged in the infernal morass of Hell itself latch on to your enemies' feet, rooting them in place for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Affected creatures cannot damage the hellish chains nor magically escape them; if they attempt to use teleportation magic or a similar ability to circumvent the chains, the spell or ability fails and is wasted. While they are rooted, affected creatures take 2d6 points of piercing damage and 4d6 points of fire damage per round as blazing, hellish needles stab into the exposed portions of their bodies (affected creatures begin taking damage as soon as they are under this ability's effects). A creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw is only held in place for half the number of rounds and takes the listed damage only once."

You also mystically subsume some of the qualities of the animal that gave its life for the armor.

You must be wielding a spear to use this ability.",

Whenever you have taken at least 1 point of damage per Hit Die, your attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage, and the save DCs of fire spells and effects you create increase by 1. Once per day, you can cast fire shield (warm shield) on yourself as a swift action. When you die, your body explodes in a wave of ash and magma, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot burst; a target that succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) takes half damage. Your body is destroyed by this eruption, but your gear is not. If you die in this way, you can be restored to life only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish.",

During the 24 hours following your meditation, you can grant yourself and up to four other creatures within 30 feet a +4 profane bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks as a move action. You can maintain these bonuses as a free action for up to 1 round per Hit Die, after which you must meditate again to regain the ability.

This increases your base speed by 30 feet. Additionally, you can use your coils to form a cage for your enemies. When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the [swallow whole universal monster ability](umr/swallow_whole). Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free. Activating three-headed serpent is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",

			">2. **Boggard's Blessing (Ex)** Your form becomes batrachian in aspect, like the frogfolk of the marshes. You gain the boggard's hold breath, sticky tongue, and terrifying croak abilities. In addition, you count as a boggard for the purpose of effects, including prerequisites (although you lose access to related options if you haven't performed your obedience). If you are a boggard, you instead gain a permanent +2 profane bonus to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and the DC of your terrifying croak ability, and you can use your terrifying croak ability at will.",
			">3. **Kiss of Gogunta (Sp)** Calling out to the Song of the Swamp, you transform those who oppose you into frogs and toads. Any number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet must succeed at a Fortitude save or be transformed into Diminutive frogs or toads, as per baleful polymorph but heightened to a 9th-level spell. As with baleful polymorph, any creature that fails its Fortitude save must then succeed at a Will save to retain its mental faculties. Any creature that intentionally touches a creature transformed this way must succeed at the same saving throws or be transformed as well; a creature that kisses a transformed creature automatically fails its Fortitude save against this effect but automatically succeeds at its Will save. This ability can be used once per day.",
