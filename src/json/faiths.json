In addition, whenever you poison a creature via any method, whether from a spell such as poison or prismatic spray, from an envenomed weapon, or any other means, the saving throw DC of the poison effect is increased by 2.

Damage with your whip deals lethal damage, and you can damage creatures wearing armor. The whip deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a hit, and once per minute as a swift action as you strike a foe with a whip, you can cause the whip to poison the target with black adder venom. The saving throw DC of this venom is equal to 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier.",

When you perform your obedience, choose a single whip and a single light or heavy shield you have to become imbued. An imbued shield gains the animated special ability. An imbued whip can siphon magical energy from spellcasting foes it strikes: up to three times per day as a swift action as you strike such a foe, you can attempt to drain magic. When you do so, the target must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). If the target succeeds, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score (whichever is highest). If the target fails, the whip deals 1d6 points of ability drain to this ability score instead, and it absorbs one spell from the target. If the target is a spontaneous caster, one of its highest-level available spell slots is expended, and you regain a spell slot of an equal or lower level (your choice; if you don't have the ability to spontaneously cast spells, you receive no benefit from this). If the target is a prepared spellcaster, one of its highest-level spells (determined randomly) is lost as if cast, and that spell becomes stored in your whip (as per a major ring of spell storing). Your whip can store only one spell at a time in this way; if you drain another spell while your whip already contains one, the contained spell is replaced by the new spell you drain.",

This trophy must be anointed with a single drop of your blood, drawn from your flesh by a sawtooth sabre, and the trophy must be destroyed at the end of your meditation. If you have yet to complete a contract, have no appropriate trophies at hand, or seek to serve the Mantis God in other ways than as the god's assassin, you must instead offer your own vital fluid to He Who Walks in Blood by cutting yourself along the right arm with a sawtooth sabre. Such self-mutilation deals 1d6 points of damage to you, which cannot be healed during the hour of meditation without disrupting the obedience; after the meditation ends, the wounds can be healed by any means available. You gain a +2 profane bonus to confirm critical hits while wielding a sawtooth sabre. As long as you have a sawtooth sabre in each hand, you can use those blades to complete the somatic component of any spell you cast, and you treat sawtooth sabres as your divine focus for the casting of divine spells.",

In addition, your whip takes on the illusory appearance of a serpent, and you gain a +2 profane bonus to combat maneuver checks to trip opponents.

While in this form, you gain DR 10/- and immunity to acid, critical hits, disease, fire, infestations, poison, and precision damage (such as sneak attacks). You can speak, but you can't make physical attacks or manipulate objects, and you can't use somatic or material (including focus) spell components. You can fly at a speed of 10 feet and automatically succeed at Fly checks, and you can pass through small holes or narrow openings. You are treated as a Fine creature for the purpose of wind effects. While in sandstorm form, you can enter another creature's space once per round as part of a move action; this provokes an attack of opportunity as normal. When you enter a creature's space this way, that creature takes 3d6 points of slashing damage from abrading sands and is blinded for 1d6 rounds; the target can halve the damage and negate the blindness with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier).

			"3. **Flensing Storm (Sp)** Once per day, you can call out to Aldinach to conjure a deadly sandstorm from the Whispering Sands, which flenses those caught within down to nothing but bloody bones. This acts as an incendiary cloud spell, except that instead of fire damage it deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and 1d4 points of Constitution damage; this Constitution damage can be negated with a successful Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier). As a move action, you can direct a flensing storm to move up to 60 feet in any direction; this need not be a straight line. You are immune to the effects of your flensing storms and can see through them without penalty.",

You gain a hidden strike, with which you deal an extra 2d8 points of precision damage on melee attacks or ranged attacks from within 30 feet against foes who are unaware of your presence or who consider you an ally. You can also deal hidden strike damage to a target that you are flanking or that is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, but in these cases, the damage is reduced to 2d4. You can deal hidden strike damage against targets with concealment (but not total concealment). This stacks with other sources of hidden strike damage or sneak attack damage you already have. In addition, like a deadfall scorpion, you are adept at taking advantage of your foes' surprise. During a surprise round, you can take a full round's worth of actions, rather than a single standard action.",
			"3. **Sting of Aldinach (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, you can grow a golden-hued scorpion's tail, complete with stinger. This sting is a primary natural attack that deals damage as appropriate for a creature of your size (1d6 points of damage for a Medium creature). The sting is poisonous (injury; save DC 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Str damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 1 save). Like that of the immense black scorpion, your stinger strikes with blinding speed; you can make an attack with your stinger as a swift action (in addition to any other attacks or actions taken during that round). Once activated, your stinger remains for a number of minutes equal to your Hit Dice.",

Once per day as a standard action, you can speak a profane prayer to your goddess. When you do, each enemy within 60 feet must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or its skin partially turns to scales. This painful process deals 1d6 points of damage for every 2 Hit Dice you have, and the target is subject to the effects of a slow spell for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, a target takes only half the damage and negates the slow effect. Creatures need not hear you to be affected, but you must be able to speak to use this ability.

When spoken to a creature within 30 feet, the first unsolvable riddle you use in a day paralyzes the target as it searches for the answer; the creature must succeed at a Will save (DC = half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be affected by hold monster. The second unsolvable riddle is filled with subliminal messages; up to one creature for every 3 Hit Dice you have within 30 feet must succeed at a Will save (at the same DC as above) or be affected by a suggestion spell (with a suggestion of your choosing). The third unsolvable riddle uses such circuitous and warped logic that it shatters listeners' sanity; each creature within 60 feet must succeed at a Will save (using the same DC) or become confused.

In sphinx form, your face is eerily devoid of features (although they appear when you need them to eat, speak, make bite attacks, cast spells, and so on), and you gain blindsight to a range of 60 feet.

Likewise, in your dark heart you know that you are one of Baalzebul's favored servants, and this knowledge invests you with authority.

Your obsession with this macabre act has imbued you with mind-warping abilities to make Baalzebul proud. Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a single living creature within 60 feet.

Once per day as a standard action, you can declare your infernal birthright to inspire shock and awe in your enemies. Creatures within 30 feet that hear and oppose you must each attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or be stunned for 1 round and then shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice while contemplating your unholy power.

Once per day as a spell-like ability, you can cast storm of vengeance.",

When you do, you are immediately affected by protection from good if the dismissed outsider was good-aligned, or protection from evil if the outsider was evil-aligned, for a number of minutes equal to your Hit Dice.",
			"3. **Avernus's Iron Gates (Sp)** You have an unholy tie to Barbatos's demesne. Once per day, you can open a gate to Avernus, as per the spell gate, and use it either for planar travel or to call a pit fiend to your service. If you use it to call a pit fiend, this functions like the gate spell's calling creatures effect, but you are not required to pay the 10,000 gp material cost. If the pit fiend has more Hit Dice than you, you can't control it (as normal), but pit fiends tend to gladly obey the requests of powerful minions of Barbatos.",

A creature that is restrained with a successful grapple or otherwise rendered immobile cannot damage itself for that round. This ability lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.

If the outsider has a fly speed, you gain its fly speed while this ability is in effect, and you similarly gain any of the outsider's resistances and immunities. You do not gain any of this outsider's other statistics or abilities, and you only superficially appear to be the outsider, but you gain a bonus equal to twice your Hit Dice on Bluff checks to convince others that you are the outsider.

			"2. **Coerce Service (Su)** You understand and can exhibit the blatantly charismatic pull of your goddess, convincing others to aid you even if they normally might not. Once per day, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to bribe a target (treat as if you are attempting to improve an NPC's attitude toward you by one step) or an Intimidate check to coerce a target, you can use this ability to gain Besmara's blessing to ensure further cooperation. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on the Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and if you succeed, the target is immediately subject to a geas/quest effect. For as long as the effect lasts, you can concentrate as a standard action and learn whether the target is actively undertaking your orders or actively defying them.",
			"3. **Bribed Sea Monster (Sp)** The sea monsters at Besmara's behest follow your call at the goddess's command. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon one of the monsters Besmara has bribed or intimidated into aiding her followers. You must choose the monster from among the following list: adult sea dragon, sea serpent, or vouivre. The monster appears as if summoned via summon monster, and you must summon it into an appropriately watery environment. It follows your commands perfectly for 1 round per Hit Die you possess before vanishing. The monster doesn't follow commands that contravene Besmara's interests, such as blocking waterways or giving a navy better control of a sea region; issuing such untenable instructions, if they're egregious, could cause the monster to attack you.",

You can change the illusion by spending a move action in concentration. The illusion lasts until you create a new one or dismiss this effect as a swift action.",
			"3. **Rally Crew (Su)** The Pirate Queen lends you her divine panache, which fills all of your allies with courage and pride in their service to you. Once per day as a standard action, you can inspire all allies within 60 feet to greater speed and might. They each gain a 10-foot bonus to their speed and the benefits of heroism. On any attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks benefiting from this morale bonus, your allies take no penalties due to the effects of water or weather. The bonus lasts for 1 hour per Hit Die you possess. As an immediate action, you can cause any number of creatures who disobey your orders to lose this bonus.",

			"3. **Pirate Queen's Curse (Su)** You know that the Pirate Queen's enemies are destined to suffer, and you can deliver her wrath personally. Three times per day, you can channel a curse through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you make the attack roll. On a hit, the target is cursed unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw to negate the effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). The curse causes the target to be sickened for a number of days equal to your Hit Dice; furthermore, during this period, any creatures flanking the target or against which it is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC deal an additional 1d6 points of damage with every successful hit. This extra damage applies to the attack that delivers the curse. In addition, all creatures with a swim speed have a starting attitude of hostile toward the target. This is a 7th-level curse effect. The curse cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed through break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.",

You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Disable Device checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

You can affect constructs with magic as if they were living creatures. Once per day, you can target a construct with a spell or spell-like ability, and the spell resolves as if the construct's creature type were humanoid.

By applying Brigh's deep insights into efficient time management and technical innovation, you can craft items in spare moments squeezed in while adventuring or otherwise serving your god's ideals. When crafting magic items while adventuring, you can devote 4 hours each day to creation and take advantage of the full amount of time spent crafting instead of netting only 2 hours' worth of work. In addition, you can use fabricate once per day as a spell-like ability.

As a swift action, you can alter your body to incorporate construct-like features that protect you from physical damage. The transformation is subtle, such as adding metal reinforcements along your bones or small, auxiliary clockwork counterparts to your vital organs. The transformation grants you DR 3/- and lasts for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds need not be consecutive. Dismissing the effect is a free action.",

The golem follows your commands perfectly for 1 round per Hit Die you possess before vanishing.",

			"2. **Drinking Buddy (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, you can create an illusory double of yourself that appears in a square adjacent to you. Your double acts on your initiative count, and can move up to your speed each round. It always attempts to flank with you against a single target you designate. If it must use Acrobatics to avoid an attack of opportunity during this movement, your double uses your bonus. Though your double can't attack, it is treated as threatening adjacent squares for the purposes of flanking with you. Anyone attacking your double or otherwise physically interacting with it can attempt a Will save (DC 25) to recognize the double as an illusion. The double has your AC, and if any hit would deal damage to it, the double dissipates. An opponent who recognizes your double as an illusion can't be flanked by it. The double lasts 1 round for every Hit Die you possess or until it is hit with an attack, whichever comes first.",
			"3. **Intoxicating Strike (Su)** Once per day, you can declare one of your attacks an intoxicating strike. You must declare your use of this ability before you attempt the attack roll.

An intoxicated creature takes a -4 penalty to AC, on attack rolls, and on skill checks, and its movement is reduced by 10 feet.",

The bralanis follow your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to their home in Elysium. The bralanis don't follow commands that would cause them to commit evil acts or restrict freedom solely for the sake of law. Such commands not only earn refusal and scorn from the bralanis, but could cause the bralanis to attack you if the command is particularly egregious.",

A potion created in this way heals 3d8 points of damage plus 1 point of damage for every Hit Die you possess (to a maximum of 3d8+15). The holy water you create is more potent than usual, dealing 4d4 points of damage to an undead creature or evil outsider, and 2d4 points of splash damage to each such creature within 5 feet of the point where the flask hits. Holy water and potions created in this way last for 1 hour. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).",

While unobserved, balance the coin or button on the edge of a weapon, flip it into the air, and call out how it will land. If you are right, find someone else to give the coin or button to-perhaps even its original owner-and explain how the token will bring good fortune. Gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls with the type of weapon (for example, short swords) you used to balance the object. If you can't find someone to take the coin or button after an hour, or if you were wrong in calling how it will land, hide it somewhere where it will be found and where the finder might deem himself lucky for discovering it.

			"2. **Confident Gambler (Su)** While many creatures rely on their luck, your faith allows you to control your luck to a small degree. Except when performing Chaldira's obedience, you can determine as a free action how an ordinary coin you flip or ordinary die you toss will land. If you use this ability for your own personal gain to the detriment of someone who is innocent or less fortunate than you are, you are likely to incur Chaldira's disfavor and lose the use of this boon until you atone, as set forth in the [atonement](spell/atonement) spell. When used to recover the use of this boon, an [atonement](spell/atonement) spell has an additional monetary cost equal to the amount you gained due to the misuse of this ability. If you instead return the amount you gained to the person you acquired it from (or to the person's family, community, friends, or other appropriate connection) and provide a genuine apology, then the [atonement](spell/atonement) spell has no additional cost.",
			"3. **Auspicious Accuracy (Su)** Your ability to control your luck expands to desperate situations of life and death. A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once per day), when you would normally roll a miss chance percentage, you can instead choose whether or not to hit. This ability manifests as a lucky turn of the blade or an awkward lunge that appears to be an overcorrection but actually places your attack right where it needs to be. Observers are likely to consider you exceptionally fortunate in your attacks, rather than suspect that you are supernaturally guided to bypass effects that would cause you to miss.",

It then moves up to 120 feet as you mentally direct its movement (doing so is a move action that requires concentration). The image of the Pale Horse ignores difficult terrain and can walk over water or other surfaces that would normally not bear a creature's weight, but it cannot fly. Any creature whose space the image of the Pale Horse passes through must succeed at a Fortitude save or take a -6 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, as if it had suddenly aged to become venerable. Creatures (like dragons) that normally gain benefits from aging do not gain any benefits, and they instead take the ability score penalties described above. These penalties do not stack with themselves or with existing penalties from aging. A creature can resist the effects of the Pale Horse with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A creature can be affected by the Pale Horse only once per round, regardless of how many times the Pale Horse moves through its space. This is an aging curse effect.",

These effects last for 1 minute, after which the vines crumble to dust. Creatures able to move through natural undergrowth unhindered ignore the effects of this ability. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
			"3. **Shambling Form (Su)** Once per day as a move action, you can assume the form of a Huge shambling mound. You gain a +8 size bonus to Strength, a -2 penalty to Dexterity, a +4 size bonus to Constitution, and a +6 natural armor bonus. You gain a constrict special attack and two slam attacks that each deal 2d8 points of damage plus your Strength modifier and have the grab special attack. You gain darkvision (60 feet) and resistance 20 to electricity and fire. In addition, if you are struck with an attack that deals an amount of electricity damage that is less than your resistance, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level. You lose these temporary hit points after 1 hour. You return to your true form after 10 minutes or when you take a free action to dismiss this ability, whichever comes first.",

A creature reduced to 0 Charisma in this way is permanently transformed into a hideously deformed aquatic version of itself; it gains the mutant template, the aquatic subtype, and the amphibious quality, and its alignment becomes chaotic evil. When this transformation occurs, all Charisma damage the creature has suffered is instantly cured. Such mutants are initially friendly toward you. This transformation is a curse effect.",

In your hybrid form, you are immune to damage from water pressure, gain the ability to breathe water, and gain a swim speed equal to twice your base speed. Your head becomes that of a viperfish, granting you a bite attack that deals damage as for a creature two size categories larger than you (2d6 for a Medium creature). In addition, a single long tentacle sprouts from your body, granting you a tentacle secondary natural attack that deals damage as for a creature of your size category (1d4 for a Medium creature). This tentacle has the grab and constrict abilities; the constrict damage is equal to your tentacle damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier. While grappling a creature with your tentacle, you are not considered grappled and do not take any of the penalties associated with that condition.

If the target fails a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), it is turned into an infernal statue made of black marble and hardened soul flesh as per flesh to stone.

You must use a standard action to activate this ability and can dismiss it as a free action. The duration need not be used all at once, but must be used in 1-minute increments. Additionally, once per day while this ability is active, when you use it to see a creature that is invisible or under a blur or displacement effect, you can invoke the Iron Lord's unholy power to strike fear into its heart as a swift action, giving it the shaken condition for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice and removing the blur, displacement, or invisibility effect.

A successful saving throw negates this effect. When this ability targets multiple creatures, you can choose to exclude one or more of them.

Three times per day, you can cast harm as a spell-like ability.",
			"3. **Hell's Sadistic Angel (Sp)** Doloras is well versed in ways to cause unholy pain to even the strongest and most resourceful souls, and you have painstakingly studied her torturer's techniques. Once per day as a standard action, you can call down your evil goddess's dispassionate, unholy might upon all enemies in a 30-foot radius centered anywhere within 100 feet of you. When you do, otherworldly chains forged in the infernal morass of Hell itself latch on to your enemies' feet, rooting them in place for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. Affected creatures cannot damage the hellish chains nor magically escape them; if they attempt to use teleportation magic or a similar ability to circumvent the chains, the spell or ability fails and is wasted. While they are rooted, affected creatures take 2d6 points of piercing damage and 4d6 points of fire damage per round as blazing, hellish needles stab into the exposed portions of their bodies (affected creatures begin taking damage as soon as they are under this ability's effects). A creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw is only held in place for half the number of rounds and takes the listed damage only once."

This damage is considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This additional damage is never doubled upon a critical hit.",

You have studied Eiseth's tactics carefully and can imitate them to advance your goddess's dark glory. Once per day, you can cast ride the lightning as a spell-like ability.

Once per day as a standard action, you can summon two advanced salamanders or two advanced brimorak demons as though using summon monster VII.",
			"3. **Salamander's Heart (Su)** Although they dwell in the Plane of Fire, salamanders have long ranked among Flauros's favorite minions he sends to impose his will upon realms beyond the Abyss. As one of his chosen few, you can take on aspects of this favored race. Your skin turns a deep crimson, and your body emanates intense heat. You gain the fire subtype and DR 10/magic. Your touch and any metallic weapons you wield deal 1d6 points of fire damage, but your equipment is not damaged by this effect. At will, as a standard action you can transform your legs into a salamander-like tail or back again. This tail reduces your base speed by 10 feet, to a minimum of 20 feet, but grants you a tail slap natural attack (dealing 2d6 points of damage for a Medium creature) with reach 5 feet greater than your natural reach. You also gain the grab and constrict special attacks; your constrict damage is equal to your tail slap damage plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier.",

You permanently gain fire resistance 30. If you are immune to fire or gain permanent immunity to fire at a point after you gain this boon, you instead gain cold resistance 30, as your flesh and blood burn so hot that they protect you against such extremes.",
			"3. **Awaken Flames (Su)** Even fire itself must answer to mighty Flauros, and at his whim, flames take on lives of their own. You have developed a method of doing the same. Once per day as a standard action, you can call forth an elder fire elemental from any flame source. Alternatively, you can activate this ability as a swift action while you cast a spell with the fire descriptor, causing an elder fire elemental to manifest in a space adjacent to you. The elemental appears immediately, and you can direct its actions as a free action via telepathy. The elemental is considered called, not summoned, and remains your minion for 1 hour. Unlike a normal elemental, this elder fire elemental is chaotic evil in alignment and has the Chaotic and Evil subtypes.",

By stabbing the earth below you with your spear, you cause a deadly eruption that engulfs a foe. This allows you to cast maximized pyrotechnic eruption once per day. You must be wielding a spear to use this ability.",
			"3. **Vengeful Annihilation (Sp, Su)** The wrath of Flauros fills you, causing your might to intensify with every wound-and erupting from you in a killing wave when you finally fall. Whenever you have taken at least 1 point of damage per Hit Die, your attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage, and the save DCs of fire spells and effects you create increase by 1. Once per day, you can cast fire shield (warm shield) on yourself as a swift action. When you die, your body explodes in a wave of ash and magma, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot burst; a target that succeeds at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Constitution modifier) takes half damage. Your body is destroyed by this eruption, but your gear is not. If you die in this way, you can be restored to life only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish.",

As a standard action, you shout shocking truths at the target. The target is affected as per heretic's tongue (see page 72). If you successfully deny a divine spellcaster access to its class abilities, that target must succeed at a second saving throw at the end of the spell's effect, whether shortened or not (DC = 10 + your Wisdom modifier + half your Hit Dice). If the target fails, its abilities do not return until it receives the benefits of an atonement spell.",

Additionally, the critical threat range of any heavy flail you wield increases by 1 (this increase stacks with that from the Improved Critical feat).",

The appearance of the corpse doesn't change, but it miraculously provides enough sustenance to feed a number of creatures equal to your Hit Dice. Creatures that eat from this communal table, a process that takes 1 hour, gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls and Will saving throws instead of the usual +1 morale bonus. It also provides those who eat from the corpse with the benefits of the spell regenerate.",

During the 24 hours following your meditation, you can grant yourself and up to four other creatures within 30 feet a +4 profane bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks as a move action. You can maintain these bonuses as a free action for up to 1 round per Hit Die, after which you must meditate again to regain the ability.

When you successfully grapple a creature, you can transfer that creature into your coils; this works like the swallow whole universal monster ability. Your coils have AC 17 and 18 hp when an entrapped creature attempts to cut itself free. Your coils heal quickly while this ability is in effect, allowing you to transfer another (or the same) creature into your coils 1 round after a creature cuts itself free. Activating three-headed serpent is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",

You too have learned to embrace the starlit beauty of the evening, knowing that the darkness will give you shelter whether you are predator or prey. You gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet, or extend your existing darkvision by 30 feet. You need only half the normal amount of sleep or rest each day to avoid becoming fatigued.",

Those enemies you fell are bound and ripe for your stewpot, should you feel less than charitable in victory. When you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can forgo any additional damage to immediately bind your foe in sticky webs, paralyzing it and pinning it in place. This functions as a [hold monster](spell/hold_monster) spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.

If it fails, the target is driven mad by thoughts and concepts far beyond what the brain can handle, as if the workings of Thassilonian magic were revealed to a common ant; it is affected as if by the insanity spell.

As a swift action, you can provide divine guidance to your allies in combat. Allies able to see you gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls.

			"With the assistance of another priest of Hanspur or by yourself, simulate the act of drowning. You can do this by fully submerging yourself in a body of water, exhaling all of your breath, and painfully inhaling water instead of air. Alternatively, you can lie on your back with your head at a lower elevation than your legs while water is slowly poured on your face and up your nose. If you choose the latter method, you must cover your face with a cloth while the water is poured. When you conclude this simulated drowning, contemplate your life and how your goals coincide with the teachings of Hanspur and the Six River Freedoms. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Survival checks attempted while on or near rivers. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either a sacred bonus or a profane bonus the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

The target of this ability can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect.

You must have enough water to form the weapon, an amount equal to the weapon's normal weight. Once formed, the weapon behaves as a weapon of its type with an enhancement bonus of +1.

			"Antipaladins of Hei Feng are self-sufficient wanderers who roam the land, offering great aid or-more commonly-great destruction at their own whims. They are rarely deceptive about their intentions, and desperate people can ask them for help, knowing that these antipaladins will keep their word if they agree to offer assistance. Any slight, however, will be met with overwhelming retribution. The code of Hei Feng's antipaladins contains the following adages.",
			"",
			"- The blessing of the storm comes in lightning. I am permitted to offer sincerely altruistic aid, so long as that aid comes in the form of violence visited upon others.",
			"- The clouds warn of coming rain. My wrath may be sudden, but it is honest. I may trick a foe with boasts or cunning, but I do not pretend to be a friend to those I intend to harm. Such sycophancy is cowardice.",
			"- The wind cannot be chained. I stay nowhere for long, and I do not abide oaths that try to restrain me for longer than a month. If I make such promises, they have no weight, and those who trust them are fools.",
			"- My last word is a thunderclap. None shall insult me, or my god, without paying a terrible price. My revenge will be unstoppable and absolute.",

For example, if you would be hit by a sneak attack dealing an extra 3d6 points of damage and you had two cards remaining, you could reduce the sneak attack damage to 1d6 (these dice are removed before being rolled). Once a card absorbs a damage die, it disappears. Unused cards disappear at the end of each day.",

Your body still retains enough rigidity that you can speak, wield objects and weapons, and wear items like armor.

The baregara follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home in the Abyss. The baregara doesn't follow commands that would cause it to act in lawful, good, or otherwise beneficial ways.

In emulation of this horrific method of reproduction, you have been granted the ability to curse a foe to rebirth itself-when you do so, its new and horrible form bursts from the husk of its old flesh. This works like the witch's forced reincarnation hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with reincarnate, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a wish or miracle spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. If you have the hex or hex arcana class feature, you can use the DC for your hexes instead.",

This could be a personally embarrassing detail, or it could be secret plans to attack or sabotage you, at the GM's discretion. Additionally, creatures that fail their Will saving throws become confused for as long as you maintain this supernatural ability (once you've activated it, maintaining the Hellfire Testament is a free action). You can dismiss the Hellfire Testament as a free action, and you can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice.

If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice it cannot make any bodily contact with you, including attacking with manufactured weapons, as if it were a good-aligned summoned creature and you were affected with a protection from good spell.

			"- Milani's priests understand that a revolutionary's work is often rewarded with death, and they accept that they may one day be called to die for a cause. Fortunately, the goddess teaches that the truly devout who are martyred saving other people from death or tyranny will rise again in some way-perhaps even immediately, though being reborn in the faith is much more likely.",
			"- Some priests claim to be the incarnations of past followers of the goddess, able to access memories of past lives with the proper magic and meditation. A follower born after Milani ascended to godhood (about a century ago) can attempt to search for his past lives' memories by casting legend lore, which Milani grants only for this purpose to clerics, inquisitors, and warpriests as a 4th-level divine spell. The first time a caster attempts this use of the spell, he rolls 1d4-1 to determine the number of specific followers of Milani whose memories he accesses; each time he uses the spell, it reveals only information known to those individuals. If the result of the roll is 0, the caster can access no memories, either because he is not a reincarnated follower of Milani or because the goddess has not made his past lives' memories available."

			"3. **Accept the Flame (Su)** Three times per day, you can gain immunity to fire for a number of rounds per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. Track any fire damage you take during this time. For 1 minute after you end the effect, your body becomes uncomfortably warm, and once as a standard action you can use a melee touch attack to deal an amount of fire damage equal to the damage your immunity prevented (maximum 10 points of fire damage for every Hit Die you have) and cause the attack's target to catch fire. A successful Fortitude save halves the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier). If you do not touch another creature before the end of this minute, you take all of the damage your immunity prevented-neither fire resistance nor fire immunity can reduce this damage.",

Each round that they're on fire, affected creatures take an additional 1d6 points of fire damage per 6 Hit Dice you have (maximum 4d6). If you begin your turn within 15 feet of a creature taking damage from this ability, you gain fast healing 10 for 1 round.",

Creatures killed while on fire from this ability are immediately reduced to ashes, leaving behind no remains.",

For a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, Malebolge's flames aid you and up to four allies within 30 feet of you. The flames encase affected creature's bodies, providing a +4 profane bonus to AC and immunity to fire.

Up to four targets of your choice in the area must each succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be stunned for 1 round and staggered for another 3 rounds by the raw power of Hell.

Twice per day as a standard action, you can invoke the names of the Lord of the Sixth. All enemies that can hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice.

Three times per day as an immediate action, when you step into any natural body of water, you can cause water within a 30-foot radius of where you stand to churn. You are unaffected by this churning. Any other creature wading or swimming in this water must attempt Swim checks as if the water were one category rougher; wading creatures must attempt DC 10 Swim checks, creatures swimming in calm water must make DC 15 Swim checks, creatures swimming in rough water must attempt DC 20 Swim checks, and creatures swimming in stormy water must attempt DC 25 Swim checks. If the water has a natural current, that current becomes fast moving. If the current was already fast moving, the DC of the Swim or Strength check to avoid going under increases to 15 + half your Hit Dice. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or until you leave the water, whichever is first.",
			"3. **Healing Waters (Su)** You have learned that the waters can take life, but also that they can give it. Three times per day, you can hold a creature underwater for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice. Each round, as long as the creature is submerged and holding its breath, it is healed of 1d8 + 5 points of damage. If the creature doesn't hold its breath, it doesn't receive healing that round. If you submerge a creature and heal it for fewer rounds than half your Hit Dice, it still counts as one use of this ability.",

Once per day as a standard action, you may call out the name of a loved one you have lost. All opponents within hearing distance must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. If you cause at least one creature to become shaken in this way, you gain a +2 profane or sacred bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on saving throws against spells with the mind-affecting descriptor for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.",
			"3. **Final Strike (Sp)** You can call down your goddess's cleansing wrath upon your wretched enemies. Three times per day as a standard action, you can cause a great column of white light to pour from the heavens that acts as a fireball, except the damage is force damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC = 13 + your Wisdom modifier) halves this damage.",

All foes within a 30-foot, cone-shaped burst are staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, and take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect.",
			"3. **Mantle of Tragic Grace (Sp)** You drape yourself in tragic glamor, and your longing for rest puts you beyond the reach of mortal harm for a lingering moment. As a standard action, you can activate this mantle, which acts as a globe of invulnerability. You may use this ability for a number of rounds each day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds do not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss this effect as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",

The robe functions as a lesser globe of invulnerability except that it only excludes hostile spell effects of 3rd level or lower. Any spell that would force you to attempt a saving throw; cause you to take hit point damage, negative levels, ability drain, or ability damage; or end your life is considered hostile for the purposes of this effect.

Using this ability doesn't change the casting time or other qualities of the spell, but you must make a melee attack with your quarterstaff against the target's AC rather than a touch attack against its touch AC. If you hit the target, you deal quarterstaff damage as well as discharge the spell effect. You can hold the charge as normal when delivering a touch spell through a quarterstaff.",

You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). These rounds don't need to be consecutive, and you can activate and deactivate your aura as a free action. You and any allies within 20 feet of you increase your caster levels by 1d4. Roll this die when you activate this ability and use the same value for all who gain this benefit.

You can use this ability after you have rolled, but must declare the use of this ability before you know the result of the check. If this roll is made as part of a Sleight of Hand check or game of chance, the luck bonus is instead equal to your total Hit Dice. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1). Once you have used all of your daily uses of this ability, you can attempt to use this ability one additional time, but there is a 50% chance that instead of gaining a luck bonus on the roll, you instead take a penalty equal to the bonus you would have received.",

Wielding a dagger with your tail in this way does not count as two-weapon fighting for the purposes of determining penalties to attacks made with weapons wielded in your hands. In any round during which you don't make a full attack but you wield a dagger with this tail, it makes a single attack against an adjacent enemy of your choice-if it hits, it deals no damage but distracts the foe enough so that you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against that target.

Three times per day as a move action, you can use this power to improve the next melee or ranged attack you make during your turn; if you are in an area of bright light, you can instead use this ability as a swift action.

If this attack is made using a firearm, the result is never a misfire, regardless of the attack roll. If the attack threatens a critical hit, the critical threat is automatically confirmed.

Any creature struck by your weapon must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be permanently blinded. Unlike normal brilliant energy weapons, this weapon is made of pure sunlight and can harm undead creatures normally. Against undead foes that are particularly vulnerable to sun, the weapon also functions as a disrupting weapon.",

Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by an attack or affected by a spell or effect, you can transfer its effects to a creature within 30 feet. This creature must be one that is under your control or command or that otherwise considers itself subordinate to you. You suffer no effects from a transferred effect. If the effect is one that affects multiple creatures (such as horrid wilting or a breath weapon), the recipient of the transfer can suffer its effects twice. You can decide to transfer the effect or attack after the results of the attack rolls or saving throws have been revealed.",
			"3. **Avatar of Strife (Sp)** You can call upon the Shining Scourge to fill you with his burning light, which spreads mindless warfare everywhere you go. Once per day as a standard action, you can begin radiating an aura of blazing light equivalent to that created by daylight, lasting 1 round per Hit Die. Any creature within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) at the start of its turn or be compelled to attack the nearest conscious creature that round (similar to the \"attack nearest creature\" result of the confusion spell). Worshipers of Nurgal are immune to this effect. As a swift action, you can command a creature affected by your aura to direct its attacks against a creature of your choice within the effect's 60-foot area; this designation lasts until the effect ends.",

Once per day, you can send yourself into a determined state that lasts for 1 minute.

			"3. **Holy Brand of the Sun (Su)** Your devotion to the Dawnflower allows you to wrap your weapon in her cleansing flames to better bring justice to her foes. For a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds), you can cause flames to wreathe your weapon. Any weapon you hold while this ability is active becomes a +1 flaming burst weapon. (You can use this ability on a ranged weapon, but can't apply it directly to a piece of ammunition.) If you drop the weapon or give it away, the flame effect on that weapon immediately ends. If the weapon you hold has an enhancement bonus greater than +1, use the higher bonus. Activating or deactivating this ability is a free action, and the rounds in which you use the ability don't need to be consecutive.",

You can add your exalted levels to any cleric levels you have to calculate the power of your channel energy ability. In addition, you can spend three of your daily uses of your channel energy ability to channel an especially powerful burst of healing that manifests as a bright burst of sunlight around you. Anyone healed by your channeled energy sunburst who is currently suffering from poison or a nonmagical disease can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +2 sacred bonus to end the poison or disease effect.",
			"3. **Angelic Ally (Sp)** Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a movanic deva to aid you. You gain telepathy with the movanic deva to a range of 100 feet. The deva follows your commands perfectly for 1 minute for every Hit Die you possess before vanishing back to its home. The deva doesn't follow commands that would cause it to violate its alignment by committing evil acts, and it could even attack you if the command is particularly egregious.",

You can channel positive energy by consuming a single use of your lay on hands ability instead of two uses. If you don't have the lay on hands class feature (or if you have lay on hands but can't use it to channel positive energy), you instead gain a +4 sacred bonus on Heal checks.",
			"3. **Sunburst Strike (Sp)** Once per day, you can channel the effects of sunburst through your weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast sunburst, as well as taking normal weapon damage. The sunburst effect you generate affects only the target you have struck, not an area of effect as it would normally. If you miss with your attack, the sunburst ability is wasted.",

In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of Dawnflower's Mercies teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae's arms.",

			"**Initial Benefit:** You take no penalty on attack rolls for using a scimitar to deal nonlethal damage. If your attack with the scimitar would normally deal additional damage (such as via sneak attack, the flaming weapon special ability, or the like), this additional damage can be nonlethal damage. You can also alter spells with the fire, good, or light descriptor and inflict spells so that the damage they deal is nonlethal damage instead. You can choose to apply this effect as the spell is cast.",

			"**Advanced Benefit:** Once per round as you strike a foe with a weapon and deal nonlethal damage with that attack, you regain 1d6 hit points as the warmth of Sarenrae's approval and the conviction that you are doing the right thing to minimize suffering infuses your body and soul. If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points. You can gain the benefit of this healing only once per round, regardless of how many successful attacks you make with the weapon.",

The target can resist this transformation if it wishes with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A transformed creature's type becomes construct, and it gains all traits of the construct type, including lack of a Constitution score. The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait. A transformed creature must be wound once per day with a special key (which appears as part of this transformation); as the key must be inserted into the creature's back, this requires either a successful DC 25 Dexterity or Escape Artist check or another creature's assistance. If the creature is not wound by midnight each night, it becomes immobile and helpless until wound again. A creature transformed into a clockwork doll becomes mindless, with an Intelligence score of 0. It can't use any supernatural or spell-like abilities it had prior to transforming, nor can it cast spells. It also loses all feats and skill ranks. A clockwork doll follows your commands to the letter, but otherwise it remains motionless and takes no actions on its own (unless you command it to react in certain ways, such as serving as a room guardian). This transformation can be reversed only by break enchantment, miracle, polymorph any object, or wish. If the clockwork doll is slain, the creature can be brought back to life via true resurrection. You can only have one clockwork doll under your command at a time. If you create a second clockwork doll, the first one must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it succeeds, it reverts to its previous form with no memories of the time spent as your clockwork doll, but if it fails this save, the clockwork doll crumbles to rubble and is destroyed. If you are slain, any clockwork doll you've created automatically reverts to its previous form (no save required to avoid destruction).",

Your arms become boneless and flexible, with sucker-covered, starfish-shaped \"hands.\" While you can still manipulate objects and wield weapons with these appendages, they also grant you two tentacle primary natural attacks. Each tentacle deals damage appropriate to your size (1d6 if you are Medium). These tentacle attacks have a reach 5 feet greater than your normal reach, and you gain the grab and constrict abilities (your constrict damage is equal to the damage you deal with one of your tentacles plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier); you can grab a creature up to one size category larger than you this way.

When you are targeted by an effect based on alignment or patron deity, you can choose to be treated as having the alignment and faith of the creature originating the effect (you don't need to know that creature's alignment or faith to make this choice). You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity. Making this choice does not require an action, or even awareness that you are being targeted (in which case the ability always functions as best benefits the character in that situation). In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities. Once per week, you can choose to perform the obedience of any lawful or good deity with which you are familiar instead of Sifkesh's obedience. This still grants you your normal benefits from Sifkesh, not those from the other faith.",
			"3. **Baptism of Sin (Su)** Your unholy magic infects the souls of mortal creatures, washing away their morality and drawing them into the Lady of Heresy's tender embrace. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting spells, that creature becomes filled with false but nevertheless convincing memories of having committed a horrific sin. A nonevil and nongood target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become staggered for 1 round, while a good target must succeed at this Will save or become nauseated for 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to baptism of sin for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect.",

You can cast phantasmal killer three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.",
			"3. **Broken Angel (Ex)** Like that of your Abyssal mistress, your body has fallen to pieces. Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts. You are immune to effects that cause severed limbs or that arise from severed limbs (including the beheading effect of a vorpal sword) and also to bleed effects and bleed damage. You automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points.",

Unlike with the spell, you are not limited to existing forms; you could turn the target into a three-headed nymph or a centaur-like creature made only of human body parts, for example (although this does not apply to inanimate forms, such as turning a human into a sculpture of soft clay or vice versa). You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle. If the resulting form would be lethal, the target gains a +4 bonus on the save. Unlike for a normal polymorph any object spell, changes you make this way can be undone only by a wish or miracle spell or by another use of this ability.",

These temporary hit points stack with multiple uses of this ability (but not with temporary hit points from other sources), and last for 1 minute or until depleted.

Your physical appearance becomes darkly beautiful and sexually appealing, granting you a +2 profane bonus to your Charisma score. As long as you do not have an armor bonus to your Armor Class, you gain a profane bonus to your AC and on Fortitude saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier.

The blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The blade lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level, though the blade immediately vanishes if it leaves your hand.

You gain the see in darkness supernatural ability allowing you to see in areas of even magical darkness. In areas of dim light or darker, you can move as if affected by [air walk](spell/air_walk).

			"3. **Sculptor's Strike (Su)** The strike of your weapons causes a specified foe to calcify and harden into stone, bit by bit, eventually transforming that enemy into a favored child of Xoveron. To use sculptor's strike, you must first designate a foe in sight within 30 feet as a standard action. Once you've designated the foe, whenever you deal damage to that creature with a melee weapon (including unarmed strikes and natural weapons), the creature takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain in addition to the normal damage. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) this drain is reduced to 1 point. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a gargoyle (as per polymorph any object, except no Fortitude save is allowed) and must succeed at a Will save (using this ability's DC) or have its mind also become that of a gargoyle (as per baleful polymorph). When a creature is transformed in this way, all Dexterity drain caused by this effect is instantly healed and the creature's hit points are fully restored. The mental change can be reversed by any effect that removes curses, but the physical transformation can only be reversed by miracle or wish. You can activate sculptor's strike once per day to designate a foe, but once you've done so, that foe remains susceptible to your ability until you or it is slain. If you designate a different foe on a later day, any previously designated foe is no longer designated and can no longer be affected by this ability (unless you designate it once again at a later date).",

An affected creature counts as one size category smaller for the purpose of determining the size of weapons it can wield. If the creature is capable of making natural attacks with its arms, hands, or claws, the damage dealt by those attacks decreases as though the target were one size category smaller than its actual size.

On a failed save, the target painfully advances in years to the next age category. This aging can never have beneficial effects (such as if used against a true dragon). The target gains the penalties associated with the new age category to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, but its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores do not increase. This advanced age effect lasts for 24 hours before it fades and the affected creature returns to its normal age. A venerable creature (including one whose age has been magically accelerated via this ability to venerable, but not one whose age is temporarily advanced from other effects, such as per sands of time) that fails its saving throw against the aging effects of this ability is instantly slain, as if via old age (though the body instantly reverts to its original age appearance upon death). A creature slain by this effect can only be restored to life via miracle, reincarnate, true resurrection, or wish. This is a curse effect.",

When you use this ability, those in the area of effect are subjected to a powerful vision-that the world they are in becomes wrapped in the endless coils of the Ravager Worm. The affected creatures never glimpse Yhidothrus's head, and know only for the brief instant of eternity they spend in your time stop area that the world around them is fully wrapped in the coils of something more foul than they even imagined.",
