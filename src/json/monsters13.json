			"",
			"This gremlin's head and pointed ears are overlarge compared to the rest of its anatomy. Thin, often matted hair tops a drexin's scalp. Its light-starved, wizened flesh stretches taut across its bones, and its claws brush the ground as it walks. An average drexin stands 3 feet tall and weighs 25 pounds.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Gremlin](family/gremlin)",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Many gremlins believe that drexins were once nuglubs or jinkins who strayed too far underground. It's thought that after wandering into the twisted lands of Orv, these poor creatures stumbled upon a cabal of neothelids and were taken prisoner. Years in the massive worms' captivity both warped the gremlins' appearances and enhanced their minds. These lost gremlins became the drexins. The altered creatures emerged from the depths with new psychic abilities and an understanding of the neothelids' aberrant tongue. Perhaps the drexins escaped through sheer luck; perhaps their ascension to the upper levels of the Darklands is part of the machinations of the alien monstrosities in the deep heart of the world. Of course, the entire story is mere conjecture, and drexins quite possibly developed their psychic talents independent of neothelid influence.",
			"",
			"As their enlarged craniums suggest, drexin gremlins are particularly intelligent and have psychic talents that they gleefully employ to befuddle and maim the minds of others. While other gremlins revel in breaking objects, drexins enjoy tinkering with and disrupting thoughts, breaking the wills and minds of their targets rather than dismantling them physically.",
			"",
			"Drexins delight in sneaking up on spellcasters or artisans and using abilities such as babble, id insinuation I, and mental block to disrupt the process of spellcasting or magic item creation. If the victim senses the drexin's presence, the drexin typically casts mind thrust I or telekinetically flings an available object at the creature before fleeing. Drexins are physically weak and abhor physical combat unless they have a powerful ally to hide behind. This cowardice usually confines drexins to the sidelines of a fight.",
			"",
			"Like all gremlins, drexins are skilled trapsmiths. A drexin can imbue its traps with its own psychic spells. These masterpieces far surpass the mechanical devices made by other types of gremlins. Drexins are fond of creating and setting snares outside places of study, magic shops, and mages' homes. If a target springs the trap, the drexin emerges to torment its victim while she lies incapacitated, just outside the reach of aid. Drexins especially like to target other psychic creatures in this way, particularly those that are too powerful to confront directly. While drexins crave additional psychic power, most are incapable of more than a few spells. These wretched creatures therefore envy those who master the occult.",
			"",
			"From time to time, a drexin appears to a spellcaster or psychic and offers its services, usually proposing to increase the security of that person's home or workshop by building a number of traps in exchange for certain knowledge. Anyone foolish enough to accept the drexin's terms enjoys the benefits of a loyal trap crafter for a time. All too soon, however, the drexin gains the knowledge it seeks or grows bored with the arrangement. The unfortunate master returns to his home or study only to fall into the traps that once kept his secrets safe. The drexin then either kills or disables its former employer before stealing anything valuable and retreating to the sewers.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Among gremlinkind, drexins are feared for their mastery of mental magic. Different varieties of gremlins grudgingly cooperate with drexins to terrorize other creatures, but regard the psychic gremlins with intense distrust. Jinkins, pugwampis, and vexgits are even known to put aside their aversion to cold iron and construct \"mind shields\"- simple helms or plates of cold iron that are fastened around the head with straps to prevent drexins' psychic intrusions. These items do nothing to stop drexins' intrusions, but popular gremlin opinion keeps them in use. The fact that drexins speak Aklo as well as Undercommon further contributes to their otherness in gremlin society.",
			"",
			"In the Darklands, some lesser creatures believe drexins are capable of mental possession. The average drexin cannot truly dominate the mind or spirit, but individuals encourage this rumor, desiring the fearsome reputation it brings. Some drexins, however, grow more powerful than their kindred and gain class levels in kineticist or psychic. These drexins are particularly influential in gremlin society, and often command their own mobs of drexins or even other gremlins, who serve them out of fear and necessity rather than respect. Advanced drexins occasionally infiltrate humanoid society, enticing curious minds to explore mysteries best left undisturbed. Behind many academics who delve too deeply into maddening ancient secrets and spellcasters who open cursed magical tomes is an ambitious drexin joyfully luring others into psychic peril.",
			"",
			"Drexins prefer to dwell in the subterranean world, usually making their homes in caves and underground ruins. These gremlins commonly reside in the Darklands, and can be found among the slaves of the drow and serpentfolk of Sekamina. Drexins also form their own loosely organized societies in Nar-Voth, alongside jinkins, nuglubs, and vexgits. Still, the buzzing energy of thousands of minds in close proximity draws drexins to surface cities, where they often infest abandoned buildings and sewers.",
			"",
			"Though drexins usually betray their allies, occasionally creatures forge successful partnerships with these fey. Frauds claiming a connection to the spirit world or the minds of others sometimes use a hidden drexin's abilities to con patrons out of their hard-earned coin. A drexin might enter such a deal spurred by the promise of shared knowledge or gifts of materials to augment trap crafting. Ultimately, to avoid falling victim to a drexin's backstabbing, a drexin's partner must be just as conniving and cruel as the gremlin itself. Such a worthy creature might inspire a feeling akin to friendship in the drexin. If the partner ever doublecrosses the drexin, however, the arrangement ends. Drexins do not hold grudges; rather, they cultivate and nurture them over time, never forgetting the face or name of a betrayer. A drexin is a patient creature and may wait years to exact its revenge.",
			"",
			"Drexins are proud gremlins and do not typically worship deities or acknowledge any force greater than themselves. Contrary to their nature, however, some drexins pay homage to a being reverently named \"The Taker.\" This entity urges drexins to increase their own mental abilities by stealing the power of others, usually through a gruesome ritual in which the gremlin ingests portions of the brain of a murdered spellcaster or psychic. Drexins who follow The Taker typically dispatch their victims via traps, poison, or strangulation while those unfortunate souls sleep. While The Taker is not a deity and cannot grant spells to clerics, drexin oracles and shamans serve as the being's prophets and emissaries among drexin populations. Whether The Taker is an aspect of another deity, a powerful but mortal being with nefarious plans, or the creation of the gremlins' wild imaginations remains unknown."

Erinats don't care who wins the fights they start; they simply wish to be entertained by the largest brawls they can arrange. The mischievous gremlins delight in creating chaos, and are prone to making outrageous claims in the hope of sparking riots, aided by forcing bystanders to attack each other with random, often ridiculous objects.",

Yet as is rarely the case with such tales, nearly every word of these stories - no matter how unlikely or comic - proves near to the truth. Strange, capricious fey creatures that enjoy skimming whitecaps, flipping over solitary horseshoe crabs, and suicidally teasing dolphins and sharks, hanivers endlessly indulge a mad racial curiosity. Such is their obsession that every haniver must know what is under every rock, in every basket, and beneath every hat.",

The gremlins don't steal out of any sense of maliciousness, but rather out of curiosity and self ishness. The most intelligent occasionally even believe that they're trading, and leave behind old \"treasures\"-often strange or natural items that barely fit the description-in place of things they've claimed. Regardless, folklore advises those who have something stolen by a haniver to simply abandon it rather than face the frustration of attempting to rescue it-hence the tendency of sailors to blame the hanivers whenever something goes missing.",

			"**Collateral Damage (Su)** Whenever an attack fails to damage a hobkins, whether due to the attack result being too low, a miss chance, or a failure to penetrate DR, the hobkins can redirect the attack to any target that was in range of the original attack (if any). The attack can't be redirected against the original attacker. The attacker rolls a new attack and damage roll against the new target, and is considered to possess the [Improved Critical](feat/improved_critical) feat for the redirected attack. Hobkins delight in using this ability to force creatures to destroy their own prized possessions.",

			"Like many gremlins, hobkins enjoy destroying things that others cherish, but unlike their jinkin cousins, hobkins delight in manipulating people into destroying their own belongings. Their favorite strategy is to use their spell-like abilities and their Intimidate skill to frighten a family. A hobkins may wait at a child's window during a storm so that it appears pressed up against the glass when the lightning flashes, only to hide away when they check again. Once its victims work themselves into a frenzy, the gremlin gives them time to arm themselves, then reveals itself, leaping and floating out of reach to force panicked victims to throw anything at hand.",

The save is DC 14 + the Charisma modifier of the jinkin with the highest Charisma score (DC 16 for most groups of jinkins). Alternatively, the group of jinkins can attempt to infuse a magic item with a curse. The nature of this curse is determined randomly; half of these curses make the magic item unreliable (each time the item is used, there is a 20% chance it does not function), while the other half give the item a random requirement. A jinkin can take part in a tinkering only once per day, and may only tinker with a creature or object that isn't already cursed. Once a tinkering curse is in place, it is permanent until removed via an effect like remove curse. All jinkin tinkerings function as a curse created by a 6th-level caster.",

Well acclimated to the shadows, they hide in cramped quarters and attack larger creatures when they're strategically positioned. Jinkins commonly work with or near larger or more powerful creatures; these larger creatures provide cover for the jinkins' trickery. They use dimension door to exit any battle that goes badly, taking any stolen goods with them.",
			"",
			"Jinkins delight in leading larger creatures into dangerous caves or pits, usually by lunging out of the shadows to make a single sneak attack against a creature and then running away, taking care while \"fleeing\" to remain visible to their target so that they can lure the victim into a trap.",
			"",
			"Jinkins also hold dangerous grudges, and one might follow a creature that supposedly slighted it for weeks, looking for an opportunity to take revenge. This revenge can take many forms, from leading horses astray to contaminating food supplies to directing larger monsters toward the begrudged creature.",
			"",
			"One of the most direct and unwelcome revenges of the jinkins is the destruction or cursing of magical items. Many times they'll observe camped enemies from a distance and either steal an item to tinker with it or just use their tinkering magic at a distance to annoy the item's owner. Once a jinkin has worked its sabotage on a stolen item, the jinkin either grows bored with the item or may attempt to return it to its owner. Jinkin lairs are often cluttered with stolen items that bear curses the jinkins themselves have forgotten all about.",
			"",
			"Dwarves in particular hate jinkins, with numerous tales in their folklore telling of tragedy at the hands of the gremlins. The loathing is largely mutual.",

If combat doesn't come to them, they seek it out, entering villages and killing innocents by night.

A creature that harms the nuno, damages the nuno's home, or steals the nuno's belongings must also save against the curse with a -2 penalty. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to that nuno's curse for 24 hours. A creature under the effects of the nuno's curse experiences horrific swelling and hair growth in a location the nuno touched or that was associated with harming the nuno (for instance, a creature's foot if that creature kicked over the nuno's anthill). This swelling imparts a -2 penalty to Dexterity and causes the affected area to occasionally ooze or expel black pus. The DC to remove a nuno's curse with spells and abilities like remove curse is 10 higher than normal (24 for a typical nuno). A nuno can remove its curse as a standard action, and when a nuno dies, all its active curses end immediately. The effects of multiple nuno's curses don't stack. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Wax Locator (Su)** Any creature cursed by a nuno can spend 1 minute pouring molten wax into a spoon and then into a container of water, causing the wax to run in the direction of the nuno.

			"Nunos are fungus gremlins that live in anthills. Even young nunos appear as wizened old men, and the creatures are solitary hermits, living among ants in anthills and burrows in tropical regions. Though nunos are as spiteful as any other gremlins, they tend to keep to themselves and reserve their enmity for those who bother them-especially those who dare to harm a nuno's anthill home.",
			"",
			"Due to the relative difficulty of removing a nuno's curse via magic, the best options for a creature cursed by a nuno are to slay the nuno or parley with the creature. Since the curse could have triggered while the nuno wasn't present, both approaches are made easier by the nuno's wax locator ability. Though inherently grumpy, nunos are easily bribed with offerings of fruit or valuable objects, and can at times be swayed by a particularly well-constructed argument. They can also usually be persuaded by humanoids and fey they find beautiful, though a nuno's predilections are unpredictable at best, and they tend to loathe conventional beauty.",

These nuno ascetics still value their privacy, but they are sometimes willing to accept lavish bribes from pilgrims in exchange for sharing their wisdom. Nuno ascetics advance by class level, usually either as either monks or occult classes. They each develop a unique variation on the basic nuno's curse, which acts as a signature of sorts. Unlike most monsters with class levels, nuno ascetics add half their class level to the DC of their nuno's curse ability.",

They then wait nearby, both to laugh at the inevitable mishaps and to make sure their personal unluckiness is passed off on their victims.",

Their \"jokes\" tend to involve spikes and excrement, or sometimes pits full of spiders or campsites that flood with swamp water. Certainly only the pugwampis consider their jokes funny. As all pugwampis are somewhat deaf, when not trying to be stealthy, they tend to scream and yell loudly so they can hear themselves and each other.",
			"",
			"At some point in the distant past, pugwampis became enamored of gnolls, seeing in the beast-men a kindred form and thus aspiring to the height and deadly prowess of the savage warriors, whom they honor as gods. Gnolls, for their part, hate pugwampis even more than other creatures, mostly because of the gremlins' weakness and sickening fawning, though they sometimes keep the gremlins around just to torment them.",

On those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple specimens, groups of gricks do not appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks individual targets and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they were unable to damage the creature with their nonmagical weapons. Those that are familiar with gricks (especially dwarves, morlocks, and troglodytes) know the best strategy for dealing with them is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements.",
			"",
			"Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions when food is scarce in a given region, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but these sojourns are almost always out of necessity, and end as soon as the gricks find entrances to new subterranean lairs. They prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead, avoiding the open sky and going to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead.",

A griefgall must be implanted into a humanoid, and it quickly grows to full size, but can't survive more than a week without a humanoid host. It attempts to conceal its body and tendrils within the host's mouth. By extruding its filaments through the victim's neck and scalp, it externalizes its sensory organs, disguising them as a flowery headdress or garland entwined with the victim's hair.",

In reality, the griffon is less concerned with abstract concepts than with hunting food and protecting its own. While they can sometimes be trained or befriended to serve as mounts, griffons have no inherent affinity for humanoids, and frequently come into bloody conflict with civilized races over their attempts to secure their favorite food-horse flesh. City folk may marvel at the trained griffon's stately manner and 25-foot wingspan, but those farmers forced to share territory with its wild kin know to hurry home and secure their barns when the beasts' hunting shrieks split the sky.",
			"",
			"Griffons mate for life, and will often search for years to take vengeance over a slain mate or child. It was likely this innate stubbornness and fierce loyalty that first brought them into domestic use as mounts and guardians of treasure hoards. Despite the inherent danger, trade in captured griffons and stolen eggs is brisk, with their eggs worth up to 3,500 gp apiece and live young twice that. Characters eager for griffon mounts, however, should note that buying or forcibly domesticating intelligent creatures like griffons is still recognized as slavery by most good deities, and winning a griffon's allegiance of its own free will is no easy task. Reaching a mutually agreeable accord (or even a friendship) is a much more elegant and safe route to securing a griffon mount.",
			"",
			"Before it can be ridden in combat, a griffon requires practice bearing the weight of its rider. In order to be trained successfully, a griffon must first be helpful toward its trainer (possibly requiring a Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal check). After that, 6 weeks of practice and a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check is sufficient for the beast to be comfortable with its burden, and due to their intelligence, trained griffons can be treated as knowing every trick listed in the Handle Animal skill description, possibly even responding to new, simple requests made in Common.",

Grigs use their movement to their advantage, frequently jumping about their enemies or flying beyond their reach.",

This creature was so outraged by the metaphysical order of the multiverse that it became a kind of rogue deity dedicated to the ending of all other lives.

The least powerful of these lethal servants are called lesser deaths.",

This handful of treacherous artifacts calls forth a lesser death instead of a dire wraith when the skull card is drawn. The vast majority of lesser deaths are not bound within artifacts, though, and are free to wander the multiverse, spreading doom wherever possible. Their choices of victims sometimes seem capricious, and have birthed myriad rumors regarding their nature and purpose. Some claim that these creatures serve the whims of a hidden force in the multiverse, while others claim they select their victims according to some dark logic that only they fathom. While these creatures possess a wicked intelligence, they converse with no one and use their haunting rasps only rarely, in mockery of those who would defy them. On rare occasions, a group of these creatures converges and works together to deal death to a particularly powerful foe. When they do, they often come riding advanced albino cauchemars in a terrifying stampede, trampling the life from any who would impede their dread work.",

None are sure where this disdain stems from, but it is speculated that a squid is to an octopus for a grindylow what a dog is to a goblin dog for goblins. Incredibly fond of their similarly designed kin, grindylows believe octopuses to be the epitome of beauty, with squids being regarded as hideous freaks in comparison. There is no greater insult to a grindylow than being called a squid.",

The grogrisant has reappeared throughout history to test great Taldan heroes, and scholars disagree as to whether this is the same ageless mythic beast or a rare race of creatures. In either case, the mighty grogrisant has sired powerful offspring among the dire lions of the Whistling Plains north of the World's Edge Mountains. Their legendary heritage evident in their great size, lustrous hide, and rending claws, grisantian lions stalk the plains and mountains of northern Taldor. Haughty and powerful, grisantian lions seek easy meals but cannot resist an opportunity for a challenging fight, hurling themselves against large foes such as mammoths and giants to demonstrate their formidable attacks and supernatural resilience.",
			"",
			"A grisantian lion stands 14 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 8,000 pounds. Female grisantian lions are slightly larger than males.",
			"",
			"Descendants of an incredibly rare legendary beast, grisantian lions are themselves remarkably uncommon. Despite being few in number, grisantian lions are extremely hardy and long-lived. Their golden-hued hides, which retain some of their ancestor's legendary toughness, protect them from parasites as well as the rare attackers that dare to challenge them. A grisantian lion can easily live 2 centuries, and even longer in an area where regular prey is plentiful.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions are choosy regarding their mates, selecting only the largest and most powerful dire lions. Unlike regular lions, grisantian lions do not congregate in prides; they return to their solitary lives shortly after mating. Grisantian lion cubs grow quickly, becoming adults within a year of birth. A grisantian lion parent may teach its cub the rudiments of hunting and caring for itself, but grisantian lions are not nurturing by nature and rarely express affection for their offspring. A grisantian lion parent forces its cub away from its territory as soon as it can survive on its own, but before it becomes large enough to effectively challenge its parent for control of the area. A dire lion parent may attempt to incorporate its grisantian lion cub into its pride, but the creature's supernaturally resilient hide, savage cunning, and natural ferocity make it a danger to other dire lions, and the cub is quickly shunned. Adult grisantian lions therefore already have long experience in surviving on their own.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions are solitary hunters too large to stalk prey through tall grasses as effectively as their smaller cousins. Instead, grisantian lions bring their brute strength and intellect to bear, often targeting prey accompanied by their young; this forces the prey to either stand and protect their offspring, or flee and leave the lion an easy meal. Grisantian lions revel in challenging fights, and often attack larger animals just for the thrill of battle. Confident in their incredible hides, Grisantian lions have been known to attack mastodons, dinosaurs, hydras, and even dragons. Much like common lions, grisantian lions rarely attack humanoids when other food options are available. This reluctance is less out of a concern for self-preservation than because grisantian lions don't see humanoids as large enough to pose a worthwhile challenge. If a grisantian lion learns otherwise-such as if a well-placed arrow manages to overcome its resilient hide-it leaps eagerly into battle. Many hunters have attacked a grisantian lion, believing the creature to be disinterested or even skittish, only to have a lucky shot provoke the lion's assault.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although the grisantian lions' mythic progenitor inhabits the World's Edge Mountains, the lions have spread over much of Taldor and even into neighboring nations. Grisantian lions prefer warmer climates, but they can thrive in almost any environment. Their thick fur and dense flesh allow them to survive severely cold climates for short periods of time, generally long enough to hunt before returning to whatever warm cave or den they've made for themselves. Their fur becomes thicker in such climates within only a few weeks, helping to keep the creatures warm. In hot regions, grisantian lions tend to shed weight, becoming much lighter, and grow very fine coats, with the males losing their manes entirely.",
			"",
			"Aside from the urge to find a mate and produce offspring, which strikes only every few decades, grisantian lions are creatures of solitude. They deem mundane lions too weak and dimwitted to be worth their company for long, and they consider the irritation of sharing food and glory with another of their kind more bothersome than the difficulty of hunting alone. Grisantian lions rarely ally with larger, more powerful creatures, as their inclination is to fight such creatures to prove their prowess rather than work together.",
			"",
			"Hunters and trappers eagerly pursue rumors of grisantian lion activity, hoping to craft durable armor from its hide. Unfortunately for these hunters, the lion's skin nearly always loses its remarkable resilience after the beast is slain. Rumors of alchemical or magical treatments to preserve the hide are as pervasive (and, unfortunately, as frequently spurious) as rumors of the lions themselves.",
			"",
			"Grisantian lions can't speak, although they understand languages spoken in nearby communities. Unwise Taldan nobles sometimes sponsor hunts to recover grisantian lion cubs, but the creatures grow so quickly that keeping them caged is often a difficulty. Even young grisantian lions resist domestication with a petulant ferocity. With their keen intellect and ability to understand their keepers' language, grisantian lions escape confinement frequently; at best, a would-be master loses only a few servants or some livestock as the creature escapes back into the wild; at worst, the noble finds herself at the claws of the creature she sought to keep captive.",
			"",
			"Bargaining with a grisantian lion is difficult but not impossible; the creatures like to receive tributes of meat and other delicacies and can be convinced to provide short-term services in exchange for the promise of future spoils. Orcs, in particular, find a particular kinship with grisantian lions and sometimes attempt to convince one to join a raid against a well-fortified settlement, although such alliances are often temporary."

But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born.

This deals 2 points of Constitution damage per gryph chick, after which the hatchlings immediately take wing and fly away (if needed, use game statistics for a bat familiar to represent a hatchling). Removing implanted eggs requires a DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage.

Gryphs normally survive on carrion and small animals, but take on larger game when driven by hunger or if they feel threatened. Most disturbing is their means of reproduction. Gryphs are hermaphroditic and mate frequently, such that their egg pouches are rarely empty. When they encounter a suitable host-a warm-blooded creature of size Small or larger, ideally alone-the gryphs swoop down, latch on to the target, and implant their eggs directly into its flesh. As long as the target is conscious, the flock continues its assault, though if the target flees the area, the gryphs return to their nest. The eggs quicken swiftly once implanted, and gryph chicks hatch forth mere minutes later in a bloody birth that is often fatal to the host.",
			"",
			"Gryphs have a strange affinity for vermin, often lairing in close proximity to one or more insect swarms or vermin of Medium size or smaller. The insects avoid the gryphs instinctively, feeding off the remains of the flock's meals and on creatures too small for the gryphs to bother with.",

When it attacks, it stiffens its edges, making them blade-sharp. It races past its target and draws its entire length across any exposed flesh, leaving a long, deep, and painful slash that bleeds badly afterward. This is not the scroll's only means of attack, however. It can also wrap itself around a Medium or smaller creature in the blink of an eye, constricting it.

Gugs may cling for long hours to cave walls or just within dark side-caverns, lying in wait for prey to stumble too close.

Any creature struck by this blast is coated in the ooze's gunpowder residue (Reflex DC 27 negates). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Combust (Ex)** Because of its volatile nature, a gunpowder ooze may explode around open flames or sparks. Anytime a gunpowder ooze takes fire damage or damage from a ranged firearm attack, it spontaneously explodes, dealing 10d6 points of fire damage to all creatures and objects in a 30-foot cone facing the damage source that ignited the ooze (Reflex DC 27 half). If there is no method of determining the damage source's direction (such as a burst or spread centered on the ooze), the ooze instead combusts in a 15-foot-radius burst. A gunpowder ooze that combusts splits automatically. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Gunpowder Residue (Ex)** Whenever a gunpowder ooze successfully strikes a creature with its blast or slam attack, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex save or be coated in sticky gunpowder residue. Though the residue is not harmful in itself, if a creature covered in the residue uses a firearm, wields any weapon capable of dealing fire damage, takes fire damage from any source, or is exposed to a suitable spark, the residue immediately ignites and explodes, dealing 5d6 points of fire damage to the creature. Creatures adjacent to the exploding creature take half damage (which can be halved again with a successful DC 27 Reflex save). Gunpowder residue remains flammable for 24 hours, until it is ignited, or until it is scrubbed away (which requires soap, water, and at least 1 hour of bathing and washing). A creature can be covered in only up to one layer of gunpowder residue at a time. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

These oozes include additional horrifying elements that were not present in their parent substances. An admixture ooze has the advanced simple template, as well as a unique ability depending on its alchemical admixture. For instance, an admixture ooze with the power of an entangling shot cartridge entangles foes with its slam attack (Reflex DC 27 negates), whereas flare cartridge oozes can emit blinding flashes as a free action, dazzling sighted creatures within 20 feet for 1d6 minutes (Fortitude DC 27 negates)."

			"Creating a hag eye ooze requires 2 weeks. This time is reduced if the brewer is working cooperatively. For each additional member of a coven involved in the process, the creation time is lessened by 2 days, to a minimum creation period of 3 days. During this period, various nutrients and ingredients must be added to the cauldron in which the ooze is brewed. As the ingredients are added the hag must consult strange texts and foul recipes to assure proper creation. If she misses a step or poorly measures a reagent, the necessary arcane energies to create the hag eye ooze do not properly bind to the creature's nascent form. If successful, she then begins a 24-hour ritual, during which the cauldron holding the brewing ooze is bombarded with spells. This ritual and spellcasting culminates in the addition of a hag eye - preferably from the hag creator. If the ritual is successful, the hag eye ooze animates fully formed and able to serve as a minion. The hag eye ooze is under the control of the creator, but in cases where a coven takes part in creating the ooze, control goes to the hag that supplied the hag eye."

With its controller gone, and no one to provide food, the ooze feeds upon its mistress and her coven sisters. Through this consumption, the creation gains some semblance of its creators' cunning, independent thought, and malignancy. If the coven sisters had hag eyes of their own, the ooze absorbs them into its form. Otherwise, consumption of the coven, with the residual magic of the original hag eye, transforms one eye from each of the hags in the coven into a functional hag eye.",

			"Coven oozes are generally 10 feet to a side and weigh roughly 1,500 pounds, although larger specimens have been encountered. When a coven ooze comes across another creature with the ooze subtype, it attempts to engulf and consume it. For every 10 HD of ooze creatures that a coven ooze consumes, its size increases by one step, to a maximum size of Gargantuan. If a coven ooze ever consumes a hag eye ooze, the creator of the hag eye ooze-if a hag-must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have her connection to the hag eye ooze severed."

			"Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking-often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp.",
			"",
			"Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example-often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death.",
			"",
			"Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis-typically horrible triplets-are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles.",

Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions-for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast.",

The target must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or be staggered as strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of impending doom plagues the victim. If a sea hag uses her evil eye on someone already afflicted by this curse, the victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or perish. The evil eye is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.Evil Eye Curse: Gaze-failed save; save Will DC 14; frequency1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the effects of the evil eye).",

Creatures that are affected by this power or that successfully save against it cannot be affected again by the same hag's horrific appearance for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Once an orb has been used in this manner, it loses its innate brilliance and cannot be used again until 24 hours have passed, after which time its energy refreshes and it resumes glowing.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A mid-sized feline adorned with a halo of blinding orbs of light, the hallowed lynx is a creature widely thought to be mere myth or long extinct. Only a handful of hallowed lynxes exist, most held in stasis within long-buried Thassilonian ruins, though rumored sightings of the blindingly bright cats suggest that small populations may have survived to the present day. Created from keen hunters and imbued with potent light-based magic distilled from powerful outsiders, hallowed lynxes are deadly predators whose mere presence bolsters their allies. Aside from the brilliant orbs that surround them, a hallowed lynx resembles its mundane kin, having a short tail, large paws, spotted tawny fur, and distinctive tufts of fur extending from its ears. It is the same size as an ordinary lynx: just over 2 feet tall, around 3 feet long, and weighing about 35 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Hallowed lynxes are not natural creatures, though they are descended from the mundane lynxes still found across Varisia. Their origin can be traced to the height of the Thassilonian empire in the realm of Eurythnia, where the runelord Sorshen created the first hallowed lynxes to serve her as favored pets and guardians similar to the way in which animals served the gods.",
			"",
			"Creating the original hallowed lynxes involved powerful conjuration magic, wherein the terrible creatures known as [shining children](monster/shining_child) were summoned and bound into the physical form of a living lynx. The outsiders' intellect bolstered that of the host, and the host channeled the outsiders' magic and light for its own benefit. The shining children continue a half-existence after their integration, orbiting the hallowed lynx and shedding their light as a powerful aura. A hallowed lynx can utilize this energy in one of two ways: either hurling the orbs at a foe, or temporarily releasing shining children from within the orbs.",
			"",
			"While several other creatures were also magically \"hallowed\" in a similar manner during Sorshen's rule, the hallowed lynx was by far her favorite, eventually spreading beyond her court as demand for the creatures grew among Thassilonian nobility. These noble felines served as pets and guardians for the realm's elite, their owners benefitting from the same aura that made the creatures so effective against intruders and foes. The small size of hallowed lynxes made them ideal indoor pets but still large enough to present a significant threat to anyone or anything that crossed their path. As status symbols, hallowed lynxes typically led plush, pampered lives in which their stalking and hunting was conducted for their own amusement rather than sustenance. More intelligent than a common lynx, a hallowed lynx can - with sufficient exposure - understand the languages spoken around it, and it can perform far more complex tasks than its mundane kin; though, as with most felines, it can be challenging to convince a hallowed lynx that undertaking a given effort is worth its time.",
			"",
			"Scattered historical records, most of which were poorly kept to begin with, make it difficult to determine how many hallowed lynxes were created within the empire, but historians agree the number was exceptionally low, and likely only in the hundreds. Given their scarcity even at their peak, scholars conclude that hallowed lynxes met their end along with the empire that created them. Today, the creatures are known from only a handful of surviving mosaics, engravings, and other artwork, and occasional references in written documents that have connected the image with their name.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Much like other lynxes, the hallowed lynx is a solitary creature. Some form bonds with their keepers, with records suggesting that Sorshen had a particularly powerful hallowed lynx that followed her as dutifully as any of the runelord's sycophants. But even within the empire that created them, it was rare for hallowed lynxes to encounter one another due to their scarcity, and such encounters have become rarer still since the empire's fall.",
			"",
			"Being savvy and sturdy creatures, however, not all hallowed lynxes perished during Earthfall. A few were caught up in the Thassilonians' various efforts to survive the catastrophe, held in stasis or otherwise preserved within the homes and temples they once prowled. A few others escaped, fleeing the collapse of Thassilonian civilization and taking shelter deep in the forests of Varisia. The persistence of the hallowed lynx as a creature in rumors and folktales suggests that the creatures managed to survive and reproduce, yet they remain so rare and hide themselves so well that their existence remains unconfirmed. Whether the creatures simply seek to remain hidden for their own safety or whether they're guarding long-buried secrets of Thassilon has yet to be determined.",
			"",
			"Few predators-natural or otherwise-pose a serious threat to a hallowed lynx. Their small size and unambitious nature places them below the notice of tyrants and chromatic dragons, but they are tremendously powerful creatures in their own right, apex predators in those few habitats where they remain. If cornered, confronted, or challenged, a hallowed lynx first hurls its blinding orbs in an attempt to debilitate its foes, then pounces to attack its target's weak points. Against multiple foes, it releases the shining children bound to it and flanks foes, or else it employs its spell-like abilities to weaken, distract, and entrance enemies."

All nonevil woodland creatures acknowledge her as the wisest of dryads and respect her gifts of healing and diplomacy. In most forests, a hamadryad is the sister or wife of an erlking, and represents the protective, patient, and nurturing aspect of nature. With her healing magic, she can relieve the suffering of a dryad whose tree has been killed and sustain her long enough for her to bond with another tree.",
			"",
			"A hamadryad prefers to avoid direct confrontations, instead using her magic and allies to divert, confuse, and even befriend any would-be enemies. Her powers allow her to speak with or quickly travel to her subjects even when they are in the most remote parts of the forest. As a consequence, little happens in the forest without her knowledge, and those who enter her realm would do well to remember this."

			"Strangely intelligent constructs, the earliest hanshepsus were created during Osirion's First Age. Hanshepsus were originally built to serve as elite soldiers that never tired, didn't need to be fed, and were impervious to common attacks. Using secrets stolen from Jistkan golem crafters, Osirion's own artificers designed hanshepsus to equalize the battlefield in their clashes against the Jistka Imperium as the two nations carved up northern Garund. Throughout the conflict, hanshepsus fought in dozens of battles, each time turning the tide in favor of Osirion's forces as they marched ahead of regular, human soldiers through the hot sands of what is now Thuvia. Hanshepsus stand as tall as an adult human. While they appear lean and muscular, their clay bodies give them additional heft, causing them to weigh in at around 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"The process of creating a hanshepsu requires the sacrifice of a willing humanoid to provide not only the life force needed to animate the construct's body, but also the creature's intelligence. This allows the hanshepsu to make calculated decisions on the battlefield, and some even commanded humanoid units during battles, implementing clever tactics amid the fray.",
			"",
			"Though a hanshepsu is intelligent, it lacks anything approaching a personality. Cold and stoic, hanshepsus don't hold conversations that involve anything more complicated than answering questions or issuing orders. Any attempt to engage a hanshepsu further results in utter silence and an inexpressive face. Some hanshepsus even shut down in the middle of their limited interactions with others, crossing their arms and changing to their solar disk head.",
			"",
			"Despite their lack of personality, some hanshepsus retain traces of their mortal memories, and shout out bizarre non sequiturs in the midst of battle. Crumbling texts from the First Age of Osirion contain reports that, after time, hanshepsus became unpredictable, sometimes turning on their commanders and the other soldiers. This suggested that the process of creating these near-impervious soldiers was flawed in some fashion.",
			"",
			"Few hanshepsus have been found in the current age, and they are rarely discovered in large numbers. The process of creating hanshepsus was expensive and required a willing sacrifice, so only the best and brightest warriors were transformed into these constructs. Because of this, modern scholars believe that fewer than 5,000 hanshepsus were created before the practice fell out of favor, and with the march of time, less than 10 percent of that estimation are believed to be still functional.",
			"",
			"Hanshepsus work best when assembled in a unit with other hanshepsus. They work in concert, taking physical cues from one another and rarely needing to verbally communicate. When not charged with leading or when fighting alongside a unit containing humanoids, hanshepsus barely regard other creatures. When at rest, they simply wait for new commands. In fighting units, hanshepsus were often at the front lines of a battle, and they used their increased strength and superior defenses to drive a wedge into enemy units and scatter their ranks, allowing the humanoid soldiers behind them to easily pick off the dispersed soldiers.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"To create a hanshepsu, the crafter must sculpt and shape the body from a single block of clay harvested from the banks of the Asp, the Crook, or the Sphinx. The creature's head must be fired in a specially prepared kiln stoked with 1,500 gp worth of rare desert wood. As a final step, a living humanoid must be sacrificed in order to animate a hanshepsu in a process that separates the victim's spirit from his body and infuses his essence (but not his personality) into the clay body.",

Horrifically, haveros are not the mere imaginings of those sages who chronicle the heavens. They are entities of deepest blackness, and on terrible occasions a lone havero has been drawn to Golarion, putting all the races of the world into reach of its endless, ruinous arms."

			"",
			"**Hardy Stump (Ex)** A heartrot tree is difficult to kill. After it sustains fatal damage, a heartrot tree begins to regenerate and can grow back to its previous size in 1d4 weeks. Dealing 50 points of fire damage to the heartrot tree's stump after it has sustained fatal damage prevents this regeneration.",
			"",
			"**Virulent Roots (Ex)** A heartrot tree's roots grow deep beneath the surface. If the tree grows above a cave, cavern, or other large underground opening, its roots have the same statistics as the aboveground tree and can menace creatures underground in the same way. In this case, though they grow from the ceiling, treat a heartrot tree's roots exactly as a normal heartrot tree. A heartrot tree can't fight with its branches and roots simultaneously.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Disgusting products of blight or other magical plagues, heartrot trees represent nature warped to its most insidious. Heartrot trees typically lurk in the deepest depths of fouled forests; they are the manifestations of the very forces that poison the land. As a result, evil and disease pulse within heartrot trees, and the behemoths hunger to destroy anything good or natural still left around them.",
			"",
			"Heartrot trees are typically 30 feet tall from the base of their trunks to the tips of their tendril-like branches. When the trees grow above a cave or another large underground space, their roots are horrifically similar to their branches and dangle just as far from the ceiling. Heartrot trees' trunks are typically 15 feet in circumference, and the plant's entire mass weighs around 15 tons.",
			"",
			"To most lovers of nature, the existence of heartrot trees is a tragedy, because these evil plants were not always so. Before transforming into grotesque harbingers of disease, heartrot trees were invariably ancient and majestic specimens growing in the depths of primeval forests. Heartrot trees were typically once maples, oaks, elms, or other types of locally common deciduous trees. They were often once among forests' largest or most venerated trees; perhaps they marked a remote druid's circle, or were a common meeting place for forest dwellers.",
			"",
			"However, once blight falls upon a wooded area, it particularly and irrevocably settles within the heartwood of these trees. Either due to proximity to the center of a blight, or because evil forces have perverted once-good magic that protected the plants, these trees become sentient, fungusdripping horrors. A malevolence awakens in them akin to the same powers that caused the surrounding blight. Newly formed heartrot trees crave violence and undergo drastic changes to their biology.",
			"",
			"The differences between a heartrot tree and its previous incarnation are manifold. In the most visually dramatic change, a heartrot tree withers and shrinks to a fraction of its former size. The water and nutrients that once circulated in its woody veins turn to a disease that rots it from the inside out-and the heartrot tree becomes a carrier of a plague that drives its victims mad before draining the life from their bodies. Heartrot trees' malevolence spreads throughout their systems of roots, trunks, and branches. As a result, they no longer feed on sunlight or water, and are instead sustained by the evil that animated them as well as the suffering they bring to good creatures that cross their paths.",
			"",
			"The most heinous change wrought to heartrot trees, though, might be the sheer determination of the evil that lurks within them. Unlike natural trees, heartrot trees can sense creatures that move near their trunks, and even near their roots underground, when they grow above a cavern or another such opening. Heartrot trees can attack victims aboveground or below, though they can't attack with both their branches and their roots at once. Even when it seems like heartrot trees are destroyed, they can regenerate in a matter of weeks. Heartrot trees attack and destroy any living creatures that wander into their demesnes, though they prefer to lurk in the heart of a blight and wait to destroy wandering creatures the blight hasn't yet warped.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Although heartrot trees typically originate in the center of a blight, they are restless, wandering brutes. Therefore, they can eventually be found nearly anywhere in a blighted area, from the fringes of a warped wood to its very heart.",
			"",
			"Heartrot trees found at the edges of a blighted area are typically solitary creatures. They are invariably aggressive, as the abundance of lost wanderers and fleeing forest dwellers naturally provides them with victims. These heartrot trees are often easy for discerning adventurers to spot-a gnarled, rotting tree amid a heap of broken bodies or standing in a pool of blood is almost certainly a heartrot tree. Fortunately for potential prey, heartrot trees gorged on fresh kills are not exactly good at concealing the remnants of their prey or their presence. What's more, particularly active heartrot trees often leave the torn flesh or bloody garments of their victims hanging from their twisted branches in a grotesque display of just how much the plants crave carnage.",
			"",
			"Heartrot trees that dwell deeper in the depths of a blighted area are typically a little harder to spot. They naturally blend in with the rest of the blighted surroundings, and so GMs may wish to grant heartrot trees an additional +8 racial modifier on Stealth checks in such areas. Such heartrot trees are also more likely to lurk in pairs. In the most blighted areas, it's common for a heartrot tree to stand on one side of an ominous, deepforest path with another directly across the way. In this manner, the trees can simultaneously snatch multiple creatures that wander by, and they can ensure that their victims don't escape their grasping tendrils.",
			"",
			"### Heartrot Tree Groves",
			"",
			"In Golarion's most deeply warped natural areas, heartrot trees sometimes stand in horrifying groves made up of six to 12 individuals. In this case, the trees tend to arrange themselves circularly, like a twisted parody of a peaceful druid's grove. The sheer concentrated evil of these groves imbues the heartrot trees with a strange magical ability that can call victims directly to the slaughter. Three times per day, the grove can cast mass suggestion with a range of 220 feet (Will DC 24; CL 12th). The grove uses this spell-like ability to beckon to potential victims in the vicinity, whose broken bodies afterward typically litter the forest floor around the trees. The destruction of just one heartrot tree in a grove temporarily thwarts that grove's ability to draw creatures toward it. However, if defeated trees in a grove regenerate back to full power, the grove regains its powers of suggestion."

Unable to seek eternal rest, and unwilling to become undead in the pursuit of vengeance, the samurai's soul instead finds a suitable host in which to continue its existence. A heikegani is the effect of such a joining: a tragic, furious symbiosis of the soul of a dead samurai and the body of a crustacean. This usually occurs when the samurai dies near a crab habitat and her soul imprints upon a newly hatched crab zoea. Magic is always involved, either because the death happened in a high-magic environment or because the samurai was dealt a magical deathblow. A heikegani is especially vicious when young, and kills other crabs and marine creatures it encounters until it develops the ability to travel onto land. Each time the heikegani molts, its new shell comes to more closely resemble an angry demonic face. The soul of a heikegani has very few of its memories from life, but retains its single-minded sense of purpose and honor, and is quick to challenge those it meets to mortal combat. A heikegani believes it has been reincarnated, but in reality it never passed on to be judged. The unnatural genesis of a heikegani causes it great agony, and the dangerous crustacean scuttles along the shores, seeking foes that it can defeat in honorable combat so its soul can finally be put to rest."

Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge.

			"Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes.",
			"",
			"The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones. Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The \"fires\" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat's entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted.",

			"Hellfire ignises roam the rural areas of Cheliax, committing acts of arson and leaving brush, forest, and structures ablaze in their wake. Cruel and sadistic pyromaniacs, hellfire ignises are corrupted versions of fey that once represented both the destructive and rejuvenating properties of fire within nature.

The prevalence of wooden tenements, dense populations, and unpatrolled sewers through which they can travel unseen make towns tempting targets for the inveterate arsonists. There is a bounty on the heads of hellfire ignises in many cities and towns in Cheliax, with rewards reaching as much as 400 gp per specimen in some areas. Greedy hunters from Egorian and other cities have been known to travel far into the heart of the Barrowood and Whisperwood, hoping to carry a large collection of ignis heads back for a larger bounty in town.",
			"",
			"Despite their name and infernal origins, hellfire ignises have no allegiances to Hell or those who serve it. That said, many experienced pyromancersfind that the corrupted fey make excellent familiars. They tend to be more versatile than fire elementals and less sinister than imps, filling a specific niche between the two more commonly seen familiars. A spellcaster who takes a hellfire ignis as a familiar must be ever watchful that it keeps its arsonist spirit in check, however, as the mischievous fey have been known to set fire to their masters' workshops, libraries, and homes not out of spite or malice, but because they often contain so many combustible tools and decorations. A 7th-level spellcaster can gain a hellfire ignis as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat."

			"Powerful and swift land mammals, elk range through the plains, hills, and forests of many wildernesses, in great herds. Related to deer, elk prove important parts of many ecologies, being able to fend off or flee many threats while feeding greater predators. Their size, strength, and antlers-reaching up to 10 feet wide on some males-allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionably adaptable and remarkable survivors, capable of living through severe changes in weather and in a variety of environments without concern. Many humanoid cultures rely on elk herds, using them as valued food sources, work animals, and companions.",
			"",
			"Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females being far slighter than males. Heartier stock, such as the river elk seen throughout the River Kingdoms, Brevoy, and much of northern Avistan and Iobaria, grow to approximately 6 feet tall and weigh between 700 and 1,100 pounds. In some secluded wilds, primeval megaloceros-massive ancestors of the elk-still flourish, standing up to 9 feet tall, with bulks of 1,500 pounds and antlers growing over 12 feet wide.",

			"Similar in form to the elk but far superior in size is the megaloceros. The average male is a towering, dangerous creature with antlers that can alone weigh nearly 100 pounds. Unlike elk, megaloceros antlers are decidedly enormous and sometimes wider than their bodies are long. This leads to common misconceptions and exaggerations about the creature's monstrous size. Conveniently for those pursued, megaloceros males have difficultly navigating thickly forested areas, making them natives of plains and the woods' edge.",

The ritual to form a cabal (or to welcome new herecites into an existing cabal) requires 24 hours of worship, prayer, and vile sacrifice, after which point the herecites become bound to the area in which the ritual was performed (this area can be no larger than one 50-foot cube per herecite in the cabal, to a maximum of five 50-foot cubes for a cabal of five herecites). If any one member of a herecite cabal leaves this area, it and all other herecites in the cabal lose all of the shared abilities granted by their cabal and they must perform the ritual once again to regain these abilities.

All herecites in a cabal share one mind, can communicate telepathically, and gain a +4 bonus on initiative checks and Perception checks. If at least one herecite in a cabal disbelieves an illusion, all other herecites in the cabal are considered to disbelieve the illusion. If one herecite is aware of combatants, all other herecites in that cabal area also aware of those combatants, and if one member is injured or killed, all remaining herecites are aware of it. As long as the cabal exists, all herecites in the cabal gain fast healing 10.",

It and all undead within this area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and the DC to resist negative channeled energy in the area increases by 6. The herecite itself gains 2 hit points per Hit Die (+24 hit points for most herecites). All of these benefits are calculated into the above stats, and while they do not stack with those granted by desecrate spells, neither do they vanish if the herecite enters an area under the effect of a consecrate spell.",
			"",
			"**Faith-Stealing Strike (Su)** A nonevil divine spellcaster struck by a herecite's slam attack or by its favored weapon must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves, it is immune to further faith-stealing strikes from that particular herecite for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Herecite Domains (Su)** A herecite is associated with one evil god, and is always of the same alignment as that god. The herecite selects two domains granted by that god, gaining both domain's 1st-level spells as at-will spell-like abilities, the 2nd-level spells as 3/day spell-like abilities, and the 3rd- and 4th-level spells as 1/day spell-like abilities. Inappropriate spells granted by domains, or spells that duplicate the herecite's existing spell-like abilities, are replaced with inflict spells of the same level. For example, a herecite with access to Healing would swap out all four of its cure spells for the inflict versions, while a herecite with access to Glory would swap out bless weapon for inflict moderate wounds, searing light for inflict serious wounds, and holy smite for inflict critical wounds. The herecite above is a herecite of Asmodeus with the Fire and Trickery domains. These spell-like abilities are in addition to the herecite's base spell-like abilities (detect good, see invisibility, and unholy blight).",

It is proficient with the favored weapon of its associated deity, and if it wields its deity's favored weapon, that weapon gains the unholy weapon ability. Against divine spells, the herecite's SR increases by 4.",
			"",
			"**Unleash Heresy (Su)** When a herecite is destroyed, it explodes, dealing 3d6 negative energy damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 21 half). Any nonevil creature damaged by this energy must also succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by the herecite's faith-stealing strike. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Herecites are a particularly blasphemous form of undead created via an obscure ritual of sacrifice, wherein a priest of an evil god offers up at least five worshipers of a nonevil deity to her own deity. All of the sacrifices must worship the same deity. Upon the death of the sacrificed worshipers, their souls and bodies seethe and surge with negative energy, then melt away only to reform into a single entity-a herecite. Even the herecite's appearance serves to support its heretical nature, for these foul creations always appear as undead versions of their prior god, even though now, in their new unlife, they are devoted worshipers of the god to whom they were sacrificed. Regardless of the size and shape of the worshipers sacrificed, or the mythological size of their prior deity, a herecite is a human-sized creature.",
			"",

			"The ritual for the creation of a herecite is recorded in certain rare and blasphemous texts hidden away in dark libraries. It is known to exist in the Book of the Damned, and likely exists in texts associated with the [Whispering Way](rule/f_gravepath), although that group finds herecites more of a curiosity than a viable addition to their ranks. The ritual itself often focuses on the torture and slaughter of young, inexperienced priests while a captured leader is forced to watch. The pain and anguish experienced by the enemy high priest as his acolytes are forcibly converted in undeath serves as the ritual's catalyst. High priests driven mad or forced to lose their faith after witnessing such a ritual often rise again as huecuvas that then go on to gain levels as oracles of the ritual's profane deity.",
			"",
			"Herecites never take levels in cleric, for the ritual of their creation results in a tenuous awareness and an inability to profess such powerful faith in a deity ever again. Those who do train after their creation typically become sorcerers or witches.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Herecites, once created, typically remain as guardians by the temple responsible for their forced conversion. In some cases, a lone herecite may wander from the site of its creation, especially if it loses its creator, but once a group of herecites forms a cabal, its members remain bound to that area for months, years, or even centuries-if they leave the area, the cabal is broken, and a new ritual must be performed in order to reaffirm their blasphemous faith. They have very little interest in their new lives save for the constant offering of blasphemous prayers to their new deity; these prayers often consist of warped versions of sacred chants and songs devoted to their prior faith."

			"For nearly a century, the Estrovian Forest has been haunted by stag-horned woodsfolk known as hernes. From Egede to Lackthroat, stories are told of these mysterious beings.

While none of these stories are true, they all contain a kernel of truth.",

Though they are creatures of flesh and blood, hernes are infused with the spirit of the wild hunt. For the most part, hernes live as humble woodsfolk, reaping the bounty of the forest by their own hands. Yet they are also protectors of the forest, hunting those who abuse it or dare to claim ownership of its reaches. When hernes' anger is roused, they become the avenging spirits the stories make them out to be.",
			"",
			"Hernes tend to be tall and lean. Males stand 6 feet tall or taller-with their antlers adding another foot or so- and weigh around 190 pounds. Female hernes are slightly shorter and lighter, and their antlers are smaller, with fewer points.",
			"",
			"The race of hernes has existed for less than 90 years. The first of their kind was Herne Vilhaur, a crusader from Andoran. Wounded by a stag and left for dead by his erstwhile companions, Herne was taken by the druids of the Estrovian Forest. They promised to mend his mortal wounds with their ancient magic, and in a way they did. They hanged him from a mighty oak, and placed on his brow the antlers of the sacred stag that Herne had killed. Then they called down the \"curse of the winterthorn\" upon Herne, restoring his vitality but tying him forever to the spirits of the forest.",
			"",
			"The druids intended to use the transformed Herne as an instrument of vengeance against their enemies. Instead, he turned upon them. Stripped of his humanity, the reborn Herne thought only of vengeance against the allies who had abandoned him and the druids who had made him a monster. Unable or unwilling to leave the forest, he claimed it as his domain. He haunted it till the end of his days, hunting both animals and humanoids who dared to enter the woods. Herne did not kill all he chased; some he allowed to join his band. Recreating the ritual that transformed him, Herne called antlers from the heads of his new companions, thereby passing the curse of the winterthorn on to them.",
			"",
			"Even after the original Herne's passing, his progeny continued his legacy, even taking his name for their race. Hernes breed true, and most of those who now live were born with the curse rather than having it placed upon them. The hernes live off the bounty of the forest and protect it from those they deem unworthy of its gifts.",
			"",
			"Save for superficial details, the ritual by which a human can be turned into a herne appears to have been lost with the death of Herne himself. Yet whenever followers of the Old Faith or notorious bandits disappear, rumor quickly spreads that they have not died, but been brought into the fold of Herne's band.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Hernes are relatively few in number considering the vastness of the Estrovian Forest. Though quite capable of living alone for long stretches of time, hernes are not antisocial, and they meet regularly with others of their kind to pass along news and trade crafted goods. They stay together in groups only with a purpose, however, whether it's to raise a family or to hunt a great beast. The largest population of hernes can be found near the tree known as Herne's Oak: the tree from which Vilhaur was hanged, and under which his body is buried (along with, according to legend, a trove of funerary offerings).",
			"",
			"Like the druids before them, hernes are followers of the old ways, both in practical matters and in spirituality. As hunter-gatherers, hernes raise no crops, and have domesticated only animals useful for hunting-dogs, horses, and owls. Though they thrill at the chase, hernes never take more than they need. They build few structures. Most live in hidden caves that run beneath the Estrovian Forest. Hernes are most active at night; people living on the edge of the Estrovian Forest often attribute strange noises from the woods to the hernes' midnight hunts.",
			"",
			"The hernes practice an ancient form of druidism known as the Green Faith. This religion was once the dominant religion of the northern reaches of Avistan. Over the centuries, however, it has been replaced by the worship of the gods of the Inner Sea region. The arrival of the crusaders, many of whom worship their own regional deities, has only accelerated the decline of the old ways. The hernes thus consider themselves protectors not just of the forest, but also of the spirits which reside there.",
			"",
			"Hernes value self-sufficiency, and reject most useless hierarchies. They especially despise those who claim rulership by noble blood. This hatred is reinforced by tales of the druids' persecution by Mendevian rulers, and of the duplicity of the original Herne's so-called noble allies. While common folk may be allowed to hunt and gather from the edges of the forest, hernes are quick to turn the tables on the extravagant hunts hosted by the Mendevian elite and their crusader allies. In a few instances, hernes have even given advice and aid to brave outlaws in their fights against corrupt nobles.",
			"",
			"Hernes take full advantage of their supernatural reputation when interacting with other humanoids-they know threats are more menacing when issued from the mouth of a deathless servant of nature. Though hernes are not fey creatures and not deathless, most humanoids can't deny the creatures' supernatural nature. Though many hernes remain cold to other humanoids, some invite the dispossessed to join their bands. Those who accept the herne's offer cannot return to the life they once knew. To the superstitious folk of Mendev, swearing allegiance to a herne is tantamount to signing a deal with a devil; such folk are forever beyond the pale.",
			"",
			"As warriors have returned to their homelands from the Mendevian Crusades, they have brought with them many stories, including that of Herne Vilhaur and his accursed progeny. Reported sightings of hernes in forests far south of Mendev are easy to dismiss as the imaginings of those who have fallen for these fanciful tales, yet some who know of the hernes suspect they may be expanding their territory."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A hippocampus's scales vary in color from ivory to deep green to cerulean blue with shades of silver. Aquatic races such as merfolk and locathahs often train hippocampi as steeds or as draft animals used to pull cunningly designed underwater carriages. In the wild, hippocampi prefer to dwell in relatively shallow waters where their favorite food (seaweed and kelp) is more plentiful and larger predators are less common. These creatures often travel in large schools, analogous to free-roaming herds of wild horses on the surface world.",
			"",
			"The hippocampus is relatively easily trained-the amount of work and cost it requires is equivalent to what it takes to train a horse. As armor impacts the creature's swim speed, those who train hippocampi for war rarely bother to put barding on these creatures-when they do, they generally opt for the lightest armor, such as padded or leather barding. Mounted combat on a hippocampus is similar to fighting while riding a horse, although the hippocampus is a clumsy creature on land and cannot move at all out of the water if it has a rider weighing it down. Although a hippocampus has only two front legs, determine its carrying capacity as if it were a quadruped. Thus, a light load for a hippocampus is up to 228 pounds. Medium loads are up to 459 pounds, and heavy loads up to 690 pounds.",
			"",
			"A number of variant species of hippocampus exist, although the majority of these species differ from the creature presented here only in color and feat choice. Common feats other than Endurance for alternative hippocampus species are [Great Fortitude](feat/great_fortitude), [Improved Initiative](feat/improved_initiative), [Iron Will](feat/iron_will), [Lightning Reflexes](feat/lightning_reflexes), [Skill Focus](feat/skill_focus) (Swim), and [Toughness](feat/toughness). A few species of hippocampus are heartier and tougher all around-these creatures are generally those found in colder waters and are known as polar hippocampi. A polar hippocampus has the advanced creature simple template. Most impressive of all are hippocampi that dwell in the deeper seas. These creatures, known as giant hippocampi, are much larger-to generate stats for a giant hippocampus, advance the standard hippocampus to Huge size and increase its Hit Dice to 10. A giant hippocampus is CR 8."

			"The hippogriff bears the wings, forelegs, and head of a great raptor bird and the tail and body of a magnificent horse. As horses are a preferred meal for griffons, sages claim some flesh-warping wizard with an ironic sense of humor long ago created this unfortunate fusion of horse and hawk as a joke.",
			"",
			"A hippogriff's feathers bear coloration similar to those of a hawk or an eagle; however, some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark white or coal black feathers. A hippogriff's torso and hind end are most often bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing pinto or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs measure 11 feet long and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Territorial, hippogriffs fiercely protect the lands under their domain. Hippogriffs must also watch the skies for other predators, as they are a preferred meal of griffons, wyverns, and young dragons. Hippogriffs nest in sweeping grasslands, rugged hills, and flowing prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their home nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, yet they graze after every meal of flesh to aid their digestion. Their dietary habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, so ranching communities often set bounties on them. Victims of these hunts are often taxidermied, and preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts.",
			"",
			"Far easier to train than griffons, yet easily as intelligent as horses, hippogriffs are trained as mounts by some elite companies of mounted soldiers, patrolling the skies and swooping down on unsuspecting enemies. Although they are magical beasts, if captured young, hippogriffs can be trained using Handle Animal as if they were animals. An adult hippogriff is more difficult to train, and attempts to do so follow the normal rules for training magical beasts using the skill. A hippogriff saddle must be specially crafted so as to not impact the movement of the creature's wings-these saddles are always exotic saddles.",
			"",
			"Hippogriffs lay eggs rather than birthing live young-as a general rule, a hippogriff nest only contains one egg at a time. A hippogriff's egg is worth 200 gp, but a healthy young hippogriff is worth 500 gp. A fully trained hippogriff mount can command prices of up to 5,000 gp or more. A hippogriff can carry 198 pounds as a light load, 399 pounds as a medium load, and 600 pounds as a heavy load."

			"",
			"#### Description",

			"These massive, four-legged herbivores can grow up to 17 feet long and generally weigh between 3,000 and 4,000 pounds, though males continue to grow throughout their entire lives and have been known to reach weights of up to 10,000 pounds. Despite their girth, hippopotamuses can run quite fast-up to 30 miles per hour in quick bursts-though they usually spend the bulk of their time lazing about in rivers and wallows, using the water to support their weight and regulate heat for their titanic bodies. Excellent swimmers, hippopotamuses can hold their breath for about 15 minutes and are quite stealthy when submerged. This trait makes them exceedingly dangerous to boats, for a submerged hippopotamus is likely to view any such craft as a challenge to its territory and is entirely capable of capsizing a boat and biting the boatmen in half. Hippopotamuses typically herd together in bloats, blocking waterways and creating natural blockades for river travelers. While lions and tigers often garner more public attention from foreigners, residents of areas frequented by hippopotamuses know that the \"water horses,\" as they're sometimes known, are far more likely to kill and maim humans that cross their path. Fortunately, forewarned travelers can generally avoid bloats, as hippopotamuses mark the banks of their territories with dung, spinning their tails while defecating to create aromatic \"water horses,\"",
			"",
			"Though hippopotamuses spend most of their lives in water, adults cannot swim and are not buoyant, instead propelling themselves by pushing off the bottom in great leaps. When submerged, they surface every 3 to 5 minutes to breathe and can even do so automatically while sleeping without waking. They have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air, alerting all nearby hippopotamuses whether submerged or on land."

Chaotic evil creatures suffer 2d6 points of nonlethal damage from striking the hiracapath while within the aura.",
			"",
			"**Nonlethal Mastery (Ex)** A hiracapath can deal nonlethal damage with any of its natural attacks without taking a penalty on the attack roll. When making nonlethal attacks, the hiracapath increases the critical threat range on all natural attacks to 19-20.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hiracapaths are inhabitants of Heaven-outsiders formed from the celestial plane-but they are not true angels or archons. They exist below the lowest tiers of Heaven's hierarchy and are commanders of celestial animals, holding no official place among Heaven's formal ranks or society. They dwell primarily at the base of the mountain that makes up the plane, wandering the idyllic realm alone or in great, golden herds. Despite their placid appearances, hiracapaths act as Heaven's watchdogs, running down any discovered interlopers and dragging them before more formal authorities for judgment. To hiracapaths, this arrangement is not lopsided; rather, it's preferable, as it allows them to indulge in their natural affinity for tracking intruders while remaining outside of the official celestial hierarchy, which they find too complex and unappealing, when they even consider the matter at all.",
			"",
			"In its natural form, a hiracapath is as an intangible cloud of soulstuff and celestial energy. Heaven itself provides each glorious creature with silver and steel armor to give it both form and purpose. Clad in gleaming plates, a hiracapath stands 9 feet tall and weighs almost 1,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sometimes called the \"bulls of Heaven,\" hiracapaths are born from Heaven itself, often forming from the souls of loyal mounts and animal companions of righteous heroes. Newly formed hiracapaths burst forth as jets of light and sound from the ground of Heaven's lowest tiers. Their armor eventually emerges from these same fonts hours later, beginning a long process that is equal parts birthing and unification of their disparate elements. The creatures remember nothing of their creation, and are driven only by an imbued sense of their place in the rigid hierarchy of Heaven's inhabitants.",
			"",
			"The same force that empowers its existence allows a hiracapath to expertly sap the life energies from enemies without mortally wounding them. In spite of the hiracapath's bulk and size, its powerful blows strike an enemy carefully, and rarely draw blood or open wounds. Born trusting humanoid masters more than their own judgment, hiracapaths dread the possibility of accidentally injuring or killing a creature that deserved a kinder fate, and under no circumstances do they wish to pass judgment on any creatures themselves. Against foes immune to nonlethal damage-such as constructs or undead-a hiracapath simply wields its curled horns and powerful hooves to devastating effect, trusting that a soulless creature cannot feel the pain it brings, and hoping only to stop, rather than totally destroy, its opponent.",
			"",
			"A hiracapath's intangible core grants it many benefits, including a shining light that burns evil and the disobedient, plus the ability to tread upon air as if its armor weighed nothing. This same holy light allows them to slip between the planes as they wish. Small populations wander Nirvana from time to time, or charge though the borders of Hell and the Maelstrom. As outsiders, they have no need to eat or sleep, but enjoy both-great herds roam Heaven, chewing thoughtfully at mouthfuls of plant matter, dirt, or stones, resembling contented herds of mortal cattle, sheep, or goats. If they spot an intruder, however, the hiracapaths do not hesitate to meet the threat head on, even if they don't wish to visit mortal harm upon it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"After their emergence at the base of Heaven's mountain, hiracapaths swiftly define their territory, or join other hiracapath herds without much fanfare. Instinctively knowing their role, hiracapaths serve as vigilant protectors, shepherding celestial animals and guarding against threats from other planes. They suspiciously stalk new petitioners and planar travelers alike, only satisfied when they see newcomers judged worthy by angels, archons, or other celestials. Obvious threats' such as the rare fiendish incursion-are dealt with swiftly but mercifully. A hiracapath carries incapacitated foes to the nearest authority figure, and ultimately loves nothing more than praise from its celestial superiors for a job well done.",
			"",
			"When the threat of invasion is not a concern, hiracapaths enjoy the rigid beauty of heaven. Though herd animals, they can wander off alone to spend extended periods of time in simple but careful introspection. Bold and stubborn, hiracapaths are ultimately gentle creatures who dread the thought of causing undue harm; they move with careful grace across the fields and pastures they patrol to avoid crushing smaller creatures beneath their bulk. Hiracapaths follow a simplified paladin's code, refusing to hurt helpless opponents and offering assistance to those in need. Thanks to their dull wits and prodigious strength, a hiracapath is often painfully straightforward. For instance, a hiracapath may help a lost traveler by carrying her in a straight line-through any and all obstacles-until the traveler spies familiar surroundings. Or a hiracapath may lead a wayward visitor around the mountains in a winding or circular path, waiting until it comes across a trusted angel or archon who can help direct its charge.",
			"",
			"While hiracapaths' dogged defense of Heaven seems at odds with their ability to plane shift, they do use their planar traveling ability to pursue enemies who escape justice. Angels joke that hiracapaths' ability to jump between worlds is a symptom of their stubbornness-even the walls of reality can't sway one of Heaven's bulls once it eyes a target. Because a hiracapath is unable to bring a target it pursues across cosmic borders, those beasts who leave their home often regretfully switch to deadly force, especially against infernal or other obviously evil prey.",
			"",
			"Other times, high-ranking angels or archons gift the services of hiracapaths to virtuous mortals. The hiracapaths proudly serve as paladin mounts when so called-many filled this same role in life and vaguely recall the sense of purpose it offered. Though rare, such alliances offer valuable training a hiracapath can bring back to its herd, and the majestic beasts themselves serve as proud warriors and surprisingly capable trackers.",
			"",
			"Though many angelic lords of Heaven view them as simple brutes and watchdogs, hiracapaths maintain a special relationship with the empyreal lord Ragathiel. The empyreal lord opens his territories to myriad herds of hiracapaths to serve as both protectors and symbols of strength, and respects the dogged and just nature of the hiracapaths, rewarding those who uproot nascent evils or track down escaped enemies. The General of Vengeance selects those hiracapaths who prove themselves worthy to wander the grounds within his own fortress, and dispatches them as mounts for his messengers and scouts in his wars against the infernal. These hiracapaths are clad in crimson-and-gold armor, and their interior nimbuses of golden light are replaced with righteous fire. Such champions of their kind have the advanced simple creature template, and often possess unique abjuration and conjuration spell-like abilities."

The swarm responds by shaping itself into three-dimensional images.",

			"Hive mind beetle swarms' intellects focus primarily on food and weather. They can develop friendships with creatures who point them toward food sources, and may return to their new friends to inform them about approaching storms and other meteorological phenomena. Friendly swarms may even inform familiar creatures about other predators in the area, or assist in locating people or treasures (though the ravenous insects may just as readily eat the subject of their search).

			"A hivemind consists of a swarm of smaller creatures whose individual minds have supernaturally bonded into one to become a single, collective intelligence. Hiveminds often occur in swarms that have existed for generations and that have dwelled in areas of potent magical influence, particularly areas of strong psychic magic. Over time, the swarm learns to work together in more intelligent ways to achieve its goals, and it eventually evolves a cohesive mind. Of course, this evolution can be hastened by direct intervention of potent magic (typically something on the level of a miracle or wish), or as an unintended side effect of esoteric rituals, the use or destruction of artifacts, or the deaths of powerful minds.",
			"",
			"A hivemind swarm learns from its surroundings, which in turn shape its choices in the languages it learns and the psychic spells it develops a penchant for casting. An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience.",
			"",
			"Eventually, the hivemind's mental network takes on more complex tasks as a collective mind. At this point, the hivemind creates a nexus, a single individual in the swarm through which the collective routes all thought. While the nexus is often fairly inconspicuous within the teeming mass of the swarm, it is possible for a highly perceptive observer to notice its decisive movements, spellcasting gestures, or intense gaze. The death of the nexus does not eliminate the shared intelligence of a hivemind, but it is disruptive, forcing the collective to focus inward to regroup and form a new nexus."

			"Standing 3 feet tall and weighing nearly 150 pounds each, hobbe hounds are disposable war dogs of hobgoblin armies. Cowed only by shows of violence, they are loathsome and miserable creatures that return savagery in kind. The thick, waxy musk that constantly oozes from their pockmarked skin reeks of death and urine, and is highly irritating to non-goblinoids. Far worse, their fetid coating bursts into flame with the slightest spark, and while most armies would find flammable shock troops to be a hindrance, efficient and cruel hobgoblins find burning, baying, savage beasts of war ideal for breaking enemy ranks and sowing chaos before their own regiments close to melee.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds first appeared in Avistan during the Goblinblood Wars, when the beasts were unleashed against Andoren [Eagle Knights](rule/aff_vangard) along the war's southern front. The hobgoblins of the Chitterwood often intentionally set their own chargers ablaze, unleashing entire walls of flaming savagery upon the panicked soldiers. In the years since, surviving war beasts have formed feral packs in Isger, Molthune, and Cheliax, while hobgoblin tribes across the Inner Sea region have begun breeding their own stocks of the monsters.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds are the result of careful breeding and hobgoblin alchemical tinkering, and have little place in the natural world. Sharing many features with the more common goblin dogs-filthy, ratlike creatures that often dwell alongside goblins in their miserable villages-hobbe hounds boast much heavier frames and thicker hides at the expense of goblin dogs' already limited mental faculties. Generations of inbreeding have given them a dense musculature and incredible resistance to pain, while mutagens further develop their bulky bodies. This tinkering also exacerbates the species' overactive sebaceous glands, resulting in a secretion even fouler than the irritating dander of their leaner cousins. This alchemically infused body oil burns readily, producing billows of black, greasy smoke. Thanks to these same oils, hobbe hounds are somewhat resistant to fire, and a cruel training regimen destroys any fear of flame they might have once had, resulting in vicious beasts that rush into battle oblivious to the flames searing their own flesh. These glands often become infected due to heavy burn scars, and most hobbe hounds have repulsive patches of boils and blisters on their backs, necks, and heads.",
			"",
			"Hobbe hounds have great difficulty mating. Females go into heat irregularly and are picky about which males they allow close when they do. Their aggressive rejections leave scars or even maim potential suitors. On the rare occasion a pregnancy takes, the mother becomes listless and lazy, drained by the large and aggressive brood growing inside her. Hobgoblins feed these dazed mothers a steady diet of stimulants and mutagens to overcome this malaise; in the wild, other members of the pack become increasingly protective, given that they may see only one or two pregnancies in a year. After 3 months, the mother gives birth to a half-dozen stillborn pups and another five to 10 alert young. Born ready to eat meat, a hobbe hound pup generally makes its first meal of the littermates that didn't survive. Though the hobgoblins of Isger produced a number of variations (see Variations below), only one \"true\" breed has proven resilient enough to survive and flourish in new packs and environs without constant oversight and alchemical supplements.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Unsurprisingly, given their origins, hobbe hounds are aggressive in the extreme, with wild packs claiming large swathes of territory and attacking almost anything that enters, even predators many times their own size. A band of hounds hunts together out of a shared hatred for outsiders, but they lack the tactics or cooperation of most pack hunters. Once the prey is felled, individual hobbe hounds turn on one another in a fight to claim the choicest morsels.",
			"",
			"Those packs reared by hobgoblin tribes submit to goblinoid authority-partly from an inbred deference and partly from lifetimes of cruel beatings-and organize themselves at least marginally better than their feral kin. Tribes not actively campaigning sometimes use hobbe hounds as guards, but the willful beasts rarely stay in place unless chained to their posts. In active warfare, however, they shine, proving far more ferocious and resilient than mundane war beasts, and more obedient than worgs and similar allies of convenience.",
			"",
			"Riddled as they are with alchemical mutagens, hobbe hounds produce a number of potent byproducts. Their urine repels other canines and readily kills plant life, and their feces similarly destroy most fungi. Territories claimed by packs of hobbe hounds quickly become despoiled, marked by dead trees and chewed corpses that never fully decay. As food becomes scarce, packs turn to cannibalism to sate their hunger before finally moving on to fertile grounds.",
			"",
			"### Variations",
			"",
			"Born from mad experimentation and forced breeding, hobbe hounds are prone to mutations, and many variants have emerged. Because these variants are a result of alchemical tinkering, they almost always appear as domesticated animals, rather than in feral packs.",
			"",
			"Bug Hound: These leaner hobbe hounds are identifiable by their dark, dappled flesh. They retain a deference to goblinoids, but shun their own kind, instead slinking in the shadows and hunting by ambush, making them suitable companions for bugbear scouts.

			"Hobgoblins are militaristic and fecund, a combination that makes them quite dangerous in some regions. They breed quickly, replacing fallen members with new soldiers and keeping up their numbers despite the fortunes of war. They generally need little reason to declare war, but more often than not that reason is to capture new slaves-life as a slave in a hobgoblin lair is brutal and short, and new slaves are always needed to replace those who fall or are eaten.",
			"",
			"Of all the goblinoid races, the hobgoblin is by far the most civilized. They see the larger and more solitary bugbears as tools to be hired and used where appropriate, usually for specific missions involving assassination and stealth, and look upon their smaller goblin kin with a mix of shame and frustration. Hobgoblins admire goblin tenacity, yet their miniscule kindred's unpredictable nature and fondness for fire make them unwelcome additions to hobgoblin tribes or settlements. Nonetheless, most hobgoblin tribes include a small group of goblins, typically squatting in the most undesirable corners of the settlement.",
			"",
			"Many hobgoblin tribes combine their love of warfare with keen intellects. The science of siege engines, alchemy, and complex feats of engineering fascinate most hobgoblins, and those who are particularly skilled are treated as heroes and invariably secure high-ranking positions in the tribe. Slaves with analytical minds are quite valued, and as such raids on dwarven cities are commonplace.",
			"",
			"It is well known that hobgoblins mistrust and even despise magic, particularly arcane magic. Their shamans are treated with a mix of fear and respect, and are usually forced to live alone on the fringes of the tribe's lair. It is all but unheard of to find a hobgoblin practicing arcane magic, or as hobgoblins call it, \"elf magic.\" This is the root of their hatred of magic-the hobgoblins' hatred of elves.",

			"Hollow ones are complex creations designed to fulfill a variety of purposes, most often acting as servants, guardians, or assistants. Each hollow one is bound by a physical similarity to a certain humanoid, who sacrifices a portion of himself in the formation process.",
			"",
			"Unlike many constructs, however, the hollow one has a spark of intelligent life-the essence of its creator or the creator's victim. While this enlivening energy is little more than a shallow imitation of the original's true being, sometimes the hollow one can become more than an automaton and seek out its own life and motivations. These hollow ones are the most dangerous because they are most prone to madness (especially violent madness). Such a hollow one is the exception to the rule, however, and most are destined to become little more than slaves and playthings, obedient mockeries of those they were created to look like.",
			"",
			"When encountered, hollow ones are often mistaken for undead creatures instead of constructs, mainly due to the unconventional building material required to create these creatures.",
			"",
			"A hollow one is the same size as the humanoid it was fashion to resemble, but weighs a mere fraction of his weight due to being only chemically treated skin.",
			"",
			"As constructs generally created by alchemists, hollow ones are uncanny replicas of humanoids made from shreds of skin infused with magic and rare chemicals. Hollow ones have an advantage over many constructs in that they have intellects gifted to them by their creators during their construction. Even those who know the humanoids on which hollow ones are modeled well may still be duped by the hollow ones, as they are fashioned by a process similar to that used to create simulacra and their true nature is difficult to discern.",
			"",
			"The fundamental intelligence of these creatures makes them dangerous, however. They are unstable beings, and 5% of hollow ones harbor a deep loathing and jealousy of their creator, to a point where they cannot abide continuing to serve them. These hollow ones turn on their owners, seeking to kill and sometimes replace them. Another 5% of hollow ones develop a greater intelligence and personality than the creatures on which they're modeled, becoming superior versions of the originals. Often seeking the immediate destruction of their would-be masters, these hollow ones have inflated views of their own importance and place in the world and proceed to try to convince others of it. These creatures gain a +4 bonus to both Intelligence and Wisdom and a +6 bonus to Charisma. Many of these hollow ones go on to take class levels, typically matching those of their creator (or the person being emulated).",
			"",
			"Hollow ones begin as blank slates in terms of development. The energizing force within each evolves differently, so that three hollow ones created at more or less the same time by the same master can result in three unique constructs depending on the context and situational factors in which they were created.",
			"",
			"Some scholars make the assumption that the first hollow ones were created by foul creatures that made use of fleshwarping, but little evidence for this has been found. Records retrieved from before Earthfall mention hollow ones, so the practice of making these bizarre constructs is more than 10,000 years old, though it has only recently come to light again in Avistan.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Many hollow ones take on specific aspects of their creators. Some arcane psychologists and philosophers have suggested that the inherited aspect is the creator's most overriding emotion or state of mind at the time. Thus, a happy creator fashions a jolly hollow one, while a psychotic person creates a deranged one, and so on. However, the hollow one nurtures this aspect into something larger as it develops. Misery becomes overwhelming sorrow or joy becomes completely unbearable. Each year after its creation, the construct must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or lapse into madness brought on by these emotions. The direction this madness takes varies, but is always dangerous in some way.",
			"",
			"Hollow ones develop their own mannerisms similar to - but not always identical to - their creators'. Those that escape into society often act as beacons for other constructs-paragons and leaders that use their constructed followers on crusades of their own twisted devising, taking on levels in various classes, and become tyrants, dictators, and saints in their own design.",
			"",
			"Several narcissistic cabals and cults use hollow ones as tools of vengeance and assassination, creating scores of copies of the cult leader to visit punishments upon dozens of enemies at the same time, creating the illusion of omnipotence. Such tactics have been employed by power-crazed tyrannical alchemists, who go on a frenzy of self-harm and create scores of hollow ones. Sadly, such personal killers often become so crazed that they turn on their creator en masse and exact suitable revenge, usually starting by flaying the creator alive.",
			"",
			"A tale circulating through Absalom speaks of a thieves' guild that once operated in that city and employed hollow ones as patsies and for blackmail. The guild leadership would capture someone, torture the captive by flaying her skin, and then healing her so there was no evidence of the stolen tissue. They would then send the hollow one to commit a visible crime in order to implicate their victim. To clear her name, the victim was forced to pay the guild's leadership a hefty price.",
			"",
			"### Other Hollow Ones",
			"",
			"The method for creating hollow ones don't restrict the form to be that of a humanoid. The form needs to be a creature that has skin, though. A catalog of constructs was recently unearthed from an old Azlanti ruin that described an aboleth hollow one that perplexed the ancient explorer who encountered the strange creature. Hollow ones made in the form of creatures with particularly durable skin could have a much higher natural armor bonus than the typical hollow one described here.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"The process used to fashion a hollow one requires the creator to collect a considerable quantity of the skin of the person being copied (referred to as the subject) using knives and an arcane ritual that ultimately deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the subject. The skin is alchemically treated and enhanced into a form not unlike the wrappings of a mummy. At the final moment of the ritual, the creator removes a piece of the subject's brain using a specially created brass and ebony hook with a tiny movable cutting blade attached. This hook is inserted into the subject's brain through the nose to remove a portion of living brain tissue, an act that deals an additional 1d2 points of Constitution damage to the subject. At this point, the creator must succeed at a DC 30 Heal check; otherwise the subject permanently loses 1d3 points of Intelligence.",

Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.",

A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15th-level caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents."

			"",
			"Among the many manifestations of serpentfolk faith, the hollow serpent represents one of the most horrific harbingers of doom. Serpentfolk legend suggests Ydersius created the first hollow serpents as protectors and guardians for their underground enclaves. But serpentfolk priests soon learned how to make more, worshiping and cultivating the skin sheddings of monstrously giant snakes with rituals to turn them into engines of destruction. Capable of laying waste to entire regions, the hollow serpents used their life-draining coils to slay the enemies of the serpentfolk, proving particularly effective against the Azlanti empire in the early years of the serpentfolk's age-long struggle against humanity. Eventually, however, the Azlanti learned to combat these skins with positive energy and fire. With the retreat of the mighty snake-god and his people into the shadows of the Darklands, serpentfolk priests have hoarded the most potent of these defenders as guardians of the hibernation chambers of the serpentfolk elite.",
			"",
			"A typical hollow serpent measures a little over 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds. A lesser hollow serpent is 7 feet long and weighs just 90 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"While the first hollow serpents were supposedly created from scales shed by beasts favored by the Serpent King himself, and those unholy snakeskins can even shed their own lesser offspring over time, serpentfolk priests can also create their own lesser hollow serpents. A lesser hollow serpent created by a serpentfolk priest requires a more involved process. The priest must fill a clay pot with dirt taken from a serpentfolk grave, the skin and bones of a giant constrictor snake, an onyx gem worth at least 250 gp, and a sprinkling of unholy water. Thereafter, a 15th-level caster must cast create undead on the skin stuffed with the other assembled reagents."

			"**Bloodless Touch (Ex)** When a hooded harbinger makes a melee touch attack, its target must attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the save is successful, the victim takes 2d6+8 points of damage and is wracked by pain for 1 round, gaining the staggered condition. It is thereafter immune to that hooded harbinger's bloodless touch for 1 day. On a failed save, the portion of the victim's body that is touched begins to swell and turn purplishblack as the blood flow to it is restricted. This effect deals 4d6+12 points of damage per round and the victim gains the staggered and sickened conditions from the intense pain. After 1d4 rounds, the victim can attempt a new saving throw each round to try and end the effect. The effect can be ended sooner by a heal spell or a successful DC 23 Heal check. The Heal check requires a precise incision to the affected flesh, and consequently deals 2d6 points of bleed damage to the victim as the pressure of the entrapped blood flow is released. Once a victim has been affected by a bloodless touch, it can't be affected by another until the effects of the first one have ended. If the effects are ended by a successful save, then that individual is immune to further bloodless touch attacks by that hooded harbinger for 1 day. The bloodless touch attack of a hooded harbinger affects only living creatures with recognizable physiology and a blood supply. Undead, oozes, most constructs, and creatures that are not subject to precision damage are immune to bloodless touch. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Manifest Yellow Sign (Sp)** Once per day, a hooded harbinger can trace a mystical pattern in the air, causing a glowing, immaterial image of the Yellow Sign to appear before it. This image remains in place for 1d4 minutes. Any creatures within 100 feet who is able to see the sign (it glows as per light) must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or be confused for as long as the sign persists. The sign can be erased with dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel magic, or erase with a successful DC 26 caster level check. Anyone under the effects of the Yellow Sign will not act against the hooded harbinger in any way, though that does not mean that they will follow its commands. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.",
			"",
			"**Profane Reek (Su)** The musty, carrion stench wafting from the foul folds of a hooded harbinger's rags extends in a 5-foot radius, creating an aura of obscene influence around the creature. This terrible smell gives a hooded harbinger a profane bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. In addition, any breathing creature that enters this cloud must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be affected as though under the mental effects of a mind fog spell for as long as it remains within the profane reek's area of effect and for 2d4 rounds after it leaves. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the mind fog effect of that hooded harbinger's profane reek for 1 day. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Prophetic Utterance (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate action, a hooded harbinger can mutter a prophetic utterance against any single creature within 100 feet that has just dealt damage to it. This mutter is unintelligible to anyone but the target, which hears the utterance as a telepathic message pronouncing its doom. The target is immediately affected by a doom spell (no save) for the next hour or until the utterance is successfully dispelled (requiring a successful DC 26 caster level check).",
			"",
			"**Terrible Visage (Su)** A hooded harbinger never reveals its face. Only if slain or rendered helpless can anyone attempt to remove the hood and reveal the harbinger's true visage. However, as layers of the stinking, rotten wrappings around its face are peeled back or cut away, new layers are found beneath. These many filth-crusted layers can be removed only with 1d4+2 rounds of effort. If they are successfully removed, only those adjacent to the creature can see the revealed countenance and anyone able to do so must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by an insanity spell. Those who succeed at their saves are unaffected, as their minds mercifully erase the image from their memories. Those cured of the insanity receive the same relief. Immediately after the hooded harbinger's face is revealed, its body explodes in a massive flash of light and concussive force that completely obliterates all evidence of it. Anyone within 10 feet of the corpse when it explodes takes 6d10 points of force damage (Reflex DC 23 half) and must attempt two DC 23 Fortitude saves, one against blindness and one against deafness (both as per blindness/deafness). The save DC to resist the insanity effect is Charisma-based, and the save DCs to resist the explosion's effects are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"It is said that the Crawling Chaos is the messenger of the Great Old Ones, but whether this is by their command or his own whim is debatable. Regardless of why, the Great Old One known as Hastur sometimes instead relies on his hooded harbingers to relay messages to his far-flung cults and even to the High Priest Not To Be Described of mystery-shrouded Leng. These dread figures swathed in filthy yellow rags bear the whispered tidings of their Unnamed Lord. There are those who even speculate that the veiled priest of Leng is actually the greatest of the hooded harbingers, who gained some measure of autonomy-but the truth of this remains unknown. Thought to have originated in distant Carcosa by unthinkable means, hooded harbingers are exceedingly rare, and seldom is more than one encountered at a time.",
			"",
			"Though tasked with the menial role of messengers, hooded harbingers take their charge very seriously. Infused with the hateful potency of their master, they are able to call upon many terrible powers in defense of their duties. When forced into combat, they prefer to trip opponents with the trailing ends of their ragged arm coverings and administer their bloodless touch to as many victims as possible. They always attempt to use plane shift to flee if in danger of imminent defeat.",
			"",
			"Serving as messengers for Hastur, hooded harbingers receive the communications they deliver directly from the Great Old One via mental transmission. Upon receiving the message, the hooded harbinger twitches and shakes as if it were having a seizure. During this time they are particularly dangerous, because if they are attacked or distracted in any way, they fly into a furious rage and the offender risks attracting the attention of the King in Yellow.",
			"",
			"No one has seen a hooded harbinger's face and lived to describe it. If its hood is pulled back, the creature's head is seen to be completely swathed in the same filthy rags that cover its body. If it is helpless, the rags can be unraveled, but each layer only gives way to dozens of layers of the tattered yellow cloth. Eventually, a face is revealed, but it appears to be the face of the unraveler. If she is lucky, her memories are immediately wiped clean. If she is less fortunate or less able to forget, she is driven insane.",

			"**Attach (Ex)** When a giant hook fly hits with a bite attack, it latches onto the target, anchoring the target in place. An attached hook fly is effectively grappling its prey.

When a giant hook fly drains blood, its abdomen becomes bloated as it spawns an enormous brood of young. It gestates these flies in its abdomen until it has dealt 6 points of Constitution damage with this ability. The following round, the giant hook fly detaches from its victim, and as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, its abdomen ruptures and disgorges a hook fly swarm. The swarm appears adjacent to the giant hook fly and immediately attacks any nearby foes (it ignores the giant hook fly that spawned it).

Blood cultists, too, sometimes find that giant hook flies and their spawn are unwelcome visitors to their lairs. On more than one occasion, giant hook flies and their swarms have unwittingly driven evil creatures from their hiding places, surreptitiously aiding a populace shocked that the cultists have been operating in their midst the entire time.

It has a natural armor bonus of +3 (AC 15, flat-footed 14), 4 Hit Dice (26 hp), a +4 attack bonus to its bite attack, a base attack bonus of +3, a CMB of +2 (+10 grapple), and a CMD of 13 (21 vs. trip). Its spawn brood extraordinary ability deals only 1d6 points of slashing damage to it when its abdomen ruptures, and the ability expels two hook fly swarms at a time.",
			"",
			"Giant hook fly matriarchs are typically found alone or with other non-matriarch hook flies in places where spilled blood is enormously abundant, such as on or near recent battlefields, at sites of mass tragedy, or the like. Although they tolerate other giant hook flies, particularly their own spawn, giant hook fly matriarchs are often quite territorial, and matriarchs in close proximity often squabble or even fight the death. However, in places where blood is so abundant that the matriarchs don't need to fight for resources, giant hook fly matriarchs sometimes coexist peacefully, regularly giving birth to enormous broods. The prospect of such a hook fly population explosion is terrifying to most sentient creatures, as it would ensure that no living creature could survive nearby for long."

When hunting, it covers most of its body under the sands of the ocean floor and remains perfectly still until potential prey swims nearby. When it lunges, its bite is so quick and powerful that its hook-teeth can cut targeted creatures in half. A smaller (but still sizable) variant of the hookfang is the vampire worm, which drains blood from its victims."

The horla slowly drives its host mad by forcing him into increasingly destructive acts, yet it is always careful to issue its commands so that the repercussions are what cause lasting harm to a victim's social life or relationships rather than the specific acts.",
