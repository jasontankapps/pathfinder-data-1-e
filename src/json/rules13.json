			"Everyone knows the story of the blacksmith's son who, after taking up arms to defend his village, continues on to become a renowned adventurer. And of the young elf who spends years studying musty tomes and practicing simple spells before she heads out into the world to seek ancient lore. These are the stories of everyday adventurers, risen from the ranks of the common folk to make a name for themselves in places harsh and unforgiving.",
			"",
			"But these are not the only stories of heroism. Some adventurers are beyond exemplary - their stories forge the greatest sagas of history, and their every deed births a legend. From the children of gods, blessed with the divine spark, to the lucky heroes born under auspicious stars, these characters are destined to greatness. They are mythic: possessed of unparalleled heroism and capable of astounding acts.",
			"",
			"To be mythic means to draw upon a power that few even dare to understand, and even fewer hope to wield. An air of destiny surrounds mythic characters, and each choice they make shapes the world at large. Their story is intertwined with the great events of the day, and their actions are central to the outcomes. Mythic characters are more resilient and powerful than others, and as a result are awe-inspiring in ways their non-mythic counterparts could never match. Other adventurers might balk at taking on a dragon that plagues a village, but mythic heroes would not only take on the dragon, but also clear the entire region of threats.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the story of mythic heroes is defined by the challenges they face. The GM has a number of new and awe-inspiring tools with which to confront mythic player characters, ranging from immense and deadly mythic monsters to vile and cunning mythic villains. Mythic monsters are unique creatures or remnants of a bygone age when such terrifying beasts ruled over the land. They now dwell in the lost places of the world, waiting for their time to bring great terror. Mythic villains have many of the powers of mythic characters, but they use their abilities selfishly - to subjugate kingdoms, slaughter the innocent, and bring ruin to the world. Unless heroes rise to stop them, mythic villains can cause destruction and chaos on an unimaginable scale.",
			"",
			"Even with such great power, mythic characters are not invulnerable, just more able to deal with the dangers of the world around them. If a mythic character dies, her loss is a great tragedy to the world, as the light of one of its true champions has been extinguished. This is what makes a mythic story exciting: these heroes might fall, just as non-mythic heroes might succumb to lesser threats. And when they do succeed, their victory often comes at a high cost, and usually leaves them scarred.",
			"",
			"The rules herein give players and GMs the tools they need to run mythic adventures. The mythic rules add to the base rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, either as part of an adventure in which the PCs attain mythic power for a limited time, or as the backbone of an entire campaign charting the legend of a group of mythic characters."

			"In a world of might and sorcery, with dragons and elves, what does it mean to be \"mythic\"? Being mythic means possessing a degree of might unusual even in a fantasy world. Scenes turn more dramatic, the enemies are more lethal, and the consequences of the heroes' actions make a far-ranging impact. Being mythic means invoking a sense of wonder and awe even in those already accustomed to the strange and unusual.",
			"",
			"The way this section portrays the mythic narrative isn't solely about stories at 20th level and monsters with high Challenge Ratings - it's about the surprising and unfamiliar regardless of power and scale. Even 1st-level characters could be imbued with mythic power and become forces to be reckoned with. Similarly, lesser monsters such as ogres and skeletons that become mythic transform into terrifying foes with unknown powers, changing the nature of the story you're playing - and startling those accustomed to their non-mythic ilk.",
			"",
			"Not only the characters take on unexpected forms in mythic adventures; the setting does as well. The vistas are more dramatic, featuring flying islands and keeps that float in raging volcanoes. The colors are brighter, the sounds are more mysterious, and all of the other stimuli are sharper and more vibrant. Where the non-mythic hero would encounter a crumbling keep filled with familiar monsters, a mythic hero faces a towering citadel that builds itself from the bones of would-be invaders and is inhabited by cruel and malign creatures of nearly god-like power.",
			"",
			"Besides the setting, the challenges that face mythic characters are far more harrowing than usual. Enhanced abilities allow mythic characters to take on threats beyond the reach of those without such power. They can face with ease foes both powerful and numerous. The real challenge is when they take on mythic creatures that possess the same resilient nature and abilities similar in potency to those they themselves rely on. When a mythic hero comes face to face with a mythic monster, the battle is truly legendary.",
			"",
			"Finally, mythic adventures feature difficult choices and far-reaching consequences. As the characters progress through the story, they're tasked with taking on challenges that seem impossible even to them, and might be tempted to wander from their path. As mythic heroes, they're the first to respond to cataclysmic events, just as they're the last bastion to stem the tide of evil and darkness that threatens to wash over the world. Their successes and failures leave marks on the world for centuries to come."

			"",
			"***Ascension:*** The [moment of ascension](rule/mythic_ascension) is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.",
			"",
			"***Boon:*** When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a [boon](rule/mythic_boons). A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.",
			"",
			"***DR/Epic:*** A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.",
			"",
			"***Mythic:*** With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See {rule/Mythic versus Non-Mythic}.)",
			"",
			"***Mythic Path:*** (Often referred to just as a \"path.\") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her [mythic path](rule/mythic_paths)-archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Power:*** Each mythic character can call upon this [base mythic ability](rule/base_mythic_abilities) to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Rank:*** (Often referred to just as a \"rank.\") Similar to tiers, [mythic ranks](rule/mythic_rank) are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Tier:*** (Often referred to just as a \"tier.\") Mythic characters advance in power by {rule/gaining tiers}, each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Trial:*** (Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A [trial](rule/gaining_tiers) is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.",
			"",
			"***Non-Mythic:*** Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.(See {rule/Mythic versus Non-Mythic}.)",
			"",
			"***Surge:*** Surge is a basic ability that each mythic character receives. It allows her to roll a die and add the result to a d20 roll, influencing the outcome after the results are revealed."

In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power - such as its source - to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.",

This critical part of the story is called the ***moment of ascension***. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline.

It's generally easier to start with a lower MR - you can always increase the MR later if you need the monster to be a little more powerful.",

If half the MR isn't an even number, round down to get the monster's final CR. Use [Table 6-8: Monster Statistics by CR](rule/evaluating_monster_statistics) to evaluate whether the monster's abilities are appropriately challenging for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities complement its non-mythic abilities particularly well, that mythic creature may be too powerful for its final CR. If a creature's mythic abilities don't interact with its non-mythic abilities, that creature may be too weak for its final CR. If either of these situations occur, make adjustments to the monster so it better fits the intended CR.",

Once the monster's abilities and statistics fit its CR, you're done."

When you take 10 on any Intelligence-based skill check, add your tier to the result. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to ask one question as if using divination. The base chance for a correct answer is 70% + your highest arcane caster level + your tier (maximum 100%). The answer doesn't come from a divine agent, but from your own native understanding; therefore, the answer is never cryptic.

As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell.

Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph). This specific creature must be known to you, but it doesn't have to be known by the target. The target gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to pass as that individual, but Bluff checks or knowledge of the individual might be required to make the disguise truly convincing. ",

While it's in this form, treat the familiar as an intelligent magic item with the familiar's mental ability scores but no magical abilities. You can add magical enhancements, intelligent item powers, and intelligent item senses as if you possessed the appropriate crafting feat. (For example, if your familiar transforms into a staff, you could craft it into an intelligent staff of fire as if you possessed the {feat/Craft Staff} feat.) You must still pay for enhancements as normal. As a standard action, the familiar can transform into and out of its item form and does so in such a way that you can have it immediately equipped when the transformation is complete. While in item form, your familiar retains its original hit points, but gains the hardness of the item it transforms into. If your familiar takes enough points of damage in item form to become broken, it automatically reverts to its familiar form and cannot change to item form again until it is healed to its maximum hit point total.

By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it - a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door.

As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to surround yourself with a bubble of air enclosed by a thin iridescent layer of force. While this bubble offers no protection from attacks, you can propel yourself through the air at great speed. As long as you concentrate, you gain a fly speed of 240 feet per round. If you cease concentrating, the bubble stops and then sinks 30 feet per round until it reaches the ground and collapses; you can expend one use of mythic power before the bubble collapses to regain control.",

			"In the void of outer space, the bubble's speed is much faster. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system takes 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond takes 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Ceasing concentration while in the void of outer space has no effect on the bubble - it continues traveling in the previously stated direction at the same speed until an outside force slows it down. The air in the sphere is constantly refreshed and kept at a constant temperature, protecting occupants from the void of space, but not necessarily the harsh climates of other planets or planes. By expending two additional uses of mythic power, you can increase the size of the bubble to a 10-foot-radius sphere and you can bring along up to 11 Medium creatures within the bubble. Other creatures can enter or exit the bubble freely."

When making a charge attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to include a single Acrobatics check made to jump, adding 10 feet per tier to the height or distance you jump. You take no falling damage from the height gained as part of this leap. If your attack hits, you may deal an amount of additional damage equal to the falling damage appropriate for the height you reached. Alternatively, you may replace your melee attack from this charge with a grapple check. If you successfully grapple a creature, you bring it to the ground with you at the end of your jump, and it takes an appropriate amount of falling damage for the height it was at when you grappled it.",

The third time, it also applies to heavy armor.",
			"",
			"***Backlash (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 21](source/mythic_adventures)): You strike back at those who penetrate your defenses.

			"***Burst Through (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 21](source/mythic_adventures)): When you charge, you can move through allies and opponents almost as if they were not there to obstruct your path. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.",

If the touch attack hits, the foe is sickened for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If the touch attack is a critical hit, the foe is also blinded for the same duration. A blinded foe can spend a full-round action to remove the gore and end the blindness. At the GM's discretion, creatures that are immune to disease, those that live in filth (such as otyughs), or those that revel in bloodshed (such as demons) might be immune to the sickened effect of this ability.",
			"",
			"***Climbing Master (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 21](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain a climb speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks.

			"***Crusader (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 21](source/mythic_adventures)): Your prowess and ability draw countless followers to your banner. You gain followers as if you had the {feat/Leadership} feat. In addition, you add your tier to your leadership score when determining the number of followers you gain. Whenever you are within 100 feet of such followers, each follower can use the surge ability once per day without needing to expend mythic power. The followers use the same die type as your surge ability. If you have or gain the Leadership feat, you gain followers from both this ability and the Leadership feat (in effect doubling the number of followers gained).",
			"",
			"***Devastating Smash (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you attack a construct or object, treat its hardness (or damage reduction in the case of constructs) as 10 less than normal.

			"",
			"***Flash of Rage (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you or an ally within 30 feet is struck by a critical hit, you can enter a rage as a free action on your next turn. This rage functions as the barbarian class feature, and lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier. You aren't fatigued after this rage. If you have the rage class feature, these rounds don't count toward your daily uses of that ability, you can use abilities that require patience and concentration while in this rage (although you are still restricted when using your rage class feature normally), and these rounds of rage don't count toward the total number of rounds of rage used when determining how long you are fatigued.

As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.",
			"",
			"***Juggernaut (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 22](source/mythic_origins)): Little can stand in your way when you charge forth into battle - even solid doors and walls don't stand a chance. While charging, you may attempt a free Strength check to break through a single door or wall in your path. You can expend one use of mythic power while performing this charge to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Strength check to break the object. If you destroy the object, you can continue your charge as though it were never there. If you fail to destroy the object, your movement ends in the square before that object. Note that destroying integral parts of a structure may trigger a collapse (treat as a cave-in) at the GM's discretion. This ability can be combined with other path abilities and effects that modify charge attacks, such as the *burst through* path ability. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you may break through one more wall or door during your charge, and the circumstance bonus on your Strength check increases by 10 (to a maximum of a +30 circumstance bonus).",
			"",
			"***Lesson Learned (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.",
			"",
			"***Limitless Range (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): Multiply the range increment on all of your ranged and thrown weapons by 5 feet, and these weapons no longer have a maximum range increment for you. You can throw any melee weapon as if it had a range increment of 20 feet - this increment isn't multiplied by 5, but the weapon doesn't have a maximum range increment.",
			"",
			"***Meat Shield (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use a creature you're grappling to protect you from harm. If you're grappling a creature and are attacked with a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action you can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against your grappled opponent. If you succeed, the incoming attack targets your grappled opponent instead of you. If you fail, the grappled opponent breaks free from the grapple and the incoming attack targets you as normal.",
			"",
			"***Mounted Maniac (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): Your unstoppable momentum while mounted is terrifying. Whenever you charge a creature while mounted, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of your target, adding your tier to the result of the check. If you expend one use of mythic power, any creature demoralized by this ability is frightened instead of shaken. The duration of this condition is dependent upon your check, as noted in the Intimidate skill.",
			"",
			"***Mule's Strength (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 22](source/mythic_origins)): You treat your Strength score as 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity. This bonus applies to encumbrance, the maximum weight you can lift over your head, dragging and pushing, and so on. You can take this path ability multiple times.

			"",
			"When you use the surge mythic ability against a creature whose mythic tier or rank is higher than yours, you add the difference between your tiers as a bonus to the surge result; if the surge applied to an attack roll, the attack also deals additional damage equal to your tier. In addition, you can use the surge mythic ability twice per day without using one use of mythic power, but only when the roll modified is against a mythic creature.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Ki (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain 2 points in your ki pool (up to your maximum).

			"",
			"***Mythic Smite (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 22](source/mythic_adventures)): As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to regain one use of your smite evil ability.

			"***Overcharged Blast (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Whenever you use one of your kinetic blasts, you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to apply one additional infusion to the blast, beyond the normal limit of one form infusion and one substance infusion per blast. Additionally, whenever you use this ability, you reduce the total amount of burn you would accept from the blast by 2 (to a minimum of 0).",
			"",
			"***Punishing Blow (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 23](source/mythic_adventures)): Any opponent you hit with a melee or ranged attack loses the benefits of regeneration and fast healing for 1 round. In addition, if you score a critical hit against the target, it loses the benefit of its damage reduction for 1 round. A creature whose regeneration can't be suppressed or ignored (such as the tarrasque) is immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"***Sniper's Riposte (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 22](source/mythic_origins)): You're an expert at defending yourself while aiming a ranged weapon. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity from making ranged attacks. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the Stealth check penalty for sniping for 1 round.",

The damage from these sunder attempts ignores item hardness. If you destroy an item in this way, you drive the shattered pieces of the item into the flesh of its wearer or wielder, dealing 1d6 + a number of points equal to your tier of piercing damage. This damage bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"***Swimming Master (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 23](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain a swim speed equal to your base land speed and a +8 racial bonus on Swim checks. If you already have a swim speed, your base swim speed increases by 30 feet.

			"***Tear Apart (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 23](source/mythic_adventures)): You can attempt to rend the armor of your opponent, reducing its effectiveness. Using this ability is a standard action that requires you to attempt a sunder combat maneuver check against your foe. If the check is successful, reduce the target's armor bonus, natural armor bonus, or shield bonus (your choice) by half your tier (minimum 1). If the creature has an enhancement bonus to the bonus you chose, reduce the normal bonus first, then apply any leftover reduction to the enhancement bonus. You can't reduce the bonus below 0. Armor and shields damaged in this way can be repaired as if they had the broken condition. Natural armor regains the lost bonus at the rate of 1 point per day. Lesser restoration restores 1d4 points of natural armor bonus, and restoration restores all of it.",
			"",
			"***Titan's Bane (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 23](source/mythic_adventures)): You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space.

For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a two-handed weapon.

			"***Disabling Strike (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 22](source/mythic_origins)): With your mighty strikes, you can brutally batter the limbs of your foes. Whenever you score a successful critical hit against an adjacent creature, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to potentially disable one of that creature's limbs. Mythic creatures receive a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your Strength modifier + your tier), while non-mythic creatures do not. An affected creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and one of its limbs (your choice) is mangled. If you choose to disable an arm, the creature drops anything held in that arm, cannot hold items in that arm, and makes natural attacks with that arm at a -4 penalty. If you choose to disable a leg, the target's base movement speed is halved. These penalties are removed when the Constitution damage taken from this ability is healed.

Non-mythic creatures that fail their saves fall prone and are staggered for 1 round. Non-mythic creatures that succeed at their saves and mythic creatures that fail are staggered for 1 round.

While using the *uncanny grapple* path ability, if you throw a creature into a solid object, that object takes the same amount of damage as the creature; if this is enough to break the object, the creature continues to move through it. If you throw the creature into another creature, resolve the attack as a bull rush by you, except the thrown creature moves with the bull rush and does not incur any attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares. If you crush the creature, you can choose to deal either 1d6 points of lethal damage per tier or 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per tier, and you can limit the damage you deal to the amount required to render the target unconscious. If you swing the creature as a weapon, add your tier to the amount of damage you deal to both creatures; if you score a critical hit, the target of the swing attack also takes damage from a melee natural attack from the creature you are swinging (if it has one; choose randomly if it has more than one).

Whenever you make a full attack, your attack bonus on the additional attacks you gain by having a high base attack bonus is 5 higher. This ability can't give any of these attacks a higher attack bonus than your base attack bonus. For example, a 12th-level fighter normally has a base attack bonus of +12/+7/+2; with this ability, his base attack bonus is +12/+12/+7.

As a standard action, make a single ranged attack roll and resolve the attack against all targets in a straight line up to the maximum range of your weapon, stopping at any barrier the attack couldn't penetrate. Roll damage once and apply that damage to each creature hit by the attack. Before making the attack roll, you can expend one use of mythic power to bend the path of the attack up to two times as it strikes targets or objects. Each deflection can alter the line of the attack up to 90 degrees, allowing you to shoot around corners or cover."

			"***Critical Master (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you roll a critical threat against a non-mythic creature, you automatically confirm the critical hit and deal the maximum amount of damage to that creature. This ability can be selected twice. The second time it is selected, it also applies to mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"***Fistful of Daggers (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): When you could make a full attack with thrown weapons, you can instead make a single attack roll at your highest attack bonus and apply the result to any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage once and deal it to all creatures hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. You must throw one weapon at each target. Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of concealment for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.",
			"",
			"***Kinetic Font (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to open up a wellspring of kinetic energy within yourself. Each round, beginning on the round in which you use this ability, you can reduce the total amount of burn you would take for a single blast or utility wild talent by 1, to a minimum of 0. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to half your mythic tier. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Perfect Strike (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to deliver a perfect strike. A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a &times;2 weapon deals &times;3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike. Perfect strike can be used in conjunction with any champion's strike if you expend uses of mythic power for each ability separately.",
			"",
			"***Seven-League Leap (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 23](source/mythic_origins)): Your leap is so mighty that you defy gravity. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks made to jump. The distance you can jump in a round is not limited by your movement speed. If you are carrying no more than a light load, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a powerful jump that lets you sail through the air. In order to use this ability, you must be able to run in a straight line for 1 minute. Any obstacles or impediments that prevent you from completing this sprint uninterrupted prevent you from being able to use this ability, though the expenditure of mythic power is not wasted. At the end of your 1-minute sprint, you attempt an Acrobatics check and leap a distance up to half the check's result in miles, rounded down to the nearest mile (for example, an Acrobatics check result of 29 would allow you to jump 14 miles). This trip takes 1 round per mile, and you reach a maximum height at the apex of your arc equal to half the distance traveled. You do not take falling damage from using this ability. You must have a clear arc of travel to complete this jump; if you strike an obstacle mid-jump, you and the obstacle each take a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 &times; the number of miles you have left to travel. If this damage destroys the obstacle, you continue your jump; otherwise, your jump comes to an end and you fall, taking falling damage as appropriate. You cannot aim this leap accurately, and always land 50 to 5,000 feet (5d%) from your intended destination.",

			"***Shatter Spells (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.",

			"Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful - indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.",

			"",
			"*Absorb Blow (Su):* As an immediate action, whenever you take hit point damage from a single source (such as a dragon's breath, a spell, or a weapon), you can expend one use of mythic power to reduce the damage you take from that source by 5 per tier (to a minimum of 0 points of damage taken). If you have another ability or effect that reduces damage (such as protection from energy), reduce the damage with the absorb blow ability before applying any other damage-reducing effects. For every 10 points of damage that this ability prevents, for 1 minute you gain DR 1/epic and 5 points of resistance against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The DR and resistances stack with any other DR and resistances that you have.",
			"",
			"*Beast's Fury (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount with some of your mythic power. As an immediate action, that creature can move up to its speed and make an attack with one of its natural weapons. When making this attack, the creature rolls twice and takes the higher result. Any damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. A creature affected by this ability can take these actions in addition to any others that it takes during its turn.",
			"",
			"*Sudden Block (Su):* As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the ally's AC against this attack. The creature making the attack must make two attack rolls and take the lower result. Once the attack is resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the guardian path abilities lists or from the [universal path abilities lists](rule/universal_path_abilities). Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***True Defender (Su):*** At 10th tier, whenever you take damage from a melee or ranged attack scored by a non-mythic creature, the damage is halved. This reduction is applied after all other reductions in damage, such as energy resistance or damage reduction. Once per round, when an enemy scores a critical hit against you, you regain one use of mythic power."

			"",
			"***Affliction Resistance (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): Your body is honed to fight off even the most virulent illnesses. Whenever you succeed at a saving a throw against a disease or poison, you become immune to that disease or poison for a number of hours equal to half your tier. If you are affected by the disease or poison and succeed at a saving throw to cure it, you automatically cure yourself of the affliction (even if it would normally require more than one saving throw to cure), and you become immune to it for a number of hours equal to half your tier.",
			"",
			"***Armor Master (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You don't take an armor check penalty or incur an arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor or using a shield (including a tower shield). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus of light armor doesn't apply to you. You can select this ability up to three times. The second time, it also applies to medium armor. The third time, it also applies to heavy armor.",
			"",
			"***Armored Might (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You treat the armor bonus from your armor as 50% higher than normal, to maximum increase of half your tier (minimum 1). For example, if you are 4th tier and wearing +2 breastplate, you treat the armor's +6 armor bonus as +8 (50% of +6 is +3, limited to +2 by half your tier).",
			"",
			"***Avenging Maneuver (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): Taking grievous wounds only empowers you. Any creature that confirms a critical hit with a melee attack against you provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can use this attack of opportunity only to attempt a bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting this combat maneuver check.",
			"",
			"***Borrow Elements (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you store some of this energy within yourself and can direct it outward through your attacks. Whenever you take energy damage, you gain an amount of energy of that type equal to 1/2 the damage taken (after any resistances or immunities are applied). Whenever you hit with a melee attack, you may expend 5 points from the pool of one energy type to have the attack deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of that type. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to release all stored energy of one type as a ray with a 60-foot range. The ray deals 1d6 points of energy damage for every 5 points of energy stored. If unused, the stored energy harmlessly dissipates 1 minute after the last time you took energy damage of any type.",
			"",
			"***Burst Through (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you charge, you can move through squares containing allies and opponents almost as if they were not obstructing your charge. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.",
			"",
			"***Draw Fire (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): As an immediate action, when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an immediate action by expending one use of mythic power.",
			"",
			"***Empathic Healing (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.",
			"",
			"***Ever Ready (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the {feat/Combat Reflexes} feat. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th tier, the number of attacks of opportunity you can make each round increases by one.",
			"",
			"***Fast Healing (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain fast healing 5 for 1 minute. This ability can be taken a second time at 3rd tier or higher and a third time at 6th tier or higher. Each additional time you take this ability, the fast healing increases by 5.",
			"",
			"***Guarded Gathering (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Whenever you use your gather power class feature, the gathered energy swirls around you, forming a protective barrier. You gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to half your mythic tier (rounded down, minimum 1).",
			"",
			"***Guardian's Shout (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Your warning shouts keep allies from danger. Whenever you attempt a Reflex save to avoid an effect that affects multiple creatures, you can expend one use of your mythic power to call out a warning to your allies. Any allies within 100 feet who can hear you gain a bonus equal to your tier on their saving throws against that effect.",
			"",
			"***Immovable (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Add your tier to your CMD whenever an enemy attempts a bull rush, drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against you. If the check is successful, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to cause it to fail instead.",
			"",
			"***Imprinting Hand (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.",
			"",
			"***Indefatigable Traveler (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): You can run and charge while fatigued or exhausted, and you ignore the movement penalty while exhausted. When [traveling overland](rule/overland_movement), you can expend one use of mythic power to be able to hustle for a number of hours equal to your tier without taking nonlethal damage or becoming fatigued (this is in addition to the 1 hour per day normally allowed for hustling). In a day of normal walking, you can walk 8 hours plus 1 hour per tier before you must start making Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"***Irrepressible Soul (Su)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): Your true self can't be buried beneath disguises or magical effects. Once per round as a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to end one effect that is currently affecting you. When you use this ability, you make an additional saving throw against the effect at its original DC, even if one would not normally be allowed. This ability can end only polymorph effects, charm and compulsion effects, domination effects, illusion effects that change your appearance, and any effects that control or conceal your true identity. If you succeed at the second saving throw, the effect immediately ends.",
			"",
			"***Knowledgeable Guardian (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Add double your tier as a bonus on Knowledge checks you attempt to identify monsters, including checks made to learn any special powers and vulnerabilities. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to telepathically communicate the knowledge you obtain from this check to all allies within 100 feet.",
			"",
			"***Lesson Learned (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): You adapt quickly to the perils presented in battle. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.",
			"",
			"***Mule's Strength (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): You treat your Strength score as 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity. This bonus applies to encumbrance, the maximum weight you can lift over your head, dragging and pushing, and so on. You can take this path ability multiple times. Each time you do, you treat your Strength score as an additional 5 points higher when determining your carrying capacity.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Companion (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.",
			"",
			"***Mythic Mercy (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use the mercy paladin class feature, your caster level check to remove curses, diseases, and poisons automatically succeeds unless the affliction is from a mythic source. If you expend one use of mythic power when using a mercy, you add break enchantment to its effect, using your paladin level as your caster level. You must have the mercy class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Pack Wild Shape (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Partial Transformation (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You have refined control over your transformation ability. When using wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to only partially transform into or out of animal form. For example, you could transform your hands into tiger claws and your head into a tiger's head (giving you low-light vision and scent, and allowing you to make claw and bite attacks but still wear armor and use worn magic items normally), transform into a deinonychus with human hands (allowing you to still manipulate objects and wear rings), or transform into a constrictor snake with a humanoid head (allowing you to speak and cast spells with verbal components). You may make one such change per round as a free action for the duration of that use of wild shape. For example, if you change into a tiger, this ability allows you to partially transform yourself from tiger form to your normal form and back as needed until the duration ends or you fully return to your normal form. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Quick Recovery (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you are dazed, dazzled, deafened, sickened, or stunned, reduce the duration of that condition by half (minimum 1 round). Any other effects relating to the source of that condition are unaffected; for example, if you are panicked and sickened from an eyebite spell, the panicked effect has the normal duration even though you are sickened for only half as long. You can select this ability twice. The second time you select it, you also reduce the duration of the blinded, nauseated, and paralyzed conditions by half.",
			"",
			"***Raise Animal (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): By burying the corpse of a dead animal (at least its bones) and expending one use of mythic power, you raise it from the dead overnight. You can use this ability on an animal companion, familiar, or bonded mount even if it is not a creature of the animal type. At 1st tier, this functions like raise dead. At 3rd tier, this functions like resurrection. At 6th tier, this functions like true resurrection.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Disarm (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use a ranged attack to disarm an opponent. Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.",
			"",
			"***Relentless Healing (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a healing spell or using a class feature that heals damage to apply that healing to the dead creature. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.",
			"",
			"***Retributive Reach (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an attack of opportunity. If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the attack roll and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Sacrificial Shield (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Once per round when you would normally be hit by a weapon attack, you can use your shield to block the attack. You must be using a shield in order to use this ability. Subtract your shield's hardness and hit points (see [Table 7-12](rule/breaking_things)) from the damage of the attack and apply the remaining damage to your hit points. If the shield takes enough damage to destroy it, it's destroyed. Otherwise, it gains the broken condition, even if the damage was not enough to give it the broken condition under other circumstances. You can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to negate any damage dealt to the shield, though you still take any damage that exceeds its hardness and hit points. You can choose to negate the damage after the damage is rolled.",
			"",
			"***Supreme Tracker (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 30](source/mythic_adventures)): If you have something that carries a creature's scent (such as a personal item or piece of flesh), you can expend one use of mythic power to create a supernatural bond that allows you track that individual. As a free action, you can sense the creature's general direction and distance, as well as know whether it is alive, dead, destroyed, dying, or undead. The creature must be on the same plane as you for this ability to function. For the purpose of spells and effects that block scrying and divination, your caster level for this effect is a number equal to double your tier. At 6th tier, you can track the creature if it's on a different plane than you.",
			"",
			"***World's Heart (Su)*** [Star Tower] ([Mythic Realms pg. 15](source/mythic_realms)): While touching the ground, you gain a bonus on Strength checks and to your CMD equal to half your mythic tier (minimum +1). As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power while touching the ground to remove the exhausted or fatigued condition and gain a bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls equal to half your mythic tier (minimum +1) for 1 round. For the purposes of this ability, you are considered to be touching the ground when you are outside or underground and on the ground, or when you are touching the floor in a stone or earthen building built on solid ground."

As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder opponents until the end of your next turn. When this ability is active, any creature moving out of one of your threatened squares, even when making a 5-foot step or using a form of movement that doesn't usually provoke attacks of opportunity, provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If your attack of opportunity hits and deals damage, the creature remains in its current space and its movement ends. Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of a charge.

If you succeed, you learn the type of teleportation effect (such as dimension door) and the creature's intended destination, and then may prevent the effect (as if using a quickened dimensional anchor, using your character level as your caster level) or accompany the opponent as if you were part of its gear with negligible weight.",

If you have the {feat/Whirlwind Attack} feat, you can use this ability at the same time that you make an attack against each foe within reach, allowing you to attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check against each foe that you hit. After you've pushed opponents backward, you may move with any one of your bull rush targets.",

			"***Shield of the Martyr (Su)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 25](source/mythic_origins)): By expending one use of mythic power, you can use the *take the hit* path ability on an ally within 30 feet rather than an adjacent ally. Alternatively, you can expend one use of mythic power when using take the hit on an adjacent ally to take all of the damage (as well as any other effects, such as disease, grab, or poison), not just half.

You remain partially aware during this stasis and can detect any lethal threats within 5 feet of you. There are several ways to end this stasis.

If you take damage while in stasis, you immediately awaken, though you are staggered for 1 hour. Finally, you can use sheer force of will to awaken from stasis without expending mythic power, taking 1d4 weeks for you to awaken. When activating this ability, you can put an adjacent willing allies into stasis as well. There is no limit to the number of allies you can put into stasis in this way, but you must expend three additional uses of mythic power for each ally.",

As an immediate action, that creature can move up to its speed and make an attack with one of its natural weapons. When making this attack, the creature rolls twice and takes the higher result. Any damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. A creature affected by this ability can take these actions in addition to any other actions it takes during its turn.",

The spell must be on one of your divine class spell lists (or your domain or mystery spell list), must be of a level that you can cast with that divine spellcasting class, and must have a casting time of \"1 standard action\" (or less). You don't need to have the spell prepared, nor does it need to be on your list of spells known. When casting a spell in this way, you treat your caster level as 2 levels higher for the purpose of any effect dependent on level.

You can cause the altered energy to either affect the opposite kind of targets (undead or living), or change whether it heals or harms, but not both. Channeled energy that has been changed in this way heals or deals half the normal amount of damage. For example, if an evil cleric attempts to channel negative energy to heal undead, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert that to channeled positive energy that either heals the living or harms undead. You must have the channel energy ability to select this ability.",

Alternatively, you may focus this channeled energy so it affects only the undead creature that hit you. If you focus solely on that creature, you are considered 4 levels higher in the class that grants you the channel energy feature when determining its effects.",

			"***Channel Shockwave (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 33](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of channel energy whenever you score a critical hit against a creature that has an element of alignment opposite to your own (chaotic and lawful are opposite, as are evil and good, so if you were lawful good, you could use this ability against a chaotic creature or evil creature). If you do, add your channel energy damage to the damage from the critical hit. This damage is the same type as your channeled energy (positive or negative) but damages the target regardless of whether it's living or undead. The target can attempt a Will save against your channel energy DC to halve this bonus damage. All other effects of your critical hit still apply.",

			"***Contingent Channel Energy (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 33](source/mythic_adventures)): You can simultaneously expend one use of mythic power and one use of your channel energy ability to delay your channel energy so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate. The conditions needed to bring the channel energy into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the channel effect occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. For example, you could create a trigger that uses your channel positive energy if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. If you prescribe complicated or convoluted conditions, your contingent channel energy ability could fail to trigger. The ability triggers based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You make all decisions about the ability when you expend the use of mythic power, according to what you can normally do with your channel energy ability; if you wish to exclude targets, you must name them at that time. You can have only one use of this ability waiting to be triggered at a time; if you use this ability again, the previous use expires. This use also expires after 1 day per tier if it hasn't been triggered. This use of channel energy can't be regained until after the contingent channel energy ability is triggered or expires.",

Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level. You can have only one creature that has been summoned using this ability at a time; summoning another causes the previous one to disappear. If you expend two uses of mythic power, the level of the summoning spell is equal to your tier instead. For example, if you are a 10th-level druid, 5th-tier hierophant, you can use this ability to summon one creature from the summon monster II or summon nature's ally II list (or a lower-level list) for 10 rounds; if you expend two uses, you can instead summon one creature from the summon monster V or summon nature's ally V list (or a lower-level list).",

			"***Empathic Healing (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 34](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.",

			"***Enhance Magic Items (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 34](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.",

			"***Faith's Reach (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 34](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you cast a divine spell with a range of touch, you can instead cast the spell with a range of 30 feet. If the spell normally requires a melee touch attack, it instead requires a ranged touch attack.",
			"",
			"***Flexible Counterspell (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 34](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic power enhances your ability to counter spells. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to counter a spell. Upon using this ability, you must identify the spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell's level).

When talking or dealing with a non-mythic intelligent creature, you always detect the selected type of information without a skill check, though you do not necessarily understand what the information means. For example, realizing that someone is concealing an emotion doesn't necessarily tell you what emotion the person is hiding, whether she's lying, or why. This ability has no effect against mythic creatures. You can select this path ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you must choose an additional option.",

This healing can be from a spell or effect you cause or from a magic item you wield. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared.

You can continue to apply excess healing to other adjacent allies until no injured allies are adjacent or you run out of excess healing. For example, if you could cure 40 points of damage with your cure critical wounds spell and the target has taken only 20 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 20 points of healing to an adjacent ally; if that second ally has taken only 15 points of damage, you can apply the remaining 5 points of healing to another adjacent ally.",

This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment (such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment.

For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any divine spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on a divine spell cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though any metamagic effects on spells already cast remain). You can select this ability more than once.

If you're targeted by any of these spells, as an immediate action you can expend one use of mythic power to turn the spell back upon the original caster as if using spell turning.

If the spell has other duration conditions, those still apply (for example, the duration of stoneskin changes to 24 hours or until discharged). A creature can't be subject to more than one spell affected by this ability at a time; if another is cast upon the creature, the first one ends.

If you expend one additional use of mythic power, the voice deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per tier to enemies within 60 feet of you who can hear it, and they are stunned for 1 round.

Alternatively, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to target a mythic creature. The target can attempt a Will save against the effect (DC = 10 + half your tier + either your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher).

This shell of a creature gains the mindless quality, and it acts like a puppet with you as the puppeteer. The creature is neither living nor dead, and positive and negative energy have no effect on the creature. It immediately regains half its maximum number of hit points, which becomes its new maximum hit point total for the duration of this effect.

The puppet must still have all the necessary components to activate special abilities and spells. Abilities that normally refresh periodically, like breath weapons, do not refresh. Once the puppet takes an amount of damage equal to its total number of hit points or the duration of this effect ends, the puppet is destroyed and becomes a corpse once again.

			"Some are destined not only to achieve personal greatness, but also to inspire armies, rally the fallen, and bring the most out of those who follow them. The marshal is such a leader, renowned for his vision, courage, and strategic acumen. Soldiers flock to a marshal's banner for a chance to serve under such a commander, confident that his skill will see them through even the most difficult challenges.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As a marshal, your abilities allow you to inspire mythic and non-mythic allies alike to greatness. In a group, you protect and push your allies to even greater acts of heroism. All the while, the powers of the marshal allow you to take the lead, help your companions, and take the fight to your enemies.",
			"",
			"***Classes:*** Bards, cavaliers, clerics, inquisitors, and paladins will all find a host of useful abilities in the marshal path. In fact, almost any character who assists others, both during combat and afterward, will likewise find that the path of the marshal includes a number of valuable abilities that will help in her noble endeavors.",
			"",
			"***Bonus Hit Points:*** Whenever you gain a marshal tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.",
			"",
			"### Path Features",
			"",
			"As you gain tiers, you gain the following abilities.",
			"",
			"***Marshal's Order:*** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"*Advance (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire a tactical advance on the field of battle. This allows you and each of your allies within 30 feet to take either a single move action of the character's choice or a 5-foot step, as long as you or your ally has the ability to take such an action (for example, an unconscious character still can't take an action). The action granted by this ability doesn't count toward the number or type of actions a creature is allowed to take on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Decisive Strike (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to give one ally within 30 feet the ability to immediately make a single melee or ranged attack on your turn. Add your tier as a bonus on the attack roll. The damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. This attack doesn't count toward the ally's actions on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Rally (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rally your allies. This gives you and each of your allies within 30 feet the option to reroll any one d20 roll after the roll is made. The granted reroll must be used before the beginning of your next turn, and the creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"***Path Ability:*** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the marshal path abilities lists or from the [universal path abilities lists](rule/universal_path_abilities). Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"***Visionary Commander (Su):*** At 10th tier, whenever you or an ally within 30 feet rolls an initiative check, roll twice and take either result. If the first round of combat is a surprise round, you and all allies within 30 feet at the start of the combat can take a full round's worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action. Once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet scores a critical hit against a mythic creature, you regain one use of mythic power."

			"### 1st-Tier Marshal Path Abilities",
			"",
			"You can select these path abilities at any tier.",
			"",
			"***Additional Order (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You learn an additional marshal's order ability. You can select this ability twice.",
			"",
			"***Assured Skill (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you attempt a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.",
			"",
			"***Clarion Call (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You bestow your wrath on your allies. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all allies within 30 feet the benefits of your active smite or challenge ability, directed at the same opponent you're targeting with that ability. Only the constant effects from the smite or challenge are conferred with this ability, not the ones you can use only once. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier or until either the combat ends or the subject of the smite or challenge is dead or unconscious.",
			"",
			"***Commanding Entrance (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): When you first enter an area or make your presence known to a group of strangers, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power and attempt a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the attitudes of everyone within 10 feet per tier, and an additional number of characters equal to your Charisma modifier who are outside that range but have line of sight to you. (For instance, you could affect everyone near the entrance of a throne room and key people on the dais at the far end.) Alternatively, when you reveal yourself during the first round of combat (not counting the surprise round), you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to use Intimidate to demoralize your targets.",
			"",
			"***Deadly Guidance (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You are able to point out the weak points in an enemy's defenses, and your allies benefit from your tactical insight. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to designate a single opponent within 30 feet of you. All allies within 30 feet of that opponent gain the sneak attack ability when attacking it, and can thus deal +1d6 points of damage when flanking that opponent or when the opponent is otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This sneak attack damage stacks with sneak attack damage from other sources. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You can take this ability up to four times. Each time you take it, the sneak attack damage from this ability increases by 1d6.",
			"",
			"***Directed Assault (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): By finding a gap in your enemy's defenses, you allow your allies to take advantage of your discovery. When you confirm a critical hit with a melee or ranged weapon against an opponent, allies within 30 feet of that opponent add your tier to their critical confirmation rolls against that opponent. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. During this duration, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert an ally's successful attack into a critical threat. The ally must be within 30 feet, and can also gain the bonus to its confirmation roll. Only one opponent can be the focus of your directed assault at a time. If you confirm a critical hit against another creature, you may make it the new focus (immediately ending the previous focus) or maintain the current focus.",
			"",
			"***Distracting Assailant (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): You make a barrage of attacks and quick feints that are so distracting your opponent loses focus against all other assailants. Whenever you successfully strike a foe with a melee weapon or natural attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action. For 1 round, that opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to AC on all attacks against it other than yours. While this ability is in effect, any allies who flank that foe gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it, instead of the normal +2. While the opponent is affected by this ability, each time you hit it, the duration increases by 1 round. This effect automatically ends if your turn ends and the target is not within your melee reach.",
			"",
			"***Focus (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mighty and inspiring presence enhances the power of your companions' heroic surges. Whenever a mythic ally that is within 30 feet uses the surge ability, it rolls its bonus die twice and takes the higher result.",
			"",
			"***Granted Stride (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic grace means that you and your allies easily pass through undergrowth at full speed. Allies within 30 feet of you gain the benefits of woodland stride (as the ranger class feature), as long as they can see and hear you. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow allies within 30 feet to ignore naturally occurring difficult terrain in any of your favored terrains for 1 minute per tier. You must have the woodland stride and favored terrain class features to select this ability.",
			"",
			"***Greater Surge (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your surge is more powerful than most. Treat your tier as if it were 3 higher for the purpose of determining your mythic surge die (maximum 10th tier). When you gain your 10th tier, your surge die becomes 2d8.",
			"",
			"***Helpful Rebuke (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): You are quick with stern yet helpful words of advice. Whenever an ally within line of sight fails a skill check with a skill you're trained in, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow that ally to reroll that skill check with a bonus equal to your tier. If the new roll is successful, your ally succeeds at that check instead of failing it. The ally who failed the skill check must be able to see and hear you to gain this reroll. You can use this ability with a skill you aren't trained in, but you must expend two uses of mythic power to do so, and the ally doesn't gain your tier as a bonus on the reroll.",
			"",
			"***Heroic Block (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): With surprising speed, you can leap to an ally's defense. When a opponent makes a melee attack against one of your allies, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to move up to double your speed or take a 5-foot step. You must end this movement adjacent to the attacking opponent. When you end this movement, you can immediately use the aid another action to grant a bonus to your ally's AC. This bonus is applied before the opponent's triggering attack. These actions don't count against your actions this turn.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Minions (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"***Inspired Defense (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use bardic performance to inspire courage, the competence bonus against charm and fear effects instead applies to all saving throws. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a bardic performance to inspire courage, you add your tier to this bonus.",
			"",
			"***Inspiring Surge (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Your surge inspires non-mythic allies to greater acts of martial daring. Each time you use your surge ability, each non-mythic ally within 30 feet gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for the next weapon attack it makes before the start of your next turn. An ally must be able to see and hear you to gain the bonus. You can take this ability up to three times. When you take it the second time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to half your tier. When you take it a third time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to your tier instead of half your tier.",
			"",
			"***Lend Power (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): You are an invaluable asset to your comrades. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power or your Confidence ability (see [3rd-tier abilities](rule/marshal_2_3)) to grant the benefit of your surge ability to a mythic ally within 30 feet. The ally uses your surge die.",
			"",
			"***Lightning Performance (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Your tongue is as quick as any blade. You can start a bardic performance as a swift action instead of a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can instead start a bardic performance as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Loyalty (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain {feat/Leadership} as a bonus feat. If you already have the Leadership feat (or if you take it at a later level), add your tier to your Leadership score. Whenever you use your marshal's order ability and your cohort is within 100 feet, you can include your cohort as an additional ally affected by your order.",
			"",
			"***Menacing Presence (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Something about you puts others on edge. You can attempt an Intimidate check to influence a creature's attitude as full-round action instead of it taking 1 minute. In combat, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can attempt to use Intimidate to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a standard action, or as a move action if using the {feat/Dazzling Display} feat.",
			"",
			"***Mounted Marshal (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): Whenever you're riding on a bonded mount or animal companion, you and your mount are each treated as flanking any opponent you both threaten. Whenever you use your surge ability while mounted, your mount heals a number of hit points equal to your surge result plus your tier. You can expend one use of mythic power while charging with your mount to deal double damage to the target of your charge (or triple damage if you're wielding a lance).",
			"",
			"***Mythic Fascination (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use the fascinate or suggestion bardic performance ability, non-mythic creatures take a penalty on their saving throws against it equal to half your tier. If you expend one use of mythic power when you activate the performance, the penalty also applies to mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"***Painful Gambit (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Facing off against you is never a safe option when your allies stand beside you. When you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow all of your allies to make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked you if it's within their melee reach.",
			"",
			"***Perfect Aid (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you successfully use the aid another action, your ally also adds your tier to the aid another bonus. If you use your surge ability on the aid another roll, add the result of the surge die to this bonus as well.",
			"",
			"***Persuasive Countenance (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"***Potent Message (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): You can expend one use of mythic power to create a song, oration, poem, or joke that contains information that you want to spread. This can include points of fact or simple instructions. You only need to perform the work once (which takes 1d4 hours to complete); thereafter it will spread through the community by itself. For 1 day per tier, all non-mythic beings that hear this message (whether from you or someone else) are compelled to spread it to others by slipping it naturally into conversation or otherwise bringing it up. Anyone who has heard this message takes a -4 penalty on opposed Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against you when you request that they to carry out duties related to this message. This is a language-dependent effect. At 6th tier or higher, you can expend one additional use of mythic power to make this work universally understandable, regardless of any language barriers.",
			"",
			"***Press the Advantage (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): When an ally seriously harms a foe, you seize the moment. When an ally within 30 feet confirms a critical hit against a creature you threaten, the target of the critical hit provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you hit with your attack of opportunity, all of your allies gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that creature for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Redirect Attention (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): Where you point, others feel overwhelmingly compelled to look. You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose - and away from others; non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-footcone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"***Resurging Words (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Using the power of your mythic presence, you spur on allies even when all seems lost. Using this ability takes 10 uninterrupted minutes, during which time you give a stirring speech to all allies within 30 feet of you. If you expend one use of mythic power at the end of the speech, your allies gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your tier plus your Charisma modifier, and a bonus on saving throws against fear equal to half your tier (minimum 1). Any ally who currently has 1/4 of its full hit points or fewer gains twice as many temporary hit points from this ability. The temporary hit points and saving throw bonus last for 24 hours. Allies can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Rise Up (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Your allies draw strength from your courage and leadership. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all of your non-mythic allies within 30 feet one use of the surge ability, using your surge die. This surge must be used within a number of rounds equal to your tier. An ally can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Shout of Defiance (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): You can channel holy energy into a righteous shout of defiance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and one use of either channel energy or lay on hands to create a 100-foot spread of healing energy. All allies within this spread heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 plus double your tier. If this brings an ally from negative hit points to 0 hit points or more, the ally can immediately stand up from prone without provoking an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Smiting Aura (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use your smite evil ability, you can expend one use of your mythic power to create a 20-foot-radius aura centered on you that lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier.

			"",
			"***Tactical Genius (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain a bonus teamwork feat. You must meet all prerequisites for the feat. Any ally within 30 feet of you counts as having that teamwork feat for the purposes of you gaining bonuses from the feat (the ally doesn't gain the bonus unless it actually has the feat). At the start of each day, you can spend 10 minutes and expend one use of mythic power to replace this teamwork feat with any other teamwork feat you qualify for. You can select this ability up to three times. Each time, you gain an additional bonus teamwork feat. If you have selected this ability more than once, at the start of each day you can replace any number of teamwork feats this ability grants you, spending time and uses of mythic power for each feat you replace.",
			"",

			"***Concentrated Barrage (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): You can direct your allies to attack as a unified force. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to enable two allies within 30 feet of you to each make a single ranged or melee attack at a target you designate. Allies must be able to attack the target (either with a ranged weapon or by being close enough to use a melee weapon), and may choose not to. Each attack is resolved using the attacker's highest base attack bonus, and this attack doesn't count toward the ally's total number of actions on its turn. At 6th tier and higher, you can affect up to three allies with this ability. At 9th tier and higher, you can affect up to four allies with this ability.",
			"",
			"***Confidence (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You can draw upon a deep reserve of confidence in times of need. You can call on confidence three times per day to use the surge mythic ability without expending one use of mythic power. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you gain three additional uses of confidence per day.",
			"",
			"***Corner of the Eyes (Su)*** [Mordant Spire] ([Mythic Realms pg. 13](source/mythic_realms)): By focusing, you sense and analyze magical auras through your peripheral vision. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of arcane sight, except your eyes don't glow. You can maintain this ability for up to 1 minute per tier, but while using it you're staggered from the focus required. The staggered condition can't be removed as long as you maintain the effect, but you can cease focusing as a free action.",
			"",
			"***Demagogue (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You have an unnatural ability to call and sway crowds with your commanding presence and flawless rhetoric. When in a small town or larger settlement, you can expend one use of mythic power to [gather a crowd](rule/city_streets). Doing so takes 4d10 minutes. Add your tier to your Charisma bonus and then multiply the sum by 5 to determine how many creatures are in the crowd (as long as the settlement has a sufficient population to provide a crowd of that size, as determined by the GM). For example, a 4th-tier marshal with a +6 bonus to Charisma could gather as many as 50 creatures. The crowd remains for 1 hour, and you gain a +10 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to direct the crowd. You can expend another use of mythic power to extend the effect for another hour. This is a language-dependent effect.",
			"",
			"***Dispel Fear (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You can rally your allies and relieve their fear. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to either end all fear effects affecting allies within 30 feet of you, or end all fear effects on one ally within line of sight who can clearly see you and hear you.",
			"",
			"***Don't Cross Me (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): Even when you're away from your thralls, they fear and obey you. When you successfully use Intimidate to make someone helpful, you can expend one use of mythic power to cause the creature to remain helpful to you even in your absence for up to a number of days equal to your tier. At the beginning of each day, the creature may attempt a Will save; if it succeeds, this effect ends prematurely (DC equal to the result of your original Intimidate check minus 2 for each day since the creature last had direct contact with you). This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"***Flexible Confidence (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): Your resolve is more useful that others'. You can expend the uses of your confidence ability as uses of mythic power for the purposes of your marshal path abilities.",
			"",
			"***Glorious Charge (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You call your allies to make a coordinated charge at the same time. As an immediate action when you start a charge, you can expend one use of mythic power and allow an ally to charge immediately after your charge is complete. You can expend additional uses, allowing one more ally to charge per use spent. An ally's charge doesn't count toward the number of actions it can take on its next turn.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Martyrdom (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): Your friends and allies are compelled to fulfill your requests, even at the risk of their own safety. When you attempt a Diplomacy check to make a request of someone who has an attitude of helpful toward you, the DC of your Diplomacy check doesn't increase when you request dangerous aid or request aid that could result in punishment for your target. You can expend one use of mythic power to use this ability when attempting Intimidate checks, effectively allowing you to coerce someone into performing obviously dangerous or harmful acts. (Such use of this ability is often an evil act.) You must have the *persuasive countenance* marshal path ability to take this ability.",
			"",
			"***Master of Mercy (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): Your touch provides great relief. If you have the mercy class feature, when you lay on hands, you can expend one use of mythic power to apply all the mercies of your level or lower instead of just the mercies you've selected. If you don't have the mercy class feature, you can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to remove a single condition from a creature you touch, using your tier as your paladin level to determine what mercies are available to you. You can select a different mercy each time you use this ability.",
			"",
			"***Master of Shadows (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You are a master of moving unseen and unheard, and adept at guiding others in quiet and undetected movement. When you or any ally within 30 feet attempts Stealth checks, each of you rolls twice and takes the higher result. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to add your tier to one ally's next Stealth check. The ally must be within 30 feet and the check must occur within the next minute.",
			"",
			"***Mob Ruler (Sp)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): You can move a crowd to tranquility or whip it into a frenzy. By expending one use of mythic power, you can affect a large group of non-mythic creatures - anyone within 20 feet per tier who can see or hear you - with either rage or calm emotions (caster level equal to your character level). If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can escalate an already riotous crowd into confusion (as the spell) or direct their ire toward a target of your choosing (as mass suggestion).",
			"",
			"***Mythic Bond (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): Your hunter's bond ability is more powerful than most. If your bond is with an animal, that animal gains half your favored enemy bonuses. If your hunter's bond is with your companions, you can activate the bond as a swift action, granting your allies your full favored enemy bonus instead of just half.",
			"",
			"***Shared Alertness (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): Your presence and guidance allow others to avoid traps and other dangers. Allies within 30 feet of you that can clearly see and hear you gain your trap sense ability. If you have evasion or improved evasion, you can expend one use of your mythic power as an immediate action to grant that ability to one ally within 30 feet until the beginning of your next turn.",
			"",
			"***Shatter Resilience (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You can channel your mythic power through your strike to lower your target's damage reduction. When you hit a creature that has DR, you can expend one use of mythic power as part of the attack to lower the target's DR by an amount equal to your tier (to a minimum of 0) for 1 minute. Multiple uses of this ability on the same creature don't stack.",
			"",
			"***Unfettered Spirit (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): As an immediate action when an ally within 30 feet fails a d20 roll that could be modified by your spirit bonus, you can spend 1 point of mythic power and allow your spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence over you to add your spirit surge die to the check's result. If the ally is receiving your spirit bonus from the spirit influence ability, you can choose to either spend your mythic power or allow your spirit to gain additional influence instead. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Words of Hope (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius, granting each of them the ability to roll twice and take the higher result on one attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. An ally can use this ability once per round for a number of rounds equal to half your tier, and must choose whether to roll twice before rolling the die. This is a language-dependent emotion effect."

			"***Beacon of Hope (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You radiate a supernatural aura that fills your allies with hope and resolve. All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus against fear and emotion effects, and a +4 bonus on stabilization checks. Furthermore, each time one of these allies is subject to a healing spell or effect, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to your tier. Once per day as a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and end this aura to heal all allies within 30 feet of an amount of damage equal to 1d6 hit points per tier you possess. If dismissed, the aura automatically reactivates 24 hours later.",

			"***Castigate (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): While your words can soothe and aid your friends, they are equally adept at assaulting your foes. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to unleash a scathing verbal assault that demoralizes all opponents within 30 feet for 1 minute, as if you had successfully used the Intimidate skill. These opponents must be able to clearly see and hear you, but this ability is not language dependent.",
			"",
			"***Fast Friends (Su)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): You have such a way with words that you can befriend entire groups of people with a single utterance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to improve the attitudes of all non-mythic creatures within 30 feet by one step. You can use this ability multiple times to improve these creatures' attitudes by multiple steps. Mythic creatures receive a Will save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to negate this effect. The improvement to attitude lasts a number of hours equal to your tier. This ability is generally ineffective in combat (except perhaps to sway the attitude of a crowd of bystanders or an unaffiliated neutral party) or against creatures that intend to harm you and your allies in the immediate future.",
			"",
			"***Fight On (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): With an order or a determined look, you spur a wounded ally to keep fighting. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.",
			"",
			"***Free Your Mind (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): You can reach into the mind of your allies and free them from unwanted influence. You can spend 1 point of mythic power as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting an ally within 30 feet. The effect immediately affects you instead, and you receive a saving throw to resist the effect as if you were the original target. If you succeed, the effect has no effect on you; otherwise, you are subject to it. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Inspiring Assault (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.",
			"",
			"***Stones Will Weep (Su)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): Your art can awaken the spirits of beasts, plants, and even the elements. You can attempt Perform checks in place of Handle Animal checks. You can expend one use of mythic power to speak with animals (as speak with animals), plants (as speak with plants) and elements (as stone tell, except this effect targets fire, wind, and water as well as earth) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. While speaking with plants or the elements, you can also request their aid, effectively allowing you to use animate objects, animate plants, control water, control winds, and stone shape. You must expend one use of mythic power as well as one use of bardic performance for each round you want to use these spell-like abilities, and on each round you can simultaneously use a number of these abilities equal to half your tier. You must have the bardic performance ability to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"***Surge of Inspiration (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.",
			"",
			"***Unswerving Loyalty (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): You are a bastion of strength and resolve, and you possess the ability to protect your mind from even the most powerful charms and compulsions.

Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power."

Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.",
			"",
			"***Role:*** As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding - but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.",

The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.",

This attack doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. When making a deadly throw, roll twice for the attack, take the higher result, and add your tier to the roll. If the attack misses, the weapon or alchemical item lands adjacent to the target, regardless of the range.",

At any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll.

			"",
			"*Surprise Strike (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee attack or ranged attack against a target within 30 feet, in addition to any other attacks you make this round.

			"***Aim for the Eye (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): You can home in on your targets with uncanny and supernatural accuracy. You can make ranged sneak attacks from up to 60 feet away (rather than 30 feet). When calculating range penalties for ranged attacks, you are always considered to be one range increment closer to the target than you actually are. Whenever you successfully score a critical hit against a flat-footed creature with a ranged attack, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to blind that creature for 1d4+1 rounds. A mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Dexterity modifier). Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are creatures with unusual anatomies (GM's discretion).",

			"***Assured Drinker (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): No one can stop you from imbibing, even in combat.

			"",
			"***Clown (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one creature laugh uncontrollably, as the hideous laughter spell. The saving throw against this effect is equal to 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. If you aren't in combat when you use this ability, it can affect any number of creatures in a burst with a radius of 10 feet per tier.",
			"",
			"***Combat Trickery (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Through buffoonery and deceit, you can trick opponents into moving where you want them. You can make a single combat maneuver check using your Bluff check modifier in place of your CMB. Apply the result of this check to all adjacent opponents, and resolve it for each enemy independently as a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver. For example, if facing three opponents, you can roll one check and attempt to bull rush the first, drag the second, and reposition the third.",
			"",
			"***Compelling Feint (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): Your parries, attacks, and dodges are sporadic and difficult to predict by those who oppose you. Whenever you feint, you can choose to feint against all opponents within 10 feet, using the same Bluff check for each opponent. If you expend one use of mythic power while you're feinting, any target you successfully feint against is considered flat-footed against the first attack any creature makes against it before its next turn. You must use this ability after your Bluff check is rolled but before the results are revealed.",

			"***Control the Mindless (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): You can gain control over mindless constructs and undead. Using this ability is a standard action, and requires you to make a Knowledge check against the target's CMD. Use a Knowledge (arcana) check against a mindless construct, or a Knowledge (religion) check against a mindless undead. If your check equals or exceeds the creature's CMD, you can give the creature an order that lasts up to 1 round. For every 5 by which you beat the DC, your control lasts 1 additional round. The creature's creator or controller can't regain control during this time unless it also uses this ability. If you expend one use of mythic power when attempting to use this ability, the duration of your control increases from rounds to an equal number of minutes.",
			"",
			"***Crime Spree (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action when not in combat, you can attempt two Sleight of Hand checks to take items from other creatures, but you take a -5 penalty on each check. As a standard action in combat, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against each creature within your reach that you choose, without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Deadly Dodge (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. During this time, whenever a creature misses on a melee attack against you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can choose to either take this attack of opportunity or force that creature to reroll the attack and change the target to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the attacker's reach. This reroll uses the same modifiers as the initial attack roll.",
			"",
			"***Defensive Move (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Once per round, you can designate one opponent. Unless you attempt to move through that opponent's space, your movement (including standing up from a prone position) doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that opponent. If you move through the opponent's space, you can still attempt an Acrobatics check to do so without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can take this ability more than once. Each additional time you select it, you can designate one additional opponent when you move.",
			"",
			"***Down Like Dominoes (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): When you successfully trip a foe, as a free action you can attempt an additional trip attack against a creature adjacent to the first foe tripped at a -4 penalty. The adjacent creature must be no more than one size category larger than the creature you just tripped. If this second trip is successful, you can continue to attempt to trip creatures as long as they are adjacent to the last one successfully tripped, taking a cumulative -4 penalty on each trip attempt after the first. In a round, you can trip a number of creatures equal to half your tier in this way, and only until your first failed trip attempt. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping additional foes with this ability, and if you fail a trip attempt after the first there's no chance of you tripping yourself.",
			"",
			"***Enhance Magic Items (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.",
			"",
			"***Faster than the Eye (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): Few can trace your expert skills of legerdemain. You can use Sleight of Hand to lift or plant objects as a move action with no penalty. When you use Sleight of Hand to steal something, the target takes a penalty equal to your tier on its Perception check to notice the theft. You can use Sleight of Hand to plant a small object on someone else. When doing so, you use the same method and bonuses as you would for lifting the same item.",
			"",
			"***Ghostly Performance (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use bardic performance, you don't need to spend an action to maintain the effect. This means you can maintain the performance if paralyzed or stunned, although it still ends if you are unconscious or dead. You must still expend rounds of bardic performance to continue the effect. Once you start a performance, its effect continues whether or not the subjects can perceive you or the performance. When the performance ends, its effects linger for a number of rounds equal to your tier. This extended duration stacks with any other abilities that extend the duration of your performance, such as Lingering Performance. This ability doesn't change how many active performances you can have at once.",
			"",
			"***Impeccable Balance (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Even the smallest of handholds and outcroppings are more than sufficient for your purposes. You automatically succeed at all Acrobatics checks to walk along narrow ledges. Your Acrobatics checks never take a penalty because of obstructed, slippery, sloped, or unsteady surfaces, and you can move at full speed across such surfaces with no penalty. You also gain a +10 bonus to CMD against trip attacks.",
			"",
			"***Improbable Prestidigitation (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check to hide or retrieve objects in a personal extradimensional space, similar to a glove of storing. You can take 10 or 20 on this check, and the space can hold up to 1 cubic foot of material per tier. An item the size of a potion or dagger can be stored or retrieved with a successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check; the DC increases to 25 for an item roughly the size of a one-handed weapon. Storing an item is a swift action, and retrieving it is a move action. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve any number of items from your extradimensional space.",
			"",
			"***Inspire Minions (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"***Knot Expert (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): You can tie knots in rope with a flick of your wrist, and can do so from the far end of the rope. You can tie a knot in any rope you hold, including turning it into a lasso, as a swift action. You can also use a whip, lasso, spiked chain, or similar weapon to constrict an opponent. In order to do so, you must make a successful attack with the rope-like weapon, after which you can, as a swift action, attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature, adding your tier to your combat maneuver check. If you are successful, the creature is considered to be grappled, though you are not, and you can deal {umr/constrict} damage to the creature equal to the amount of damage you could normally deal with the weapon used.",
			"",
			"***Master Dilettante (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You are passingly familiar with almost every subject and have dabbled in numerous fields and activities. You gain a competence bonus equal to your tier on all untrained skill checks. You can attempt all skill checks untrained, even if the skill normally cannot be used untrained.",
			"",
			"***Master of Escape (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use the Escape Artist skill to break free from spells and magical effects that limit your movement or actions. While you're subject to a spell or effect that gives you the entangled, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned condition, once per round as a free action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check to end the condition. The DC for this check is equal to the save DC of the spell or effect that caused the condition. If you succeed, you end one such condition on yourself (your choice), though this doesn't make you immune to similar effects from the same source (such as moving through black tentacles or web). If the spell or effect doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't use this ability to overcome it.",
			"",
			"***Nimble Glide (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you fall, you don't take any damage and you land on your feet. When using this ability, you fall at a rate of 150 feet per round, and can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall.",
			"",
			"***No One of Consequence (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, you're under a permanent nondetection effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action.",
			"",

			"",
			"***Persuasive Countenance (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"***Ranged Disable (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can use a thrown weapon or reach weapon to attempt a Disable Device check to disable a device. If you're using a thrown weapon, the range of this ability is 30 feet; otherwise, it's your reach with the reach weapon. You take a -5 penalty on the check and can't take 10 on the check, even if you have an ability that would normally allow you to do so. If you expend one use of mythic power, you ignore the -5 penalty and can attempt the check in place of an attack (such as if making a full attack or attack of opportunity).",
			"",
			"***Rebounding Stare (Su)*** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): You can cause your hypnotic stare to bounce between creatures. When you use your hypnotic stare, you can spend 1 point of mythic power to affect an additional creature within 30 feet of the original target with the stare for 1 round. You can affect additional creatures up to your mythic tier. You can maintain additional stares by spending 1 point of mythic power per additional stare each round.",
			"",
			"***Redirect Attention (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose - and away from others. Non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-foot-cone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"***Ricochet (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever a creature has cover from your ranged attack, you can deflect the shot off a nearby surface, treating that surface as the origin point of the attack to determine whether the target receives a cover bonus to its AC. You can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from you if you know what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.",
			"",
			"***Shadow Stealth (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you're in darkness, you can move at full speed within that area without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to teleport from one area of darkness to another within 100 feet as if using greater teleport. You must have line of effect to the destination.",
			"",
			"***Sniper's Riposte (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You're an expert at defending yourself while aiming a ranged weapon. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity from making ranged attacks. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the Stealth check penalty for sniping for 1 round.",
			"",
			"***Subtle Magic (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you cast a spell or activate a spell trigger or spell completion magic item, you can attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by a Sense Motive check from anyone that can see you. Those who fail the opposed check don't know that you cast a spell or activated an item unless it has an obvious effect that emanates from you. In addition, the magical auras of magical effects on you and magic items you carry (except for artifacts) can't be detected.",
			"",
			"***Supreme Stealth (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): Choose one of the following senses: blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. A creature using the chosen sense can't automatically detect you, and must succeed at Perception checks as normal to do so. If you choose blindsight, this ability also affects blindsense. You can select this ability up to three times, each time choosing a different sense.",
			"",
			"***This Might Just Work (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You're adept at combining optimistic resourcefulness with natural skill. You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a -5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it. The GM can disallow certain uses of this ability when the skill can't possibly be applied to the task.",
			"",
			"***Thwart Detection (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can bypass magical constructs, spells, and traps that are meant to allow only certain creatures to move or act within their range. This includes constructs, spells, and traps that can be bypassed with a password as well as those that can be programmed to exclude specific creatures based on type or other physical characteristics (such as alarm, forbiddance, glyph of warding, and symbol of death). You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.",
			"",
			"***Titan's Bane (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks it makes, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.",
			"",
			"***Transfer Magic (Su)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic nature allows you to take magic from others as easily as you could take their gold. By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target. If the transferred magic can't affect you (for example, if it doesn't affect creatures of your type), it ends immediately as if dispelled. You can't use this ability to transfer continuous bonuses from magic items, such as an armor bonus from bracers of armor.",
			"",
			"***Trap Taker (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use the Use Magic Device skill instead of Disable Device to disable magical traps. If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.",
			"",
			"***Treacherous Critical (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): When you score a critical threat, you can attempt a free combat maneuver check instead of dealing extra damage. If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result. If the result is equal to or greater than your opponent's CMD, the attack deals damage as normal and you can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against that opponent, using the confirmation roll as your combat maneuver check for the purpose of determining the effects of the maneuver.",
			"",
			"***Unintentional Feint (Ex)*** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You make near misses look like expert feints, and your efforts are rarely wasted. If you make an attack roll that misses your original target, you can expend one use of mythic power to specify a second target, which must be adjacent to you (if a melee attack) or the original target (if a ranged attack). If the second target would be hit by what you rolled, you hit that target and deal damage as normal.",
			"",
			"***Unwavering Skill (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can always take 10 or 20 on class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20.",
			"",
			"***Wall Run (Ex)*** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): When you move, you can travel across vertical surfaces as if they were floors. If your movement doesn't end on a horizontal surface, you fall at the end of your move unless you are able to remain in place using another ability (such as using the Climb skill to cling to a handhold). The vertical surface must be capable of supporting your weight - for example, you couldn't move across a windowpane or curtain."

This sabotage is a sunder combat maneuver that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Add your tier to your CMB when attempting this maneuver. If you succeed, you can give the broken condition to a single item the opponent is wielding or carrying. This attack doesn't deal any damage to the object. The condition can be removed by spending 1 minute undoing the sabotage, or instantaneously with mending or a similar spell.",

Typically, this means that the task takes half the normal amount of time to accomplish. If the skill would normally take a full-round action, it instead takes a standard action. If it would normally take a standard or move action, it instead takes a swift action. If it would normally take a swift or free action, it instead takes no time at all.

The trap's CR can't be higher than your tier, and the trap remains in the place you designate for a number of hours equal to your tier.

You leave no tracks (as pass without trace), and ignore adverse effects from nonmagical difficult terrain and ground hazards, including caltrops.

If you expend one use of mythic power when creating a disguise to impersonate an individual, you can read that creature's mind as if using detect thoughts with a range of 1 mile.

Thereafter, every consecutive round that you deal sneak attack damage, add a cumulative +1d6 bonus on your sneak attack damage roll. The targets of these sneak attacks don't need to be the same.

			"A character's mythic power is classified by tier, with a 1st-tier mythic character already being significantly more powerful than a non-mythic character of the same level and a 10th-tier mythic character possessing nearly godlike puissance. Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are gained in a different manner from levels. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. A trial is a difficult task that adds to the legend and story of your character. Achieving a new mythic tier occurs independently of experience point progression (though you will also gain experience points for the various encounters you complete as you progress through your trials).",

The GM decides what qualifies as a trial, and it's up to you to complete it as you would other adventures. You might not even know you are attempting a trial until it is completed and the GM informs you to note it on your mythic character sheet, though you'll likely get an inkling when you find yourself facing a particularly challenging foe or attempting something that most would find impossible.",

			"The number of trials required to attain each new tier appears on Table 1-2: Mythic Trials per Tier. For example, suppose a 5th-level fighter discovers her mythic heritage and becomes a 1st-tier champion. Over a number of sessions, she earns enough experience points to gain her 6th level of fighter. During this time, she doesn't complete a trial, so she doesn't advance to the next tier of the champion path. During the next session, however, she engages in a climactic battle against a mythic troll that has plagued the town for years; by defeating the troll, she completes her trial, allowing her to become a 2nd-tier champion. To reach 3rd tier, she will need to accomplish two more trials. A mythic character can't gain more than 10 tiers.",

These spines function as +2 armor spikes. Any creature striking you with a natural weapon or grappling with you takes 1d6+2 points of piercing damage.

Using this ability is an immediate action taken after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome of the roll. After using this ability, you are staggered for 1 round.",

Non-mythic enemies within 30 feet are deafened and shaken for 1 round per mythic tier you possess (Will halves this duration; DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier).

			"Mythic spells draw upon the caster's mythic power to create more powerful magical effects - [mythic fireball](spell/fireball) sets affected creatures on fire, [mythic mage armor](spell/mage_armor) can negate critical hits, and so on. These spells aren't separate spells you gain as a spell known from your spellcasting class, but rather mythically charged versions of spells you already know.",
			"",
			"***Learning Mythic Spells:*** To learn a mythic spell, you must either select the mythic spellcasting [universal path abilities lists](rule/universal_path_abilities) or the {feat/Mythic Spell Lore} feat. In doing so, you unlock the secret of using your mythic power to amplify non-mythic spells you choose.",
			"",
			"***Casting Mythic Spells:*** If you know the mythic version of a spell, any time you cast the spell, you may expend one use of mythic power to convert the spell into its mythic version as you cast it. This doesn't change the level of the spell slot you use to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"If you're a caster who prepares spells (such as a cleric or wizard), you never have to prepare the mythic version of a spell - if you prepare the non-mythic version, you may cast it as the mythic version by expending one use of mythic power. Unless otherwise specified, casting the mythic version of a spell doesn't take any longer than casting the non-mythic version.",

For example, zombies created by both {spell/animate dead} and [mythic animate dead](spell/animate_dead) count toward the spell's HD limit of how many undead you can control at one time, and a chaotic creature is immune to [mythic chaos hammer](spell/chaos_hammer) in the same way it's immune to {spell/chaos hammer}.",

For example, the [mythic blasphemy](spell/blasphemy) spell has penalties for creatures that fail their saves; because the description doesn't indicate that these penalties replace those of non-mythic {spell/blasphemy}, the penalties are in addition to the non-mythic spell's effects.",

Some augmented effects require you to have a minimum tier in order to cast it as an augmented mythic spell. If so, the tier requirement for the augmented effects is listed in parentheses in the entry. For example, *Augmented (4th)* means you must have at least 4 mythic tiers to use this option. If you know a mythic spell, you automatically know how to cast the augmented version of that mythic spell upon reaching the required tier.",

The number of additional uses required for the augmented version is listed in the spell's augmented entry and includes the one use of mythic power necessary to cast the mythic version of the spell. When you cast a spell, you must decide whether you want to cast the non-mythic version, the mythic version, or the augmented mythic version, and expend the appropriate number of uses of mythic power. You can't cast the non-mythic version of the spell and later expend one use of mythic power to change it to the mythic version, nor can you cast the base mythic version of a spell and later in the duration expend the difference in mythic power to change it to the augmented version.",
			"",

Casting {spell/animate dead} works as normal and requires no uses of mythic power. Casting [mythic animate dead](spell/animate_dead) requires you to expend one use of mythic power when you cast your prepared animate dead. Casting the augmented version of [mythic animate dead](spell/animate_dead) requires you to expend two (not three) uses of mythic power when you cast your prepared animate dead spell.",

			"***Mythic Spells in Stat Blocks:*** In a creature stat block, a footnote will indicate that the creature knows the mythic version of the spell.",
			"",
			"***Potent:*** Any spell you cast as a mythic spell can also be cast in a potent form that is harder to resist. By expending one additional use of mythic power, you increase the spell's save DC by 2 and gain a +2 bonus on your caster level check to overcome spell resistance.",
			"",
			"***Resilient:*** Any spell you cast as a mythic spell can also be cast in a resilient form that is harder to dispel or counterspell. Expend one additional use of mythic power; any check attempted in order to dispel the spell then takes a -4 penalty, and the spell can't be countered unless the opposing caster also expends a use of mythic power to overcome your spell's resilience (in which case the normal rules for counterspelling apply).",
			"",
			"You may combine the potent and resilient forms of a spell; to do so, you must expend a total of two additional uses of mythic power. You can cast potent and resilient forms of augmented mythic spells in the same manner.",
			"",
			"***Tiers in Mythic Spell Descriptions:*** Unless otherwise stated, any reference to tier in a mythic spell description refers to the tier of the creature casting the spell. Whenever a mythic spell refers to half your tier, the minimum is 1 (meaning you still get a benefit at 1st tier)."

			"For a game to feel mythic, it must evoke wonder and awe in the GM and the players. It represents a power shrouded in mystery and beyond the reach of mortals. When characters encounter the mythic, they should feel as though they've just received a glimpse into an unseen world, promising so much more if they're bold enough to explore its wonders and face its dangers. A mythic atmosphere involves legends coming to life, and the characters will have a part to play in shaping these myths. If they succeed, they'll be the subject of tales and epic ballads for generations to come.",
			"",
			"Running a mythic game requires more than just allowing the players to have mythic power and face off against mythic foes. While that is certainly part of it, creating a mythic atmosphere is just as important. The world itself and the structure of the story need to change to make room for the mythic to exist alongside the normal. This change doesn't require you to reinvent the world, but mythic creatures and their environments should feel as if they are part of the world; they may be hidden, but they should still be tied to the mundane events and lands around them.",
			"",
			"Contrasting the mythic with the normal world is crucial to conveying an atmosphere of legend and mystery. The extraordinary only seems that way if it's in sharp contrast with the mundane. For example, a flying castle with a 1,000-foot-tall tower at its heart, drifting through the air on a thunderous storm cloud, is certainly a dramatic sight, but only when compared to the pastoral farmland and grime-covered town in its shadow. Picture the same floating castle in a world of towering volcanoes, and 500-foot-tall fortresses and the castle just becomes another extreme element in a world of extremes. If your game is set on Golarion (or some other established world), inserting contrasting mythic elements is easy, since the world already has a specific feel. Making your game mythic simply requires you to push beyond the boundaries of the setting, identifying hidden places where mythic elements have always dwelled, waiting to be discovered."

Ultimately, it's up to the GM to decide how much influence these rules have on the campaign and world as a whole. The following types of scale are provided to give GMs an easy guideline for incorporating mythic rules into their games.",
			"",
			"***Rare:*** At this scale, mythic creatures live only in remote parts of the world, content to be bygones of a lost age. People speak of them in stories, but none have actually encountered them. The PCs are not themselves mythic in this type of campaign, but throughout their travels, they may be up against a mythic creature at the conclusion of a noteworthy quest. Alternatively, a mythic creature might be forced into the world to terrorize the land, driving the PCs to find a way to deal with such a powerful threat.",
			"",
			"***Limited:*** At the limited scale, the PCs get a taste of mythic power through some extraordinary event, albeit only for a short time. For the duration of an adventure or short campaign arc, they can wield this power to further their goals. Unfortunately, it's fleeting, and they soon become normal once again, perhaps with a few remnants of power they might call on in a future time of need. Perhaps their power will return at a later date - possibly even regularly according to some mysterious cycle, allowing them to plan out when they take on more difficult challenges coinciding with their resurgence of power.",
			"",
			"***Uncommon:*** Mythic creatures and characters are uncommon in this scale of game, but not wholly resigned to the whispers of legend. The PCs also get mythic power, but their advancement in tier is slow. The GM can control this by limiting the number of trials that are presented. Likewise, mythic foes are still not pervasive, but are found with some regularity - leading secret cabals, harassing quiet villages on the edge of civilization, and dwelling in the dark places of the world.",
			"",
			"***Common:*** In the common scale, mythic characters and monsters are an everyday part of life. This doesn't mean that every town has a group of mythic heroes defending it, but that such characters are known to exist and their deeds are common knowledge. Nobles, priests, and other powerful people call upon the PCs for help against those dangerous monsters and villains others are powerless to fight. In this type of campaign, the PCs begin play with mythic power and see it grow as they gain levels, roughly at the rate of one mythic tier per two character levels."

This formula can work for a single session, where the PCs gain mythic power at the beginning and lose it by the end. Or you can apply it to an entire campaign, where the PCs gain mythic power early on and retire after of dozens of adventures.",

This structure is divided into five parts: the contact, the awakening, the journey, the return, and the life after. In the contact, the PCs encounter a threat too great for them to handle. In the awakening, they're granted mythic power to handle this threat. In the journey, the heroes quest to increase that power and gain what they need to vanquish that threat. In the return, they finally encounter the threats as equals (or near-equals) and have the opportunity to forever right the world. In the life after, the mythic heroes deal with the aftermath of their trials, and either become normal characters once again or hold onto their new power.",

Failure doesn't need to mean death, but instead that the PCs' efforts aren't enough to solve all problems before them. They might win the battle, but find that around them the town was destroyed, or someone close to them died during the conflict. This failure is a story opportunity - it can be used as motivation to continue on their journey, even against loss and extreme adversity. This also illustrates that the PCs' enemies have power similar to theirs, and that challenges ahead will test the heroes' limits and resolve.",
			"",
			"### Starting Off Mythic",
			"",
			"A key part of the mythic narrative is that the characters don't start out as mythic heroes. Even if they gain their powers during the opening scenes of their first adventure, each character has an ordinary life before their ascension. This helps to ground them in the world and gives them a framework by which they can understand the magnitude of this change within them. That's not to say the seed of mythic power couldn't have been a part of them since birth, but such latent power should be hidden from them until the appropriate time."

The PCs are forced to flee into a secluded valley near where the beast was slumbering, only to find that the valley contains an ancient seal recently broken. A guardian spirit explains to them that it has failed in its duty to keep the beast contained, and beseeches the PCs to intervene if they are brave enough.

The GM should also mark this point with some sort of loss or setback, to emphasize the gravity of the situation and the need for the PCs to undertake their quest. In the example above, the PCs might leave the valley only to find that their hometown is completely gone, devoured by the tarrasque. Before the PCs have a chance to mourn, they're beset by a group of cultists who helped to weaken the seal.

			"",
			"One type of test is that of the heart, compelling the PCs to struggle for something they care about other than themselves. These tests provide the PCs with a goal other than their own well-being and power. There should be something threatened if they fail, which serves to give the PCs resolve, a reason to carry on. As they visit a city in the path of the monster, the PCs might encounter people who remind them of home, or of friends lost. Or they could find a child in the clutches of a enemy, only to learn that he's the key to their diabolical plan, and the PCs must succeed if they're to save him in time. If the threat is powerful enough, the PCs may even come to learn that their own survival is secondary their quest's completion.",
			"",
			"Temptation is another type of test, one that has different twists. Some temptations are obvious, and you expect the heroes to refuse, such as discovering a bucolic valley where they could forgo their journey and retire in peace, or a dubious stranger offering them a shortcut through a cursed forest. Such temptations are important to a mythic tale because refusal defines the characters and shows us their limits. Then there are the subtle temptations, ones that heroes might actually consider - either because the price seems small (or even non-existent) compared to the gain or because the source seems trustworthy: taking food from an evil witch after starving for days, or choosing to give up a child they're protecting in exchange for an entire city's safety. Keep in mind that forces of good and evil are equally likely to test the heroes, to either reveal their mettle or lead them down the path of corruption. In any case, the PCs might be tempted a number of times along their journey and they must find the resolve to carry on and stay on the path.",
			"",
			"The PCs will eventually come to a point where they must confront the source of their own power, which provides another form of test. During their travels, they learn more and more about that source, ultimately revealing the truth about its nature. This might lead to a confrontation with the source of their power, after which the PCs feel they are equals to this source rather than its servants. For example, the PCs might learn their power comes from a divine source, and that deity is using them for its own ends. At great risk, they confront an aspect of the god to find answers. At the conclusion of the conflict, the PCs realize that while they're only a piece of the god's grand scheme, they're no mere pawns. Just as the god is using them to achieve her ends, they're using the god to achieve theirs.",
			"",
			"At the end of their journey, the PCs find their ultimate goal just within reach. Achieving this should be their most difficult test yet. Some foes are there to cull the unworthy, while others are agents of evil set to destroy the PCs. This last step in the journey should include a reward the likes of which the PCs have never seen, the culmination of their entire journey. With our earlier example, the PCs arrive at the resting place of the legendary sword capable of ending the tarrasque. Retrieving the sword from its ancient tomb is no easy task though, as the weapon is guarded by a host of mythic monsters and deadly traps. With the sword in hand, they must return to defeat the danger."

Cunning foes frequently escape a losing battle to regroup and prepare another attack. After the PCs' first encounter with a cunning enemy, their foe learns from that experience and uses new tricks and tactics to neutralize the PCs' strengths.

And there is always the classic story moment of presenting a hard choice, where no option is without cost. It's through suffering and reacting to such consequences that the true nature of these mythic heroes emerges.",
			"",
			"***Impressive Settings:*** The world of mythic adventures is enormous and dramatic. While a large keep is certainly impressive, one with a 200-foot-tall tower at its heart is more suitably awe-inspiring. This applies to natural environments as well, such as an entire forest with plants five times the normal size, waterfalls more than 100 feet high, or an immense volcano erupting at its heart. This might also take the form of a location with supernatural effects, such as a lake that is perfectly calm even when disturbed, or a swamp that is preternaturally dark. These places should appeal to all the senses, making them vibrant and memorable.",
			"",
			"***Legendary Creatures:*** Some creatures the PCs face should be legends in their own rights. While those that are drawn from ancient myth (such as the minotaur and the medusa), are likely candidates, any monster can fit into this category given the proper backstory. A random encounter with a dire wolf in the wilderness isn't especially legendary, but if the PCs visit the nearby town first and learn that there's a feral monster that's been feeding on townsfolk for a decade, and there are many local myths about the beast, that same encounter gains a legendary quality. Defeating such foes adds to the mythic characters' story, making these moments important to a mythic adventure.",
			"",
			"***Otherworldly Influence:*** Whether from artifacts, ancient magic, or the gods, mythic power is beyond that of the mortal realm. When the PCs gain such power, they attract the attention of mysterious forces that seek to control or otherwise influence them. This can take many forms, from a deity speaking to them through a cryptic seer, a strange sign from the stars, or gifts left in a tranquil glade to aid the heroes on their journey. Not all such influences will be beneficial - the PCs might be hammered by powerful storms, led astray by a constantly changing map, or attacked by agents of an evil power. The PCs should feel like their quest has caught the attention of powerful forces, even if they do not understand their sources or motives.",
			"",
			"***Powerful Enemies:*** Foes should have powers and abilities far beyond those the PCs normally expect to face. Through their mythic abilities, the PCs have the tools to defeat these challenges, but such foes are powerful and dangerous nonetheless - more than capable of bringing pain to the world if not defeated. Battles with powerful foes make it clear that the PCs truly need their mythic power to survive. Of course, not every fight should be against a powerful foe; lesser foes give the PCs a chance to show off their talents.",
			"",
			"***Supernatural Events:*** Strange and wonderful events surround mythic characters, events that twist and alter the world around them. Such events might be local (a perpetual blizzard in a small valley) or they might cover a vast area (a gloom that covers the sun). These supernatural events are in some way tied to the story of the characters. Perhaps the blizzard is the sign of a mystical frozen water elemental seer who is trying to get the heroes' attention. Or the gloom covering the sun is caused by a mythic demon seeking to bring ruin to the surface world."

			"Amazing powers and impressive foes are only part of a mythic story. The world's reaction to such heroes is also a significant part of making a campaign actually feel mythic. The NPCs encountered in a mythic game should have a sense - possibly vague, possibly unmistakable - that the PCs are marked with grandeur.",
			"",
			"When portraying the PCs' mythic origins and powers, the GM has a few options. The mythic nature could be apparent to everyone in some visible way, like a glowing brand or faint aura. This could be always visible, or manifest only as a character uses mythic power. Alternatively its nature could be subtle and felt rather than seen. Of course, it could start as something subtle at lower tiers, and become more pronounced as a mythic character progresses. Regardless of what direction you take, the people in the world should not mistake mythic characters for normal people.",
			"",
			"The way that common people talk to these heroes needs to be different from the way they would talk to other characters. Mythic PCs should never be \"tasked\" or \"ordered\" to do anything (except perhaps by a demanding foe in a momentary position of power). Beings, even rulers or powerful planar allies, should address the mythic characters as peers or possibly entreat them as supplicants.",
			"",
			"Likewise, when NPCs are in the presence of such greatness, they should not waste time asking for trivial favors. That's what normal low-level adventurers are for. Even a 1st-level/1st-tier character is worthy of respect. That doesn't mean you have to throw away the quests you've planned, but you should present them to the PCs (and players) as something worth a mythic character's time and energy.",
			"",
			"The true powers in the world, whether the raw power of angels and demons or the political power of kingdoms and churches, recognize the potential in the mythic heroes. Wise ones know to be polite to low-tier heroes today, because in the future they will be formidable allies or devastating foes.",
			"",
			"On the flip side, mythic power is an alienating force. Very few people have it, and many of those who do are threats, not friends. So the people the heroes encounter will look at them with reverence, fear, or even resentment, but never with familiarity and ease. In some ways, mythic characters are the ultimate outsiders, saving a world that they don't quite fit in anymore."

Some campaigns will focus on one theme to tell a mythic story, and others will include multiple themes - although the GM should be careful when using more than one theme, as this might muddle the story behind such power. In some cases, merging various themes will make more dramatic sense than using one theme alone.",

This pattern is found throughout countless modern and ancient mythological tales, from the Bible to The Lord of the Rings. You won't have to search hard to find examples in books and films. Game Masters are encouraged to read up on the monomyth in more detail, as well as examine other stories and media that use this pervasive narrative structure."

While the heroes are stunned, a creature bashes through the doors with such force that it breaks the hinges and escapes. When the PCs come to, a guardian spirit waits over them, imploring them to recapture the monstrosity they unleashed.",
			"",
			"The PCs realize that each of them inherited a curved piece of metal inscribed with symbols in an archaic script. By placing the pieces together, they form a circle. When the circle is complete, the PCs each feel energy pulse through them that causes them to ascend.",

The PCs are drawn into this struggle and must prevent such power from falling into the wrong hands - possibly even realizing that those hands are their own.",
			"",
			"Ancient artifacts and items from distant planes carry secrets and abilities rarely accessible to those living today.

These items find their ways into the collections of great and long-living creatures, such as dragons and liches, or are buried in the most remote areas beyond the known world.

From this lofty perch, they must defend themselves from all mythic threats seeking to steal what they have earned. Alternatively, those who reach that height of power might find there is only one more step to take - stealing more power from a deity or other source of immense power. Or there may be a grand reward awaiting those who capture all the mythic power in the world."

			"Designing a mythic encounter is a lot like designing an encounter in any other adventure. During play, the PCs will face a variety of challenges: monsters, NPCs, traps, and more. The difference is that during a mythic adventure, the challenges are far deadlier. It's important to stress to the players, through the encounters that they face, that these are dangers beyond what they might normally expect in the game. Much of this comes through the design of the encounters, which can vary greatly depending on the PCs and how you want to challenge them. In the most basic terms, the mythic rules can be used in one of two ways: to challenge normal PCs and to challenge mythic PCs.",
			"",
			"***Encounters for Normal PCs:*** If the PCs aren't mythic, then these rules can be used to present challenges of an unexpected nature. Mythic creatures and villains are more powerful than their normal counterparts, making encounters significantly more dangerous. See Adjusting CR and Level below.",
			"",
			"Normal PCs should be rewarded with experience points and treasure based on this adjusted CR. This means the PCs will face creatures that would normally be below them in terms of their original CRs, but whose strange abilities make them true threats. Such encounters should generally be at least challenging in relation to the PCs' Average Party Level (APL; see [Table 12-1](rule/designing_encounters)).",
			"",
			"For example, a group of four 6th-level PCs is exploring an ancient crypt filled with undead. As they face a variety of normal undead foes, they also begin to discover a far greater evil dwelling within, sealed away centuries ago by a holy brotherhood. Upon breaching the final chamber, they face a pair of mythic mummies crackling with dark magic. The pair of mythic mummies has an adjusted CR of 8, making it a deadly threat to the 6th-level PCs.",
			"",
			"***Encounters for Mythic PCs:*** Mythic adventurers are ready for challenges beyond those normally expected for characters of their level. (See Adjusting CR and Level below.) When designing encounters to challenge these characters, roughly one-third of the encounters should use their adjusted APL, one-third should use the characters' original APL, and the remaining should fall somewhere between those two values.",
			"",
			"Of course, individual encounters can vary from these numbers as normal (such as a challenging encounter versus an easy encounter, as noted on [Table 12-1](rule/designing_encounters)). When facing a mythic foe, add half its mythic rank to its original CR to determine the foe's adjusted CR (as above).",
			"",
			"For example, when designing challenges for a group of four 12th-level, 6th-tier mythic PCs, approximately one-third of the encounters they face should be CR 12, one-third should be CR 15, and the remaining encounters should be CR 13 or 14. That means some of their encounters are rather easy (allowing them to dominate foes using their mythic power), some are of average difficulty, and some truly push them to their limits. The challenging encounters should be against other mythic foes, forcing the PCs to confront enemies with similar power.",
			"",
			"### Adjusting CR and Level",
			"",
			"Having mythic tiers changes the effective level of the character for the purposes of determining what threats they can face and what treasures they should earn. Likewise, having mythic tiers or ranks changes the effective CR of the foes heroes must contend with.",
			"",
			"To adjust a character's level, add half his tier (minimum 1) to his total character level. So a 10th-level/5th-tier character is effectively a 12th-level character for challenge and reward purposes, and a 20th-level/10th-tier character is effectively a 25th-level character for those purposes.",
			"",
			"To adjust a foe's CR, add half its tier or rank (minimum 1) to its CR. So a 2nd-rank minotaur is effectively a CR 6 monster, while a 6th-tier champion pit fiend would be CR 23. For the monsters presented [here](rule/mythic_monsters), this calculation has already been made."

These trials are the peaks of the story, turning points at which one wrong move or costly mistake might cause the entire quest to fail. In the game, these events denote the stages of the mythic character's journey. Think of trials as an important plot point, one that is intrinsically tied to the legend of the characters.",
			"",
			"Mythic characters advance in two ways: they gain character levels by accumulating experience points, and they gain tiers by accomplishing a number of trials (see [Table 1-2: Mythic Trials per Tier](rule/gaining_tiers)). These trials are the true tales of mythic heroism, representing the culmination of an entire adventure or campaign arc in which the PCs overcome a terrifying challenge or achieve some fantastic victory. The trial can be anything the GM imagines, but it's not accomplished until some major goal is completed - be it to defeat a monster, save a town, or recover an artifact. So while an entire adventure might be a trial, it does not count toward advancement until the heroes complete it.",
			"",
			"The rate at which these trials are accomplished determines how quickly the PCs gain mythic tiers. As a guideline, the PCs should face a number of trials equal to the amount needed to gain a tier in the time it takes for them to gain two character levels. This should keep the character's mythic tier roughly equal to 1/2 the character's overall level. (Of course, the GM can alter this rate to suit the campaign.) That means if the PCs attain their first mythic tier at 1st level, they should probably face only a single greater trial by the time they reach 4th level, so that they reach 2nd tier at that time. Conversely, higher-level characters that gain mythic power later in their careers might face a number of trials in quick succession to gain tiers quickly, or they might even start with multiple tiers right away to get them closer to the average. [Table 1-2](rule/gaining_tiers) lists the number of trials a character must overcome to gain a new tier, but this number is subject to GM discretion and the needs of the story.",
			"",
			"A GM might instead decide that every time the PCs complete a trial, they gain a tier. In this case, such trials are far less common. Alternatively, a GM might double the number of trials needed, and in turn make them more common. Either way, the rate of tier progression shouldn't feel much different from what would normally happen.",
			"",
			"When designing a trial, GMs should keep the following points in mind. Trials represent important stories in the legend of mythic characters. Unlike an anecdote about particularly nasty fight or dangerous trap, trials are lengthy tales of multiple dangerous encounters, against mythic foes and unimaginable adversity. A trial should be the culmination of an entire adventure or a short series of adventures.",
			"",

Not wanting to provoke outright war between the crown and the faiths, the mythic characters are charged by their patron to discover the cure for their monarch's besieged mind.",
			"",
			"***Abyssal Parasite:*** A powerful interaction of multiple mythic spells destroyed the body of a powerful demon, but in its place created a vengeful spirit neither dead nor alive. The spirit is capable of possessing others and infusing its host with demonic powers, using this as an opportunity to gather evil allies and gain strength. A celestial being that opposes demonkind calls the upon PCs to stop the vile being. They must then track the demon spirit as it moves from victim to victim, until the heroes can eradicate the demonic shade.",

Unfortunately, by the time the PCs fend off the attackers, the gravely wounded creature is drawing its last breaths. Just before dying, it bestows mythic power upon the heroes and entrusts them with a quest that it was not able to complete. With their new abilities, the PCs can finish the mission, avenge their fallen benefactor, and take their first steps into a larger world of challenges and foes greater than they ever knew existed.",
			"",
			"***For Those Who Must Follow:*** The PCs are heroes in the days before a coming apocalypse at the hands of a dark divine or even extraterrestrial power. Unlike a campaign where the PCs must stop a cataclysm, in this trial they have no hope of averting the impending disaster. Instead, they must draw on mythic power to lay a foundation for future heroes to save the world. Their adventures will lead them to create secret repositories containing knowledge and small slivers of their own mythic power. While doing this they also attempt to form deep alliances with disparate groups the world over, laying the groundwork for the heroes that will one day rise and change the fate of a world that they themselves had not time enough to save.",
			"",
			"***Into the Abyss:*** The PCs go on a quest to the Abyss, and must endure a harrowing expedition through the infinite layers of that chaotic evil realm. They're tasked to rescue an important mortal sold into demonic slavery, retrieve a soul that was condemned to the Abyss by mistake, or topple a particularly destructive demon lord. Whatever the reason, the adventurers face challenges that push their new abilities to the limit.",
			"",
			"***Lost Souls:*** The souls of the dead are not reaching their final destinations, but are instead trapped in a state of waiting. The PCs must discover what is powerful enough to interfere with this cosmic process - and for what dark purpose. Worse, the denied souls are being twisted into monstrous forms, causing pockets of corruption and instability, and presenting other threats to the world. The PCs struggle to unravel the mystery and defeat the furtive villain behind it all.",

The divine powers of each realm perceive the others as threats and seek to do away with the rival \"mockeries\" of their own world through their ascended champions. The PCs are selected on behalf of their world's pantheon of gods while searching out their opponents, some of whom might be eerily similar to them. GMs can offer players the choice of vanquishing their opponents or of allying with them in a joint effort to stop this cosmic bout.",

Each round of the competition proves more deadly than the last, as it becomes clear that only one team will survive this tournament. If the PCs are victorious, a great boon might be bestowed upon them, so when the chance to escape presents itself, they must decide whether or not to continue.",
			"",
			"***Redemption:*** Pursuing a once-strong champion of goodness like a fallen angel or an antipaladin, the PCs use mythic power not to oppose their enemy but to discover the source of his defection in the hopes of turning him back to the light. Or they must cleanse a relic that's been polluted by some festering malignancy. The corruption is so deep-seated that the PCs must journey to a distant place of renown that can be reached only by heroes wielding the strongest of mythic powers.",
			"",
			"***Revenge Unyielding:*** Some legendary warrior or powerful monster returns, like a dragon or giant once imprisoned in stasis, petrified, or under an enchanted sleep. Finding its world gone and all of its family and kin perished at the hands of heroes long since past, its mind collapses into madness. The creature vows revenge on all its foes' descendants, or perhaps even the entire world, and slaughters in blind rage. The heroes must find a way to stay the avenger's madness or put the tormented soul to rest.",
			"",
			"***The Culling Plague:*** A rare disease has stricken one of the great races of the world. Giants, dragons, even outsiders might be victim to this debilitating plague. The oldest members of the afflicted species beseech the adventurers to stem this horrible contagion. Such a quest could take the PCs to far-flung parts of the world (and perhaps even beyond) searching for rare ingredients to concoct a cure. Alternatively, a sickness that strikes a species spread across the spectrum of good and evil, like outsiders or dragons, might make the PCs unlikely peace brokers between angels and devils or chromatic and metallic dragonkind while trying to find the cure.",
			"",
			"***The Giving Rain:*** The flensed flesh of a deity executed for unknowable crimes falls in a gory rain across the land. The areas with the highest concentration exhibit bizarre, troubling effects. The PCs, being close to one such place, gain mythic powers. Drawn to other epicenters as if pulled by the godflesh, the heroes must deal with the changes wrought by the storm. This includes putting down monsters that have likewise gained strange new abilities, hunting down masses of godflesh that are hidden deep underground or atop the highest peaks, and restoring peace to kingdoms that have gone to war over possession of these divine blessings.",
			"",
			"***The Old Guard:*** The PCs inherit a grand duty from a group of aging heroes with a sacred and momentous charge. This might be guarding a rift in the multiverse, manning the prison of a dreaded lich or even an elder god, or preserving the first teachings of arcane magic or a hallowed fighting style. The aging guardians deputize the PCs and charge them with a sacred quest to find others able to wield mythic power and take over for the august veterans when their time has come, or grant the PCs a chance to become the new guardians themselves. In the latter case, the older heroes direct the PCs toward quests and accomplishments that will increase their mythic power to the levels needed to replace the retiring guardians. Perhaps the PCs don't even realize they're being vetted for this crucial role as they undergo their adventures.",
			"",
			"***To Challenge a God:*** An evil deity and its minions are making a play for ultimate power in the mortal realms. Other gods, prevented from interfering in the matter by a divine compact, task the characters to oppose the usurper. The PCs must disrupt the schemes of the deity's minions and work their way up through the ranks, breaking the chain one link at a time, until they finally confront the ambitious god.",
			"",
			"***Uniting the Armies:*** War rages across the land. Disparate humanoid and monstrous races fight with one another, oblivious to a rising threat that will soon endanger them all - and that might have orchestrated their conflicts in the first place to keep their armies occupied. The heroes alone learn the truth and must use their mythic powers to unite the warring groups - but doing so means facing a series of challenges of diplomacy, intrigue, and brute force. Only by banding together will the land be able to fight off their immense foe in the ultimate battle."

Such a villain builds tension - for even as the PCs foil her plans, they're kept frustrated by failing to permanently stop this fiend. Creating such nasty villains is challenging as heroes grow stronger and get better at killing off persistent foes. To ensure the mythic villain survives, make use of noncombat encounters, ensure your villain always has an escape plan, and don't be afraid to reintroduce her after the players think she's had been finished off.",
			"",
			"Noncombat encounters help players develop a connection between their PCs and the villain in a way that doesn't risk the villain's life (or the PCs'). Early on, she can appear as a harmless or even helpful NPC. Or, if the PCs have already fought the villain, she can leave notes or use magic to taunt them. Various mythic powers, the Disguise skill, or even simple magic like {spell/disguise self}, {spell/glibness}, or {spell/nondetection} can be used to help a villain blend in and rub elbows with the heroes all while seeming innocuous. Later, once the villain is revealed, she can work behind the scenes, using minions and other allies to accomplish her ends, all the while making it plain to the PCs that she's continuing to thwart them.",
			"",
			"In a world where powerful creatures are hunting you, paranoia and the willingness to abandon plans and allies are key to survival. If you want your villain to fight the players, plan an early exit. It's okay for a villain to flee even if she might win a confrontation, as her plans are a long game and require that she survive to see them through. There are many spells, mythic powers, and class abilities that give the villain the ability to get away in a hurry. She should use more mundane escape methods when possible, concealing her iconic escapes as much as possible so they're more difficult for the PCs to counter.",
			"",
			"Should the villain be killed, don't be afraid to have her revisit your campaign for a little posthumous mockery and mayhem. There are many ways to reintroduce a dead villain - sometimes it's as simple as having a minion cast {spell/raise dead} or {spell/resurrection}, but there are other, more sophisticated options. You can introduce a new recurring villain who tracks down one of the PCs' dead foes and brings him to some semblance of life in the form of an undead minion or possessed item, or who uses speak with dead to learn the deceased foe's secrets."

			"Mythic heroes, for all their might, are still people with troubles and flaws. Many such legendary beings have equally legendary flaws that are ultimately their undoing. Because of the heroes' great power, these failings and weaknesses are also often dramatic, and if their enemies learn of these flaws, they will seek to exploit them.",
			"",
			"The following mythic flaws are optional rules the GM may want to include in a mythic campaign in order to reflect heroes of old. They force characters to suffer a particular ailment in certain situations, one that they can't mitigate or work off over time - a flaw truly a part of their mythic nature.",
			"",
			"Flaws don't provide great benefits to the characters - including them is purely for dramatic purposes, not to create an optimal character. The GM should carefully weigh whether or not to include them in the game, and decide if their addition is a benefit to the story as a whole and (more importantly) something the players will enjoy playing.",
			"",
			"If you decide to include mythic flaws in the game, they are gained at the same time the character gains mythic power, during the moment of ascension. You can select these flaws yourself, making them an aspect of the theme used to grant the PCs mythic power, or you can allow the PCs to select them, integrating the flaws into their backstories. The following mythic flaws are examples of the types of flaws you could include in your game.",
			"",
			"***Dependency:*** There is only one food or drink that can nourish your hero, and without it your powers fade. Select one specific type of food or drink (other than water). If you don't ingest that food or drink at least once per day, you begin to lose your mythic powers. After the first day of absence, you can no longer regain uses of mythic power. After the second day, you lose all the powers and abilities granted by your mythic path. After the third day, you lose all of your mythic abilities, with the exception of ability score increases, bonus hit points, and bonus mythic feats. These powers and abilities are immediately restored as soon as you consume that food or drink.",
			"",
			"***Elemental Vulnerability:*** One element above all others has an adverse effect on your power and is capable of harming you like no other. Select either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You take double the amount of damage whenever that damage is of the selected type. You never benefit from resistance or immunity to that element. When an effect of that type is used against you, it is always treated as though it's from a mythic source.",
			"",
			"***Furious Rage:*** Your rage is a beast, one that you can barely control. Whenever you are hit by a critical hit or demoralized by the Intimidate skill, you go into an uncontrollable rage. This functions like the [barbarian's rage class feature](class/barbarian), but you don't gain a bonus to your Strength or Constitution score (even if you have the rage class feature). This limits the actions you can perform and gives you a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus your mythic tier, but you aren't fatigued after this duration expires. If you have the rage class feature, this does not count toward your uses of that feature. If you are raging when this flaw is triggered, that rage immediately ends and this effect begins.",
			"",
			"***Hubris:*** You are first, best, and above all others. Your power is unrivaled and you know it. You receive a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against an effect that would have caused you to gain the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you instead gain the staggered condition for a duration equal to the duration of the effect that you saved against, as you spend part of each round boasting about your prowess. If you instead fail a saving throw against such an effect, that effect's duration is doubled as you're also confronted with doubt or shame.",
			"",
			"***Material Weakness:*** There is one material that can penetrate even your toughest defenses. Select cold iron, silver, or wood. Weapons made primarily from that material automatically confirm all critical hits against you and the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons made primarily of that type always bypass that reduction.",
			"",
			"***Mercurial Mind:*** The power that you wield speaks to you, and it befuddles your mind at critical moments. Whenever you're hit by a critical hit or fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or special ability, you also gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"***School Aversion:*** Despite your power, there is one type of magic that is foretold to be your undoing. Those that wield it are of great danger to you. Select one school of magic (except divination). Whenever you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect of that school, you take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The effects of such spells (if harmful) last twice as long if you fail the saving throw. In addition, all spells and effects of that school used against you are always treated as though they're from a mythic source. You also may not benefit from spells and effects from the selected school, subject to GM discretion.",
			"",
			"***Weapon Weakness:*** The prophecies say that one weapon will be your doom. Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapons. Weapons from the selected group gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you. If a weapon from the selected group scores a critical hit against you, the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons from that group always bypass that reduction."

Each idea includes a basic synopsis of the plot, a list of some of the challenges the heroes could face, a look at the primary adversary, and ideas for further adventures. Some of these ideas imply the heroes' mythic origin, but they can easily be tailored for PCs who have already gone on other mythic adventures.",

			"### Moments of Powerlessness",
			"",
			"Many stories in novels, comic books, television shows, and movies involve powerful characters losing their abilities for a short time. It's tempting for many GMs to make that a part of a mythic campaign. While you can certainly use such a plot device in your game, the loss of power must be handled carefully to avoid turning an otherwise fun string of adventures into something no one wants to play anymore. Here are a few tips to make this idea work in a fun way.",
			"",
			"To start with, this is only a good option when the characters are in the middle tiers (between 4th and 7th tier). If the heroes are of a lower tier, they haven't used their mythic power enough to make the powerlessness storyline interesting. If they're of a higher tier, the gulf between their mythic story and the story being told now is so great that it may break the flow of the story.",
			"",
			"Powerlessness arcs should last no more than a couple sessions, lest the temporary loss of power start to seem like a permanent disability.",
			"",
			"Causes of the PCs' powerlessness need to be explainable- and either the characters know about it beforehand or someone informs them of the cause after they've lost their powers. It could be an event that comes to pass, like a lunar eclipse or a great volcano's eruption disrupting the flow of power in the world. Or a foe might enact a ritual to nullify the heroes' power. The PCs might even be responsible for their own loss of power, especially if the divine being who granted the powers doesn't approve of their recent activities.",
			"",
			"Solutions to the PCs' plight should make sense from a story perspective. Events pass, reinstating the PCs' mythic power (in which case, the PCs need merely to wait, and possibly fight to survive until then). The foe's rituals are undone by the temporarily normal PCs. Or penance can be granted as the PCs show that they're still worthy.",
			"",
			"Drama happens between the cause and solution: foes that should have been easy before become challenges again, and those the heroes have angered can now retaliate, whether they are monstrous foes or slighted townsfolk. The rewards acquired during this time should reflect the difficulty of the challenges the PCs face."

			"***Adversary:*** For the PCs to rescue the wise woman, they must defeat the queen (who could be based on a type of mythic giant). For her part, she does not necessarily want the PCs dead right away, but instead wants to learn more about their world so that she can expand her domain.",
			"",
			"***Further Adventures:*** Other creatures might seek out the heroes' home world now that they know it exists. If the PCs don't kill the queen in her world, she may seek revenge in theirs. The PCs might learn that the queen sent the artifacts to other worlds and that she has many other captives who need the PCs' help. Perhaps the mythic power even remains when the PCs return home, only to discover their returning has awakened long-dormant mythic power across their world, unleashing many perils."
