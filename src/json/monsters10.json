			"**Change Shape (Su)** A faceless hulk can assume the form of a Large humanoid at will but requires 10 uninterrupted minutes to alter its body. Performing this transformation is somewhat painful, but the faceless hulk can maintain its new shape indefinitely once it has achieved that form. It can change back to its true form as a swift action, and it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for 1 round after it does so. A faceless hulk retains its own innate abilities when it assumes its new form and does not gain any of the abilities of the creature it mimics. A faceless hulk gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks when using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Expansion (Su)** In its natural form, a faceless hulk can expand rapidly as a full-round action. It grows one size category larger, pushing back any creature or object in its new space. The faceless hulk can choose which direction (or directions) it expands from its original space, and it can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver check against any creatures in these squares of sizes Large or smaller. The faceless hulk uses its increased size (usually Huge) to determine its Combat Maneuver Bonus for these checks. At the end of its turn, it immediately returns to its original size, though it can choose which squares it occupies when it does so. This ability does not change the faceless hulk's weight.",
			"",
			"**Faceless (Su)** In its natural form, a faceless hulk has no discernible facial features. It gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist attacks or effects that target the senses. This includes gaze attacks, odor-based attacks, sonic attacks, and similar attacks. This bonus does not apply to illusions.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ugoroths are monstrous, sadistic beings created by aboleths in their long war against the surface world. Alongside their smaller cousins, the faceless stalkers, they work to destabilize surface-dwelling civilizations from within. During the war, the destruction of the aboleth city Voshgurvaghol left them leaderless and without direction. Though they have long forgotten the beings that created them, faceless hulks continue their original mission, driven only by a hatred for humanity that was molded into their very bodies. Some believe that ugoroths still serve their veiled masters, even without their own knowledge.",
			"",
			"Faceless hulks range in height from 10 to 14 feet and weigh anywhere from 1,200 to 1,700 pounds.",
			"",
			"Ugoroths have flexible, boneless bodies that resist various forms of attack. While they prefer to forgo armor whenever possible, they typically use whatever weapons and equipment are most common among the race they are disguised as. Though they lack many of the special abilities that make each giant race unique, they have managed to adapt facsimiles of several, enough to pass the scrutiny of all but the most discerning of observers. Some older ugoroths acquire magical items and artifacts to bolster themselves with abilities they would normally lack.",
			"",
			"They cannot digest solid food even when they assume the forms of creatures with mouths. Instead, they subsist on liquids, especially blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues, which they use to penetrate and lap blood from smaller humanoids.",
			"",
			"Historians are unsure whether aboleths created the first faceless hulks as part of a larger plot to infiltrate the land-dwelling peoples of Golarion or whether the enlarged faceless stalkers simply evolved from their Medium-sized kin over time. Some scholars of ancient Azlant believe faceless hulks were crafted intentionally to infiltrate the cyclopes the Azlanti enslaved (and the cyclopes of the long-extinct kingdom of Ghol-Gan). Others defend the theory of independent evolution, citing the existence of even larger, older ugoroths (ugoloroths, which are described below) as proof that the faceless hulks of today are simply the descendants of an exceptionally large strain of faceless stalkers. Despite their disagreements, sages recognize that faceless hulks and faceless stalkers now form two distinct species.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Faceless hulks were originally created to sow discord and animosity between giants and other surfacedwelling races, to further weaken both during the war with the aboleths. Toward that end, ugoroths disguised themselves among the various giant races to attack and spread mayhem in humanoid society. A lone faceless hulk may take the form of a fire or frost giant before attacking a humanoid settlement. Others infiltrate giant tribes and raiding parties, living among them for months or years and manipulating them into causing great violence whenever possible. Greater faceless hulks, which prefer to take the shapes of cloud or storm giants, spend decades in disguise, sparking conflicts that can span generations.",
			"",
			"Unlike typical giants, faceless hulks leave very few casualties in the wake of their attacks. Instead, they favor mass destruction, taking special care to level centers of commerce and locations of political import. These attacks also give them the opportunity to take prisoners they may later feed on in private. Faceless hulks have been known to work together with faceless stalkers to great success. Their smaller kin ensure that humanoid settlements are unprepared for giant attacks, and they later whip the survivors into a frenzy, driving them to retaliate against the giants. By working together this way, the two races can transform minor conflicts into explosive wars.",
			"",
			"Some ugoroths believe they are the divine creations of the god Ghlaunder, who reigns over parasites and stagnation, while others cleave to the atheistic nature of their true creators, the aboleths. A few have taken to worshiping chaotic evil giant deities. Strangely, many faceless hulks consider themselves kin to evil giants, favoring them over their own kind. In some rare cases, they willingly choose to spend their entire lives among giants, pretending to be hermits or wandering sages. This is a particularly dangerous lifestyle for an ugoroth-after generations of slavery, many giants are naturally distrustful of those they don't know. If they discover an ugoroth hiding among them, giants hunt it down without mercy.",
			"",
			"### Greater Faceless Hulks",
			"",
			"Known as ugoloroths among their own kind, the largest and most ancient faceless hulks serve as spies and infiltrators within the societies of the largest races of giantkind, including cloud giants, storm giants, and taiga giants. An ugoloroth is a faceless hulk with the advanced and giant creature simple templates. It gains Combat Reflexes and Greater Bull Rush as bonus feats. It casts spell-like abilities as a 12th-level caster, and gains levitate and undetectable alignment as at-will spell-like abilities. When using its change shape ability, an ugoloroth can take the shape of any Huge humanoid. More so than their ugoroth kin, ugoloroths often take levels in classes such as barbarian, fighter, ranger, sorcerer, and witch to more easily pass as members of various giant races."

			"Ugothols (as faceless stalkers call themselves) are one of the many tools created and then discarded by the aboleths in their long war against the surface dwellers. Scorned by their former masters when the scheme for which they were designed unraveled, the faceless stalkers fled into swamps, marshes, or any other dark, wet places they could find-the closest they could come to the aquatic cities they once considered home.",
			"",
			"Originally designed to serve as spies that could walk uncontested among the air-breathing races, faceless stalkers adopt new forms by reshaping their skin and contorting their rubbery bodies. This painful process takes approximately 10 uninterrupted minutes-an ugothol typically seeks a private place to do it, avoiding even others of its own kind. The sensation of returning to its true form is quite exhilarating and results in a momentary burst of euphoria.",
			"",
			"Faceless stalkers cannot digest solid food even when in the form of a creature with a mouth. Instead, they subsist on liquids, including blood. In their natural forms, they have three hollow tongues which they use to penetrate and lap blood from their victims. Since they have no particular skill at grappling foes, most ugothols wait until a victim is helpless or asleep before attempting to drink its blood-although the best is when a victim is helpless but conscious during the process, so that the faceless stalker can \"play with its food\" by having grisly and cruel conversations with it."

			"**Blind (Ex)** A faceless whale sees and senses exclusively through its blindsight ability, which is based on sound and movement-beyond 150 feet, the whale is considered blind. A deafened faceless whale is effectively blinded as well. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks.",
			"",
			"**Resonant Song (Su)** As a standard action, a faceless whale can focus a 60-foot ray of sonic energy on a single target that deals 8d6 points of damage. This ray deals normal damage to objects, but is still subject to hardness. Alternatively, a faceless whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60- foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Any submerged creature holding its breath must succeed at a second Fortitude saving throw at the same DC or it has its breath knocked out of it and instantly begins drowning.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Called \"ansiktsloshvals\" in Aklo, and sometimes called \"Darklands whales,\" faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubberlined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly.",
			"",
			"It is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song.",
			"",
			"An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large.",
			"",
			"Faceless whales resemble the toothed whales common to the Arcadian Ocean in body structure, possessing a tapered mouth lined with stubby, conical teeth and a streamlined body. Lacking eyes, faceless whales depend totally upon their keen blindsight to navigate, seek prey, and avoid the predations of the Sightless Sea's most horrific inhabitants. Faceless whales prefer to hunt near the bottom of the Sightless Sea, where crushing pressures and freezing temperatures nurture large, sluggish organisms with few places to hide, and where the whales find safety from other menacing predators. Because of the unusual and outright alien composition of the creatures found within the lowest depths, faceless whales developed indiscriminate appetites. A hungry faceless whale consumes virtually any living thing it can gulp into its jaws, including the plentiful aquatic aberrations. Faceless whales can remain submerged for hours at a time, diving to depths of over 7,000 feet. Faceless whales that survive to adulthood in the harsh conditions of Orv live 80 years or longer.",
			"",
			"As predators that spend the majority of their lives in the deepest waters, Darklands whales are rarely spotted. Those who sail upon the dark currents of the Sightless Sea and Lake Nirthran see these beasts only when the whales surface to breathe. When surfacing, a faceless whale breathes for minutes at a time, exhaling and inhaling massive volumes of air in great misty spouts.",
			"",
			"When a faceless whale finds prey it can easily outswim, it plunges downward with its mouth agape, snapping up the morsel before it can react. When pursuing larger or faster prey, the faceless whale becomes a persistence hunter, hounding its quarry at a deceptively leisurely pace. After what often proves to be days of dogged pursuit, the whale's prey becomes too exhausted to swim further. Before the quarry can marshal the last of its strength to defend itself, the faceless whale renders it helpless with a resonant song. When the faceless whale is not in combat, it uses this sonic attack to break through rock and gain access to new hunting grounds within Orv and beyond.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Faceless whales typically hunt and swim alone, except when prey is abundant. When hunting is favorable, faceless whales organize into pods led by the oldest (and typically largest) female. Pods are short lived, often forming only a handful of times within a faceless whale's lifetime. As such, males compete fiercely for breeding rights during these gatherings. Pods last only as long as prey sustains them. Once food becomes scarce, the pod disperses into the Sightless Sea, and individual whales brave the chill waters alone in search of richer hunting grounds.",
			"",
			"Mated pairs of faceless whales remain together only long enough to raise their first calf. This period of nurturing typically lasts no longer than 5 years-just enough time for the parents to teach a calf basic hunting strategies and witness its first unassisted kill. Afterward, the parents part ways, leaving the calf to mature to adulthood or perish in the uncertain depths of the abyss.",
			"",
			"A faceless whale spends the majority of its life in isolation, plumbing the depths of the Sightless Sea in search of prey, the occasional mate, and hunting grounds rich enough to support a temporary pod. When it makes such a discovery, a faceless whale circles the boundary of the new territory, calling out to its fellows with a groaning, dirge-like song that carries for leagues. Whalers who ply their trade upon the Sightless Sea listen for this dirge with fanatical obsession. Faceless whales provide numerous alchemical ingredients, and their bones and teeth make excellent weapons and armor. An adult faceless whale possesses enough of both to make a crew of whalers rich, provided they have the courage and skill to slay the creature.",
			"",
			"Though faceless whales prefer larger meals, they eagerly prey upon humanoids when other food is scarce. A sailor fallen overboard makes an easy snack for an adult or a full meal for a juvenile. Conventional wisdom claims that faceless whales consider seagoing vessels indigestible, but serpentfolk hiss tales of faceless whales of exceptional cunning that capsize or fracture ships and feast upon the drowning crews, plucking them from among the flotsam.",
			"",
			"On rare occasion, a faceless whale finds its way into the oceans of Golarion. Some believe the creatures possess an instinctive knowledge of hidden waterways linking the Sightless Sea to the world above (perhaps all that remains of the migratory instincts that once drove their cetacean ancestors). Those few faceless whales that venture beyond the Darklands typically do so only briefly, breaching the surface on moonless nights just long enough to take in a breath of air free from the fetid staleness of Orv.",
			"",
			"Many sages postulate that the Sightless Sea is bottomless, its deepest trenches connecting to planes of primordial darkness where the pressure is capable of crushing living beings into stone. It is possible that the Sightless Sea is just one of many faceless whale hunting grounds. If this is the case, there is no telling what a faceless whale might bring up from the ebon depths."

Constantly gnashing or chomping in the air, it delivers grievous wounds to those who don't flee this terrible creature.",

Though it isn't a very large creature, its fearsome composition and the aura of fear it exudes give it a presence that makes it seem much greater than its actual size."

Agile, alert, and clever, these handsome beasts find few traps or enclosures they can't escape-and few gardens or larders they can't enter. To aristocratic hunters, they represent the ultimate quarry to track, leaving no footprints, running confusing trails, and easily vanishing from sight, but to the common people of western Taldor, fading foxes have become a surprisingly common and persistent pests they have neither the ability nor the permission to trap."

			"- Tornado Force: The winds themselves gust at nearly 300 miles per hour, affecting all creatures in the area of effect as if they were caught in tornado-force winds.

If a creature dies from the effects of this curse, its body explodes in a 60-foot burst of burning wind, with effects identical to Fafnheir's breath weapon. This effect occurs if the cursed victim dies from any effect, not just from the curse. One round later, Fafnheir gains the effect of a true resurrection spell, appearing at the same spot where the cursed victim died (or the closest area large enough to contain the Colossal creature), with full memories of the cursed victim's doings and accomplishments while cursed. The only way to permanently slay Fafnheir is to avoid becoming cursed after killing him, or to remove the curse before the victim dies.

			"",
			"Called the Father of All Linnorms, Fafnheir is the oldest and mightiest of his kind to dwell upon Golarion-other, even more powerful linnorms exist on the First World, but on Golarion, Fafnheir is king. Crafty and powerful, Fafnheir is more than just a creature of rage or hunger, and is sometimes known to speak with those who come to him as supplicants for his wisdom. Tales say that to gain Fafnheir's advice, one must travel through Grungir Forest to the cavern entrance of the linnorm's lair, whereupon the supplicant must call into the opening several secret names for the ancient linnorm. A single step into the lair renders the supplication moot, for Fafnheir does not suffer intrusions. It is customary to bring a herd of sheep, oxen, or several thralls for him to feast upon.",
			"",
			"Those who find Fafnheir in a talkative mood and live to tell the tale report that the linnorm is well versed in numerous fields, and capable of working a wide range of magic through wishcrafting, though how much of his bragging is true is debatable. Fafnheir claims to have been the first linnorm to cross to Golarion from the First World after slaying three of that realm's Eldest, as well as to remember a time when the dragon god Dahak came to this world, and to have taken part in ancient battles against humanity as an ally of the serpentfolk. Certain Thassilonian accounts give support to his claim of providing advice and aid at times to Runelord Xanderghul, and he endured the Age of Darkness with ease. The past few thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye for the ancient linnorm, and he expects to survive for thousands more.",
			"",
			"Fafnheir is aware of the prophecy that the hero who kills him will become king of all Ulfen. The linnorm also knows that in death he will be reborn from the burnt flesh of his slayer, and suggests to those who raise this topic with him that only by becoming him can such a Linnorm King rule. While Fafnheir has seen many challengers, few have offered him a true battle.",
			"",
			"Fafnheir spends much of his time slumbering, but wakes quickly at the slightest deviation in the patterns of the world around him, and his dreaming mind touches the woods above and the blood of his children. Those who would come upon him unawares should not expect success unless they travel into his lair from other worlds, for his attunement to Grungir Forest is uncanny. The linnorm rarely ventures far from his lair, preferring to lure his enemies close and dispatch them on familiar ground. He loves nothing but his treasure, and cannot be bribed or threatened-the lure of potential treasure does not excite him nearly as much as what he already possesses. He is a subtle combatant, preferring to use trickery before launching into melee. Unlike his lesser kin, Fafnheir has a number of potent, if limited, spell-like abilities, and he often uses his limited wishes to great effect. He has long experience with direct confrontation, and his millennia of action have taught him tricks that few remember. He is one of the most deadly creatures in the Inner Sea region, and even the mightiest dragons fear his power."

It is typically found in regions of residual magical activity, such as abandoned arcane laboratories and sites of magical disasters. Although a dweomer cap can subsist on decaying organic material, it thrives and releases spores only when it can absorb trace magical energies. This makes these fungi an indicator that magical traps or treasures might be nearby. Spellcasters sometimes adopt dweomer caps as familiars, learning to read the fungi's scintillations to help identify nearby magical effects.",

They are typically found sunning themselves on rocks during all but the hottest parts of the day, retreating beneath the shade of ridges or rocks when the sun is directly overhead. Their main method of defense is to avoid detection, but when their desert coloration fails to fool predators, they attempt to flee or use their other defensive methods, such as their unique ability to rupture blood vessels in their eyes so they can spray noxious blood at approaching predators. Due to their fierce defensive displays, horned lizards are often thought to be overly aggressive, though people who keep them as pets or familiars know that they can be affectionate creatures.",

Sometimes they manage to swim miles upriver when they hunt for fish, using echolocation to navigate through smaller channels. They are social hunters and traveling in small groups called pods, which normally contain three to five popotos. Like larger dolphins, popotos are popular with seafarers, who consider the creatures to be good luck and tell hopeful tales of popotos leading lost swimmers to shore and pods fighting off sharks that are much larger than the popotos themselves.",

A creature within a fantionette's aura that is studying or interacting with it can attempt a DC 15 Will save to perceive the outsider for what it truly is. A creature that succeeds at this save or that is attacked by a fantionette immediately sees the fantionette's true form for the next 24 hours, even while outside the aura. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",

			"",
			"- Make an extra attack as part of a standard action.",
			"- Move up to its speed. The fantionette loses its move action on its next turn.",
			"- Reroll a single roll after it was made, but before the results are determined.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A fantionette is a servitor outsider for the halfling deity [Thamir Gixx](faith/thamir_gixx). It embodies the halfling god's association with assassination and opportunity, presenting itself to loyal followers of the Silent Blade both as a powerful assassin and as impressive support for established murderers. When left to its own devices on the Material Plane, a fantionette is a terrifying stalker of halflings and humans alike, positioning itself among large groups of human children or halflings and selecting adult targets to murder based entirely on whim and opportunity.",
			"",
			"A fantionette stands between 3 and 4 feet high and weighs about 70 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike other auras, a fantionette's aura of revelation serves as a weakness-a range at which creatures can see through its otherwise illusory guise. A fantionette combines its deceptive form with its ability to blend in to crowds, often positioning itself as part of a group of children or adult halflings. Sometimes a child sees through the fantionette's aura, only for the child to be scared away and attempt to warn her parents. The result is almost always the same: the warned parent glances over at the disguised fantionette, too far outside the aura to perceive its true form, and dismisses the child for being foolish. A fantionette thrives on the fear it generates from children-though it is clear from their patterns of attacks that these outsiders are either somehow forbidden from harming children, or simply prefer not to.",
			"",
			"Once a fantionette is ready to strike, or when an unfortunate witness manages to pierce its illusory form, the fantionette attacks in a flurry of claws accented by vicious bites. In its true form, it has a pair of wicked claws, each made of black chitin and pieces of jagged porcelain. The fantionette also sports a similarly serrated bite; its mouth resembles disjointed spider mandibles with a second layer of chipped porcelain. Fantionettes often employ their claws to cruel effect, combining an uncanny knowledge of anatomy with savage rends that tear most opponents into a bloody mess within seconds. Even creatures attempting to flee an unrestrained fantionette soon discover the outsider is capable of instinctually following-in some cases relinquishing itself to its malignant puppet strings, letting an unseen force drag the fantionette to chase down the fleeing target.",
			"",
			"A wide array of divinely granted powers assists the fantionette in its paired roles as assassin and deceiver. These gifts most often manifest in a variety of spell-like abilities, which the fantionette uses as means to overcome targets or as a way of deflecting scrutiny in social settings. The hand of Thamir Gixx is said to hover invisibly over every fantionette in service to the Silent Blade. While fantionettes are free-willed beings, they can temporarily suspend their independence and allow other forces to guide their malignant claws. Such lapses in control manifest in odd last-second movements, such as a claw destined to miss a foe suddenly jolting upward into a disemboweling strike. Other times, a fantionette moves in an oddly contorted manner; these jerks and jostles reveal that it's being guided by its hidden puppeteer.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"First and foremost, fantionettes are servants of Thamir Gixx. Whether directly delivered by their god or summoned to the Material Plane by eager spellcasters using spells such as lesser planar ally, fantionettes seek only to spread the chaotic, murderous joy of their patron deity. Like their god, they also offer deference to the followers of Norgorber. Fantionettes are as likely to work alongside a worshiper of Thamir Gixx as they are to take on the role of plucky sidekick to a fanatical devotee of Norgorber. Of the divine servitor races, perhaps none are more closely aligned than fantionettes and their [karumzek](monster/karumzek) counterparts. Where fantionettes prefer the eventual chaos of revealing themselves to a target, karumzeks prefer to act entirely behind the scenes. The two outsiders complement each other well, as karumzeks provide alchemical tools and poisons to fantionettes operating in service to Norgorber as part of Thamir Gixx's service to that deity.",
			"",
			"A fantionette's patron will inevitably grow weary of its murderous presence and either destroy the outsider or release it into the wild. On their own, fantionettes often assist thieves and murderers-and disenfranchised halflings in particular-establish a violent reputation by grafting their own long trails of murder and theft that lead to these apprentices. In this way, Thamir Gixx's favored servitors create new worshipers for their patron deity, both by taking on new murderous servants and by using their own murderous actions to remind halfling communities of the presence of the Silent Blade.",
			"",
			"When not acting on the Material Plane, fantionettes are found in equal measure in the Abyss and Axis. In the Abyss, they congregate around their deity's mysterious home, operating as guardians or entertainment, depending on the whims of their capricious master. In the lawful realm of Axis, fantionettes fall in line with the mysterious followers of Norgorber, acting in equal roles as assassins, entertainers, and messengers for the ascended deity in his hidden realm in Axis. Left to their own devices on either plane, fantionettes form horrific gaggles. These groups traverse the planes in search of new arrivals or otherwise weak prey, first presenting themselves as lost or stranded children or halflings. In the Abyss, this deception often surprises voracious demons, who see nothing more than a buffet of innocent humanity and are torn apart shortly after realizing the truth of their would-be meal. In Axis, fantionettes are far more cautious in their attacks. They always relocate to another distant portion of the plane after venting their bloodlust, striving to stay one step ahead of the axiomites and their inevitable enforcers."

Many communities who interact with them revere them as bringers of food and medicine, as well as protectors of crops. These fey have a particularly strong connection to corn; they regularly project their senses through corn plants to monitor the health of the field and search the local area for threats. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation if possible, using their ability to originate their spells from corn plants to harass those they wish to chase away."

			"As tall as a human, a faun stands on stark white goat legs and has short horns protruding from its head. It also has a short tail that swishes playfully when it is excited or entertained, and its hair falls gracefully around its horns and ears. Its humanoid torso is always lithe but chiseled because of its constant activity and play-fauns rarely laze about too long. Fauns stand nearly 6 feet tall and weigh little more than 150 pounds."

Many such gardens can be found in the stalactite-city known as the Court of Ether, for its dark fey inhabitants crave the piquant misery contained in the mushrooms and consider them a delicacy to be used in only the most bizarre culinary delights. Despite their role in production of these despair-laced luxuries, fear eaters are welcome only on the margins of most fey societies, and most fey rulers prefer to purchase their specialities through intermediaries rather than be seen associating with fear eaters directly.",

Feargaunts often allow victims to believe they have escaped, only to attack anew from an unexpected direction. The Dimension of Dreams is their home territory, and a feargaunt uses its knowledge of this realm to ensure that no matter how fast or how far victims flee, they can never truly leave the feargaunt behind.",

			"Long ago, in the wake of terrible calamity, some populations of sasquatches embraced terrible rites and dark bargains to protect their homes, becoming fen maulers. While sasquatches only resort to violence when threatened, fen maulers revel in bloodshed and vindictive belligerence. All but invisible within their shadowy domains, fen maulers stalk victims for hours or days at a time, until they corner their lost and panicked prey and force a final, deadly confrontation."

			"",
			"**Skull-Splitting Roar (Ex)** As a standard action, a feranth can unleash a terrible roar, affecting all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Any creatures in the area of the cone must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round and deafened for 1 minute. A feranth can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A feranth uses its devastating sonic attack to incapacitate foes and follows up with its powerful bite, vicious claws, and sharp horns to tear its prey asunder. This massive ambush predator is covered with hardened ridges and mottled black skin. Its limbs end in powerful claws that it uses to dig through tough terrain. When burrowing, a feranth uses its rear legs to smash the sides of its burrow, collapsing the passage behind it. A feranth's head is adorned with two massive, forward-facing horns and four bulbous, constantly humming sacs that amplify its mighty roars. A feranth stands 25 feet tall and 40 feet long, and weighs between 9 and 11 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The feranths that now roam Numeria are the descendants of a group that were abducted from a far-off planet and brought to Golarion as part of an ill-fated voyage. They remained locked in their containment pods for many years after their arrival on Golarion, but the damage sustained by the pods eventually became too much-they finally failed, releasing the feranths into the unsuspecting world. Using their sharp claws, the creatures burrowed through the structurally weakened hull of the starship in which they were contained, emerging onto the surface of a strange new planet.",
			"",
			"On their native planet, feranths were apex predators that devoured prey with endless appetite, and the few living on Golarion remain true to this behavior. Feranths move on to a new location only after exhausting most sources of available food. While feranths do eventually return to previous hunting grounds, they instinctively wait many years for food sources to replenish before terrorizing those regions once again.",
			"",
			"Because of feranths' highly territorial nature, battles between two rivals are vicious affairs that can take hours or even days to resolve, and almost invariably end with one of the combatants bloodied, limping, and nearly dead. Yet deaths are surprisingly rare during these trials, despite the ferocity with which they are fought. It seems that feranths prefer to simply frighten and weaken their rivals rather than killing them outright.",
			"",
			"When hunting prey, feranths tend to use ambush tactics. They often charge up through the ground once they have pinpointed their prey's location using tremorsense, and then unleash a mighty roar to further discombobulate their victims. Feranths often repeat this tactic many times during an encounter with prey, diving beneath the ground only to erupt back up a few seconds or even minutes later.",
			"",
			"Fortunately for the inhabitants of Numeria, female feranths are rare on Golarion-a fact that keeps the beasts' numbers low. It's uncertain whether this same discrepancy in the ratio between the sexes exists on the feranths' home planet. Females are by far the most ferocious members of the species, especially in the few months following the hatching of their eggs. During this time, a female feranth can be identified by her mottled red-brown skin tone and vicious temperament. For 3 months after their eggs hatch, female feranths have the [blood rage universal monster](umr/blood_rage) ability. A female usually mates multiple times during her lifetime, laying two eggs each time. She cares for her offspring for 3 years before the juveniles abandon their mother, leaving in search of their own territories in which to hunt. Juvenile feranths that have just left their families are often about 12 feet tall and 20 feet long.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Scholars believe that feranths' behavior on Golarion is much the same now as it was on their home planet, with one key difference: their range. Rather than roaming great swaths of territory like their ancestors did, feranths on Golarion remain primarily in Numeria. Some of these creatures have wandered into the Worldwound, however, and every now and then one rampages through the northern reaches of the River Kingdoms, across the southern border of Mendev, or along the eastern edge of Brevoy. For unknown reasons, feranths avoid treading into Ustalav.",
			"",
			"Feranths prefer to carve their lairs out of hillsides where they can monitor the passage of potential prey, but they sometimes dig dens deep underground to protect themselves from ambush by rival feranths. It is most common for a feranth to construct its home underground when other feranths threaten its territory, but females of the species also dig underground lairs when they are ready to lay and hatch their eggs. Thus, the presence of an underground feranth lair is a sign of greater danger: either the nearby area is infested with other feranths, or the den belongs to a ferocious feranth mother.",
			"",
			"Crafty Kellid tribes have learned some tricks, such as the use of earplugs or silencing magic, to counteract the beasts' advantages. They also bait feranths into traps or enclosed canyons using livestock or other large animals. The Kellids use these tactics not only to fight these alien beasts, but also to capture them-a few captive feranths have even been trained for warfare by various tribes. Powerful alchemical concoctions are mixed and fed to a captive feranth, as it is necessary to cloud the creature's mind to tame it. In this state, the feranth becomes docile and seemingly forgets how to burrow, making it easy for the tribe to keep its prized beast nearby. Once the feranth's mind is clouded, blinders can be attached to limit the creature's field of vision, allowing a brave barbarian rider to guide it in battle. When the time comes for the feranth to fight, a second concoction is fed to the beast to give it a burst of energy, sending it into a rampage.",
			"",
			"The Red Dog tribe in Numeria's Sellen Hills was renowned for many years for its control of a feranth, a feat that its leaders parleyed into an alliance between a number of nearby tribes. This alliance-and the entire Red Dog tribe-ended abruptly when the captive feranth eventually developed a tolerance to the alchemical concoctions used to keep it docile."

Powerful mortals might arise as multiple festering spirits, each spawned from a different aspect of the original creature's personality.",
			"",
			"A festering spirit can't travel more than a mile from its remains. When left alone for long periods, a festering spirit usually wanders the halls and rooms near its burial site, destroying things, indulging in pranks, or trying to eat and drink anything it finds palatable (which falls through its incorporeal body to no effect). Its senses can barely detect these treats, though some adventurers report that strong alcohol and spicy foods can distract the spirit as it savors these sensations."

Most festrogs gather in small bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they might recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings in sunless areas easily defended with group tactics. Like ghouls, they tend to skulk about graveyards, though they prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they can hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs, preferring open areas like plains, farmlands, or open forests where they can track down prey with few places for it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically, often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of mortal flesh."

Alone or in small groups, they disguise themselves as hapless mountain folk, comely youths, or foreign wanderers to engage in confidence schemes and practical jokes against humanoid neighbors.

			"**Discorporate (Su)** A flotsam terror can break apart into a tangle of seaweed and rubbish as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, becoming a swarming mass of Tiny debris. It gains the swarm subtype, its space changes to 10 feet, and its reach changes to 0. In this form, it gains a swarm attack that deals 2d6 points of damage. The flotsam terror gains a +20 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as harmless flotsam while in this form. Creatures can move through the flotsam terror's space while it is in this form, treating the area as difficult terrain. The flotsam terror can reconstitute as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Flotsam Missile (Ex)** While in its standard form, a flotsam terror can hurl a portion of its body up to 30 feet as a ranged attack. A flotsam missile deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 + the flotsam terror's Strength modifier.",
			"",
			"**Flotsam Repair (Su)** A flotsam terror has fast healing 2 when in an area with a high concentration of nautical debris, such as a shipwreck, a sargassum field, or the area created by the discorporate ability of one or more other flotsam terrors.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Also known as jetsam swarms, sailor's bane, and wreck wraiths, flotsam terrors are undead created from the souls of sailors and other sea travelers killed in shipwrecks. Such a soul lingers around the detritus of a shipwreck, eventually coalescing into a flotsam terror. Multiple terrors can spawn from one wreck. They then ride the currents, roaming the seas until they locate other ships. Flotsam terrors are malicious and bitter entities, detesting their fate and intentionally seeking out ships in hopes of causing additional wrecks. The creatures follow and attack any survivors, intent on creating more of their kind.",
			"",
			"A flotsam terror is typically 3 feet tall and weighs up to 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although they usually form around shipwrecks, flotsam terrors aren't created after the sinking of every ship. The souls that linger to eventually become flotsam terrors are usually already filled with spite. Many flotsam terrors are born after a failed mutiny causes a ship to crash, when the remaining traitorous souls are reborn with vindictive fervor. Not all flotsam terrors share this origin, however. Some are born from the souls of casual travelers who believe themselves unfairly slain, usually due to the actions of the ship's captain or crew. Rather than attacking ships in general, these flotsam terrors seek out surviving crew members in hopes of revenge.",
			"",
			"A flotsam terror's composition is peculiar. Each has the ability to undo itself, reverting into a floating mass of debris and seaweed. In this state, the terror is virtually indistinguishable from actual flotsam, and the component parts of its form are surprisingly interchangeable: multiple flotsam terrors can exchange and share various pieces of debris, trading parts of their bodies with every discorporation. Flotsam terrors can also intertwine and mingle while dispersed in this manner, forming sizable masses of debris called floats.",
			"",
			"Flotsam terrors spend most of their time at sea. Occasionally, the pursuit of a specific target causes a flotsam terror to move onto land. A flotsam terror is hindered when out of the water, as the thick, waterlogged mass of its body weighs it down. On land, the terror usually discorporates to appear as a pile of flotsam that washed up on shore. A flotsam terror is incredibly patient and will remain in this form for days or even weeks, waiting for a creature to investigate its presence on the shore, at which point the flotsam attacks.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions, a flotsam terror forms from the remains of previously slain flotsam terrors. Sometimes a single piece of a destroyed flotsam terror will slip away, holding a spark of its animating force. When enough of these lone pieces come together, they create a more powerful form of a flotsam terror. Known as flotsam fiends, these terrors have the advanced and giant creature simple templates. A flotsam fiend's increased intelligence allows it to speak and recall an original purpose; thus, a flotsam fiend often strives to fulfill the original intent of its most dominant soul. Flotsam fiends can hold dominion over large numbers of flotsam terrors, allowing them to draw small armies to their causes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Flotsam terrors generally travel near coasts where they can attack ships early in their journey. This also allows the creatures to more easily destroy ships by leading them toward dangerous reefs or cliffs. Those formed far out at sea tend to remain in their dispersed form for weeks, allowing the currents to draw them closer to civilization. In the rare case that a flotsam terror encounters a ship while out at sea, it often attaches to the hull until the ship returns to dock, then attacks disembarking sailors, or it finds a suitable location to try to sink the ship.",
			"",
			"Flotsam terrors generally lack any kind of personality. When first created, a flotsam terror is filled with specific purpose, usually the destruction of an individual whom the terror believes wronged it in life. This purpose is quickly lost, however. When flotsam terrors disperse and intermingle, they mix not only their debris but also their intelligence and memories. This leads flotsam terrors traveling in groups to eventually share a similar, but diminished purpose. While not precisely a hive mind, these groups move and attack with complicated tactics, a byproduct of their shared semiconsciousness.",
			"",
			"A float of flotsam terrors behaves differently if led by a flotsam fiend. Such floats still attack ships in large groups, but their attacks are more deliberate. A fiend with a particularly tactical soul, such as that of a captain or naval general, is a force to be reckoned with.",
			"",
			"A fiend that succeeds at its primary goal usually surrenders its position and its power by intentionally discorporating among its fellow terrors. When it reforms, the fiend has a new dominant soul, meaning a flotsam fiend never lacks a purpose. This allows a float to maintain a neverending crusade, continually adding more flotsam terrors to its ranks. This process is of particular note to scholars, as undead creatures are rarely so prone to cooperating with one another. Whether this is an instinctive response or a sign of the various souls finding camaraderie in their misery has yet to be seen.",
			"",
			"### Flotsam Terror Treasures",
			"",
			"The composition of a flotsam terror varies by creature and region. Depending on the kind of debris that composes the flotsam terror, the creature may have any number of pieces of detritus as part of its body. While most of these are common items, there is a 20% chance of finding gems or jewelry worth up to 250 gp among the components of a given flotsam terror, and an additional 5% chance of finding a magic item. The latter is usually worth less than 500 gp and does not provide any benefit to the flotsam terror (it is not considered to be wearing and can't activate the magic item). At the GM's discretion, a flotsam terror can contain a more powerful or valuable item or even the seed for a new adventure."

They also know full well the limitations of their fragile forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to tackle these dangerous tasks instead.",
			"",
			"Flumphs float and speak via a constant flow of air through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft. Typical flumphs weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their birth, flumphs occasionally engage in a ritual called the Seeding, in which seed pods are flung into outer space in order to provide other planets with guardians."

Creatures that succeed at their saving throws cannot be affected by the same fluxwraith's time shift ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"A fluxwraith is an incorporeal undead with a host of extraordinary powers owing to its singular status as a time-displaced entity. Its serene appearance and dreamlike demeanor harken to its origins, for in life it slept away the centuries in a state of magical or technological stasis. Now, whether by accident or malign intent, the fluxwraith's soul lies scattered across the timestream. Demented by its paradoxical consciousness, it yearns to destroy any living being audacious enough to exist within a single point of time.",
			"",
			"Because its appearance depends upon its state when it first entered suspended animation, viewers may sometimes be able to deduce clues about its former life, as well as its motivations for entering hibernation. Some seek interminable sleep while they are in the prime of life, aiming to awaken and embrace immortality as a perfect specimen, while others hope to defer a terminal diagnosis. However, the sleeper's motivations in life seldom define a fluxwraith's outlook, as the process of becoming undead erases all but the most deeply ingrained mortal traits.",
			"",
			"The first hint of the fluxwraith's destructive nature manifests in the caul of energy that winks on and off around it. This ever-shifting network of temporal energy contains fragments of its consciousness, appearing as flickering aspects of itself as a youth, an adult, or a corpse. Scrutinizing these vignettes may provide further clues about the fluxwraith's former existence, although any creature that enters the fluxwraith's aura, or any creature affected by its attacks, may begin to see its own reflections appear within the shards as well. These disturbing images depict a creature not as it is, but as the fluxwraith perceives it in the past or future.",
			"",
			"Fluxwraiths tend to speak ancient or dead languages, often murmuring incomplete or garbled statements that blend past and future tenses in unsettling ways.",
			"",
			"While some sages seek to cheat mortality through necromancy, others use potent temporal magic or even cryogenic technology to survive the eons, aspiring to awaken in a future when death has been rendered obsolete. Yet temporal stasis carries many risks, and any damage to the sleeper's pod may kill its inhabitant, or worse. Some types of malfunctions kill the sleeper's physical body but scatter its awareness across the timestream, causing its consciousness to exist in every moment at once. This process shreds the sleeper's sanity but imbues its spirit with terrifying temporal powers, resulting in a fluxwraith.",
			"",
			"The malfunction also causes most fluxwraiths to lose the skills and abilities they had in life. They do retain a sharp intellect, although they see the world through a distorted lens of madness, malice, and heightened temporal awareness. A fluxwraith perceives living creatures as knotted threads of time-bound energy begging to be untied and twisted into more pleasing patterns, and it revels in its capacity to shift victims through time or even freeze them for eternity.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, a demented spellcaster may purposely create a fluxwraith seeking to harness temporal power for her own use. In such cases, the sleeper is usually tricked into entering its slumber with promises of immortality, after which its malice and fury are only increased by the betrayal. A fluxwraith does not remain subservient to any master, and it invariably overpowers its creator.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Though no one knows why, fluxwraiths rarely drift far from the damaged sleeping chambers that spawned them. Some might harbor an unconscious hope that their pods might be repaired, enabling them to return to a more peaceful time-bound sleep; others might simply feel no need for physical movement, since their minds now roam unfettered through the timestream.",
			"",
			"A fluxwraith may prefer solitude, attacking intruders on sight. Others relish the chance to toy with visitors before severing them from the timestream. An ambitious fluxwraith might employ underlings to kidnap living beings, providing it with a steady stream of organic \"puzzles\" to unravel. Occasionally, a system-wide malfunction results in the creation of several fluxwraiths at once. These clusters become monomaniacal, plotting to spread their influence far beyond their lair. Using tantalizing glimpses of the future, they entice evil mortals or lesser undead to scour the world for time-based artifacts in order to vastly boost the range of their innate abilities."

			"**Partial Invisibility (Su)** A flying polyp's body constantly flickers and shifts, passing from visibility to invisibility in a seemingly random pattern and often not wholly at once, leaving the creature's body in what appear to be multiple sections. This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target the creature, granting it a 20% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible.",
			"",
			"**Sucking Wind (Su)** This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie wind out to slow and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull creatures back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the effect. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or it is slowed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any slowing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a slow spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round-it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. Freedom of movement protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and control winds negates its effects in the area of effect of the control winds spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind. A flying polyp can activate a sucking wind once per day, and can maintain concentration on the effect for up to an hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Wind Blast (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a flying polyp can create a powerful blast of wind at a range of up to 120 feet. This blast of wind creates a sudden explosion of flesh-scouring wind in a 30-footradius burst. All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC 26 Reflex save halving the damage. In addition, these winds can check or blow away creatures as if they were tornado-strength winds. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

A typical flying polyp measures 30 feet in length but is unusually light for its size, weighing no more than 2,000 pounds. These creatures seem to have no maximum lifespan, but their violent, warlike nature ensures that death eventually occurs-even if it takes eons for the polyp to encounter something capable of defeating it.",
			"",
			"A flying polyp is a physical being, but one composed of material strangely unlike the flesh that garbs most living creatures. While the stuff that makes up the exterior of a flying polyp's body might seem similar to ordinary flesh, it often behaves in ways that should be impossible. The material seems to fade in and out of visibility, almost at random, at points becoming transparent enough that the nauseating inner workings of the thing's body are laid bare. Although the polyp feels moist and damp to the touch, what might serve as blood in other creatures behaves more like strange vortices of wind within a flying polyp's body. When wounded, its damaged flesh does not bleed so much as whistle and gust.",
			"",
			"A flying polyp's association with wind goes far beyond the strange storms that surge through what pass as veins and arteries in its massive body. These creatures have a remarkable ability to control the air around them, both via a wide array of spell-like abilities and through the use of potent supernatural powers. They do not wield tools or weapons as a rule, instead using their mastery of the winds themselves to wage war and build their grim cities, scouring towers and chambers out of basalt with precise blasts of sand-laden wind.",
			"",
			"Although flying polyps display some of the features of other sentient races, particularly in their habit of building cities (although these towering settlements usually incorporate architectural features that most other races find awkward and unsettling), in other areas they seem strangely primitive or uninterested. They are as aberrant in mind and philosophy as they are in physical form. For example, they seem to have neither a name for their own race, nor a language to call their own. Their cities, while bewildering in their vast scale, seem to serve little purpose other than to unnerve, for flying polyps do not engage in trade or politics or other social constructs.",
			"",
			"The primary exception to this, to the detriment of other creatures unfortunate enough to dwell in regions claimed by flying polyps, is war. Flying polyps excel at genocide, using their mastery over wind to scour clean entire cities and civilizations when they come upon them. Some among their kind can even travel to other planets by bringing with them a sizable sphere of purloined wind to carry them aloft and sustain them, and with this power they lead armies from planet to planet as necessary, relentlessly tracking their chosen enemies across worlds. Every so often, flying polyps encounter a race that is their equal in war, and on some worlds, they still endure the humiliation of these ancient defeats after being imprisoned in extensive underground chambers where they are cut off from the outside world. Yet flying polyps are long-lived, and should unforeseen tectonic events creates new exit to their prison chambers, lost in the forgotten corners of those planets' depths, they emerge with unabated fury to seek revenge against the enemies who dared humiliate them so."

A forlarren grows to adulthood with astonishing speed, reaching full growth in only a year-even those who come into the world as orphans are capable of defending themselves and seeking out food. Yet despite the rapidity with which they reach maturity, few forlarrens survive to adulthood. Cast out from both sylvan and fiendish society, the typical forlarren is a lonely creature, cursed by its own existence. It detests itself and everything it sees, and soon becomes consumed by hatred of life itself. The forlarren vents its rage on good and evil alike, lashing out at anything that approaches it.",
			"",
			"The forlarren attacks with its clawed hands, typically focusing on a single opponent at a time and attacking until it or its opponent is slain. Yet curiously, when a forlarren succeeds in killing an opponent, the kindly traits of its fey mother sometimes surface, and it shows profound remorse for its cruelty. With such a pendulum of erratic behavior, it is no wonder that forlarrens are all but incapable of forming lasting friendships-even with others of their own kind.",
			"",
			"The majority of forlarrens inherit little in the way of the magical abilities possessed by their fey mothers, but they do gain a small measure of the powers of their fiendish fathers. In most cases, this manifests as the ability to use heat metal three times per day, but some forlarren instead gain a different spell-like ability chosen from the following list: chill metal, flame blade, flaming sphere, gust of wind, summon swarm, or warp wood.",
			"",
			"A forlarren stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 160 pounds. In theory, these creatures can live for hundreds of years, but most perish through violence before they turn 10."

Only when they leave their larval stage are workers given a unique number carved into their carapaces, which is used in place of an individual name. Workers parrot the taskmasters in many things; they denote accomplishments on their carapaces and even have duels (though duels among workers almost never involve death). Rarely, a particularly remarkable worker will be called out for special attention by their taskmaster, and these workers are presented to the queen and given a proper name of their own.",

			"Workers flee from combat unless they are ordered by a taskmaster or myrmarch to attack intruders. If a hive is invaded, formian workers might be used as diversions or to undermine or collapse tunnels on invading enemies.

Freedom of movement grants immunity to this combat maneuver penalty, and the tendrils cannot penalize creatures that are gaseous or incorporeal.",
			"",
			"**Tentacles (Ex)** A formless spawn's tentacles always function as primary natural weapons. As it deals damage with a tentacle, a formless spawn can decide whether it is dealing bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Oozes are much-feared denizens of the Darklands, yet many of them share characteristics that canny adventurers can exploit. The two best known are their mindlessness (a feature that lets an experienced adventurer manipulate the ooze in a battle, due to its inability to use tactics) and their lack of armor (a quality that allows for tactics like Power Attack to be used with abandon). However, those who stumble across one of the so-called formless spawn of Tsathoggua would do well to remember that not all oozes are mindless and easily hit in combat, for these deadly guardians prove quite cunning and display an alacrity that grants them incredible defenses against physical attacks.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn at rest resembles nothing more than a simple puddle of tar, oil, or another dark, thick liquid; once roused to attack, however, it could never be mistaken for anything other than a monstrous and malignant predator. The creature's outline changes constantly, shifting from serpentine to insectile to a truly shapeless mass-at times even approximating humanoid or other bestial shapes before collapsing in on itself a moment later. Always, the formless spawn sends forth a storm of tendrils that whip and writhe, blocking attacks and fouling attempts at combat maneuvers. The creatures can speak if they deign to, yet they rarely bother to do so with creatures that have fixed shapes-formless spawn consider talking to one's food a waste of time.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn is elephantine in size, capable of covering a 15-foot-diameter pool to a depth of a foot, and it weighs just over 9,000 pounds. Even at this weight, a formless spawn is only about as dense as oil and thus floats on water, unless it actively swims down under the surface.",
			"",
			"A formless spawn is a sentient and quite intelligent mass of protoplasm capable of assuming any basic shape but incapable of holding that form for long. It has no true shape. The ooze's characteristic formlessness results from a combination of physical disinclination to stay in one configuration (doing so causes a formless spawn something akin to nausea) and a mental inability to even comprehend the concept of a fixed form. Still, a formless spawn hardly seems to suffer at all in power or intellect for these constant fluctuations in appearance. Indeed, they often ridicule those who they view as being \"locked\" into a single shape, although most creatures never even get the chance to hear such mockery, for formless spawn are usually more eager to slaughter and consume those they encounter than speak to them.",
			"",
			"Formless spawn do not age-a process that spawn refer to as \"a crude biological function\"-nor do they reproduce. All formless spawn that exist were themselves spawned from sources deep below the ground. The original formless spawn issued fully formed and aware from Tsathoggua himself, but after a time, the very rocks in places where that Great Old One slumbered seemed to gain the ability to create them. Just as pockets of oil might bubble up from a fissure in the stones, so too might a fully formed spawn come into being. Fortunately, such points are few and far between. While spawn do not grow old or mate, they must eat, and a spawn denied meals can starve to death. When a spawn uses its freeze ability, its metabolism slows significantly-a spawn masquerading as a pool can live for decades or even centuries without eating, but upon awakening, it is always ravenous and must seek sustenance promptly or begin to starve.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The majority of formless spawn that are encountered are acting as temple guardians or agents of the cult of Tsathoggua, to the extent that many texts refer to these monsters by a longer name: the formless spawn of Tsathoggua. Within the Great Old One's temples, a formless spawn often resides within a large font or other carved container that upon first glance might appear to be little more than a decorative aspect of the shrine. Those formless spawn that are encountered in the wild are almost always ones that have lost their temples or have survived the destruction of a cult they once served. Formless spawn wander the deep tunnels of the Darklands relentlessly, driven by an urge to seek out new cults or temples of their father to serve. These formless spawn, subjected to a wider range of obstacles and challenges, most often advance beyond the standard powers presented above, either by gaining Hit Dice or class levels. Formless spawn that gain levels generally do so as clerics of Tsathoggua, psychics, rogues, or sorcerers. A spellcasting formless spawn usually takes Eschew Materials as a feat as early as possible, but as long as it worships Tsathoggua, it can use its own body as a divine focus in place of a holy symbol when casting spells.",
			"",
			"In some cases, formless spawn manage to ascend beyond being mere guardians of a temple or agents of a cult, and wind up actually leading the temple itself. These formless spawn are almost always clerics of Tsathoggua, and they often count several standard spawn among their servitors, alongside the various humanoid or monstrous cultists who make up the bulk of the clergy. Legends of formless spawn being able to hold a single shape for extended periods of time are inaccurate, and they are often confused with accounts of shoggoths that have developed this capability. Despite both being dark-colored oozes, shoggoths and formless spawn have very little in common-the former being regarded by the latter as dangerous but useful beasts of burden, and with the shoggoths themselves generally showing minimal interest in anything other than themselves.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"This memorable creature first made its appearance as an unnamed antagonist in Clark Ashton Smith's short story, \"The Tale of Satampra Zeiros,\" wherein a pair of wouldbe thieves run afoul of the monster in a lost jungle city while searching for treasure said to be held within a temple devoted to Tsathoggua."

			"It's believed that these strange frozen oozes are created when a particularly cold arctic area has prolonged exposure to ice from the Elemental Planes. Rising seemingly spontaneously from such a supernatural deep freeze, freezing flows shamble forth in search of prey, hungry for the life energy of warm-blooded creatures, which they somehow metabolize.",
			"",
			"Within their native habitat, these oozes are particularly difficult to spot. While they lack intelligence, they have an instinct to stay put within frozen ice flows, on the icy surface of frozen lakes and rivers, or within areas of permafrost, waiting for prey to stumble upon them. This instinct may be tied to the fact that they can stay relatively dormant for decades or even centuries, but eventually they need the life energy of warm-blooded creatures to fuel their strange locomotion. Since they dwell in unforgiving and underpopulated areas, it is easier for them to conserve energy and wait for prey rather than to try to track down warm-blooded creatures.",
			"",
			"After feeding, or when fully fed, these creatures tend to ignore other creatures unless attacked. Though freezing flows' crystalline construction can give the illusion that they are brittle, nothing is further from the truth. When a freezing flow slams into flesh, it does so with enough power to break bone, and it is cold enough to numb flesh, causing its prey to convulse in a fit of shivers.",
			"",
			"When hungry, the only things freezing flows avoid are fire and high temperatures. Such things can still melt and damage a freezing flow, though it typically requires more heat to diminish a freezing flow into a puddle of water than it takes to melt a patch of normal ice 10 times the ooze's size."

Perpetually ill-tempered, a froghemoth often seems to kill simply for the sake of killing-vomiting up partially digested meals in favor of new prey when it encounters such. It's not unheard of to find these strange creatures far from their normal habitations, as if the marsh didn't agree with them and sent them wandering in search of a new home. Some sages argue that the froghemoth isn't from this world at all, and that these wanderings are instinctual urges to seek out its true home-a home not represented by the strange world in which the beast finds itself trapped.",

They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands.",
			"",
			"Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly.",
			"",
			"Frost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind. This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status when representing the grove in external matters (see below).",
			"",
			"Once a frost fir's fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a supply of carcasses for this effort.",
			"",
			"Following 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member. Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir's development remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself. Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to mourn their loss.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Frost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time, banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances of their species. Only in times of great conflict do multiple groves join forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight-usually followed by great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs' ire.",
			"",
			"Within frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.",
			"",
			"### Frost Firs in Alchemy",
			"",
			"Some alchemists prize frost firs for their sticky resin and easily combustible branches. When used as a component in manufacturing tanglefoot bags, a frost fir's resin increases the DC of the bag's Reflex save by 2 and extends the duration of the goo's entangling effect by 1 round. Frost fir resin can also aid in the crafting of tindertwigs, reducing the Craft DC from 20 to 15 and cutting the raw material cost in half."

When a creature dies from exposure to such harsh conditions, bitter anger and the searing cold sometimes combine to reanimate the dead as one of the frostfallen. Once reanimated, frostfallen creatures prowl the cold lands in which they fell, wreaking indiscriminate vengeance on living creatures out of spiteful rage.",
			"",
			"Although frostfallen creatures can be created through necromantic magic like other undead, arcane scholars are fascinated by the necromancy that brings frostfallen creatures to unlife, for the animating force is a synthesis of negative energy and a bone-numbing cold. This cold empowers the creature's attacks, wreathing its natural weapons in a deathly chill. Those who have fought these creatures describe great wounds instantly numbed by the lethal touch of frostbite. In addition, a frostfallen creature's body emanates an aura of cold that flashfreezes moisture in the air around it, coating the creature in a patchwork of ice capable of deflecting blows from even the heaviest weapons. The creature's affinity for cold also allows it to locate nearby warm-blooded creatures, even in driving blizzards and on moonless nights.",
			"",
			"Frostfallen creatures move with the same gaits they had in life, while gaining a savage surge in physical power. Additionally, unlike normal zombies, the frozen condition of the creature fortifies its unlife, making it extremely durable.

			"",

			"The corrupt animus that powers frostfallen creatures imbues them with a hatred of all living things, and most spend their time wandering wintry terrains near where they died, looking for life to snuff out. Sometimes, vestiges of behavior from their original forms lead to groups banding together, like frostfallen wolves that hunt in packs. Even those frostfallen that have never encountered others of their kind seem to instinctively recognize their own, and band together if prey is nearby.",
			"",
			"In Irrisen, winter witches and other ice casters prefer creating frostfallen creatures, as such creatures' bodies more readily withstand the decay and brittleness often faced by skeletons and zombies in harsh northern climes. Casters who create frostfallen creatures often use minor magic to emblazon a creature's ice armor with carvings or specific colors, effectively branding the creature as a servant.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions, casters will create frostfallen creatures in warmer regions like the Mwangi Expanse or the deserts of Thuvia. Despite the scorching heat of such places, frostfallen creatures retain all of their powers. In such cases, the undead's creator normally employs her minions against creatures that are susceptible to the frostfallen creature's freezing attacks. Some frostfallen creatures have even survived independent of their creators. When such a rarity comes to pass, the frostfallen creature simply begins hunting the region for fresh life to end, though it will often lie in wait in cooler places like deep caves, or under the water of an oasis so as to better ambush creatures and travelers who would never expect to see a frostfallen creature so far south.",

			"Fuldrexes are mean, territorial creatures that, despite naturally taking the shape of small humanoids, seem to share more physical characteristics with fungi than anything else. Layers of thin, spotted, fibrous flesh cover their bodies like skin; their chubby fingers seem more like mushroom stalks than digits; and where hair might normally grow instead drips lacy growths that would seem more at home growing along the walls of a cave. Fuldrexes crave warm, dark, isolated places, and react violently when disturbed. The exception is when a much more powerful creature - particularly [a fungal creature](template/fungal_creature) - enters their demesne with an overwhelming display of might. In this case, the cowardly and dull creatures are apt to prostrate themselves before their better, vowing to serve and venerate it as other creatures might worship a deity.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes are notorious shapechangers that can appear to be naturally occurring fungi whenever they wish. They often use this ability to blend in with their surroundings before ambushing their enemies, or simply to fade from sight when a major threat barrels their way. In its natural form, a fuldrex stands 2-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"The product of natural growth run evilly amok, fuldrexes spawn in remote places where mundane fungus is abundant, especially in underground caves and oases. Fuldrexes always live where moisture and spots to hide among other plant life are abundant and where the searing light of the sun is scarce. Unlike most plants, though, fuldrexes have an advanced physiology and thus crave meat-the fresher the better-to sustain their strange little bodies. They also need moisture from their diets as well as from their surroundings to keep their bodily systems running smoothly.",
			"",
			"In a pinch, fuldrexes eat small animals native to their homes. However, fuldrexes prefer to accost larger creatures, especially humanoids, both for the large supplies of meat those victims provide as well as the liquids their bodies retain. They are most common and most comfortable as a species underground, though some fuldrexes thrive in the depths of primeval forests' especially blighted forests-where the treetop canopies keep their surroundings dark, moist, and perfectly suitable. When they do live in blighted areas, fuldrexes tend to gorge themselves on the fey that have so far escaped physical harm, and ignore those whose bodies and minds have been transformed into evil shadows of their previous selves (see the [blighted fey template](template/blighted_fey)).",
			"",
			"Regardless of where they live, fuldrexes reproduce using spores. There is no sexual dimorphism among fuldrexes, but two of the creatures are required for this process to take place. One fuldrex leaves a collection of spores in a safe, fungus-filled place, such as the hollow of an enormous, rotted log, or a crevice in an underground rock formation. Then, noticing the deep and pungent smell that distinctively marks these spores, another fuldrex later adds its own spores to the mix. The parents invariably abandon their gestating spawn, and after a few weeks, a new fuldrex springs fully formed from its fibrous sac.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes have no concept of parenthood and often squabble with their young over the best places to hunt or gather moisture. However, they do often allow the young specimens to live in their territories, usually provided that the children help lure fresh meat to the area. On rare occasions, fuldrexes spawn outside of any of their kin's territories, and in these cases the young are left entirely to their own devices.",
			"",
			"Although disease and blight have no hand in spawning fuldrexes, the creatures nonetheless maintain an incredible concentration of choking spores within their bodies. Mature fuldrexes know how to harness these physical characteristics into attacks that can weaken or kill their prey. Worse, though such planning and collaboration is rare among their kind, some fuldrexes even sneak unnoticed next to potential prey, releasing the noxious fumes from their rotten flesh just as a number of other fuldrexes descend upon the weakened victim. Terrifying as this sounds, though, fuldrexes almost always hunt alone or in pairs, even in territories where half a dozen or more of the creatures dwell. It is only in the most inhospitable environments that infestations of fuldrexes typically work together to kill any living creature unlucky enough to wander by.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As fiercely territorial creatures, fuldrexes are most concerned with maintaining a home that provides a steady stream of prey upon which to feed. They are cruel but rather cowardly, and thus prefer to use their environment as camouflage before ambushing victims. A stretch of deeply forested land or an expansive underground cave might seem abandoned, but it well may be teeming with an infestation of hiding fuldrexes simply waiting to strike.",
			"",
			"Fuldrexes typically treat each other neutrally; that is, fuldrexes occupying the same territory that aren't hunting partners tend to ignore one another- unless a fight breaks out over a kill or a prime spot to hide and ambush prey, of course. In this case, fuldrexes battle each other viciously and often to the death.",
			"",
			"Despite their ambivalence toward one another, fuldrexes do not brook other hunters living in or even passing through their territory. They often band together to drive out rival predators weaker than themselves, if they don't kill the offending creature outright for food. In a strange way, this behavior emulates a code of honor, though the evil creatures might turn on one another once the offending interloper is dispatched.",
			"",
			"The exception to fuldrexes' hostility toward rival predators lies in evil creatures that are significantly more powerful than they are, such as dragons, demons, and divs. These terrors' auras of evil are like siren songs to fuldrexes. If such a powerful rival rampages through a fuldrex territory-especially if the rival makes a wanton display of sheer power or wickedness-the local fuldrexes are likely to emerge from hiding and vow to serve the creatures unfailingly. Should the rival accept the fuldrexes' offer, the plant creatures dedicate themselves to being loyal minions, following even orders that would result in their certain deaths. As they are rather thick and blatantly self-centered, fuldrexes also tend to believe that they are the chosen acolytes of powerful creatures, and that they can achieve supernatural power through serving those they deem worthy."

They invariably appear as monstrous crickets or locusts fused with fungal growths, often topped with mushroom-like caps. This hybridization makes them adept survivors, and infestations are notoriously difficult to clear out entirely. Their needle-like teeth cannot chew solid food, so most fungal crawlers rely on digestive enzymes injected through their bite to make their meals palatable. Average specimens grow to 30 pounds and 3 feet in length. They reproduce by releasing spores, which remain viable for decades until they contact organic matter and eventually develop into small, pale grubs.",
			"",

They have adapted over millennia to fill every environment: flying variants fill subterranean rifts with the deafening drone of their wings, while aquatic breeds skim across the surfaces of underground lakes, and still others thrive in the fiery chambers and tunnels of volcanic networks."

			"#### Special Abilities",
			"",
			"**Compel Plants (Su)** A fungus queen's mind-affecting powers and spell-like abilities (and spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen's energy drain attack is not killed-instead, it immediately loses all negative levels imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion in her service. Most creatures gain the [fungoid simple template](template/fungoid), but vermin slain by a fungus queen instead rise as [spore zombies](template/spore_zombie). Fungoid creatures and spore zombies are under the control of the fungus queen that created them, and remain enslaved until that fungus queen is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation. A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane. She can control a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than double her own Hit Dice. Any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures or spore zombies. A fungus queen can free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a creature cannot be enslaved again (although fungoid creatures can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities).",
			"",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** A fungus queen drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before she can use this ability. The fungus queen's embrace bestows one negative level and has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the fungus queen. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the suggestion. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. Creatures killed by this attack do not die-they instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn above). The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Plant Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy ability, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted with a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train them as guardians.",
			"",
			"**Sporepod (Su)** As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle, though she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full attack, and only one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object with an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins attempted to invade the Abyssal realm of the demon lord of disease and fungus. These succubi sought to slay a powerful witch who had befouled a profane temple the assassins served. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with this development, the witch seeded numerous Material Plane worlds with fungus queen spores, and these new fungus queens have taken to these new environments like rot to a carcass; today, hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the fouler reaches of the Material Plane. They are particularly fond of large cave systems and the slums of ruined cities. Fungus queens also often dwell in areas of corrupted woodlands where blighted fey rule, or in the sewers of active cities with an unusually large amount of magical pollution.",
			"",
			"An encounter with a normally unintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way can be evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but fungus queens are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves-particularly attractive humanoids. Especially favored minions are given the gift of the fungus queen's embrace and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Yet a fungus queen knows that a diverse array of guardians is best, and is certain to keep some non-plant minions on hand to protect her lair.",
			"",
			"Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those who have been infested elicit their eternal ire, but it is succubi that most enrage fungus queens. Whether this is due to a simple territorial conflict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the plants abandon their normal approach of subtle mental control and trickery, instead bringing all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature apart. Fungus queens also take great and specific delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control.",
			"",
			"While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territories apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to \"poach\" from their sisters' harems of charmed and infested pets.",
			"",
			"Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in bard, ranger, or sorcerer- they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. Fungus queen druids are remarkably rare.",
			"",
			"A fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds."

			"**Deleriant Aura (Ex)** A furcifer's pollen induces euphoria and confusion, imposing a -2 penalty on Will saving throws on any creatures within 50 feet of the furcifer. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"**Displacement (Su)** A furcifer's illusory pollen constantly distorts its presence. It gains a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, displacement does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals its true location and negates the miss chance, and creatures immune to illusions or poison are immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"**Tongue (Ex)** A furcifer can grab a foe with its tongue and draw the victim to its mouth. This tongue attack has a reach of 25 feet. The attack deals no damage but allows the furcifer to grab its target. A furcifer does not gain the grappled condition while using its tongue in this manner.",
			"",
			"**Utopia (Sp)** A furcifer is blessed with strange powers of illusion and can warp the world around it at will to seem idyllic and safe. This functions as a mirage arcana spell, though the furcifer's simplistic intellect means it may create unusual or surreal illusions based on what its victims find appealing. Creatures in the affected area may recognize the landscape as unnatural with a successful DC 20 Will saving throw; otherwise, the furcifer's powers lull them into accepting the impossible. Affected creatures cannot recognize any natural hazards in the area, and the furcifer itself appears as something harmless within the affected area, such as a flower-covered hill, quaint home, or friendly animal, making it effectively invisible; if the furcifer attacks, it immediately breaks the invisibility effect but does not end the mirage arcana effect. Creatures immune to illusions and mind-affecting effects are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Standing as tall as a house and draped in intoxicating blossoms, the furcifer is a bizarre synthesis of reptile and plant born from enormous surges of positive energy. Despite their inviting, vibrant hides, furcifers are ravenous predators, capable of warping the world around them into almost any placid scene and concealing themselves from ordinary senses. These abilities make them extraordinary ambush predators, and parties of human-sized travelers are easily picked off one by one from above thanks to the clever reptilian hunters' long, prehensile tongues.",
			"",
			"Lazy and patient, these large reptiles sometimes lull whole caravans into complacency, letting them linger in false wonderlands for days or weeks as the furcifer picks off its prey one at a time. Furcifers are cantankerous and stubborn, and dispense with all subtlety to pursue prey relentlessly if it escapes their illusory paradise.",
			"",
			"Furcifers on average stand over 15 feet tall and 35 feet long thanks to their long, curled tails. Furcifers weigh up to 6-1/2 tons.",
			"",
			"A primordial creature of incredible size and impressive innate magic, the furcifer blends reptile and plant features into the form of a deadly ambush hunter. With the frame of a massive, hunchbacked lizard, opposable claws on each limb, a long prehensile tail, and a bony crest to protect their neck, this vicious beast lacks little in comparison to other predators. Despite all this, furcifers are lazy and capricious, preferring to lie in wait and snatch smaller prey with their long, prehensile tongues. Their broad-set eyes can rotate independently, allowing them to look in multiple directions at once and constantly watch for other dangerous creatures.",
			"",
			"Furcifers command impressive innate magic that allows them to cloak the world around them in a placid disguise. They have rudimentary psychic abilities and can read glimpses of whatever their prey finds inviting and harmless, and then spin those stolen images into a soft landscape. When confronting intelligent creatures, the beasts' limited intellects sometimes result in surreal illusions-such as fruit trees heavy with bunnies, rippling ponds sitting at angles in hillsides, or houses made from candy- but the mind-numbing euphoria of their magic often makes such impossible landscapes feel sensible to their unsuspecting prey.",
			"",
			"The orchidlike plants growing from the furcifer's back help further define their abilities. Rather than a symbiotic relationship, the blossoms are as much a part of the predator's anatomy as its eyes or claws, and they secrete a sweetly scented narcotic pollen that lulls most warmblooded animals into a mild euphoria. The plants provide some sustenance to the furcifer but also produce a bevy of alchemical reagents that help power its magical abilities as well as its consumption. With the aid of these botanical factories, furcifers can digest practically anything they can swallow- from rocks and debris to armor worn by their prey.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Furcifers flourish in warm and temperate forests, as their cold-blooded nature and hothouse flower elements make them vulnerable to the cold. The resilient creatures could survive in desert and mountain environments if transplanted, limited only by available water and prey, but they rarely leave the familiar hunting grounds where they are born.",
			"",
			"As asexual creatures, furcifers rely on pollinating insects for reproduction. Once their blossoms are fertilized, they release their spore-like eggs into the wind, and those that settle on trees develop into small, carnivorous flowers that feed on their host trees and passing insects and birds for several years before maturing into miniature furcifers that begin hunting. The youngs' first meals often consist of other larval furcifers that have yet to mature into their ambulatory states. On rare occasion, a single larval bloom will produce twin young, who bond and share their territory for life.",
			"",
			"Infused with positive energy and strange alchemical reagents, furcifers are useful components for a variety of projects. Their pollen remains psychoactive for years after death, and the nectar harvested from a single beast can provides weeks' worth of potent hallucinogens. Their bones are coveted for magic items involving acid, and their skin can be readily fashioned into cloaks and robes with illusory properties. The flesh itself is mildly toxic, and dead furcifers may rot slowly for months rather than be scavenged by other animals."
