Most historians find it more likely that a Bekyar skald spent time in Nex, was exposed to the idea of divination as a tool of war from a copy of Cold Irony, and fabricated tales of how that knowledge came to be in his hands.",

This allows the augur to cast augury as a spell-like ability. At 7th level, he can instead use signs and portents to cast divination as a spell-like ability, and at 12th level, he can instead cast commune as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, he can use signs and portents twice per day. This ability replaces all types of versatile performance.",

Once per day as a free action, he can declare one of his melee attacks to be a predictive strike. Against the augur's attack, the target is flat-footed and gains no benefits from concealment or cover. Attacks from other creatures are treated normally. The target still benefits from total concealment and total cover normally. At 11th level, the augur can use this ability a total of two attacks per day, and at 17th, three attacks per day.

Bonuses and penalties that apply to wild empathy checks apply to these urging checks. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. The song can influence plants or magical beasts with Intelligence scores of 1 or 2 as well as drunken creatures of any Intelligence (even without sharing a language), but against these non-animals, the bacchanal takes a -4 penalty on this check.

The effect ends when the target can no longer hear the bacchanal from within 30 feet.

			"**Controlled Inspired Rage (Su):** When the urban skald inspires rage, he does not grant the normal benefits. Instead, he can apply a +2 morale bonus to his allies' Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 16th level. The urban skald can apply the full bonus to one ability score or split the bonus between several scores in increments of 2. The choice applies to all affected allies. The controlled inspired rage grants no bonus on Will saves, imposes no penalties to AC, and does not prevent affected allies from using Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charisma-based skills. This alters inspired rage.",

If the foe fails a Will saving throw, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and on attack rolls, cannot use any Intelligence-, Dexterity-, or Charisma-based skills, and must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (DC = 15 + spell level) for as long as it remains in range of the skald and the performance is maintained. At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the urban skald can target an additional foe with this ability. This replaces song of marching and damage reduction.",

That target must attempt a Will save. On a failed save, the primary target cannot benefit from any morale bonus or teamwork feats, cannot treat any creature as an ally, and must attempt to save against any spell cast on it (including harmless spells, even if it casts them on itself). These effects remain as long as the primary target can hear the skald and the skald maintains the performance.",

Secondary targets must succeed at Will saves or they cannot treat the primary target as an ally, and cannot target it with spells or abilities that are harmless.

This grants the painted ally the benefits of one additional rage power when the ally activates the furious paints.

Furthermore, the war painter can select only [a blood rage power or a totem rage power](ability/rage_powers).

Once while benefiting from the paint's raging song, the painted ally can use a standard action to cast the infused spell on herself as if the war painter had cast it. The spell ends when the paint's other effects end. A war painter can infuse only a skald spell whose level is at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level skald spell he can cast. He can infuse any targeted spell in a painted ally, even if its range is personal. The war painter can use this ability twice per day at 13th level and three times per day at 19th level.",
