If there is a verbal component, they still hear your loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting.

				"In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the fighter weapon groups on page 56 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). At your GM's discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective.",
				"",
				"*Capture Weapon* (Improved Disarm): When you successfully disarm an opponent's manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a -4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM's discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.",
				"",
				"*Find the Hidden* (Blind-Fight): You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a -2 penalty and no miss chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn).",
				"",
				"*Grab Purchase* (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.",
				"",
				"*Hurl Scabbard* (Quick Draw): You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon.",
				"",
				"*Steer Opponent* (Improved Bull Rush): You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.",
				"",
				"*Tangle Leg* (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent's legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent's reach.",

				"",
				"*Attention Grabber* (Perform 5 ranks, Bluff 5 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): Your loud or discordant performance covers your allies' movements. Creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you play an instrument take a -2 penalty on Perception checks, other than Perception checks made in response to your actions, for as long as you play.",
				"",
				"*Goad Animal* (Handle Animal 5 ranks or Animal Affinity): You can use your soothing performance to handle an animal that is friendly toward you, such as a mount or pet. When playing your instrument, commanding the animal to perform a trick it knows is a free action, and pushing it to perform a trick it does not know is a standard action. If you already can make an animal respond more quickly, such as with the link ability of an animal companion, this trick provides no benefit.",
				"",
				"*Jaw-Dropping Distraction* (Perform 7 ranks, Bluff 7 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): When using your instrument, you can attempt a Perform check instead of a Bluff check to feint an opponent. If you succeed, the creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against one target of your choosing (other than you) until the beginning of your next turn. Once you have used this trick against a creature, whether or not you succeeded at the check, you cannot use this trick to feint the creature for 24 hours. Creatures with uncanny dodge are immune to this trick.",
				"",
				"*Play to the Crowd* (Perform 3 ranks, Diplomacy 3 ranks or bardic performance or raging song class feature): You can use Perform, rather than Diplomacy, to improve an NPC's initial attitude toward you as long as you are able to perform for at least 1 minute. You cannot use this trick to increase the NPC's attitude beyond friendly.",
				"",
				"*Ruffian's Riff* (Catch Off-Guard): You can treat a musical instrument as an improvised weapon with the performance special feature. When you use a masterwork musical instrument as an improvised weapon, you treat it as a masterwork weapon (adding a +1 enhancement bonus on your attack rolls). Your attacks with a magical musical instrument are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",

				"*Musk Poison* (poison use class ability): You can apply Kaava musk to a melee or thrown weapon as if it were a poison. This makes your weapon reek in the normal manner. However, the first creature struck by your weapon also gains the musk-stink as if it were splashed by a full container of musk 2 days ago. The struck target can wash off the musk on the next round in the normal manner, but otherwise it continues to stink for 2 more days. Kaava musk applied to small items like ammunition has no effect.",
				"",
				"*Musk Sickening* (Sickening Critical): When using Kaava musk as a thrown weapon, increase the duration of the sickening critical effect by 1 minute.",
				"",
				"*Reactive Splashing* (Improved Disarm): When disarming an opponent of a flask of Kaava musk, you can have the flask break at your opponent's feet, automatically splashing him with the musk.",
				"",
				"*Splashproof Shield* (Shield Focus): If you are using a shield and are hit with Kaava musk, you can make a Reflex save to use the shield to prevent any of the musk from touching you (thus, if you drop the shield, you do not have any of the musk penalties). The DC for this ability is 10 if using a tower shield, 15 for a heavy shield, 20 for a light shield, and 25 for a buckler. You cannot use this trick if you are flat-footed or helpless.",

This improved oil can only be used in the lamp or lantern it's mixed in and has no additional special effects.",

				"*Lesser Light* (no additional prerequisites): When lighting a lamp or lantern, you reduce the size of its flame to provide only dim light in the area in which the lantern usually provides normal light. The lamp or lantern uses oil at half the usual rate. The lamp or lantern must be extinguished and re-lit to shed light normally.",
				"",
				"*Oil Splash* (Improved Dirty Trick): You can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver against an opponent while either you or the opponent is holding a lamp or lantern.

Make a melee attack against an AC of 10. If you hit, and if a creature you cannot see is in the designated area, you deal no damage but have successfully pinpointed the creature's current location.",

				"*Wall Climb* (Climb 3 ranks): You can climb narrow passageways if your pole can reach a wall or other solid surface on both sides, bracing yourself and scooting the pole further along the surface as you climb. This method is reliable but laborious; you gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Climb checks to climb in this manner, but you climb at half the usual speed.",

If you are falling, this is treated as an attempt to catch yourself while falling made with a +10 bonus, but there must be some sort of solid anchor available for your rope to loop around. When attempting this check on another creature, treat it as if you yourself were falling. If the weight of the creature exceeds twice your heavy load limit (your own equipment does not count against this maximum), you are pulled after it.",

				"*Break Ground* (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent's feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone.

Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature's gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.",

				"*Ricochet Shield* (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything): When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a -2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.",

				"*Shield Gag* (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything): You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you both lose the grappled condition, though your shield remains in its mouth.

You gain a +2 bonus on the combat maneuver check, and you take a -2 penalty to your AC until the start of your second turn.",

				"*Hurl Splash Weapon* (Far Shot, Throw Anything): You can fling a splash weapon with your sling to great effect.

Sighted creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst of the sunrod must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 2d4 rounds. Creatures with light sensitivity or light blindness receive a -2 penalty on their saving throws. Alternatively, as a full-round action, you can strike a creature with the sunrod or throw the sunrod as a ranged attack with a range increment of 10 feet. When it strikes a hard surface, it flares as describe above. Since you don't have to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at the corner of particular 5-foot square. Treat the target corner as AC 5. If a creature is struck by the sunrod and fails its Fortitude save, it is blinded for the first round of its dazzled condition.",

				"*Like the Sun* (ability to cast any spell with the light descriptor): You can use a sunrod as an additional material component for any spell that bears the light descriptor.

				"",
				"*Lure* (Handle Animal 5 ranks): As a move action while holding a lit sunrod in your hand, you can attempt to move an animal in any direction you desire. Make a Handle Animal check against a DC of 15 + the target animal's CR. If you are successful, the animal moves 5 feet in the desired direction on its next turn. For every 5 points by which your check exceeds the DC, the animal moves another 5 feet, up to the animal's maximum speed. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, though if one is taken, the animal immediately stops moving (whether or not the attack hits). You cannot move an animal into an obvious hazard with this trick, but you can (for example) lure it into an open cage.",
				"",
				"*Twice as Brightly* (Craft [alchemy] 5 ranks): As full-round action, you can tamper with an unused sunrod such that it burns out in a single hour, but shines much more brightly. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by two steps for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes normal light, and dim light or normal light becomes bright light). It does not increase the light level in bright light.",

Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can't take 10 or 20 on this check.

When coupled with the necessary reflection and meditation, this reckoning takes 1 hour per day to perform. Once you have performed your order's reckoning, you gain the benefit of a special ability as indicated in the Reckoning entry for the Hellknight order to which you've sworn allegiance. If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by the Hellknight order. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the Hellknight order's second boon.

Due to the dilution, a murky spell has only one-tenth of the duration of a normal spell (generally 1 minute per level, though mind fog lasts 3 minutes), but this reduction doesn't affect the duration of secondary effects like mind fog's mental penalties. Abilities that see through mist and fog can't see through a murky spell unless they also specifically see through murky water (like the mistsight universal monster rule). Instead of wind, currents can disperse a murky spell; any current with a speed of at least 10 feet disperses a murky spell in 1 round. A murky spell has no effect above the water.

Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within).",

				"Age: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp.",
				"",
				"Flavor: As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of [Desna](faith:desna) might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way."
