Each day upon waking, a successful DC 14 Fortitude save means that no headaches are suffered that day; otherwise, the victim takes a -1 penalty on all Dexterity- and Intelligence-based skill checks and on attack rolls. Any amount of magical healing can remove this effect for the day. A greater danger rises when the victim is confronted with a stressful situation (such as combat, disarming a trap, or otherwise engaging in risky activity). Whenever a victim takes any action in such a situation other than to attack a creature with a melee weapon, she becomes sickened for the remainder of the round. A victim who is sickened for 3 consecutive rounds in this manner becomes confused for 1 round (after which the count of consecutive rounds of being sickened resets)."
