The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll.

The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as [programmed image](spell:programmed_image)), but actually turns invisible (as [invisibility](spell:invisibility)) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer."

			"**Mental Fallback** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source:occult_adventures)): Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by [charm monster](spell:charm_monster) cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself."

Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light."

The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits.

			"**Spell Anticipation** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source:occult_adventures)): The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it."
