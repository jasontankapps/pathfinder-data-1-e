Adding new trinkets has the same cost and time requirement as adding formulae to a formula book. An antiquarian can study a wizard's spellbook or alchemist's formula book to learn formulae, but an antiquarian's trinket collection is too esoteric for anyone except another antiquarian to learn spells from. An antiquarian prepares spells by meditating and charging relics with supernatural power, which has the same requirements and limitations as preparing extracts. However, instead of creating extracts, an antiquarian casts spells as though he were an arcane spellcaster, which means he can affect other creatures with his spells. An antiquarian does not suffer from arcane spell failure.",

Fetters rely on the magical resonance of creatures capable of casting spells (spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities) which saturates even their hair and clothing. Fetters cannot target a creature with no magical ability. The malice binder knows one fetter at 1st level and gains another at 4th level and every 2 levels thereafter.",

An investigator can obtain a single token in any of the following ways: a successful Sleight of Hand check against an unsuspecting target, a successful steal combat maneuver, or a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the creature's CR) to search an area his target occupied for at least 2 hours. Malice binders can search such a location for additional tokens, but each subsequent Perception check increases the DC by 5, regardless of success or failure. Tokens rely on the magic that clings to spellcasters and creatures with spell-like abilities; they must be carefully preserved as soon as they are recovered and before they can be used. Preparing a token requires a move action, and a malice binder can maintain one prepared token per class level. Each token can be used only to power a fetter targeting the creature it came from, and it is consumed in the process. At 7th level, the malice binder can instead prepare a token as a swift action.",

This fetter deafens or silences the target for 1 round per 2 class levels (minimum 1 round). Silenced creatures cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, but they are otherwise unrestricted from making sounds.

Once activated, this fetter forces its target to spend twice the normal amount of movement to approach the fetter while within range of its effect; it does not affect the target's ability to move away. At 11th level, the fetter's target cannot physically approach within 10 feet of the fetter, as if affected by a repulsion spell. This fetter remains active for 1 minute per class level and can be handed to another creature or left somewhere to ward against a witch's entry. A target can overcome this effect with a successful Will saving throw when the fetter is first activated.",

This fetter grants a +2 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from the creature that caused the original wound, which is treated as the fetter's target for the purposes of how often it can be used. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the deflection bonus to AC increases by 1, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. This fetter is painful to whom it protects, sickening the protected creature while the fetter remains in effect.",

			"**Shackle (Su):** Binding a token to manacles or a length of rope causes the restraints to fly out and entangle the target. A target can avoid this fetter with a successful Reflex save. An entangled target can attempt to escape as a standard action with either an Escape Artist check or a combat maneuver check using the same DC as the initial saving throw. Using masterwork manacles in this fetter increases the escape DC by 2.",

			"**Temptation (Su):** Anointing a token with incense or scented oils creates a supernaturally appealing object to attract a target's attention. Once activated, this fetter lasts for 1 minute per class level.

This effect ends immediately if the target picks up the fetter or the fetter moves more than 30 feet plus 5 feet per 2 levels away from the target. At 11th level, the fetter fascinates its target once picked up, affecting it as if by the spell hypnotism for 1 round per class level; this fetter is not limited by the target's Hit Dice.",

For this fetter, a binder can use a clear footprint as a token; finding an appropriate footprint requires a successful Survival skill check to track the target.",
