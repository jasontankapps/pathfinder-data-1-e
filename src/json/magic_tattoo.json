The tattoo is a silent, spell completion item that only the bearer can activate. It vanishes when activated. A spell tattoo must be visible to the bearer and must be touched as part of its activation. These magical tattoos are not normally placed on the head, neck, or back as a result, since most creatures would require mirrors to activate them. A spell tattoo's aura and caster level varies as per the scroll it emulates. A spell tattoo has a market price four times as much as an equivalent scroll.",
