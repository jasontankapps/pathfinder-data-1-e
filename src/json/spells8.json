Others, such as [kasathas](race/kasatha) and other alien races, are not true natives of Golarion and thus lack the \"spiritual weight\" needed to be included in a table of reincarnation possibilities.

The target doesn't mention anything about the secret and doesn't remember telling you it has a secret.

Unconscious air-breathing creatures caught in the area immediately begin to drown, but other air-breathing creatures can hold their breath while in the cylinder. Movement through the cylinder at normal speed requires a successful DC 10 Swim check (otherwise, creatures move at one-quarter speed). If conjured in an area with insufficient room for the entire cylinder, the cylinder attains its maximum possible size. It retains its shape in defiance of gravity for the spell's duration, and any creature can enter or exit the cylinder's sides as easily as stepping into or out of a pool of ordinary water. The water disappears at the end of the spell's duration, so creatures swimming in the water immediately fall to the ground."

If your roll equals or exceeds a creature's CMD, that creature is knocked prone. This trip attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity (though you do provoke one for casting the spell), nor are you knocked prone if you fail the check by 10 or more. Unlike with a regular trip attack, you can trip any creature touching the ground, regardless of size. [Improved Trip](feat/improved_trip) does not affect this spell in any way. Though the earthquake is small and focused on the ground, if the area is particularly unstable, the spell might cause items to topple, stones to shake loose from the walls or ceiling, and so on at the GM's discretion."

A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings.

Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend.

The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature's choice.

This spell binds a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge. The tome weighs 10 pounds and has one page for every day of the subject's life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject's appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory-including those the target may have forgotten long ago-are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in excruciating detail in the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn't understand, that dialogue is reproduced phonetically, and must be translated by a reader who knows that language. Any alterations to a subject's memories-such as by a modify memory spell -appear in a subtly different script; a successful DC 35 Linguistics check is needed to identify this.",
