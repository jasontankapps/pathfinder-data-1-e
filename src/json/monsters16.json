A leechroot is driven solely by an insatiable thirst for blood. It hides among undergrowth and below the earth while waiting for unwary prey. With its razor-sharp roots, a leechroot slashes at anything that comes its way, snatching victims and feeding directly from their wounds. The absorbed blood mutates into a thick, dark-red sap that runs through the leechroot and oozes from its unhallowed body, helping to heal and sustain the predatory creature.",

They often steal something of worth from adventurers just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume. They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they've stolen, slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The exception is gold-leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret, hidden places. It is rumored that a person who finds a gold coin in the forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a wish as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumors are false-likely perpetuated by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them gold.",

Leviathan can disjoin an existing spell effect by biting it, although doing so exposes Leviathan to the spell's effect as it bites. Likewise, Leviathan can attempt to disjoin a magic item by biting it. On a hit, the item must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be permanently destroyed-note that even if the disjunction doesn't destroy the item, the damage dealt by Leviathan's bite might be sufficient to destroy the item. Leviathan's disjoining bite cannot destroy artifacts. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Eye Beams (Su)** As a standard action, Leviathan can fire prismatic beams of rippling light from its hundred eyes out to a range of 1,000 feet. While Leviathan cannot target a single creature with more than one eye beam at a time, it can split its 100 beams any way it wants against visible targets in range. When Leviathan attacks with its eye beams, it must make a ranged touch attack with a +37 bonus to hit a target. On a hit, a creature must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or its mind is emptied, becoming affected as if by feeblemind, and its thoughts are drawn into Leviathan's own mind. As long as Leviathan is active, this effect can be removed only via miracle or wish; if Leviathan is defeated and forced into its comatose state (see Recovery below), the feeblemind effect can be cured as normal. Once a creature succeeds at a save against Leviathan's eye beams, it is immune to the eye beams for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Flight (Su)** Leviathan's ability to \"swim\" through the air is treated as a supernatural form of flight.",
			"",
			"**Hurl Foe (Ex)** When Leviathan damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its natural attacks, it can attempt a combat maneuver check to hurl the foe as part of that attack. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of Leviathan's choice and falls prone. The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which Leviathan's check result exceeds the foe's CMD. If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining, and the foe is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.",
			"",
			"**Inhalation (Ex)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Leviathan can inhale a massive amount of water, affecting an 80-foot-long cone. Huge or smaller creatures within this area of effect must each succeed at a DC 44 Reflex save to avoid being drawn into Leviathan's maw and automatically swallowed whole. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Labyrinthine Innards (Su)** Creatures swallowed by Leviathan find themselves separated from all other swallowed creatures in a twisting maze of passages within the Tane's digestive system. A swallowed creature can move freely through this fleshy maze and takes no damage from being swallowed, but it can't damage Leviathan from within if it attempts to escape. Instead, swallowed creatures must find an exit via one of the monster's hundred tear ducts by succeeding at a DC 20 Intelligence check as a full-round action, similar to maze. Teleportation effects do not function inside of Leviathan.",
			"",
			"**Massive (Ex)** Because Leviathan is so massive, it treats terrain features that form difficult terrain as normal terrain, though immense features like cities or forests still function as difficult terrain for the monster. A Huge or smaller creature can move through squares occupied by Leviathan and vice versa. Leviathan can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Leviathan gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It is possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Leviathan-this requires a successful DC 30 Climb check, and unlike the normal rules regarding Leviathan and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs Leviathan's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.",
			"",
			"**Pierce Immunities (Ex)** Leviathan ignores all forms of damage reduction when it attacks a foe with its natural weapons, including DR/epic and DR/-.",
			"",
			"**Planar Acclimation (Ex)** Leviathan is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.",
			"",
			"**Recovery (Ex)** At the end of its turn, Leviathan can automatically shake off any one adverse condition other than dead. If it is affected by multiple adverse conditions, it chooses which one to end that round. Should Leviathan be slain, it is instead transported across time and space to a hidden spot in the First World's oceans at a point 1d100 years in the future, fully recovered but immobile. Leviathan awakens a century after the date of its \"death,\" but if its immobile body is discovered before it wakes from this deathlike state, it can be killed forever.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The mighty Leviathan is the most powerful of the Tane, a group of destructive servitors of the Eldest. Left to its own devices, Leviathan remains in a slumber lasting for millennia or spends its waking time singing in the vast deeps of the First World's oceans. But the Eldest's planar upheavals, whims, or the ill-advised aggression of fools can arouse Leviathan as a weapon of devastation. Once awakened, Leviathan leaves cities and even entire nations destroyed in its planar wake, though it preserves the thoughts and memories of many of the fallen within its own mind, composing elegies to the lost. Some lucky few are spared Leviathan's wrath by gaining refuge within Zanziveil, the City of the Spared, a resplendent city of refugees ruled by a mysterious masked woman named Zizipal. Zanziveil itself exists in a strange demiplane accessible only via Leviathan's labyrinthine entrails, and many believe that Zizipal is a manifestation of Leviathan's remorse and curiosity.",
			"",
			"Over the eons, Leviathan has visited countless Material Plane worlds. Although often little remains physically of those Leviathan destroys, tales of the gargantuan creature's visits have a way of enduring in a society's oral history. As a result, many otherwise unconnected worlds share curiously similar mythologies of ancient cities or civilizations being destroyed by the legendary creature.",

These \"dreamers\" had become intimately attuned to Liavara's dense network of ley lines, which lulled them into a persistent meditative trance. The few taken back to Bretheda, however, have proven that the dreamers can attune to any planet's ley lines. Anyone who attempts to make mental contact with them may find himself lulled into the same trance the dreamers experience. For the most part, the dreamers seem content merely to drift along the ley lines, but awakening them from the lines' peaceful melodies spurs most dreamers into violent furies. Brethedans as a whole have treated their cousins respectfully-almost reverently-granting them ample space in which to meander and feed."

The soul remains trapped within the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life.

Absent the vitality of the soul, such a lich's physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the lich's skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the lich's remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the lich's intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the lich's will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than any steel. The lich's greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the lich's eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from any defiling its final rest.",

Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich's possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich's slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its [wail of the banshee](spell/wail_of_the_banshee) before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough to flee.",
			"",

			"",
			"Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a lich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the lich's body decays, the lich's intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the lich's consciousness, keeping the lich trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the lich's remains are destroyed or scattered (for example, by wandering adventurers), the lich's phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the lich to life. But if the lich's remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery's magic fails catastrophically, releasing the lich's soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the lich, allowing the last remnants of the lich's soul to transform it into a demilich. The lich's soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever.",
			"",
			"For wandering liches, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the lich spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the lich's body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the lich tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the lich's phylactery fail before the wandering lich returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the lich's mind is doomed to wander until the end of days.",

Such creatures are awakened demiliches, and combine the powers and near-invulnerability of a demilich with the mind and spellcasting prowess of a lich. An awakened demilich has the full spellcasting abilities of the lich it was before, and gains Eschew Materials and Still Spell as bonus feats. Awakened liches keep their original lich Hit Dice, and any mental attributes that are higher than the demilich's minimums. They otherwise have all the special abilities and defenses of a demilich except torpor, and no abilities of the original lich beyond spellcasting and mental attributes. An awakened demilich has a CR of 16, or the CR of the original lich + 3, whichever is higher."

			"In these sorrowful cases, the process traps the soul of the would-be lich outside a phylactery that will not accept it and a body that has rejected it. The potent arcane forces tampered with by the lich's failed creation also find themselves unleashed but uncontrolled, surrounding the newly formed abomination, empowering it but also slowly consuming its essence.",
			"",
			"This creature, known as a forsaken lich, is granted the undeath it sought in life, but in a terrifyingly temporary fashion. For the miscalculations of its ambitions, the creature's once-vibrant body shrivels and decays like that of a lich, but becomes a lifeless shell manipulated by the malicious soul and unchecked magical storm that envelop it, forces that control the corpse's actions almost like a marionette. Yet this doom is temporary for nearly all who attempt this foul transition. With the soul unbound from the body and both spirit and corpse exposed to destructive arcane tides, both are slowly eroded. After 1d10 days, the forsaken lich's body and soul are both consumed like a lit candle, eventually reduced physically to ashes, and spiritually to nothing-its essence utterly annihilated, scoured from existence for all time."

An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so. These limitations are purely psychological, and if pressed (such as by an enemy seeking to use a tomb entrance as a defense), a cairn linnorm can break such restrictions.",

The creature's head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through water and ice holes.",
			"",
			"A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years.",
			"",
			"Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins, but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite dwelling in water, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting through rivers and waterways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects prey above. A gare linnorm's breath weapon is similarly linked to this internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature's serpentine body pass water through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en route to the linnorm's mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the water through a series of muscular chambers that turn the water into a gout of steam hot enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between the inside of the linnorm's mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward and, because of the linnorm's magical nature, achieves an almost solid state, hampering movement throughout its area.",
			"",
			"In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm's fangs are infused with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist's fire. Meanwhile the poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing the target's reflexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in.",
			"",
			"Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwater creatures don't provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves when such creatures come to the water's edge to drink or cross. When hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through ice or emerges from the water. It bites first to poison its prey, then strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it into the water, where any creature affected by the linnorm's poison soon drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring another while others burn within the dragon's steaming breath. After feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riverbed dens to sleep, often for days at a time.",

			"Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm's territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000 square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead, after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lake or section of river. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard until the water refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it deep in the mud and silt of a riverbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency. Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females producing an egg just once every century.",
			"",
			"Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface of the water. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than the giant's entire clan."

This primordial wildlife is of such size that a waking sea linnorm rarely concerns itself with having to roam far for a fulfilling meal. After eating, a sea linnorm hibernates for years, or even centuries, at a time. In some instances, entire aquatic settlements spring to life near the hidden lair of a sea linnorm, only to incur the beast's excessive wrath when it awakens from its slumber. Some of these unfortunately placed settlements even adjust their entire societies to provide for \"their\" linnorms, shepherding schools of fish toward the beasts' lairs and, in harder times, encouraging visitors to visit the linnorms' dens.",

Those few settlements permitted to exist within a sea linnorm's domain are used as early warning systems; each settlement is seeded with traditions of alerting the great linnorm to the presence of potentially threatening outsiders or of certain types of aquatic alphapredator life-forms, such as krakens, luscas, or sea serpents. A sea linnorm immediately seeks out intruders, recognizing that it will either triumph or die-better to be slain fighting in the open water than cornered in its lair.",

As the king crossed the Arcadian Ocean on his way to the mystical paradise of Valenhall, Fahrstad is said to have leapt without uttering a word from the side of his longship into the depths of the ocean. For 3 days and 3 nights, his entourage waited. On daybreak of the fourth day, Elgar Fahrstad emerged from the sea, accompanied by a ride of eight valkyries and the severed head of a sea linnorm. A half-dozen skalds departed the expedition, forsaking the paradise of Valenhall so they could return to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and retell the final journey of King Fahrstad."

Although effects such as [remove blindness/deafness](spell/remove_blindness_deafness) can remove the blinded or deafened condition from a creature paralyzed by a litanu, this does not remove the paralysis. This ability is a necromancy and paralysis effect.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Litanus are undead abominations created by vile necromantic rituals and psychological torment. All litanus were once [merfolk](monster/merfolk), but were tortured to death and animated as undead creatures. Litanus are sneaky, spiteful creatures who seek prey suffering from loneliness and fear.",
			"",
			"Resembling merfolk that have hyperdeveloped musculature, litanus have wide mouths with narrow, sharklike teeth. Four tentacles sprout from a litanu's back, each a few inches wide and 4 feet long. These tentacles end in toothy maws and excrete a paralyzing toxin so powerful that victims are rendered insensible and unable to perform most autonomic functions, including breathing, until the toxin wears off.",
			"",
			"A litanu is about 7 feet long from head to tail and weighs around 300 pounds.",
			"",
			"Because litanus are created from merfolk subjected to horrifying tortures and necromantic infusions, they generally arise in underwater torture chambers or corpse pits. Although they have no need to hunt for sustenance, they derive a perverse joy from ambushing, paralyzing, and killing prey. Most litanus prefer to hunt intelligent prey, as complex feelings of isolation and desperation resonate with the undead creatures. Angry at their fate and resentful that their kin were spared it, litanus prefer merfolk as prey over all others. A hunting litanu might even allow non-merfolk to pass by unharmed if it believes that a little more patience might allow it an opportunity for merfolk prey instead.",
			"",
			"Litanus are immensely strong for their size, and their long, toothed tentacles are exceedingly nimble. These tentacles are grafted to a litanu's body in the final part of the reanimation ritual, rather than spontaneously grown. Litanus are protective of their tentacles, taking care to keep them clean and prevent them from becoming tangled together as the undead swim or fight.",
			"",
			"Despite their strength, litanus are reluctant to attack humanoids that are traveling in packs, preferring to use traps or trickery to scatter groups so they can attack the isolated individuals one by one. If given time to prepare, a litanu might set a harmless trap that triggers a large spray of mud, sand, or another material that temporarily obscures visibility in the water. When the trap is triggered and the members of the group are disoriented and blinded, the litanu sneaks forward, paralyzes the nearest target, and swims away while its victim is incapacitated. To draw a single target away from a group or community, a litanu might stake down a small sea creature into the seabed and wound it sufficiently so that it cries out in pain. The litanu hides nearby, ready to ambush an individual that comes to aid the suffering creature. Not all litanu tricks are so complex; some litanus simply lurk out of sight and make quiet rhythmic tapping sounds to draw the more curious members of a group to investigate, slipping away if too many come to investigate together.",
			"",
			"Although any isolated creature suffering from fear or loneliness is a delicacy for a litanu, most litanus attempt to exacerbate feelings of dread and isolation as much as possible before feeding. A litanu might drag a victim into the deep, dark ocean waters-not so deep as to kill their prey outright from cold or water pressure, but deep enough to amplify the victim's fear and suffering. When the victim's feelings of terror and isolation are at their peak, the litanu finally kills its prey with slow, deliberate bites from its tentacles.",
			"",
			"Once a litanu slays its victim, it usually loses interest in the corpse. The litanu might steal any valuables or trinkets from the body but otherwise leaves it to drift away on the ocean currents. A litanu does not value this plunder for its own sake, but it collects items, such as shiny necklaces or colorful baubles, that might be useful in luring away future victims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Litanus live underwater and prefer the seclusion of dark ocean waters. Unaffected by cold or water pressure, they can be found in deep ocean trenches. From there, they range into brighter, shallower waters to hunt for prey. If a litanu's prey escapes onto land, the litanu is unlikely to pursue; although litanus can propel themselves on land by using their tails and tentacles if necessary, they prefer to remain in the water.",
			"",
			"To merfolk, litanus are terrifying bogeymen that lurk in the deep, set traps to catch the unwary, and drag their victims away. Fortunately, litanus are rare, so most merfolk have never seen one; some merfolk believe that they don't even exist, and were invented to explain away strange disappearances or half-glimpsed natural predators such as octopuses. Those merfolk who have met a litanu (or worse, have been terrorized by a litanu that arose from the corpse of a friend or relative) know firsthand the fear and carnage even a single litanu can create.",
			"",
			"Litanus are sufficiently rare as to normally be solitary; a litanu might hunt for decades without meeting another of its kind. On the rare occasions when litanus do find each other-or when they are created alongside each other- they gather into small gangs called schools. Litanus are selfish by nature, so this tendency to congregate is unusual and perhaps due to some dimly instinctual sociability from their merfolk heritage. Even so, litanus don't work well together. They might initially discuss building complicated traps or agree to divide up spoils in an equitable fashion, but each litanu considers itself more worthy than the others. They therefore subtly sabotage each other's traps, secretly steal one another's victims, and even interfere with attacks, purely out of malice. Litanu schools inevitably come to blows after a few weeks or even days, leaving only the strongest litanu as a survivor. Only a powerful master, such as a necromancer or mighty aquatic undead creature, can compel them to cooperate with each other on a long-term basis."

It can attack creatures only by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living cave painting can crawl onto solid objects that can then themselves be moved through other means. It cannot fall or take falling damage, and it cannot use or be affected by combat maneuvers such as bull rush, grapple, or trip. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment. It has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight.

			"Little is known of the primitive tribes that preceded the great mortal civilizations of the Age of Legends. They possessed no written language and built few lasting structures, so little of their culture exists to this day. Yet some evidence of these ancient peoples can be found, hidden away in deep, remote caves protected from the ravages of time. The simple paintings and sculptures found in these caves speak to the primal roots of the human experience, and they're treasured in the modern world as pieces of art nearly as much as they are considered historical artifacts. Yet those who wish to explore these caverns or retrieve such relics must be cautious. Ancient guardians haunt the dark places in the earth, hiding among the paintings, waiting to strike down those foolish enough to disturb their millennia-long rest.",
			"",
			"These guardians are the living cave paintings, ancient works of art animated by strange magic at the dawn of human civilization. They lack true bodies, and instead exist as two-dimensional beings painted across cave walls in ocher and charcoal. Living cave paintings most often depict herd animals such as aurochs, bison, horses, or rhinoceroses, or megafauna such as megaloceros that forms herds. Some others depict predatory creatures, human figures, or even animal-human hybrids.",
			"",
			"A living cave painting's temperament and behavior seem to depend on the type of creature (or creatures) it is painted to resemble. While all living cave paintings are aggressive to some extent, those that portray bison or horses tend to be less violent and less predatory in nature than those that depict lions or bears. Likewise, living cave paintings illustrated to represent herd animals often group together, while those showing solitary creatures generally eschew the company of their own kind. It is a mistake, however, to assume that a living cave painting is merely a two-dimensional version of some common animal. Even those that represent prey animals have sharp predatory instincts, and many an explorer has met a grisly end after disregarding a living cave painting of a peaceful herd animal.",
			"",
			"Though they require no food or drink to survive, living cave paintings can consume small amounts of material-usually blood, ash, or stone pigments such as ocher. They seem to absorb these materials directly into their two-dimensional bodies, growing darker or more vivid as they do so. Living cave paintings sometimes accept such materials as offerings, allowing creatures who present them with such gifts to pass unharmed into the caverns they protect, though their tolerance is tenuous and short-lived even in the best of situations.",
			"",
			"Scholars aren't sure whether living cave paintings age. Some living cave paintings seem to have existed for thousands of years without losing any potency or vitality, while others have grown faint and restive with age. It is even possible that apparently mundane cave paintings were once living cave paintings that either died or now simply lack the will or ability to move.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living cave paintings reside deep in the earth, in places of sacred significance to the primitive cultures that created cave art during Golarion's primordial times. Living cave paintings in these caverns attack intruders out of some bestial territorial instinct rather than cruel spite or random violence. No matter how extensive the cave system it occupies might be, a living cave painting typically treats only the areas of its cave decorated with cave art as its territory. It generally ignores raw, unadorned areas, though it may pursue intruders into these areas if it feels they are still a threat.",
			"",
			"In addition to the cave itself, living cave paintings are extremely protective of the mundane paintings and sculptures that cover the walls of their cavernous homes. Explorers who damage or deface such ancient works of art, whether accidentally or intentionally, are sure to draw the ire of any nearby living cave paintings. Such behavior suggests that living cave paintings were first created to be guardians for these sacred places, and continue to act out this role long after the cultures that created them have died out.",
			"",
			"While many living cave paintings are ancient, specimens can sometimes be found in more recent sites. Some living cave paintings can be found in caverns near the surface that were occupied by orcs during the Age of Darkness, and even more recently in caves inhabited by modern Kellid or Shoanti tribes not that far back in Avistan's past. It's not clear whether the living cave paintings found in these places migrated to younger sites from older caves, or newer cave art also has the potential to transform into living cave paintings. Some believe (albeit without evidence) that shamans among some remote tribes still preserve the ageold secret to creating new living cave paintings."

A creature that begins its turn engulfed takes 6d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude saving throw or be slowed (as per the spell [slow](spell/slow)). This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the living doldrums' space and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.

			"",
			"**Stagnant Aura (Su)** The air within 240 feet of a living doldrums is always still. Naturally occurring winds flow around this radius without disturbing anything inside (though precipitation falls as normal). Mundane attempts to create airflow within the aura (such as with a fan) are only half as strong as normal. Air elementals, gaseous creatures, and winged creatures (other than living doldrums) have their maneuverability reduced by one category within the aura.

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When people imagine elementals that thrive on the Plane of Air, they are most likely to think of the spirits of rushing wind and thundering storm, but not all air elementals are so dynamic. Living doldrums are elementals that embody stagnant air. Those who can see invisible creatures describe the living doldrums as a cloud roughly 20 feet in diameter that resembles a knotted snake with a head at both ends. The scent of stale air lingers around a living doldrums, even if one only recently arrived to the area.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Living doldrums project an aura of unmoving air that lures those seeking shelter from the wind or becalms those who rely on wind to travel. Once it has them trapped, the living doldrums torments its victims until they eventually kill themselves or one other. Though they do not need to eat in the traditional sense, scholars believe that living doldrums derive from their victims some sort of psychic sustenance that enables them to become more powerful.",
			"",
			"The most dangerous aspect of these predators is their natural invisibility. They avoid direct conflict with their victims, many of which die unaware that either the dead calm of the air or the desperate actions of their allies were anything other than natural. Only when victims become aware of the living doldrums's influence-whether through magical means or mundane deduction-and take action against it does the elemental resort to physical attacks. It may be that it is the madness and not the death of its victims that feeds the living doldrums, or perhaps it merely serves them as cruel entertainment. Creatures immune to mind control are of little interest to the living doldrums, though it might use its powers to turn others against those that it can't affect directly.",
			"",
			"Though living doldrums are resistant to many physical attacks, magic that creates wind or loud noises is especially harmful to the elementals. Spellcasters are thus often the first target of the living doldrums' mind-controlled victims. Even mundane noises are an annoyance to a living doldrums (especially percussion and wind instruments), though they cause it no damage, leading some who know of living doldrums to believe that loud or discordant music drives them off. In practice, though, this tactic is more likely to cause the elemental to physically attack the musicians, making it a dangerous but effective way to draw the creature into revealing itself.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living doldrums are native to the Plane of Air, where hey haunt trade routes, feeding on unwary or ignorant travelers until put to flight by more powerful creatures (such as a combined force of djinn). On occasion, they slip into the Material Plane, often through temporary portals located in the eyes of hurricanes and tornadoes. Living doldrums are most often found at sea and consider sailing ships a favorite target-once trapped within the elementals' aura, sailors can do little to escape their fate. Away from the water, living doldrums make their lairs in desolate locations, such as desert oases and mountain valleys, preying on those who seek refuge there.",
			"",
			"Though most living doldrums are concerned only with their own desires, some revere [Hshurha](faith/hshurha), the elemental lord of air. These pious elementals see their actions as an extension of their god's mission to rid the multiverse of solid and visible creatures. It is rumored that a number of living doldrums serve Hshurha directly. These loyal spies gather intelligence for the Duchess of All Winds, and when necessary they use their powers to kill her enemies while making it look like death from natural causes or the work of others. These assassins would certainly have additional Hit Dice and mental powers unknown to other living doldrums."

			"Resting among countless tribes across the world are strange icons and statues dedicated to the memories of ancient leaders or spiritual guides. Sometimes such figures hide greater intellects, inhabiting essences that watch over nearby settlements. Known as living effigies, these stone statues are possessed by the spirits of deceased chieftains and shamans who managed to partially cheat death by imparting a portion of their souls into stone images. Each living effigy is unique in its features-some resemble the heads of great giants, while others are busts of other creatures. Twin gems are embedded in the eyes of each living effigy; they glow a vibrant color whenever the statue uses one of its many magical abilities.",
			"",
			"A living effigy's personality is as unique as its countenance, as the souls inhabiting the massive stones range from kind protectors wishing to continue their vigil over a settlement to brutal tyrants wishing only to reign past death. A living effigy stands 15 feet tall and weighs 40 tons.",
			"",
			"Despite sharing most of the traits common to other constructs, living effigies are sentient creatures that possess a portion of an inhabiting soul's intellect. Spells and abilities possessed by the originating soul are lost in the transfer, though some knowledge from the soul's past life remains. In addition to possessing this knowledge, the living effigy takes on the personal characteristics of the spirit that possesses it. In most cases, this directly impacts its alignment. The longer an effigy exists, though, the more detached it becomes from material concerns, eventually adopting an impartial stance on most subjects.",
			"",
			"Much of a living effigy's existence is spent in unassuming silence, watching over the settlement around it. Unable to move (save for a limited means of supernatural travel that typically draws unwanted attention) these effigies often learn to appreciate their isolation. Preferring that others see them as nothing more than ordinary sculptures, living effigies act only when their settlements are in danger. Should someone seek to harm it or its people, an effigy uses its charming gaze or its calm emotions spell-like ability to ease the anger of enemies and members of the settlement. Though effigies rarely issue direct commands, their gaze make the weak-willed see them in a positive light.",
			"",
			"Though living effigies can speak, they rarely do so. Instead, the constructs prefer to rely on their mystical abilities to communicate with those nearby. Their most common means of direct communication are its dream and nightmare spell-like abilities. Living effigies use these abilities to intrude on the sleeping minds of leaders to influence the direction of their settlements. In situations where approval or rejection is necessary, the effigy uses its stone shape spell-like ability to alter its facial expression to an appropriate emotion.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Transferring from a body of flesh to a monument of stone is a trauma that takes a spirit some time to recover from. It takes a living effigy a full week to learn its various abilities, and even after this initial adjustment, the spirit still needs to cope with the solitary nature of its new existence. Cut off from the sensations it once had, a living effigy learns to rely on the surface thoughts of those nearby and minor interaction through dreams. Its eye gems can attract unwanted attention when it uses its charming gaze, but can't be removed until the construct is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Settlements guided by living effigies are typically found in remote locations, away from the administration of governments or the intervention of outside agencies. Because of their nature as silent watchers, such effigies are most commonly found in far-flung communities in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, where they are treated as honored ancestors, and in the wilds of the Mwangi Expanse, where they are sometimes seen as ancestral spirit gods. Worshipers of most deities find the idea of a living effigy worrying, especially if the effigy's settlement has raised a pseudo-religion around the idol. While living effigies aren't technically undead, Pharasmin priests in particular have problems with them and often oppose them once their true nature is discovered, heedless of the protection and aid the living effigies offer to their communities.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"The construction of the stone effigy requires an appropriate amount of stone (at least 40 tons' worth) and a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. If the crafter fails the check, the stone is rendered useless for this purpose and a new block must be obtained. The creation of the effigy also requires two gems that are worth at least 500 gp each. A completed effigy acts as a soul receptacle, sucking in the intended target's soul as long as it dies within a mile of the inert statue. It takes the soul a full week to adjust to its new home, at which point the effigy animates and can use all of its abilities normally. During this transition period, the effigy remains a stone statue; it can be destroyed as normal or by removing or destroying the eye gems. Other forms of living effigies can be made of bone, bronze, wood, or similar materials.",

They use their mutable forms to camouflage themselves-often changing texts with illusory script to lead adventurers into nearby traps or hazards, or lacing important sources of information with explosive runes and then striking at trespassers when they have triggered the dangerous glyphs. Immortal unless destroyed, the creatures do not need sustenance in a traditional sense, though, like their will-o--wisp cousins, they seem to feed on the terror and pain they induce in their victims. In addition to fear and pain, living runes feed on the written word (which they can erase through this consumption or leave unharmed).

For this reason, they prefer to haunt the fringes of civilization, where they may terrorize lesser creatures in this manner- particularly arcane spellcasters. They derive a sick pleasure from the mental and physical torture of humanoids; in particular, they enjoy cornering humanoids in debates and wrapping them in riddles with the promise of shared knowledge or information, before ultimately growing bored and attacking the intruders with their myriad abilities. Such communications always begin-in the living rune's unique form of communication-with scribbled inquiries trespassing creatures will understand, and this somewhat playful and innocuous introduction often draws explorers to their deaths when they assume they are conversing with some benign artificial intelligence. In instances becoming horrifically frequent, archivists have discovered previously unheard of colonies of living runes deep in the bowels of urban libraries and archives, hiding out for years in an attempt to learn more of modern civilization, with unknown motivations that may hold terrible consequences for civilized races.",

			"### Origins",
			"",
			"In the annals of recorded history, ancient texts mentioning living runes always seem to do so in relation to the forgotten goddess Lissala, leading scholars to believe that either the creatures served worshipers of the deity in some way, or were rewarded as gifts to particularly devout supplicants. Some even speculate that Lissala herself is responsible for the creation of living runes. Others conjecture that living runes have always been, and are among the universe's eldest creatures, having escaped from the lips of some primordial god when the first words of creation were uttered. Evidence seems to dispute both these claims-the creatures are known to spring up from the scribbled text and graffiti of magic-soured ruins or untriggered symbol spells long left to rot. Whatever the truth, these haughty creatures do not discuss their origins."

			"These lizards are mostly docile and shy away from attacking creatures larger than a cat or dog. Despite their shyness, they are ultimately curious creatures, and often approach bigger creatures simply to investigate. Of course, a giant gecko is more than capable of defending itself, biting creatures that react violently to the lizard when fleeing is not an option. Some humanoids train giant geckos as bestial guardians.",

A giant gecko measures 8 feet from nose to tail and weighs 120 pounds. Coloration among giant geckos can vary wildly, though most are some shade of green."

Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright.",
			"",
			"Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires.",
			"",
			"Though generally neutral, lizardfolks' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization's \"gifts,\" and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don't defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.",
			"",
			"The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet."

In many ways, tribes see them as living monuments to the lost greatness of their people, singing songs of an era when every lizardfolk was as large and impressive as the scion.",

At that point, the tribe holds a ceremony in which they present the newly titled lizard scion with a special war trident as a mark of status. These ancient tridents are never used by ordinary lizardfolk, and most have been handed down through their tribe for generations, sometimes sitting untouched for hundreds of years until the naming of a new lizard scion.",
			"",
			"Some lizard scions become great protectors and voices of wisdom among their people, leading a tribe to previously unknown accomplishments and stability within its hidden enclave. Others attempt to build alliances with other lizardfolk tribes or even unite two tribes into one. A tribe of lizardfolk being systematically pushed out of its ancestral territory, however, might see the coming of a lizard scion as a sign that war is imminent, and could be spurred to take up arms once and for all against the so-called \"civilized\" encroachers.",
			"",
			"There are rumors that deep in some jungles or swamps there live entire tribes of dinosaur-herding lizard scions that have bred true as a race, but such stories may be little more than the overactive imaginations of explorers and treasure hunters.",
			"",
			"Lizard scions average 10 feet in height and 500 pounds, though this can vary by tribe and age. Unlike boggard priest-kings, lizard scions are never fat, but rather hugely muscled specimens with excellent reflexes."

			"Revered members of the tribe, rattlers are the keepers of tradition and leaders of the sacred dances. They are the ones who remember the ancient songs of lizardfolk glory and use them to train the youth, educating each new generation in the practices and secrets that have kept their people safe in their swamps for millennia.",
			"",
			"Though called rattlers, these lizardfolk are as much storytellers as musicians, propagating the oral traditions of their people. As a result, they are valued as much for their wisdom as for their ability to bolster the tribe's hunters and warriors in combat-though this latter responsibility admittedly defines the role in which most other humanoid races encounter them. Though a rattler might or might not be the leader of a tribe, she is often asked to sit in judgment over internal conflicts, to act as an ambassador to other tribes, or to advise a tribe's chieftains and elders so that their decisions reflect the wisdom of the past.",
			"",
			"Lizardfolk rattlers are often tribal elders, but when youths show a propensity for bardic magic or a particular passion for the old stories and shamanistic rituals, a tribe's existing rattlers might choose to take them in and train them as the rattlers of the next generation. This practice is crucial, as it can take most of a lifetime to learn all the stories, and a tribe never wants to risk losing ties to their history because of the sudden death of the tribe's rattler to old age or in battle."

Most encounters with a llorona begin as the victim hears mournful sobbing cries in the distance. Some victims she simply fills with sorrow, hoping that the experience will scar their minds or cause them to correct their ways, but others she marks for death. If a victim isn't compelled to drown himself upon hearing the llorona's wails, she snatches him up and drags him into the water so she can plunge him beneath the surface until death brings them both sweet silence."

Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above water that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most land-dwellers. Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy.",

Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts.",

Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own. Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful aquatic races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers.",

Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon; luscas brook no other large predators in their claimed territory, and battle even mighty krakens for control. They are equally territorial with their own kind, and an encounter between two luscas, except to mate, almost always ends with one dead or driven off.

A successful DC 22 Reflex saving throw negates the entangled condition and reduces the bleed damage to 1d3 points. The save is Constitution-based.",
			"",

A creature that successfully grapples a lythirium takes 2d8 points of damage and is exposed to its rampant growth at the start of the grapple each round it maintains the grapple.",
			"",
			"**Verdant Glide (Ex)** A lythirium can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. It ignores any magically manipulated overgrowth with thorns, briars, or other natural growth that would normally impede its motion.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Savage hunters of those who would harm their habitats, lythiriums prowl Golarion's densest forests, seeking to protect the wild, untouched natural growth they hold sacred. While they have lived on the Material Plane for millennia, lythiriums are actually descended from primordial beasts native to the First World-creatures that fused plant and animal so seamlessly they seemed both and neither simultaneously. Peering out of seedpod eyes that radiate a soft green glow, lythiriums have exceptionally keen senses; they are not shy about preserving their forests, and they deliver their warnings in rasping voices reminiscent of leaves blowing across the earth.",
			"",
			"At its haunches, a lythirium measures 6 feet in height, with thorns, vines, and flowering blossoms inching ever higher. Its massive body is a matrix of vines, roots, and fine, furry moss and lichens. Immense branches shape its powerful chest and limbs. From thorny head to tail, a lythirium measures 9 feet in length; it can weigh as much as 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe the first lythiriums wandered onto Golarion through a breach to the First World in the nation now known as Kyonin or through a long-healed breach in the Barrowood or Whisperwood in what is now Cheliax (though the latter is considered less likely). Lythiriums' First World progenitors are believed to have been even more massive than the beasts that exist today. Most posit that they had even stranger physical qualities than do Golarion's lythiriums, such as the ability to infuse victims of their gore attacks with various poisons or diseases. The folktales that tell of such creatures in the First World are ancient and contradictory indeed, but one detail never wavers: these creatures were always said to take the forms of antler-bearing wolves, and to have senses appropriate to such pack hunters, despite having features of both elks and plants. These tales have died out among modern peoples, though, leading scholars to believe that-for whatever reason-lythiriums native to the First World no longer exist. However, the creatures' descendants live on in the densest forests of Golarion, patrolling their territories and acting as friends and allies to those who share their goals of keeping forests safe.",
			"",
			"Perhaps owing to their odd origins on the First World, lythiriums have a strange physiology. Foliage and reedy roots intertwine to form the creatures' shape and size, and their central roots pump greenish, saplike fluid throughout their bodies. The small seedpods that constitute a lythirium's eyes are opaque, fluid-filled sacs that emit a greenish glow. These give the creatures sharp vision, even in the dimmest light. In extreme darkness, the pod-eyes extend outward from the sockets like antennae, and sense subtle vibrations in the air. This allows lythiriums to see even in total darkness.",
			"",
			"Lythiriums survive by absorbing sunlight through their leaves and by scavenging the meat of animals that died naturally. However, despite their canine appearances, lythiriums don't hunt creatures for food, and kill only if they are attacked first.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Considering their immense size, lythiriums are able to move swiftly through the underbrush and foliage of the forested regions they inhabit. Though their native habitats are full of thick, dense forest that would impede the movement of any other beast of a similarly bulky size, lythiriums' unique ability to pass through plants unhindered enables them to continue their unyielding hunts against those who would harm their homes. It also ensures that they can use their own nature-manipulating abilities without being negatively affected themselves.",
			"",
			"When the season changes and temperatures drop, lythiriums' colors deepen to fiery red, burnt orange, and plum. Their leaves begin to fall as winter approaches, and lone lythiriums seek out caves or other sheltered places in which to hibernate during the winter, when they go dormant.",
			"",
			"Perhaps driven by instincts their kind developed on the First World, lythiriums often seek out wolf companions and sometimes even attempt to supplant an entire pack's hierarchy. Despite their peaceful nature, though, lythiriums are shunned by most wolf packs because of their disturbing appearance and pungent scent of earth and vegetation, which wolves tend to find both strange and unappealing.",
			"",
			"Lythiriums are rare and seldom encounter others of their kind. When chance meetings occur, lythiriums bond quickly. Although they seek to dominate the few wolf packs that accept them, lythiriums are remarkably egalitarian when living among their own. They have a complex communication system ranging from barks and whines to growls and howls, all tinged with the sound of rustling leaves.",
			"",
			"While in its territory, a lythirium assists good-aligned adventurers and creatures against evil foes when it sees such fights break out. If adventurers approach a lythirium respectfully with news of threats against its territory, the creature does whatever is necessary to help end the menace. Lythiriums' intelligence and protective nature make them useful confederates for good fey creatures, though they also usually consider elves and gnomes to be natural allies.",
			"",
			"Though the dense terrain in which lythiriums live is enough to keep most intruders away, they constantly patrol their surroundings. A lythirium's vigilance grows if virtuous folk make their homes within its territory. Many communities of forestdwelling elves refer to lythiriums as vinewolves and usually welcome their presence when settling a new region, going as far as to hollow out dead, massive trees in the hope that lythiriums might hibernate nearby and protect them."

They love silver-which reminds them of rainfall-and can be easily bribed into abandoning their mischief for a handful of coins.",
			"",
			"Because they're fragile and lack an intrinsic link to the Elemental Planes to bind them together, mamiwas must rest by binding themselves into solid objects each day to maintain their forms, or else they must dedicate themselves to a greater power and beg enough elemental energy to remain coherent. Many find succor in Gozreh, but a few malicious mamiwas follow the elemental lords Hshurha or Kelizandri instead. Mamiwas can also obtain the energy they need to survive from mortal mages, and a neutral-aligned 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a mamiwa as a familiar."

At night, her upper torso rips away (this is a full round action that occurs at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her lower torso is helpless, but her upper torso gains its fly speed and natural attacks at this time. The upper and lower portions share the same pool of hit points (despite any intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is damaged, the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Since manananggals can be destroyed by damage to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their lower torsos when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower torso and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes 1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into dust.",

This allows the undead creatures to select their prey from within the community. Manananggals particularly enjoy feeding upon pregnant women, targeting them in their sleep so the undead may feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they carry. These foul creatures drain blood via their long, black, hollow tongues. Manananggals despise the scent of garlic and strong spices like cloves and anise.",

			"**Anatomical Undoing (Ex)** A twilight pitri adds its Wisdom modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its unarmed attacks, as it has an intuitive grasp of how to unmake corporeal forms. On a critical hit with its unarmed strike, it deals triple damage.",
			"",
			"**Cerulean Nimbus (Su)** Twilight pitris are surrounded by an eerie blue light said to be a reflection from a previous version of the multiverse. While active, this light grants them a +4 shield bonus to their AC. A twilight pitri can make use of its frightful presence aura only while its cerulean nimbus surrounds it. The pitri can dismiss the light as a free action, even when it is not the pitri's turn, to reroll any one saving throw or to negate a critical hit. A dismissed nimbus returns in 1d3 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Lunar Rays (Su)** A twilight pitri can shoot rays of moonlight with a range of 100 feet. A twilight pitri can fire a single ray as an attack action, or up to four rays as a full attack action. Firing a ray does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A twilight pitri can apply its Vital Strike feats to lunar rays. Each ray deals 8d6 points of cold damage and 8d6 points of positive energy damage. This positive energy does not harm creatures that aren't normally damaged by positive energy, nor does it heal them.",
			"",
			"**Third Eye (Su)** As a swift action, a twilight pitri can open or close its third eye. While the eye is open, the twilight pitri gains access to an additional pool of 45 PE and gains a constant true seeing effect, but loses the benefits of its cerulean nimbus. This pool of psychic energy is separate from the twilight pitri's regular pool, and is accessible only while the third eye is open. Effects that blind a twilight pitri prevent the use of this ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation, manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories - the current multiverse is not the first to exist and it won't be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon, existence itself waxes and wanes.",
			"",
			"Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitris are manasaputras whose existence predates the current multiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures started their path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse, not some more ancient one. During that indescribable existence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to the ranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their native reality, they endured and were incarnated into the current multiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Though they are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulation and challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among the greatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment.",
			"",
			"This transition between multiverses has the effect of cutting off the former manus' souls from the Cosmic Fire of creation. This \"twilight\" forces the new pitris to pursue enlightenment without the fire's guidance.",
			"",
			"While these creatures can hover around the Cosmic Fire on the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from entering it. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo, but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier. These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporeality found among other types of manasaputras, which enables communion with the flame.",
			"",
			"While some occult scholars teach that this exile is some form of punishment for actions in past incarnations, both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation. Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritual suffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of the Cosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itself or to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is both challenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this test leads to either the destruction of a twilight pitri or its continuance within lesser incarnations until the death of this multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gain true enlightenment from this test become solar pitris when the next multiverse ignites, though most achieve status as a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnated as lesser manasaputras many times before succeeding and becoming solar pitris.",
			"",
			"Because these pitris are disconnected from the cosmic source, their wisdom can sometimes seem imperfect, at least compared to that of the solar pitris. While all twilight pitris seek to expand enlightenment in the multiverse, their actions can accidently work against enlightened truth.",
			"",
			"During the earliest epochs of this multiverse, the first twilight pitris sought not only to shepherd the fledgling races, but also to impart knowledge and reason to those with whom they formed the closest bonds. The results of this effort still haunt them, as the pitris' imperfect mastery of cosmic enlightenment turned these races into beings driven only by reason, logic, and systematic philosophies. As these beliefs opposed the spiritual ascension touted by other manasaputras, these early races ascended to become other types of outsiders, swelling the ranks of such beings. In the end, the kumaras had to intercede and right the wrongs inadvertently spurred by the twilight pitris' actions. Because of this, many twilight pitris have chosen to be more contemplative and intuitive in deciding on their courses of action than other manasaputras, while others become more active hoping to make up for this early misstep.",
			"",
			"In spite of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek to aid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They take great care to search for and study the individual mortals, societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise. Mortals who show the best chance of becoming some form of manu in their next incarnations are chosen and taught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executed action, and focused meditation necessary to achieve their next stage of enlightenment. At the same time, such visitations-either to mortals or others of their kind- can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitris often act in unexpected ways-their minds inscrutable to the denizens of the Material Plane-and their lack of connection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seem disconnected from other manasaputras. A handful of kumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they do leave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and finding wisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpected modes of thought.",
			"",
			"Relationships between twilight pitris and manus are complicated. Many manus have at least one twilight pitri to thank for their first steps of enlightenment and acceptance into the manasaputra castes, but upon ascension, the new manus intuit how disconnected their former teachers are from the cosmic source of all things. They immediately find the words and guidance of the twilight pitris to be filled with half-truths and blind paths, even though the twilight pitri's intentions are true and honorable. These manus still give members of this caste the respect and reverence they deserve, and understand the importance of this test-especially since they may face it themselves one day- but often go to great pains to avoid asking a twilight pitri for counsel. Relationships between twilight pitris and samsarans are even more strained, as knowledgeable members of that race blame the twilight pitris for nearly damning the entire samsaran race to a path outside of reincarnation and enlightenment. While they would never outwardly disrespect these higher forms of being, they are often suspicious of the twilight pitris' guidance and disregard twilight pitris' advice. Some samsarans outright refuse all aid coming from one of these manasaputras.",

			"Known to many as the giant praying mantis for the way the creature's deadly front limbs fold under its head as it lies in wait for food, this creature is well feared along caravan tracks that pass through dense woodlands. The giant mantis, a master of hiding in dense undergrowth, is almost unnaturally patient as it lies in wait, striking with unsettling speed as unsuspecting meals wander by.",
			"",
			"In many savage societies, the giant mantis is particularly feared-in regions where these vermin are common, they are often regarded as messengers of death sent to the world by angry gods. Their swift speed, alien appearance, and near-invisibility in forests give rise to many legends-that the giant mantis can become invisible, that it can smell fear, and that the souls of those who it slays and eats are digested and kept from moving on to the afterlife. While the giant mantis is nothing more than an efficient and deadly vermin, the numerous legends and whispers regarding its supposed powers and alien intellect have inspired some spellcasters to work such features into their constructs as a way to make them even more fearsome. There are even stories of entire societies of assassins who worship an immense mantis as a god, and who have taken to heart the mantis's style of murderous ambush, fighting with twin serrated rapiers.",
			"",
			"The giant mantis presented here stands 7 feet tall and 15 feet long, and weighs 650 pounds. Larger giant mantises exist in the deepest, darkest forests of the world, where they might prey upon things as mighty as giants or dragons. Known by various names, such as the drake-eating mantis, the treebender mantis, or simply the deadly mantis, these immense behemoths average more than 60 feet in height and have a terrifying habit of destroying entire villages or towns in order to satiate their ravenous appetites. A deadly mantis is a giant mantis advanced to Colossal size, 16 Hit Dice, and CR 14."

			"Cunning and brutal, maraxes are far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the planet's most fearsome competitors.",
			"",
			"Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"While they are far from the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability. Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs. Their seasonal migrations create famine in their wakes as they drain a region of fauna, and entire lashunta villages may relocate seasonally to avoid starvation. Maraxes possess only a single lung, and those introduced to alien environments often become extremely irritable due to shortness of breath.",
			"",
			"Maraxes are overwhelmingly carnivorous. The larger, more aggressive females dominate their packs, bringing down prey and eating first. Maraxes have voracious appetites, and will make a meal of almost anything-in lean times the animals turn to carrion, fruit, and in rare cases even soil and stones to sate their voracious appetites.",
			"",
			"Straddling the line between mammal and reptile, maraxes are warm-blooded creatures with resilient bodies. Soft fur covers tough scales across much of a marax's body, while bony knobs protect the head, back, thighs, and tail. A marax's most identifiable feature is its tough dorsal osteoderms that offer protection. They lack forelimbs, and balance instead on a single pair of legs tipped with vicious, scythe-like claws. Their oversized jaws can crush both bone and stone, and larger specimens can even tear through metal armor. A cluster of venomous barbs sprout from the end of a marax's tail, which can inject enough paralytic venom to bring down prey twice the creature's size.",
			"",
			"These statistics represent a typical marax. Various subspecies may be larger or smaller (use the giant creature or young creature simple templates accordingly) and possess a variety of different special abilities. The arctic-dwelling tundrax is smaller, but can hibernate for months beneath the snow and reawaken in moments to pounce upon unsuspecting prey, while females of the bioluminescent ghostback marax possess a resin-producing gland that grants them an ability similar to the web special ability.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Maraxes are found all across Castrovel, but exist primarily in its primeval forests and vast savannas. Dozens of subspecies fill the planet's various ecological niches, and maraxes range from the polar tundra to steaming tropical jungles. Thanks to Castrovel's dramatic tides and powerful weather systems, regular migration is a way of life, and packs can cover hundreds of miles between seasonal hunting grounds. Some subspecies follow staple herds, while others alternate between a variety of environments and diets throughout the year. Most maraxes spend dry seasons stalking small prey in wooded areas or deep in Castrovel's countless hidden valleys, then during wet seasons move onto open savanna to take down larger prey. Wherever they settle for a time, packs use their powerful claws to dig out shallow nests, which shelter a complex ecology of scavengers and opportunistic mammals once the beasts move on.",
			"",
			"Most breeds of maraxes are social animals that form complex hierarchies. They vocalize a variety of chirps, growls, and rasping grunts, and establish relative status with bellowing exchanges that lashunta call \"debates.\" The largest female typically leads the pack, and surrounds herself with the other breeding-age females for hunting and territorial defense. Males and females not of breeding age rely on this matriarch's circle for food, and are expected to groom the hunters and one another for parasites. All members of a pack contribute to marking and defending territory and to scavenging during lean times. The social bonds are knit tight, and packs are more likely to move on to new hunting grounds than drive out members in hard times. An alpha female remains fertile so long as she is well fed, and especially successful matriarchs can grow to enormous sizes and dominate packs of fifty or more, cultivating legends and nicknames among lashunta hunters.",
			"",
			"Non-alpha females breed only two or three litters in a lifetime. Females attract the attention of males using their tail barbs, and engage other females in mock combat to claim the healthiest mates. If a male shows interest, the female bonds her clutch of two to four eggs to his underbelly with a sticky resin. The father becomes incubator and guardian for the next 16 months. Hatchlings are born with soft, flexible back plates, and adults claw and nip at a pup's back to transform the soft cartilage into thick, sturdy osteoderms. The venom both males and females produce in their tails is a complex array of proteins and enzymes that the hatchlings suckle for nourishment during their vulnerable first few days. As one would expect, maraxes are very protective parents; packs will chase kidnappers for miles and tear them apart with an almost gleeful cruelty.",
			"",
			"Thanks to Castrovel's numerous planetary portals, maraxes occasionally migrate to other worlds. A smaller, wheezing variety prowls Akiton's equator, riding the planet's massive dust storms from hunting ground to hunting ground. On Golarion, a few small packs roam Numeria and southern Garund, preying on the megafauna in these locations.",
			"",
			"Among Castrovel's civilizations, capturing or slaying a marax is an impressive achievement. As maraxes' natural weapons can be used to craft vicious daggers, spears, and terbutje, those capable of reliably trapping or hunting the creatures earn impressive fortunes and high prestige.",
			"",
			"Near rural settlements, maraxes stalk domesticated herds for easy meals, and even pick off careless hunters and shepherds without fear. Their hunting tactics are so effective that some lashunta have bred a loyal domesticated subspecies to guard their wilderness settlements from predation. Though ravenous and ill tempered, these tame maraxes are unflaggingly loyal. Druidic sects see the creature as a powerful totem, crafting fetishes from the animal's bones and plates and divining prophecies from packs' seasonal migrations."

			"Natives of Elysium, mederachs are the kind and good counterparts to the bebiliths that lurk in the Abyss and prey upon demonic flesh. Mederachs once spent all of their time on their home plane, serving as healers and teachers to the azatas, angels, titans, and others creatures alongside which they lived; among themselves, mederachs delighted in discussing the nuances of the honest virtues they held in such high esteem, including kindness, charity, and mercy.",
			"",
			"As societies formed on the Material Plane, mederachs heard tales of mortals' changeable morality with interest and concern. Mortals, they came to believe, have souls that are inherently good, but that are also easily corrupted when exposed to prolonged suffering or extraplanar evil forces. During the Age of Darkness, mederachs heard of the various misfortunes and evils that had descended upon the lands of Golarion, including the falling of the Starstone, the collapse of major empires, and the rampages of the nascent demon lord Treerazer. Believing that these events would imperil the souls of all the world's mortals, mederachs began experimenting with plane-shifting; once they honed this ability, they began making regular forays to Golarion to aid good creatures in the fight against overwhelming evil. Now, in addition to embarking on these missions, mederachs also sometimes travel to the source of such evil plots-often the Abyss-and work on mortals' behalf there. However, no matter where their journeys take them, mederachs always keep in mind their belief that most evil can be redeemed, and so they seek to subdue their enemies and turn them toward good whenever possible instead of destroying them outright.",
			"",
			"Mederachs are typically 10 feet tall and weigh about 2,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"On Elysium, mederachs still occasionally serve as teachers and mentors for their native neighbors. In recent millennia, however, they've spent their time at home honing their hunting skills, for their experiences working with virtuous partners on the Material Plane has taught them they must be skilled hunters and combatants if they wish to effectively fight evil. They find plenty of creatures on Elysium willing to participate as the prey in mock hunts. Mederachs rarely remain in Elysium for extended periods, preferring to put their skills to use on the Material Plane or even in the Abyss once they feel comfortable doing so.",
			"",
			"To their credit, mederachs use peaceful methods to subdue their targets whenever they can. However, they have an instinctive, burning hatred for evil arachnid creatures, reserving the greatest enmity for bebiliths, whose malevolence mederachs believe is a mockery of the good they themselves try so ardently to accomplish. They also have no qualms about destroying unintelligent evil creatures, especially mindless undead, reasoning that these monsters serve as mere shells for the forces of evil and deserve no quarter.",
			"",
			"Mederachs hunt like typical web-spinning spiders, leaving a nigh-invisible web in the path of potential targets. They often elect to deal nonlethal damage to foes they think they can reach through dialog. During combat with such foes, they relate grand tales of supposedly irredeemable tyrants who saw the error of their ways and became benign rulers.",
			"",
			"Mederachs acquired the ability to change their appearance, which they use when they travel among those who might fear their true forms, or who might mistake them for evil bebiliths. Although they can change shape into many types of animals, they tend to choose familiar forms, such as horses with golden manes or riding dogs with golden coats. Their arachnid nature subtly manifests while they're in alternate forms, usually represented by eight toes on each paw, or scarlet dots on their heads representing extra eyes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Around others of their kind, mederachs are especially conversational and friendly; a convening of mederachs is often a talkative and somewhat disorderly, if polite, affair. They enjoy relating tales of their journeys to other planes and of creatures they have turned from evil or, regrettably, destroyed. Mederachs also enjoy discussing intricate web patterns based on designs they have witnessed in the stars or on other planes. They establish no formal hierarchy among themselves and regard each other as equals.",
			"",
			"Mederachs' egalitarianism extends to their fellow good-aligned outsiders. Of course, they have their own biases and preferences regarding such creatures. They view many lawful good outsiders, especially archons, as too rigid in their pursuit of righteousness. Archons, on the other hand, view mederachs as powerful but overly idealistic and optimistic fighters. The lawful good celestials still seek alliances with mederachs, however, when doing so would benefit their plans. Mederachs are usually open to such offers, but these collaborations tend to dissolve quickly once the creatures achieve their mutual goal.",
			"",
			"Mederachs find many neutral good outsiders to be eminently helpful when the need arises; in their own pursuit of good, agathions in particular are open to assisting mederachs with non-violent plans. When agathions embark on ambassadorial missions to other planes, mederachs often accompany them, both to further their own schemes and to cement the friendships they often have with their allies. Mederachs also frequently work with angels, although when they do, it usually involves the angels intimidating the powerful evil creatures mederachs hope to turn to good. Of course, their angel allies tend to have their own inscrutable aims in mind when they go along with mederachs' plans, which can sometimes lead to minor discord between the celestials.",
			"",
			"Of all the other good outsiders, mederachs have the most in common with azatas, who are also natives of Elysium. While azatas can be aimless in their pursuit of championing good wherever they tread, mederachs are more focused architects of such plans, and so the two make excellent partners in many situations. In such relationships, the strong-willed azatas may insist on taking the lead when carrying out plans or suddenly change their minds about the best ways to achieve the partnership's collective goals. Yet they are surprisingly willing to admit their errors in judgment or personality flaws, leading to friendships and partnerships that rarely truly sour despite minor setbacks. Beyond threatening one of their own, the best way to truly rile mederachs is to harm their azata companions."

At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conflicts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.",

Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful.

			"At a young age, Eygreas learned from her mother-a strong-willed medusa by the name of Litiasha-that she was the daughter of a powerful boggard priestking. When the tribe of boggards ambushed Litiasha several years after Eygreas's birth, demanding that the medusa release her brazen daughter to them to be sacrificed on an altar to Gogunta, Litiasha barely had time to petrify more than half of the boggard warriors before she was overwhelmed and abducted by them, and sacrificed in her daughter's place. Eygreas barely escaped the onslaught; the traumatic event spurred within her a burning hatred for the froglike denizens of the swamp, and so she honed her skill with her bow and devoted her life to hunting the tribe that had killed her kin. After stealthily slaughtering all of the boggards with her arrows and gaze-and thus removing her only driving motivation-she fell into a realm of madness and bitter isolation.",
			"",
			"Now, the brazen medusa stalks the Thassilonian ruins that dot the southern Mushfens, seeking some sort of artifact or piece of history that will once again give meaning to her life, all the while butchering any she comes across with little regard to their motives or means. Though her memory is mostly shattered, her skill at hunting remains sharp, and she seeks solace from the chaos of her mind by stalking her prey and feasting on their corpses. Still, though she does not remember why, the sight of the toady people of the swamp enrages her to no end, and the only thing that will stop Eygreas from pursuing her current target is the opportunity to hunt a boggard instead."

			"",
			"**Life-Draining Aura (Su)** At the start of a melacage's turn, each creature within 30 feet that is affected by the melacage's despair ability takes 1d4 points of negative energy damage, and the melacage becomes corporeal for 1 round. It loses the incorporeal subtype and gains a Strength score of 20. Its deflection bonus to AC becomes a natural armor bonus, and its incorporeal touch attack is replaced with two bite attacks. It loses its fly speed and gains a base speed of 30 feet. A creature within the melacage's aura at the start of the melacage's turn can allow itself to be affected by the melacage's despair ability (as if it had failed the Will save) in order to trigger this ability.",
			"",
			"**Rejuvenation (Su)** A melacage exists because it is not aware of how it died. Explaining to a melacage how it died destroys it permanently. If the melacage is destroyed but it still does not know the circumstances of its death, it rejuvenates fully in 1d10 days.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In a world with powerful spells, silent monsters, and a long history that can often affect the present in unexpected ways, death-even mass death-can sometimes come as a surprise. While souls may move on, the sudden feelings of loss and confusion can be left in the world as psychic imprints, and if enough of those feelings exist in one place, they can combine into a melacage. A melacage stays near the place where it formed, trying to transfer its crippling depression to a living creature so that it can become corporeal and investigate the cause of its death.",
			"",
			"An average melacage is around 2 feet in diameter, with four to five humanoid faces on the outside of its body.",
			"",
			"Melacages are usually created in the aftermath of a great, tragic event. This could be anything from the collateral damage of a wizard's duel to a group of subterranean monsters causing lethal tremors and a sudden sinkhole. Whatever that event, it often has these two qualities: it affected a large group of people at once, and that group of people had little to no warning that it was coming.",
			"",
			"Because a melacage is created by lingering emotions and not souls, the number of deaths that it takes to create one of these creatures can vary from one melacage to another. Sometimes the psychic imprint of an entire village will come together to form one melacage, while other times it takes only two or three sudden deaths. A major factor in the creation of melacages comes from the victims' outlook on life while they were alive; a group of happy-go-lucky, optimistic people might be devastated by their sudden deaths and form many melacages, whereas a group of down-on-their-luck folk who were barely scraping by might barely form one. [Gnomes](race/gnome) in particular are vulnerable to forming melacages, as their whimsical nature and vivacious lifestyles can make their unexpected deaths all the more traumatic, though gnomes who have survived the Bleaching almost never form part of a melacage.",
			"",
			"The fact that melacages are formed from lingering emotions and not souls also causes trouble for necromancers who try to create them. Since most spells focus on a corpse or a soul, it is hard to find a spell that targets the essences required to create a melacage; while it can be hard to covertly find the appropriate corpses necessary for casting [animate dead](spell/animate_dead), it can be even harder to quietly kill a large number of people in an unexpected and sudden way. These circumstances mean that academic work on creating melacages is severely lacking and advanced only by unscrupulous professors' side projects.",
			"",
			"The faces of a melacage reflect those who provided the emotions that formed it, although in the case of a melacage created by the confusion and sorrow of a large number of people, the faces are often amalgams of the originals. Bits and pieces of the original creatures' memories remain, mostly having to do with what the creatures were doing when they died. When accessing an individual person's memories, the melacage rotates so this particular face is showing, which can lead to a dizzying discussion if the melacage tries to access multiple different memories at once.",
			"",
			"A melacage that becomes corporeal falls onto the ground with a sickening splat as it simultaneously loses the ability to fly and gains real skin. Such a melacage is reduced to rolling around on the ground to move, and it must attack with its mouths instead of using its incorporeal essence to drain the vitality from other creatures. Despite being brought to the ground, melacages maintain much of the speed they had in their incorporeal forms, and they are able to quickly roll after any victims who try to escape.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Melacages are only as common as the events that create them, which means they tend to be fairly rare. Melacages can show up anywhere, but they form mostly in urban environments. Due to their connections with great tragedies, often the places where they reside are ruined and abandoned.",
			"",
			"Melacages cannot recall the events that lead to their creation, and they cannot rest until they know the reason for their being, yet they are often prevented from investigating their deaths by their own melancholy and despair. This means that their first priority is to find something or someone else to host their overpowering emotions. This has the dual benefits of allowing them to mentally focus on their investigations and allowing them to become corporeal and therefore able to move physical objects in their quests. However, the necessary proximity to the new host of their depression and the damage their emotions inflict upon that creature can lead to misunderstandings of the melacage's intentions, so such attempts often end in violence.",
			"",
			"While a melacage doesn't mind working with people who are investigating its death, its tumultuous and misery-stricken mind can often cause it to become confused as to who is actually helping and who is causing it harm. If a melacage is able to transfer its misery to someone else, the melacage usually becomes easier to reason with. Removing a melacage's anguish can also help people who have figured out the cause of its deaths and are trying to convince it they have discovered the truth, as the emotional shock of discovery makes it difficult for the melacage to make sense of what anyone tells it, and it often denies that such stories could possibly be true.",
			"",
			"Due to their tendency to live in isolated areas, melacages are only rarely reported, usually after adventurers have already removed them. There have been some strange rumors coming out of Nirmathas, however, of a village where melacages seem to be forming for no reason. Given the villagers' preparations for Molthuni aggression, they've so far been able to take care of the melacages with minimal harm to themselves, but they remain flummoxed as to why the undead creatures are being created in the first place. The village is offering a sizable reward for anyone who can figure out the cause and deal with the situation permanently. Current theories point to an underground city that befell tragedy, but no one has been able to locate it."

Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, feystricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories.",
			"",
			"The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror.",
			"",
			"Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby Hellknights) to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns.",
			"",
			"To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identified ( just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inflated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster.",
			"",
			"Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past."

Yet these weapons are primarily for show, as mercanes prefer to let their bodyguards deal with violent opponents. If a situation turns ugly, mercanes typically use their magical abilities to flee, abandoning their hirelings if necessary.",
			"",
			"Mercanes are known throughout the planes as traders in magical items. Each has a secret chest filled with wares stashed away, ready to be pulled out when it's time to haggle and close a deal (or to bribe a potential obstacle). Mercanes are therefore not easily robbed, and they only surrender the contents of a secret chest when they have no other choice. Mercanes have no interest in mundane goods, no matter how fine or rare. Only magical objects earn their attention and their coin. They're known for driving hard, but fair, bargains, and for hiring adventurers from time to time to recover certain goods of interest for a fair price. Although they are not particularly brave, they hold contracts sacrosanct and keep their agreements.",
			"",
			"Rumors and legends abound as to the origins of the mercanes and their reasons for seeking out and buying magical items. Their home plane is unknown, and they have wandered between the worlds for as long as any can recall. Stories claim the mercanes feed on the magic items they acquire, or even need them in order to reproduce. There are also tales of a war in a far corner of the planes, with the mercanes serving the roles of arms merchants, aggressors, or defenders, depending on who tells the story.",

A merfolk's lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males. Although amphibious, merfolk move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea.",
			"",

Ancient accounts hint at merfolk protecting a terrible secret bound to the depths, and though no reports mention what this secret is, the lengths merfolk go to remain isolated from other races highlight the importance of this safeguard.",
			"",

Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding that even those merfolk who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea.",

			"",
			"**Source** [Pathfinder #124: City in the Deep pg. 75](source/pathfinder_#124_city_in_the_deep) Merfolk advance by character class. Adventuring merfolk are most often bards, kineticists, rangers, skalds, sorcerers, and swashbucklers. They explore coastlines and sunken ruins, and they occasionally ally with surface dwellers who use magic to venture beneath the waves. Though adventuring merfolk are more outgoing than settled ones, they always maintain a slight reservation toward non-merfolk. Gaining the unhesitating trust and friendship of a merfolk is a rare accomplishment.",
			"",
			"In shoals, merfolk usually advance as bards, druids, fighters, oracles, rangers, shamans, and skalds. Shoal leaders are often druids, oracles, or shamans with unmatched knowledge of the ocean's denizens and complexion. Leaders are usually referred to by name and hold no title, as they are considered servants, rather than masters, of their communities. Leaders are expected to protect and guide the shoal, keeping its people safe and prosperous. A leader who fails may be exiled or even killed for failing to live up to these expectations.",
			"",
			"Merfolk witches are rare and powerful beings. Merfolk treat witches with respect but fear them for their link with unknown entities. Scholars who are concerned with the potential link between merfolk and an evil race consider merfolk witches to be the foremost agents of their hidden overlords. Merfolk witches are thought to commune with the supernatural beings they serve, carrying out their wishes with unquestioning loyalty.",
			"",
			"Arctic Merfolk (CR +1): Arctic merfolk live in the polar regions of the world, swimming in the iciest waters. They have the same statistics as merfolk, except they have cold resistance 5 and a +2 natural armor bonus. Arctic merfolk tend to be paler than their temperate and tropical kin. Their skin tones are waxen brown, gray, or snow white, and their tails can be gray blue, gray green, ice blue, pearly white, periwinkle, or silver.",
			"",
			"Deep Merfolk (CR 3): [Deep merfolk](monster/deep_merfolk) live near the ocean floor in the cold and lightless depths. While they have humanoid torsos and fish tails akin to other merfolk, their skin is murky and translucent, giving them a ghoulish look, and their long, silvery tails have red fins. Their eerie appearance leads to rumors that deep merfolk are evil creatures and that they worship demons and slaughter innocents. These rumors are unfounded, though; deep merfolk have the same reserved nature as their kin and generally keep to themselves. While individual deep merfolk may lead evil lives, the race as a whole is peaceful and neutral."

Three times per day as a standard action, a merlucent can replicate the effects of a single arcane spell cast within 20 feet of it, directing the spell's effect and choosing a target as if it were the caster. This echo uses the merlucent's caster level rather than that of the original spellcaster, and a merlucent can't echo any effect with a spell level greater than half the merlucent's own Hit Dice (generally limiting it to second-level spells). A merlucent can't echo the spells, spell-like abilities, or arcane echo effects created by other merlucents.",
			"",

A merlucent gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (normally +4).

			"",
			"**Vitrify (Su)** A merlucent can produce a polyp and implant it in the ear of a willing or helpless creature over the course of 1 minute, during which the merlucent is flat-footed. The polyp begins slowly consuming its host's brain, transforming the creature's flesh into a transparent jelly and replacing its bone with delicate crystal. A creature that takes any amount of Intelligence damage from a merlucent polyp can breathe while underwater, but loses the ability to breathe air. If a humanoid creature takes ability damage in excess of its Intelligence score, it transforms into a new merlucent, losing all abilities or class levels it previously possessed. The polyp can be destroyed by any effect that removes disease, but the inability to breathe air persists until a creature's Intelligence damage is healed.",

			"#### Description",

			"Merlucents are strange creatures formed from the fusion of human and jellyfish. As a species, they are simple-minded ascetics. Individual clans claim small stretches of coastline where they hunt fish and shellfish, and scratch strange glyphs into coral, coaxing it to grow in unnatural though beautiful formations. Naturally sensitive to arcane energy, they settle in locations rife with ambient magic, such as along ley lines or near schools of magic built on islands or coasts. Local communities generally consider merlucents to be pests for stripping fishing grounds bare, but the aberrations also keep more aggressive aquatic threats away. This small blessing turns bane every 2 to 5 years when merlucents enter their mating phase and become extremely aggressive.",
			"",
			"To reproduce, each merlucent spawns dozens of antsized polyps, each of which must mature inside the skull of a humanoid host. Depending on the host, it can take anywhere from days to weeks for the tiny parasite to take over its host's mind and convert the bony, flesh-covered body into its own adult form. To support their children, merlucents conduct fanatical crusades, kidnapping surface dwellers to act as incubators. Relying on its members' stealth and paralytic poison, a single clan may snatch dozens of unwary sailors or coastal residents in a single season.",
			"",
			"Merlucents range from 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh around 180 pounds, though smaller or larger specimens may be spawned depending on the size of the host.",
			"",
			"A merlucent's natural ability to sniff out and reproduce arcane magic-as well as its dependence on humanoids to reproduce-is suggestive of unnatural origins, though none of Golarion's usual culprits known for creating grotesque hybrids have ever been associated with the jellyfish-folk. Merlucents prefer kidnapping arcane spellcasters to host their young, even though they can spawn in any humanoid and their young rarely inherit a host's spellcasting ability. They also show little interest in the flavor of magic their targets wield. Merlucents were likely an accidental creation, spawned at some unknown point in the past-a grim reminder that magic remains a powerful force beyond any creature's complete control, and its use may produce unexpected consequences.",
			"",
			"Merlucents are carnivores, eating fish, shellfish, and the occasional seabird-with their translucent skin exposing the digestive process for any to see. They have no need for sleep; instead, they tend to drift with the currents, waiting for small fish to swim into their tentacles. They can wait weeks between meals, and ride the tides for hundreds of miles in a state of torpor. However, they can also become ravenous and deplete entire coves in a matter of days.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Merlucents have little in the way of religion or philosophy, and focus primarily on eating and creating art until the mating frenzy consumes them. Long-established colonies may shape coral reefs into elaborate cave systems over generations, complete with air pockets where they keep captives until the colony is ready to implant them with polyps. While merlucents understand other humanoids to be intelligent, they see them as alien and needlessly complex- more akin to termites than neighbors. On rare occasions, merlucents trade with surface dwellers, offering fish, reconnaissance, and scavenged goods in exchange for magic baubles. They rarely use these acquired treasures, instead working them into their ever-expanding coral formations. Merlucents can eventually come to see long-time surface neighbors as beloved pets or a private herd, and show affection by nurturing barnacles to grow on docks and boats to keep the waters clean, or dragging the bloated carcasses of large sea animals to shore for their pets to eat.",
			"",
			"To merlucents' alien senses, magical auras twinkle like soft music or pleasant lights. They treasure potions or wands as humans might treasure music boxes or other delicate trinkets, and they see arcane spellcasters as itinerant performers. Thanks to merlucents' fascination with magic, several clans may follow or worship particularly powerful aquatic wizards and sorcerers, but such aggregations rarely outlast the group's leader.",
			"",
			"After a merlucent rears an indeterminate number of young, a strange new instinct takes over its mind, calling it down into the deepest ocean trenches. These elders form large colonies-sometimes a hundred strong-around thermal vents on the ocean floor. Here, they rear massive schools of jellyfish and cultivate farms of tube worms in vast, swirling formations. Elder merlucents show little interest in eating their livestock, but aggressively defend their colonies against intruders. They become especially aggressive toward deep merfolk, with whom they fight constantly for control of the richest vents. Rather than implanting their young into captive merfolk, merlucents instead hurl their unfortunate enemies into the sea floor's boiling fissures, cooking them alive."

This ability affects only the mezlan's outward image. Its creature type doesn't change in this new form; it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities, and it retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. This is a polymorph effect.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Weapons (Su)** A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage. Morphic weapons deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its morphic weapons. A mezlan can also attack with a morphic weapon by hurling a portion of its body as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 60 feet (the mezlan swiftly regrows thrown portions of its body after using this attack, while the hurled portion melts away into slime after dealing damage to a target).",
			"",
			"**Skill Pool (Ex)** A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus to any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in and skills that can only be used trained. A mezlan can use any skill, even those that would normally require it to be trained.",
			"",
			"**Store Spells (Sp)** A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the same casting time as the original spell, and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use arcane, divine, and psychic spells, and can carry spells from any number of casters at a given time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan as if storing a spell in an item like a ring of spell storing. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell, choose to lower its spell resistance, and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells can't be absorbed. If a mezlan already holds 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more spells, and any spell of a level exceeding a mezlan's available spell level is not absorbed and affects the mezlan normally. Once a spell is absorbed in this manner, the mezlan can use the spell as its own.",
			"",
			"**Versatile Speech (Ex)** A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability",

			"",
			"Built by ancient arcanists and engineers to serve as spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of those ancient civilizations, close to 1,500 mezlans were created. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day.",
			"",
			"Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even more strange by the fact that they have unique, previously human personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract agreeing to serve as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didn't take, resulting in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Indications of these flaws didn't always reveal themselves before the creatures were deployed, and many such mezlans abandoned their missions to pursue their own mysterious agendas.",
			"",
			"Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them had martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an amorphous form and near immortality.",
			"",
			"Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 negative levels. These negative levels are removed at a rate of 1 per month.",
			"",
			"Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from their previous incorporation, and others never fully recall their previous selves. A mezlan that retains its living memories typically has several class levels, although it should be noted that not all skills and abilities humanoids have in life translate directly to life as a shapeshifting ooze. One notable exception is a mezlan's morphic weapons. While these attacks are natural weapons and a mezlan thus cannot gain iterative attacks, a mezlan who has feats or class abilities that bolster specific weapons can apply the effects of those feats or abilities to its morphic weapons, provided the weapons are of the right shape. For example, a mezlan with Weapon Focus (longsword) would gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with its morphic weapon attacks when they are in the shape of a longsword. This limits the damage type dealt by the morphic weapon to a damage type appropriate to the weapon being duplicated.",
			"",
			"From all appearances, mezlans seem to get along well with each other; however, to normal, living creatures, they often appear strange and unnatural in both form and behavior. They are very observant creatures that study everything they encounter, especially animals and humanoids-a frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use it as a default. Others keep dozens of regular guises and take on the ones most appropriate for particular duties they need to complete, using appearances and personalities as tools throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different shapes.",

			"### Becoming a Mezlan",
			"",
			"Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings-each is a marriage of transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, rather than any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands more of them. The sheer volume of rare metals needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth. The complex and expensive method for creating a mezlan has long been lost, but rumors hold that one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its kind. Other tales suggest that the ritual of creation survives to this day in a long-lost repository of ancient knowledge hidden deep under the ocean."
