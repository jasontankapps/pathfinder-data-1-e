			"Any good pit fighter will tell you, it doesn't matter how well you fight-all the crowd cares about is blood, and they don't care if it's yours or the other guy's. So if you want to survive your time in the pit, make sure the people get their blood, and lots of it. If you're lucky enough, the audience will be on your side, you'll feel the roar of the crowd pounding in your chest, and nothing can stop you.",

			"This simple philosophy is what separates a true pit fighter from the rest of the castoffs and washed-up gladiators found in arenas all across Golarion. Whether battling beasts in the filthy pits of Belkzen, or combating summoned fiends in the coliseums of Westcrown, a true pit fighter makes sure the audience sees the difference.",

			"**Poor Equipment (Ex):** Pit fighters are often forced to fight with poorly maintained equipment. At 1st level, a pit fighter can spend a swift action to ignore the broken condition of a single weapon or piece of armor he wields or wears for the remainder of the encounter. The selected weapon or piece of armor is treated in all ways as though it did not have the broken condition, though its hit points remain unchanged. The pit fighter can affect only one item at a time with this ability; if he selects a second item, the first immediately regains the broken condition.",
			"",
			"**Showmanship (Ex):** Once per day at 1st level, a pit fighter can treat a regular combat as a {rule/performance combat}, with the crowd's starting attitude being indifferent. He makes performance checks, may use performance feats, and takes bonuses or penalties based on the crowd's reaction as normal, even if there is no crowd actually watching the fight.

			"",
			"**Weapon Trick (Ex):** At 3rd level, a pit fighter gains {feat/Improved Dirty Trick} as a bonus feat, and can use any weapon with the performance quality to perform a dirty trick combat maneuver. Once per round when the pit fighter performs a dirty trick maneuver against an enemy, he may deal damage to the enemy as if he had struck it with his normal melee attack. The pit fighter must be wielding a weapon and have at least one hand free to use this ability.",
			"",
			"**Roar of the Crowd (Ex):** At 5th level, the roar of applause spurs a pit fighter on to greater acts of violence and brutality. When fighting a {rule/performance combat}, the pit fighter can enter a rage (as per the barbarian class ability) during any round in which the crowd's attitude toward him is helpful. This is in addition to the normal bonuses the crowd's attitude provides. The pit fighter can maintain his rage each round so long as the crowd's attitude toward him remains helpful. If the crowd's attitude ever drops below helpful, the pit fighter's rage immediately ends (though if he possesses the rage ability from another class, he may expend a round of his rage to continue the effect as normal for that class feature). If, after using this ability, the crowd's attitude ever drops to unfriendly or hostile, the pit fighter becomes fatigued. He remains fatigued for as long as the crowd remains unfriendly or hostile or until the end of the combat, whichever comes first.",
			"",
			"**Tricky Assault (Ex):** At 6th level, a pit fighter gains {feat/Quick Dirty Trick} as a bonus feat. This allows the pit fighter to perform a single dirty trick combat maneuver in place of one of his melee attacks on his turn. He must choose the melee attack with the highest base attack bonus to make the dirty trick combat maneuver.",
			"",
			"**Brutal Trick (Ex):** At 9th level, a pit fighter gains {feat/Greater Dirty Trick} as a bonus feat. In addition, a creature that spends a standard action to remove a condition applied by the pit fighter's dirty trick combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the pit fighter.",
			"",
			"**Greater Roar of the Crowd (Ex):** At 10th level, the crowd's effect on a pit fighter grows even more pronounced. The pit fighter may enter and maintain a rage so long as the crowd's attitude toward him is friendly or better. If the crowd's attitude is helpful, the morale bonus to the pit fighter's Strength and Constitution increases to +6 and the morale bonus on his Will saves increases to +3. Additionally, after using this ability, the pit fighter does not become fatigued until the crowd's attitude becomes hostile."

She does not gain any other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day, spells known (if she is a spontaneous spellcaster), and an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a proctor, she must decide which class she adds each new proctor level for the purpose of determining spells per day.",

This functions as the [wizard's arcane bond class feature](class/wizard), but as if the proctor had selected the {feat/Improved Familiar} feat. If the proctor has levels in another class that grants a familiar, levels in that class and the proctor class stack for determining the overall abilities of her familiar.",

			"**Soultended (Ex):** Upon death, a proctor's soul appears on one of the neutral Outer Planes that corresponds to her monitor demigod and begins the gradual transformation into an {family/aeon}, {family/inevitable}, {family/protean}, or {family/psychopomp}. A character attempting to resurrect a slain proctor must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the proctor's character level or the spell fails. That character cannot attempt to resurrect the proctor again until 24 hours have passed, though other characters can still attempt to do so. The comforting inevitability of this fate grants the proctor a +2 bonus on Will saves.",
			"",
			"**Monitor Expression (Su):** At 2nd level, a proctor must select a specific expression of her role for her monitor demigod. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Although a proctor's expression often aligns with her demigod, this isn't a strict requirement. Each expression provides a different benefit to the proctor.",

The foster can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to her proctor level. These rounds need not be consecutive. At 5th level, the duration increases to 1 minute, and the foster can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her proctor level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments.",

			"Harmonizers bring balance to opposing factions, and most often align with the Monad.

At 5th level, this deflection bonus increases to +4.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Monitor Boon:** As a proctor gains levels, she gains boons from her monitor demigod. The nature of the boons varies depending on the proctor's chosen demigod. A monitor demigod grants three boons, each more powerful than the last. At 3rd level, the proctor gains the first boon. At 6th level, she gains the second boon, and at 9th level, she gains the third boon. Consult the {feat/Monitor Obedience} feat and the monitor demigod descriptions for details on monitor boons.",
			"",
			"When a monitor demigod grants a spell-like ability, the proctor's level for the spell-like ability is equal to her total character level. This ability allows a proctor to access these boons earlier than normal; it does not grant additional uses of the boons once the character reaches the necessary Hit Dice to earn the boons normally.",
			"",
			"**Summon Monitor (Sp):** At 4th level, a proctor can cast [summon monster VI](spell/summon_monster_6) once per day to conjure monitors based on her monitor expression. An executor can summon one {monster/Axiomite}, 1d3 {monster/mercane/s}, or 1d4+1 {monster/novenarut/s}. A foster can summon one {monster/vanth}, 1d3 {monster/morbai/s}, or 1d4+1 {monster/catrina/s}.

A harmonizer can summon one {monster/akhana}, 1d3 {monster/jyoti}, or 1d4+1 {monster/theletos}. An impulsive can summon one {monster/ibshaunet}, 1d3 {monster/illureshi/s}, or 1d4+1 {monster/naunet/s}. At the GM's discretion, specific monitor demigods may allow proctors who worship them to summon other neutral outsiders of equal power with this ability.",
			"",
			"**Solemn Voice (Su):** At 7th level, the proctor gains an ability based on her monitor expression. Executors and impulsives can speak with any creature that has a language, as {spell/tongues}. A foster can cast {spell/speak with dead} as a spell-like ability at will. A harmonizer gains telepathy with a range of 30 feet but cannot communicate telepathically with creatures immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Expression Immunities (Su):** At 10th level, the proctor gains one or more immunities based on her monitor expression. Executors are immune to ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain. Fosters are immune to death effects, disease, and poison. Harmonizers are immune to critical hits. Impulsives are immune to transmutation effects, except those they willingly accept."

Currency or gems used in this way must be on the prophet's person, and goods other than standard currency or precious gems cannot be sacrificed to use this ability.

They are the chosen of the gods, and they often hold status nearly equal to that of a chief or shaman in a typical tribe, or sometimes even exceeding this. Rage prophets can dispense advice through their communion with the spirits and ability to divine the future.",
			"",
			"Rage prophets are always barbarian/oracles, though some have levels in other classes as well. The most popular oracle mystery among rage prophets is that of battle, for skill in battle is respected in barbarian society, but oracles of all mysteries find their way into positions as war-chiefs, counselors, and leaders. Some rage prophets choose to live apart or to act as wandering champions, belonging to all tribes and none, following the lead of their spirit guides rather than the dictates of any one tribal chief or council. Though sometimes looked at askance by tribal leaders, these wanderers are popular with many barbarians, who see them as the perfect exemplars of the strength, virtue, and power of the free folk, owing nothing to anyone but the sky above, the earth beneath, and the spirits within.",
			"",
			"**Role:** The rage prophet has considerable spellcasting ability, but it usually serves as a conduit to enhance his fighting prowess. His combat skills are considerable and his ability to keep himself going in any fight and to focus his physical rage into supernatural power gives him an unexpected boost in power and versatility to overcome any challenge.",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** Rage prophets may be of any nonlawful alignment, but chaotic alignments are more common, as they are in the barbarian tribes from which they hail. Wandering rage prophets are usually chaotic, living apart from any tribe and the tribal structure of their heritage as they take up the adventuring life.",

			"",
			"**Spirit Guardian (Sp):** At 5th level, the competence bonus provided by the spirit guide's guidance spell increases to half the rage prophet's class level when used while battling a fey, outsider, undead, or incorporeal creature. As a swift action, the rage prophet can spend 1 round of rage (whether he is raging or not) to give his armor and weapons the ghost touch property for 1 round; this effect ends if the item is no longer in his possession.",

They roam the lands spreading word of the power of Razmir, and using that power to convince the unfaithful of their misplaced loyalties in other gods and governments.",

If she wields a magical sawtooth sabre in her hand when she transforms, the magical enhancements on that weapon apply to her corresponding claw attack-if she wields two of them, then the enhancements each apply to their respective claw attacks. As she gains levels, her mantis form gains additional powers, as detailed below.",

The save DC to remove each of these negative levels is equal to 20 + the Red Mantis assassin's Constitution modifier. Each negative level inflicted in this manner grants the Red Mantis assassin 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour.

She must choose to activate this ability before the weapon's attack roll or the spell's effects are adjudicated. This grants the Red Mantis assassin a 50% chance to avoid taking damage from the attack or effect.",

The wrenching redirection deals 1d6 points of damage per class level to the redirected creature. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the Riftwarden's character level + the Riftwarden's Cha modifier) halves the damage and negates the redirection. In addition, when a conjuration effect causes a creature to appear in a square threatened by the Riftwarden, that creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the Riftwarden.",

			"**Planar Purge (Su):** At 8th level, an extraplanar creature that fails its save against a Riftwarden's planar channel is banished to its home plane (as the banishment spell; no save). Extraplanar creatures with Hit Dice greater than twice the Riftwarden's class level are unaffected by this ability, but still take damage from planar channel as normal.",

In addition, as a full-round action, the Riftwarden can expend two uses of her planar channel ability to forcibly recall a creature that used teleportation to exit an area within 30 feet of the Riftwarden since the end of the Riftwarden's last turn. Planar channel deals damage equal to the amount normally dealt by one use of planar channel. This damage affects only that target, and affects it regardless of its current distance from the Riftwarden. If the target fails its save, the teleportation effect is reversed and the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied by another creature)."

The save DC of any saving throw called for by an insurgent technique is equal to 10 + the rose warden's class level + her Intelligence modifier. Spell-like abilities have a caster level equal to the rose warden's class level.",
			"",
			"**Everbloom's Wrath (Sp):** The rose warden selects either chaos hammer or holy smite. She can use that spell once per day as a spell-like ability. If a rose warden chooses this technique a second time, she gains the ability to cast the other spell once per day as well.",
			"",
			"**Holy Thorns (Su):** Once per day as a swift action, the rose warden can cause thorns to magically sprout from her weapon. The weapon counts as good-aligned for purposes of overcoming DR. A lawful or evil target damaged by this weapon must succeed at a Fortitude save or be wracked with pain and become staggered for 1 round. The thorns dissipate after a number of rounds equal to the rose warden's class level.",
			"",
			"**Rogue Talent:** A rose warden can select one rogue talent for which she qualifies. Her rose warden levels stack with rogue levels for the purpose of any rogue talents she has with level-dependent effects, whether they were gained from this prestige class or another class.",

			"**Street Sentinel (Ex):** A rose warden gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and Knowledge (local), Perception, Stealth, and Survival checks when she is in an urban area. Whenever she is traveling in urban terrain, a rose warden leaves no trail and can't be tracked (though she can leave a trail if she chooses). At 6th level, this bonus increases to +4.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack (Ex):** This ability is exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The extra damage dealt starts at +1d6 and increases by 1d6 every 2 levels (4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th). If a rose warden gets sneak attack bonuses from other sources, the bonuses on damage rolls stack.",

			"",
			"**Insurrectionist (Su):** At 4th level, a rose warden can ignore impediments to her mobility. For a number of rounds per day equal to her rose warden level, she can move normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if she were affected by freedom of movement. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. In addition, once per day she can grant this ability to all allies within 30 feet. This effect occurs automatically as soon as it applies.",

			"",
			"**Wall of Roses (Sp):** Once per day, the rose warden can cast wall of thorns as a spell-like ability. The wall consists of a dense tangle of roses through which worshipers of Milani can pass with ease. The wall of roses heals at a rate of 5 hit points per round; it is immune to fire damage; and all piercing damage it deals bypasses damage reduction as if it were a good, magic, and silver weapon. Evil and lawful creatures damaged by a wall of roses automatically become sickened for the next minute (this is a poison effect).",
			"",
			"**Obfuscate (Su):** At 7th level, a rose warden can use the Stealth skill even while she is being observed. While she is in an urban area, a rose warden can hide in the open even without actually having anything to hide behind.",

			"",
			"**Smite Tyranny (Su):** At 10th level, when a rose warden deals sneak attack damage to a lawful or evil target, she can choose to smite tyranny as a free action. The rose warden deals an additional 2 points of damage per sneak attack die rolled to the target. The target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 20 + the rose warden's Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round by the blow. A lawful evil target is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds. The rose warden can smite tyranny a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier."

			"The ancient traditions of Thassilonian magic became mired in the culture of sin due to the legacy of that land's runelords, but taken in its purest form, Thassilonian magic is no more good than evil. Indeed, at Thassilon's outset-before the runelords seized control-the original incarnations of these seven schools of magic were not associated with sins at all, but rather with the seven virtues of rule. This original lore is all but lost, but within the city-states of Varisia (particularly in Magnimar), a small order of spellcasters seeks to reclaim the knowledge of those empowering virtues. With the might of virtuous runes, they protect their homes from the lingering evil of Thassilon and look to the guidance of Soralyon, the Mystic Angel, to aid them in their quest. These spellcasters have also come to believe that a runelord's return to power is practically an inevitable threat that must be prepared for and defended against.",

He must choose one of the seven virtues when he gains this ability, but can choose another at 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th levels; by 9th level, he has mastered all seven of the secrets of virtuous runes.

He need not expend uses from a healer's kit when treating deadly wounds in this manner, and using this rune does not count against the total number of times a creature can benefit from heaving deadly wounds treated in a day.",
			"",
			"**Generosity:** When using the aid another action, the runeguard can draw upon the rune of generosity and expend a prepared spell or spell slot as an immediate action to grant an ally an insight bonus on attack rolls, on skill checks, or to Armor Class equal to the level of spell expended. The bonus persists for a number of rounds equal to the runeguard's class level.",

All allies to be affected must be within 30 feet at the time the rune is used. Until the next time the runeguard prepares spells (at which point he regains the sacrificed spell or spell slot), each ally can sense the general emotional state, health, and direction of any other ally bearing the rune (as per status), as long as they are on the same plane. If a spell slot of 5th level or higher is sacrificed, the link also grants a telepathic bond (as per the spell) that can't be dispelled. A character with the rune of love active gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.",

			"**Zeal:** By invoking the rune of zeal as a swift action, the runeguard bolsters his spellcasting for 1 round. During this time, the runeguard gains a bonus on all concentration checks equal to his runeguard level, and he can enhance any spell he casts that round with the effects of any metamagic feat he knows, provided the metamagic feat only uses up a spell slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level.",

			"**Rune Focus:** At 3rd level, the runeguard adds 1 to the DCs of saving throws against glyph or symbol spells (any spell with \"glyph\" or \"symbol\" in its name) and spells that are language dependent that he casts. This bonus stacks with the bonuses from the {feat/Spell Focus} and {feat/Greater Spell Focus} feats. At 7th level, the runeguard adds 2 to the DCs of saving throws against these spells that he casts.",
			"",
			"**Sihedron Rune Mastery (Su):** At 10th level, a runeguard can cast permanency as a spell-like ability once per day by drawing upon the power of the Sihedron rune. He must still provide the spell to be made permanent by other means, of course. Although a runeguard can use this ability once per day, he can only ever maintain a single spell effect, and upon using this ability, the previous permanent spell effect immediately ends."

Among the followers of Torag, some feel drawn to devote themselves to these later aspects of the Father of Creation. Known as sacred sentinels, these holy warriors view themselves as mortal shields of defense in Torag's service, and seek to place themselves where defenders are most needed. Many speak of themselves as pillars, strong structures that can hold up a vast building but only by supporting the other beams and supports needed. The pillar is the source of the strength, but its strength must serve to support a network of other beams or it accomplishes little.",

The majority of sacred sentinels are dwarves, but other races that worship Torag are sometimes called to serve. For example, in the frozen Lands of the Linnorm Kings, there exists a relatively obscure but long-standing order known as the \"Linnorm Guard.\" This small number of Ulfen fighters are unusually lawful in their outlook, considering the brutality and chaos their barbaric kin often embrace.

As long as these allies remain within 30 feet of the sacred sentinel, they gain a +3 bonus to their CMDs and on Constitution checks to stabilize when dying.

For cavaliers, this determines the effectiveness of her challenge class feature. For paladins, this determines the effectiveness of her smite evil class feature. For warpriests, this determines how many times per day she can use her blessings.",

			"**Healing Touch (Su):** At 3rd level, a sacred sentinel can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by her touch. Each day, she can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + 1/2 her sacred sentinel level. If she has established her strategic protection, she can use this ability on a selected ally within range of the aura without having to successfully touch the ally.

For a number of rounds equal to the sacred sentinel's class level, whenever the ally fights defensively, uses the full defense action, or uses {feat/Combat Expertise}, the ally gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 sacred bonus on saving throws.

If the sacred sentinel has her strategic protection active and is killed through any means, she does not immediately die. Instead she remains alive and active until the beginning of her next turn, at which point she dies normally.

Rather than expend a daily use of enduring scars, he can activate a scar by taking 1 point of damage per Hit Die he has.

If this damage would kill the scar seeker, his blood coalesces in his space in the form of a lawful good {monster/monadic deva} that fights in his place for 1 minute before dissipating.

			"",
			"**Legal Judgment (Ex):** A shieldmarshal can pronounce legal judgment upon his foes as a swift action, providing a bonus or ability based on the type of judgment made. Once activated, the ability lasts until the combat ends. If the shieldmarshal is dazed, frightened, panicked, paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to participate in combat, the effect does not end but provides no benefit until he is again able to participate in combat. As a swift action, the shieldmarshal can change his legal judgment to another type.",
			"",
			"This ability can be used once per day, plus once for every three levels beyond 1st. It is equivalent to an inquisitor's judgment ability for the purpose of feats, magic items, or other game effects that affect the judgment ability; however, levels in the two classes do not stack.",

			"",
			"**Urban Commando (Ex):** At 5th level, a shieldmarshal treats urban areas as his favored terrain, as the ranger class feature. At 10th level, his favored terrain bonus increases to +4 but he does not gain a second favored terrain. If he already has a favored terrain bonus in urban terrain from another class, these bonuses stack but do not affect bonuses in other terrain types.",
			"",
			"**Gunhunter (Ex):** A shieldmarshal is well versed in covert operations, especially in urban settings. At 6th level, the shieldmarshal can move through crowds and difficult terrain without impediment in urban terrain. He can use Stealth to hide in urban terrain even without cover or concealment; if he has cover or concealment, he gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to 1/2 his class level.",

			"**Double Jeopardy (Ex):** At 8th level, whenever a shieldmarshal uses his legal judgment ability, he selects two different judgments, instead of one. This consumes only one use of his legal judgment ability. As a swift action, he can change one of these effects to another type.",

He can expend one use of his legal judgment ability to create a nonmagical effect equivalent to discern lies (caster level equal to his class level; DC = 20 + the shieldmarshal's Wisdom modifier), or expend one use as part of an initiative check or Charisma-based skill check to take 20 on that check."

			"Perhaps no event so shaped dwarven history or culture as the legendary Quest for Sky. Spurred by the words of their prophets, the ancient dwarves abandoned their homes deep within the subterranean realm of Nar-Voth and began the perilous search for the sky over 5 millennia ago. For 300 years, the dwarves fought their way upward, driving their hated enemies-the orcs-before them. When they finally breached the surface, these legendary heroes built 10 grand fortresses across the face of Golarion-the 10 magnificent Sky Citadels.",

			"",
			"Those dwarves who commit themselves to making this dream a reality are known as the skyseekers. They travel the width and breadth of Avistan as well as Garund, unearthing every scrap of dwarven history and lore they can find. Many form expeditions to explore the dwarven ruins left behind by their ancestors during the migration, often battling the foul creatures that lurk beneath Golarion's surface in their search for knowledge.

When wielded by the skyseeker against a creature with the giant, goblin, or orc subtype, the weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful hit. As a free action, the skyseeker may also identify the weapon by name when making an Intimidate check against such creatures, granting him a competence bonus on his Intimidate check equal to 1/2 his class level (minimum +1).",

			"",
			"**Rune-Carved Armor (Su):** At 2nd level, a skyseeker learns how to imbue his armor with a small semblance of the magical resistance his dwarven ancestors were renowned for. Against spells and spell-like abilities, he gains a deflection bonus to touch AC equal to his armor bonus. This bonus can't exceed his skyseeker level. This ability functions only while the skyseeker wears armor.",
			"",
			"**Commune (Sp):** At 3rd level, a skyseeker's bond with the spirits of his ancestors grows stronger, allowing him to use the spell commune once per week as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to the skyseeker's class level).",
			"",
			"**Dwarven Armor Training (Ex):** By studying the arts of his ancestors, the skyseeker learns the secret techniques of his forebears' forges and fighting styles. At 4th level, the skyseeker gains heavy armor proficiency, and he still benefits from his ranger combat style (if he has one) while wearing heavy armor.",
			"",
			"**Darkvision (Ex):** At 5th level, a skyseeker grows more comfortable operating in the lightless depths of the dwarven ancestral homelands. He gains darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If he already has darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet. At 7th level, the range of the skyseeker's darkvision increases by an additional 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Runes of Resistance (Su):** At 6th level, a skyseeker can use his armor to shrug off all manner of magical attacks for a short period of time. As a move action, the skyseeker can gain spell resistance equal to 5 + his Hit Dice if wearing light armor or 10 + his Hit Dice if wearing medium or heavy armor. Dismissing this ability is a swift action. A skyseeker can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to his class level. These rounds need not be consecutive.",
			"",

			"**Stalwart (Ex):** At 9th level, a skyseeker has honed his mental resiliency to avoid certain attacks. If he succeeds at a Fortitude or Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the skyseeker is wearing light armor, medium armor, or no armor. A helpless skyseeker does not gain the benefit of the stalwart ability.",

			"**Call to Arms (Sp):** At 10th level, a skyseeker grows so attuned with the spirits of his ancestors that he can channel them into the physical world to battle his enemies. Once per day as a full-round action, he can summon up to 1d4+1 ghostly dwarven allies, who must appear within 60 feet of the skyseeker. These dwarves function exactly as an ally produced by the spell spiritual ally (caster level equal to the skyseeker's class level), except that they always appear as dwarves wielding warhammers and they share the skyseeker's favored enemy and favored terrain bonuses (if any). On subsequent turns the skyseeker can direct a single dwarven ally to move as a swift action, or he can direct multiple allies to move simultaneously as a move action."

			"**Follow Clues (Ex):** At 2nd level, a Sleepless detective can use Perception to follow tracks as per the Survival skill, as though she possessed the follow clues [rogue talent](ability/rogue_talents).

The detective is entitled to an immediate Perception check to notice such features whenever she passes within 10 feet of them, whether or not she is actively looking. This check should be made in secret by the GM.

			"",
			"**Predictive Riposte (Ex):** At 8th level, a Sleepless detective's insight into human nature allows her to predict and counter her opponents' attacks. As a standard action, she can designate an opponent within 30 feet as the target of her predictive riposte, gaining a +4 insight bonus to AC against that opponent's attacks. Once per round, after a melee attack from the designated target misses her, the detective can spend an immediate action to make a single melee attack against that opponent as long as it is within her threatened area. This counts as her attack of opportunity for this round. If the detective's attack hits, she may add her sneak attack bonus on her damage roll. The bonuses from this ability last until the end of combat, or until the detective designates a new target of her predictive riposte.",
			"",
			"**Pierce Deception (Sp):** At 9th level, a Sleepless detective can see as though under the effect of the spell true seeing for a number of rounds per day equal to her class level (caster level equal to her class level).

			"",
			"**Reconstruction (Su):** At 10th level, once per day a Sleepless detective can combine her investigative insight with her magical senses to mentally reconstruct the recent history of an item or place. The detective must be able to examine the item or area for 10 minutes, after which she can view the events of the past 24 hours as though she had a scrying sensor present when those events took place. This ability shows her any events which took place within 60 feet of the examined area, or any creature or object that physically touched the item or area in question. Her vision is not obstructed by concealment, and she can see and identify magical auras as though under the effect of arcane sight. A reconstruction shows creatures and objects as they actually are, unobscured by even powerful illusion magic such as screen, though transmuted creatures and objects appear in their altered forms."

This ability functions exactly like a cleric's ability to channel positive energy to deal damage to undead (but not to heal living creatures), and counts as channel energy for the purposes of qualifying for feats or determining effects that rely on channel energy.

The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the soul warden's level + the soul warden's Cha modifier). Failure means the creature falls under the soul warden's control, obeying his commands to the best of its ability for a number of rounds equal to the soul warden's class level. This ability is otherwise identical to control undead.",

Any undead creatures with fewer Hit Dice than his caster level cannot enter the warded area. Undead with Hit Dice greater than or equal to the soul warden's caster level must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + soul warden's level) when entering the area. An undead that succeeds at its save is unharmed, and is immune to the soul warden's negative energy ward for 24 hours. Failure means the creature takes 3d6 points of positive energy damage when it enters the area and it becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once placed, a negative energy ward cannot be moved. The ward lasts 1 minute per soul warden level.",
			"",
			"**Necrotic Resistance (Su):** At 8th level, a soul warden becomes resistant to ability drain and negative levels. Whenever a soul warden is targeted by an effect that would result in ability drain or impose negative levels, he takes 1 point of ability drain fewer and gains 1 negative level fewer than he normally would (to a minimum of 0). At 10th level, he takes 2 fewer points of ability drain and gains 2 fewer negative levels than he normally would.",
			"",
			"**Life Shell (Sp):** At 10th level, a soul warden can create a dome of energy that repels undead creatures. This ability functions identically to antilife shell, except it hedges out only undead creatures and not creatures of any other type. Living creatures within the affected area gain fast healing 1 for the duration of the effect. A soul warden can activate this spell-like ability for up to 10 minutes per day. The duration need not be consecutive, but it must be expended in 1-minute increments."

For example, if she sets her landmark in Magnimar and later travels to Korvosa, she can determine that Magnimar is roughly west of her current location. The landmark doesn't have to be a city or any kind of recognizable site-it could be in the middle of the ocean or even midair. This is a scrying effect. A landmark location is one category more familiar for the purpose of teleporting (\"studied carefully\" becomes \"very familiar\" and so on). A spherewalker can have one landmark per class level. She can discard an existing landmark as a standard action and does not need to be at that location to discard it. Spherewalkers can take a minute to share a landmark with another spherewalker, and often do so to arrange meetings in unusual places without the need for maps or directions. A spherewalker can only detect the location of landmarks on her current plane, though they do not vanish if she leaves the plane and she can reference them if she returns to that plane.",

			"",
			"**Spells per Day:** When a spherewalker gains a level, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of spherewalker to the level of whatever other spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day and caster level accordingly.",

A 5th-level spherewalker would thus have a spell slot for one domain spell from 1st to 5th level spells. The number of bonus spells and spell save DCs are set by the spherewalker's Wisdom score.",

			"**Efficient Sleep (Su):** At 2nd level, a spherewalker gains a +4 sacred bonus to resist sleep effects and only needs 4 hours of sleep (or restful calm, for creatures that do not need actual sleep) instead of the normal 8 hours to become rested. Most spherewalkers prefer to sleep the normal amount, and if they use this ability they like to make up for it on later days by sleeping late.",

			"",
			"**Dream Link (Sp):** A 3rd-level spherewalker can form a mental bond with another willing intelligent creature as if using the telepathic bond spell. To do so, she and the target must spend at least 4 hours sleeping within 10 feet of each other. Either person in the link can end it as a standard action; otherwise it is permanent. If one person in the link dies, the other is stunned for 1 round and staggered until she can rest for 10 minutes. A spherewalker can only maintain one such link at a time, though she may be the recipient of multiple links. Married spherewalkers often link themselves to their spouses.",

In swarm form, she has a space of 10 feet (roughly filling the entire area) but can shape this space to fill four contiguous squares (such as a 5-foot by 20-foot line, an L-shaped cloud, and so on) and can squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of her component forms.

Unlike most swarms, a spherewalker in swarm form does not do swarm damage to creatures she's swarming over. The swarm form is immune to weapon damage but is vulnerable to mundane fire attacks (torches, alchemical fire, burning oil, and so on), and energy attacks from weapon (such as flaming and frost) deal full damage even though the basic weapon damage has no effect. Although a swarm cannot make attacks, the spherewalker can cast spells as normal while in swarm form (although spells with material components could prove difficult).",

			"",
			"**AC Bonus (Ex):** A stalwart defender receives a dodge bonus to AC that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.",
			"",
			"**Defensive Stance (Ex):** At 1st level, a stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance, a position of readiness and trancelike determination. A stalwart defender can maintain this stance for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, he can maintain the stance for 2 additional rounds per day. Temporary increases to Constitution, such as those gained from the defensive stance and spells like bear's endurance, do not increase the total number of rounds that the stalwart defender can maintain a defensive stance per day. The stalwart defender can enter a defensive stance as a free action. The total number of rounds of defensive stance per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC, a +4 morale bonus to his Strength and Constitution, as well as a +2 morale bonus on Will saves. The increase to Constitution grants the stalwart defender 2 hit points per Hit Die, but these hit points disappear when the defensive stance ends and are not lost first like temporary hit points. While in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender cannot willingly move from his current position through any means (including normal movement, riding a mount, teleportation, or willingly allowing allies to carry him). If he enters a defensive stance while on a moving vehicle he does not control (such as a wagon or ship), he can maintain the stance even if the vehicle moves. If the stalwart defender moves under his own power as a result of an enemy's successful use of the Bluff skill or an enchantment spell, his stance ends.",
			"",
			"The stalwart defender can end his defensive stance as a free action; after ending the stance, he is fatigued for a number of rounds equal to 2 times the number of rounds spent in the stance. A stalwart defender cannot enter a new defensive stance while fatigued or exhausted but can otherwise enter a stance multiple times during a single encounter or combat. If a stalwart defender falls unconscious, his defensive stance immediately ends, placing him in peril of death.",
			"",
			"A defensive stance requires a level of emotional calm, and it may not be maintained by a character in a rage (such as from the rage class feature or the rage spell).",
			"",
			"**Defensive Powers (Ex):** As a stalwart defender gains levels, he augments his defensive stance. Starting at 2nd level, the stalwart defender gains a defensive power. He gains another defensive power for every two levels of stalwart defender attained after 2nd level. The stalwart defender gains the benefits of defensive powers only while in a defensive stance, and some of these powers require him to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, he cannot select an individual power more than once.",
			"",
			"**Bulwark (Ex):** The defender adds his armor check penalty as a bonus to the DC of opponents attempting to Bluff him and Acrobatics checks to pass by him without provoking an attack of opportunity for moving through spaces he threatens.",
			"",
			"**Clear Mind (Ex):** The stalwart defender may reroll a failed Will save. This power is used as an immediate action after the first save is attempted, but before the results are revealed by the GM. The stalwart defender must take the second result, even if it is worse. This power can only be used once per defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Fearless Defense (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the shaken and frightened conditions. He must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.",
			"",
			"**Halting Blow (Ex):** If a foe's movement in the defender's threatened area provokes an attack of opportunity and the stalwart defender successfully hits the foe with the attack, the foe's movement ends immediately. The foe cannot move again until its next turn but can still take the rest of its action. A stalwart defender must have selected the bulwark power prior to selecting halting blow.",
			"",
			"**Immobile (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender adds his class level to his CMD against any bull rush, overrun, pull, and push combat maneuvers, as well as grapple attempts to move him. The stalwart defender must be at least 4th level to select this power.",
			"",
			"**Increased Damage Reduction (Ex):** The stalwart defender's damage reduction from this class increases by 1/-. This increase is always active while the stalwart defender is in a defensive stance. He can select this power up to two times. Its effects stack. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level before selecting this defensive power.",
			"",
			"**Intercept (Ex):** Once a round as an immediate action, when a melee or ranged weapon would successfully strike an adjacent ally, the stalwart defender can choose to have the weapon strike him instead of the intended target. The attack automatically hits the stalwart defender, regardless his AC or any miss chance in effect, and he suffers the normal consequences of the attack.",
			"",
			"**Internal Fortitude (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender is immune to the sickened and nauseated conditions.",
			"",
			"**Mighty Resilience (Ex):** The stalwart defender automatically negates the additional damage of one successful critical hit or sneak attack, as well as other abilities or effects that rely on a successful critical hit or sneak attack (such as blinding from Blinding Critical or bleed from sneak attack). The stalwart defender takes only normal damage from the attack. This power may only be used once per defensive stance. The stalwart defender must be at least 6th level to select this power.",
			"",
			"**Renewed Defense (Ex):** As a standard action, the stalwart defender heals 1d8 points of damage + his Constitution modifier. For every two levels the stalwart defender has attained above 2nd, this healing increases by 1d8, to a maximum of 5d8 at 10th level. This power can be used only once per day and only while in a defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Roused Defense (Ex):** The stalwart defender may enter a defensive stance even if fatigued. While maintaining a defensive stance after using this ability, he is immune to the fatigued condition. Once this stance ends, he is exhausted for 10 minutes per round spent in a defensive stance.",
			"",
			"**Smash (Ex):** While in a defensive stance, the stalwart defender may make an extra attack per round that is either a shield bash or a slam (even if he doesn't normally have a slam attack). If used as part of a full attack action, the extra attack is made at the stalwart defender's full base attack bonus -5. The smash deals 1d4 points of damage (if the stalwart defender is Medium, or 1d3 if he is Small) plus half the character's Strength modifier. The character can make this attack as part of the action to maintain or break free from a grapple; this attack is resolved before the grapple check is made. If the attack hits, any grapple checks made by the stalwart defender against the target this round are at a +2 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Unexpected Strike (Ex):** The stalwart defender can make an attack of opportunity against a foe that moves into any square threatened by the stalwart defender, regardless of whether or not that movement would normally provoke an attack of opportunity. This power can only be used once per stance. A stalwart defender must be at least 4th level before selecting this power.",
			"",
			"**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 3rd level, a stalwart defender gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He cannot be caught flat-footed, even if the attacker is invisible. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. A stalwart defender with this ability can still lose his Dexterity bonus to AC if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against him.",
			"",
			"If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).",
			"",
			"**Damage Reduction (Ex):** At 5th level, a stalwart defender gains DR 1/-. At 7th level, this DR increases to 3/-, and at 10th level it increases to 5/-. Damage reduction from different sources does not stack; however, a stalwart defender of 5th or higher level that gains DR from armor (but not from any other source) increases his class-based DR by the value of the armor's DR. Thus a 7th-level stalwart defender wearing adamantine full plate (DR 3/-) has DR 6/-.",
			"",
			"**Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** At 7th level, a stalwart defender can no longer be flanked. This defense denies rogues the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the stalwart defender. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least four levels higher than the stalwart defender can flank him (and thus sneak attack him).",
			"",
			"If the character gains uncanny dodge from a second class (see above), he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.",
			"",
			"**Mobile Defense (Ex):** At 9th level, a stalwart defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.",
			"",
			"**Last Word (Ex):** Once per day, while in a defensive stance, a stalwart defender can make one melee attack against an opponent within reach in response to an attack that would reduce him to negative hit points, knock him unconscious, or kill him. For example, a stalwart defender has 1 hit point left when a red dragon bites him; the defender may use this ability even if the dragon's bite would otherwise kill him instantly. If the attack hits, roll the damage dice for the attack twice and add the results together, but do not multiply damage bonuses from Strength, weapon abilities (such as flaming), or precision-based damage (such as sneak attack). This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit (although other damage bonuses are multiplied normally). Once the defender's attack is resolved, he suffers the normal effect of the attack that provoked this ability."

This includes weapons with chains (such as flails, nunchaku, and spiked chains), a kyton's armor and weapons, chains animated by animate objects, and so on.

			"",
			"**Talmandor's Fury (Su):** At 7th level, once per day as a standard action, a Steel Falcon can channel her rage at the injustice in the world, transforming her countenance into a terrifying display of righteous fury, giving her a fear aura with a range of 30 feet. Enemies within this radius are affected by a fear spell (CL 10th, Will DC 15 + the Steel Falcon's Charisma bonus).

			"",
			"**Echoing Thunder (Su):** At 9th level, anytime a Storm Kindler resists electricity or sonic damage with her oceanic spirit ability, she can spend an immediate action to redirect the damage to another creature within 30 feet. The creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the Storm Kindler's class level + the Storm Kindler's Wisdom modifier) or take an amount of electricity or sonic damage equal to the amount the Storm Kindler resisted.",
			"",
			"**Storm Mastery (Su):** At 10th level, a Storm Kindler becomes one with the relentless fury of the storm, allowing her to use her storm shape ability at will. In addition to this, she gains a fly speed equal to double her base land speed, and gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality.

			"**Pouncing Beasts:** These bestial pictographs seem poised to leap off the mystic's skin. The mystic can cast summon monster and summon nature's ally spells of up to 3rd level as a standard action, rather than a full-round action, provided all the creatures summoned enter play adjacent to him. The maximum spell level the tattoo can affect increases by 2 each time it's selected, to a maximum of 9th level.",
			"",
			"**Rune of Fangs:** These jagged runes cover the mystic's face, giving him a bestial expression. While polymorphed or otherwise transformed into a form with natural attacks, the mystic gains an enhancement bonus on his attack and damage rolls equal to 1/2 his level with one natural attack, chosen when he assumes that form. Each time he selects this tattoo, he can choose one additional natural attack to apply the bonus to.",
			"",
			"**Swallowing Glyph:** This ornate, shadowy glyph absorbs the souls of those the mystic slays. Any time the mystic slays a creature with a necromancy spell, he can spend a swift action to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the spell's level. Temporary hit points gained from subsequent uses of this ability do not stack. The second time this tattoo is selected, the number of temporary hit points increases to double the spell's level. The third time it's selected, the number increases to triple the spell's level.",

			"**Twisting Script:** The indistinct shapes that form this spiral tattoo twist into legible text when scrutinized. Creatures within 30 feet of the mystic that can see him are affected by his language-dependent enchantment spells, even if they do not understand the language he speaks. Creatures without a language are immune to this effect. The range of the effect increases by 30 feet each time this tattoo is selected, to a maximum of 150 feet.",

			"",
			"**Tattoo Mastery (Ex):** At 7th level, a tattooed mystic can use his own ability score modifier and relevant feats to set the DC for spell tattoos he crafts, and can use his own caster level if it is higher than that of the spell tattoo he is crafting (similar to a caster using a staff).",
			"",

(Additional technology-related spells can be added to this list at the GM's discretion.) If the spell chosen isn't one that's normally on his class spell list, he adds it to his class spell list at the level a wizard casts the spell. The spell chosen must be of a spell level he would otherwise be able to cast. If he prepares spells, he can prepare this spell one additional time in excess of the normal maximum number of spells he can prepare. If he casts spells spontaneously, he adds the spell to his spells known, and can cast this spell once per day without using a daily spell slot.",

			"",
			"**Arcane Battery (Su):** At 3rd level as a swift action, a technomancer can expend an unused spell slot (if he's a spontaneous caster) or a prepared spell (if he prepares spells) to power a technological device he touches. Each spell level expended in this way grants the device 1 charge. Any charges unused at the end of the round are lost, and any charges used by the device that round that aren't provided by the technomancer must come from the device's own power reserves. He can use this ability to power timeworn technology. He can't power devices that don't use charges.",
			"",
			"**Study Technology (Ex):** At 3rd level, a technomancer can study a robot, technological object, or technological trap within 30 feet as a move action and attempt a Knowledge (engineering) check to identify it. If he succeeds, he gains a competence bonus equal to 1/2 his level on attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, saving throws, and skill checks involving the studied creature, object, or trap, as well as a dodge bonus of the same amount against attacks from the subject of his study. This bonus lasts a number of rounds equal to his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If he studies a new subject, he loses his bonus against the previous subject.",

He trades in each item for an amount of crafting potential based on a fraction of its crafting cost (not price), as described below. He can use this potential and his technological crafting feats to make a new item. For example, a technomancer could use a broken laser pistol in place of 500 gp for crafting technological items (10% of the laser pistol's crafting cost of 5,000 gp). He then follows the normal rules for [crafting a technological item](rule/crafting_high_tech_items), except that he must pay at least 50% of the crafting cost using recycled technology. If he pays 100% of the cost in this fashion, he crafts the item at double the normal speed. In the process of cannibalizing the old items, the new items are destroyed and any excess gold value is lost. The item he creates is considered timeworn technology, even if new items were broken down to build it.

The robot can resist the effects of this ability by succeeding at a Will saving throw against a DC of 10 + 1/2 the technomancer's class level + the technomancer's Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher). At 7th level, a technomancer can use this ability twice per day, and at 9th level he can use it three times per day. This ability otherwise functions as suggestion, save that it is not mind-affecting and can only affect constructs with the robot subtype.",
			"",
			"**Unified Energy (Su):** At 6th level, a technomancer can draw power from a technological device in his possession to cast a spell he knows (if a spontaneous caster) or a spell he currently has prepared (if he prepares spells) without expending a spell slot or prepared spell. He consumes 2 charges from the device for each spell level of the spell being cast. In the process of casting the spell, he can apply any of his metamagic feats, using a number of charges appropriate to the increase in spell level, but he cannot exceed the highest effective level of spell he is able to cast. He can use this ability multiple times per day, but never in excess of a number of charges equal to twice his technomancer level (so at 6th level, he can consume no more than 12 charges per day using this ability).",
			"",
			"**Applied Learning (Ex):** At 8th level, when a technomancer succeeds at a saving throw against a technological effect that has reduced effects on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. A helpless or flat-footed technomancer does not benefit from this ability.",
			"",
			"**Field Improvisation (Ex):** At 10th level, a technomancer can recycle technology with astounding speed. Each hour of crafting when using his recycle technology ability is equivalent to 8 hours of uninterrupted crafting; he can perform up to 8 hours of such amazingly efficient work per day. Any item he completes is treated as reconditioned for the remainder of that day. It can be added permanently to his group of reconditioned items if he has an available slot or stops maintaining one of his current reconditioned items."

Their cultivars and gardeners were renowned, but such peaceful pursuits waned in prominence when the expansionist pharaohs of Osirion remade the land into a staging ground for war against the Jistka Imperium to the west. The old ways nearly became extinct, yet the lore of the desert's delicate blooms never entirely disappeared.",

			"**Healing Solution (Su):** A Thuvian alchemist learns how to convert magical reagents into life-giving admixtures. As a full-round action, she can convert the magical energies of two extracts or spells of 1st level into a special extract of cure light wounds. This acts as an infused extract, but it must be used before the end of her next turn or its power is lost.

The Thuvian alchemist must still meet all prerequisites for a Thuvian discovery, including level restrictions. Thuvian alchemist class levels stack with alchemist levels for the purpose of qualifying for and using these discoveries (but not others). Thuvian discoveries cannot be selected by characters without Thuvian alchemist levels.",
			"",

The Thuvian alchemist must have the bottled ooze discovery and be at least 8th level before selecting this Thuvian discovery.",

Preparing the bottle costs 500 gp per Hit Die of the elemental to be trapped and takes 1 day per 1,000 gp of value.

Only creatures that drink from the extract within 1 round of when the first imbiber starts drinking it are affected. A Thuvian alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",

Perhaps even more exhausting are the moral and ethical choices a Twilight Talon has to make on so many of her missions. Often, such choices end up being difficult decisions made between two evils, and in many cases, a Twilight Talon ends up having to deal with the consequences of such decisions for months or even years to come. Yet to make no decision at all in such a time is perhaps the greatest evil of all, for to the Twilight Talon, acting in the best of intentions is always a better option than remaining quiet and allowing evil and cruelty to continue unopposed. Being selected to serve as a Twilight Talon is an honor bestowed on only the select few who Marshal Helena Trellis, head of the Talons, believes trustworthy enough to carry out the commitment and of strong enough character to be able to make morally difficult decisions for the best of Andoran-all without public recognition. To a Twilight Talon, a job well done is one that no one outside of the Talons ever knew occurred in the first place.",

Twilight Talons train carefully in the arts of intrigue and spycraft, but they also endeavor to keep their combat skills up to snuff so that when the perfect opportunity arises, they are prepared to take swift and brutal advantage. When on a mission for the group, a Twilight Talon might tell friends and family that she's leaving under some false pretense, but more often she just disappears for months or even years at a time. When a Twilight Talon works with a group of like-minded allies (as is the case when one works with an adventuring group), she may or may not reveal her true allegiance to her companions, but if she does, she must be prepared for the repercussions if those she trusts as allies do not keep her secret.",

As long as a Twilight Talon is within 60 feet of another character with ranks in Profession (architect, barrister, clerk, courtesan, driver, engineer, innkeeper, librarian, merchant, or scribe), the Twilight Talon can pick up cues and practices in performing that job, and can use her Sense Motive check in place of that particular Profession check.",

At 2nd level, a Twilight Talon increases the amount of damage she deals with improvised weapons by one step (for example, 1d4 becomes 1d6). At 5th level, all improvised weapons used by a Twilight Talon have a base critical threat range of 19-20, and she gains {feat/Critical Focus} as a bonus feat. At 9th level, a Twilight Talon gains Staggering Critical as a bonus feat.",

			"**Eye for Detail (Ex):** Part of a Twilight Talon's training is the extensive study of the most common bureaucratic documents in Golarion's major nations, allowing her to accurately forge documents. At 3rd level, when forging a document associated with any government, she automatically receives a +8 bonus on Linguistics checks to create a forgery (as though she had seen a similar document before).",

			"**Dead Drop (Ex):** A Twilight Talon prepares for many contingencies and can tap her underground network for supplies, provided she pays into her dead drop fund beforehand. At 5th level, by spending an hour spreading around coin in any small town or larger settlement, the Twilight Talon gains the ability to access dead drops of equipment in the field.

At the GM's discretion, gear from other sourcebooks may also be available in a dead drop. In particularly remote locations, a GM may rule that no dead drops can exist, but the GM should inform the Twilight Talon of this fact when expeditions to such areas are planned. Dead drops shift locations often, so each time a Twilight Talon seeks one out, she must spend the 1d8 hours to find it.",

She can use this ability up to three times per day."

			"After centuries of raiding and pillaging throughout Avistan, the Ulfen have earned their reputation for ferocity and fearlessness. Though seemingly at odds with this perception of barbarism, Ulfen are also known for their staunch loyalty, strong sense of honor, and unyielding resolve. The combination of these reputations is in large part why they have become desired as bodyguards throughout the region. Nowhere is this practice more pronounced than in Taldor, where Ulfen have become ensconced in the Taldan tradition and adopted as the elite bodyguards of Grand Prince Stavian III himself. [Ulfen Guards](rule/f_imperial), as outsiders, are generally thought to have no ulterior motives or secret loyalty to other Taldan families or political organizations; their honor keeps them loyal to the crown. An Ulfen Guard is required to be of at least half-Ulfen descent, with one or both parents hailing from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. Non-Ulfen may serve the organization in a support capacity, but may not be Ulfen Guards themselves. While the Ulfen Guards are officially Stavian III's personal bodyguards, he often has them perform other tasks that take them all over the Inner Sea region, protecting his interests as well as his person, or operating secretly under the auspices of traveling Ulfen merchants, raiding seafarers, or unaffiliated mercenaries, all the while serving the Taldan crown.",

This bonus increases by 1 at 5th and 10th level.",

			"**Uncanny Dodge (Ex):** The Ulfen Guard gains uncanny dodge, as the barbarian class feature of the same name. If the guard already has uncanny dodge from another source (or a previous instance of this dedication), she instead gains improved uncanny dodge.

			"",
			"**Reactive Strike (Ex):** At 8th level, an Ulfen Guard can make an attack of opportunity against an enemy that moves adjacent to or attacks the Ulfen Guard's chosen ally. The Ulfen Guard cannot make a reactive strike against a creature she has already made an attack of opportunity against during the round.",

			"Zon-Kuthon's agents in the mortal realm preserve the god's grip on the shadowy nation of Nidal through darkness and horror. The rare few Kuthites gifted with the right to rule are known as the Umbral Court, and Umbral Court agents are their enforcers. Officially, Umbral Court agents operate primarily in the blasted city of Ridwan or the capital of Pangolais. In truth, however, Umbral Court agents operate throughout all of Nidal and its neighboring nations. Some work in the open as diplomats and consuls, others in secret as spies, agitators, and agents provocateur. Most agents in Nidal spend their time hunting down apostates and heretics, seeking to purge the nation of inappropriate influences. Those acting abroad seek out positions in rival nations' halls of power. Regardless of their methods, all serve the greater glory of Nidal - and the will of their dark god - with blind devotion.",
			"",
			"Umbral Court agents' loyalty to their overlords and ideals does not extend to other agents. Many an agent has fallen to a poisoned dagger from a rival seeking greater power. These minor treacheries are overlooked, or even rewarded, by superiors, so long as they do not interfere with the relative peace and order of Nidal. Agents who thirst for power often make deals with dark entities in order to stay one step ahead of their so-called allies, and in Pangolais it is not uncommon for agents to transform themselves into vampires or other types of undead.",

In addition, if the spell has the darkness or shadow descriptor or is of the illusion (shadow) subschool, the spell's effective caster level and any associated save DCs are increased by 2 (instead of 1), and any attempts at dispelling the spell in darkness or dim light take a -4 penalty on the dispel check (instead of -2).",

If both the Umbral Court agent and his target are in an area of dim or darker light, he gains a +5 bonus on this grapple check. The Umbral Court agent does not gain the grappled condition when using his shadow chains this way. He may make combat maneuver checks to maintain the grapple for as long as the effect of his touch of darkness ability persists.",

			"**Crushing Umbra (Sp):** At 10th level, an Umbral Court agent can use his touch of darkness ability at will, and the reach provided by his shadow chains increases by another 10 feet (to a total 20 foot increase). When he successfully grapples a creature with his shadow chains, the Umbral Court agent can begin constricting his victim as a free action, dealing 5d6 points of damage whenever he makes a successful grapple check. Creatures constricted in this way are also considered strangled, and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components."

			"**Founders' Favor (Su):** A group known as the founders of Aroden are the patrons of Westcrown. So strong are the traditions this group imprinted on the city that even Cheliax's relatively recent dedication to the Prince of Darkness has not effaced their mark upon the City of Twilight. A Westcrown devil learns to call upon the founders' spiritual power, enjoying a mastery of the city matched by few.",
			"",
			"At 1st level, a Westcrown devil gains a pool of favor points equal to his class level + his Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest). In addition to the powers inspired by specific founders (see below), the Westcrown devil can spend one favor point to add a bonus equal to half her class level (minimum +1) on a skill check without spending an action. The Westcrown devil must use this ability before learning the result of the check, and he can add this additional bonus only once per skill check. The pool of favor is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest.",
			"",
			"As the Westcrown devil gains levels, he learns to call upon powers inspired by specific founders. The caster level of spell-like abilities used this way is equal to the character's class level. Effects (including spell-like abilities) that allow a saving throw have a DC equal to 10 + the Westcrown devil's class level + the Westcrown devil's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (whichever is highest).",
			"",
			"**Eye of Vadrus (Su):** The patron of glassmakers allows the Westcrown devil to turn walls to glass. At 1st level, as a full-round action that costs 1 favor point, the Westcrown devil can see the internal workings of a lock, trap, or similar device that he touches. He gains a +4 bonus on Disable Device checks to disable this device. At 4th level, he can use eye of Vadrus to see through a section of any door or wall he is adjacent to and touches, as though a section of that wall or door no larger than 5 square feet were transparent. This effect works only on walls or doors that are no thicker than 6 inches. This effect lasts 1 round per class level.",
			"",
			"**Crucisal's Guidance (Su):** The patron of navigation guides the Westcrown devil while hindering any pursuit. At 3rd level, when in an urban environment, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as a swift action to gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to his base speed and a +4 insight bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks for 1 minute. Whenever the Westcrown devil spends favor to improve a skill check as part of [a chase](rule/chases) or {rule/pursuit}, he adds 2d6 to his check instead of 1d6.",
			"",
			"**Adel's Craftsmanship (Sp):** The patron of woodcraft imparts mastery over such creations. At 5th level, as a standard action, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point to use warp wood or meld into wood (as per meld into stone, except that the wood can be of any size or dimensions). If the Westcrown devil is 8th level or higher, he can use this ability as passwall through wooden barriers or statue to assume the form of a statue made of wood (hardness 5) instead.",
			"",
			"**Rixana's Bounty (Sp):** Calling upon the patron of the bounty of deep waters allows for safe navigation of underwater regions. At 7th level, the Westcrown devil can spend 1 favor point as an immediate action to grant the benefits of water breathing for 24 hours. When he activates this ability, he can affect other creatures he can touch by spending 1 additional favor point for each added creature.",
			"",
			"**Palmor's Recovery (Sp):** The patron of renewal grants access to powerful healing.

			"",
			"**Dotara's Shroud (Su):** Experienced Westcrown devils gain the favor of the patron of the dottari (city guard). At 9th level, the Westcrown devil gains a +5 insight bonus on all skill checks opposed by or targeting city guards, a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks from city guards, and a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws against effects created by city guards. This ability is constant and applies only while the Westcrown devil has at least 1 favor point remaining.",
			"",
			"**Arodennama's Avatar (Su or Sp):** Westcrown's greatest monument, the Arodennama, symbolizes the dead god of humanity, and the Westcrown devil can draw inspiration from this towering statue to invoke Aroden's authority or mastery of the blade. At 10th level, the Westcrown devil can use his favor ability to improve attack rolls with longswords as if they were skill checks. In addition, as a full-round action, the Westcrown devil can spend 2 favor points to issue a suggestion, or spend 5 favor points to issue a mass suggestion. These function as the spells of the same name except that they affect only humans.",
			"",
			"**Council's Secret:** At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a Westcrown devil gains a rogue talent, selected from those available to rogues. The Westcrown devil treats his character level as his rogue level for the purpose of determining the talents' effects. At 6th level, whenever the Westcrown devil would select a rogue talent, he can select an advanced talent instead.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, the Westcrown devil can focus on occult studies instead. If he chooses this option, when he would gain a talent via this ability, his spellcasting ability in a psychic spellcasting class he has increases by 1 level instead. The Westcrown devil can gain a level of spellcasting in this way once, plus one additional time at 6th and 10th levels.",

			"In the minds of the folk of the arctic north, the otherworldly powers of winter witches are inextricably linked with the frozen realm of Irrisen and its cruel aristocracy. These rulers, the Jadwiga, have the bitter blood of Baba Yaga running through their veins, and possess unique abilities that make them unparalleled in their power over ice, snow, and cold.",
			"",
			"Not all winter witches have a blood connection to the nobility of Irrisen. Some have their craft passed down to them by wizened mentors, and others hear their calling in the howling winds of a freezing winter's night. Of those winter witches who live outside Irrisen, many subsist on the fringes of civilization or in the wild, often concealing their powers lest they be seen as Irriseni spies. This is particularly true in the lands of the Linnorm Kings, where memories of the Winter War with Irrisen fuel long-held hatreds, as well as in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, whose superstitious tribespeople deeply distrust most forms of arcane magic.",

			"",
			"**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** A winter witch gains no additional weapon or armor proficiencies.",
			"",
			"**Spells per Day:** At the indicated levels, a winter witch gains new spells per day and patron spells as if she had also gained a level in the witch class. She does not, however, gain other benefits a character of that class would have gained except for additional spells per day and an increased effective level of spellcasting.",
			"",
			"**Hyperboreal Patronage:** A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the listed class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd-wall of ice, 5th-icy prison, 7th-freezing sphere.",
			"",
			"**Winter Witchcraft:** Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when a witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.",
			"",
			"**Freeze and Thaw (Su):** At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or a 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% of the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water that is within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds.",
			"",
			"This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Unnatural Cold (Su):** At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining the damage dealt.",
			"",
			"**Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp):** At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level.",
			"",
			"**Winter Hex:** Starting at 5th level, whenever a winter witch can choose a major hex, she must choose from the following hexes: ice tomb, hoarfrost, numbing chill (see below). Once the winter witch has selected all three winter hexes, she may thereafter choose any other hex she meets the prerequisites for.",
			"",
			"**Numbing Chill (Su):** Whenever the winter witch casts a spell that deals cold damage, she can imbue the spell with a debilitating eldritch chill as a swift action. She chooses one of the spell's targets or a creature within the spell effect. If that creature takes cold damage from the spell, it must also succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and be staggered for 1 round. The creature need only make this saving throw once per spell, even if the spell deals damage multiple times. If the target saves successfully, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.",
			"",
			"**Blizzard Sight (Su):** At 6th level, a winter witch can see normally in natural or magical rain, sleet, hail, fog, snowstorms, blizzards, and similar weather conditions.",
			"",
			"**Unearthly Cold (Su):** At 8th level, a winter witch's spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities that deal cold damage become horrendously cold. Half the cold damage caused by these effects comes from an otherworldly power and is not subject to being reduced by resistance or immunity to cold-based attacks.",
			"",
			"**Iceglide (Su):** At 10th level, a winter witch can move effortlessly at her base land speed through ice or snow. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, and doesn't create any ripple or other sign of passage. While icegliding, a winter witch can breathe normally. A control water spell cast on an area containing an icegliding winter witch flings her back 30 feet in a random direction, stunning her for 1 round unless she succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. A winter witch can use this ability for 10 minutes per day. This time need not be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Activating this ability is a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Inexorable Cold (Su):** At 10th level, a winter witch casts spells with the cold descriptor at +1 caster level. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to counterspell, dispel, or penetrate spell resistance with these spells, and the DC to counterspell or dispel these spells increases by 1."
