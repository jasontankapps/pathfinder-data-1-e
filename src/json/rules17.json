			"Typically, player characters find themselves buying and selling magic items as they gain levels to keep up with the increasing threats they face. Items come and go from each character's inventory with such frequency that they hardly have the chance to impact the game's story. Scaling items, however, increase in power along with the characters who carry them, allowing an old and cherished item to develop and retain its utility rather than being sold and forgotten.",
			"",
			"Scaling items work like normal magic items, but they gain new powers as their wielders gain levels, and their existing powers sometimes also improve. Additional item powers appear in a scaling magic item's entry with a header indicating the character level at which they unlock.",
			"",
			"The caster level of the item scales up as well. A scaling item's effective caster level is its listed caster level or the character level of its wielder, whichever is higher, to a maximum of the item's highest-level ability. For instance, if an item has a base caster level of 5th and additional abilities at 7th and 9th levels, it's treated as caster level 8th in the hands of an 8th-level character, but is treated as only caster level 9th in the hands of a 10th-level character.",
			"",
			"Each scaling item has a base price that represents its value to a character whose level is equal to or less than the item's caster level. As the item's caster level increases in the hands of a more powerful character, the item's value increases as well. The values of such items fall into three categories (baubles, prizes, and wonders), which indicate the rough percentage of the character's wealth a scaling item represents.",
			"",
			"The weakest items, baubles, represent 5% of a PC's [character wealth at her level](rule/placing_treasure) and can be compared to consumable magic items (even though baubles aren't destroyed by use). Items in the middle category, prizes, represent 15% of a PC's suggested wealth and correspond to magic items of moderate power. An item of the most valuable category, wonders, represents 30% of a PC's suggested wealth and corresponds to a major magic item, such as a fighter's most beloved and powerful sword. Wonders exceed the normal cost assumptions of the game at their highest level. Such items approach the power of minor artifacts, though they're not indestructible and can still be created normally."

			"***Per Character:*** If you apply the scaling item treasure reduction for each character, do so after dividing up shares of treasure for the characters. Reduce the treasure received by a character with a scaling item by the percentage listed for the item's category (5% for baubles, 15% for prizes, and 30% for wonders).

Since the value of a scaling item is based on wealth for an entire level, apply this adjustment to every treasure allotment the character receives. If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power. In any case, this substance should be treated as almost worthless to sell, and therefore useful only for upgrading scaling items.",

			"***Group Basis:*** You can use the scaling items of the whole party to adjust treasure. This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4)."

			"To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.",
			"",
			"***Pricing the Base Item:*** First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the [normal rules for creating magic items](rule/magic_item_creation). Then, using the column on [Table 4-13](rule/adjusting_treasure) that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level.",
			"",
			"***Adding Scaling Abilities:*** Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.",
			"",
			"***Adding Unlockable Abilities:*** Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) so well.",
			"",
			"***Adding Spells:*** Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. Table 4-14: Spell Prices includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does [fireball](spell/fireball)), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for [fireball](spell/fireball). Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.",
			"",
			"Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.",
			"",
			"***Assigning an Unlock Level:*** Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).",

Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook.

Its wearer gains the constant effects of [endure elements](spell/endure_elements) against cold conditions only.",

			"***7th Level:*** As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.",
			"",
			"***10th Level:*** As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels.

			"***18th Level:*** When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as [wind walk](spell/wind_walk) except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one [Huge ice elemental](monster/huge_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VI](spell/summon_monster_6).",

When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can also choose to summon 1d4+1 Huge ice elementals, 1d3 [greater ice elementals](monster/greater_ice_elemental), or one [elder ice elemental](monster/elder_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VIII](spell/summon_monster_8). She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall.",

Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",

			"An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding [Koriana's Blade](magic-relic/koriana's_blade), the sword wouldn't gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs' third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a [bag of holding](magic-wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1), for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",

For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",

In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there.

Or maybe a PC was rescued from slavery at a young age by members of the [Bellflower Network](rule/aff_antislavery), and has modeled his life upon heroes from that group. This starting affiliation must be approved by the GM, who may say that certain affiliations are off-limits or some organizations must be contacted in-play before joining.",
			"",
			"***Subsequent Affiliations:*** Once play begins, a PC must seek out and contact agents of an organization before attempting to join or gain affiliation with it. Upon making contact, she must convince that agent that she would make a good addition to the organization. Players should speak with their GM out of the game when they make the decision to pursue affiliation with a group, since the GM has final say as to which groups (and thus which options) are available. An affiliation should never be something players just decide they have on their own - it should be the result of gameplay and interaction with NPCs associated with the organization. Additional information on how to earn affiliation is presented in each group's section, along with a short example encounter GMs can use as inspiration for setting up the attempt to affiliate with the group.",
			"",
			"### Affiliations for Adventuring Parties",
			"",
			"At the GM's discretion, an entire adventuring party can have a group affiliation. In such a case, the assumption is that the campaign the GM has chosen to run involves the whole party being agents of a specific group. Once the GM assigns a group affiliation, all members of the party are treated as if they were affiliated with that group. This affiliation does not take up any individual PC's affiliation slots.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, a party can use rules for membership in groups, such as those presented in *Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Faction Guide*, or joining a group could be a significant part of a campaign, as in the case of the Silver Ravens in the Hell's Rebels Adventure Path. In such a case, a character automatically gains affiliation with a group once he successfully joins the group in question.",
			"",
			"### Afiliations for NPCs",
			"",
			"An NPC should typically have only one affiliation (if any), and the GM gets to decide what that affiliation is. Yet there is no maximum number of affiliations for NPCs-an NPC can have as many as are needed for the GM to tell the story she wishes to tell. It's generally unnecessary to list in an NPC's statistics what affiliations he has, since that should be clear from the NPC's background.",
			"",
			"### Rivals",
			"",
			"Note that certain groups have rivals listed in their group stat blocks, representing long-standing conflicts with other groups. The [Aspis Consortium](rule/aff_profiteers) and the Pathfinder Society are perennial enemies, and the [Hellknights](rule/aff_lawknights) and the Bellflower Network have long been at odds. There's no reason that characters of rival affiliations can't exist in the same adventuring party (although such a group will likely be more prone to party strife than others), but a single character cannot normally have an affiliation with two rival groups.",
			"",
			"### Abandoning Affiliations",
			"",
			"A character can abandon an affiliation at any time, but she cannot replace the abandoned affiliation with a new affiliation until she has gained at least 1 character level (unless the GM decrees otherwise). Once a character has abandoned her affiliation with a group, only exceptional circumstances can allow her to regain her affiliation with that group. Abandoning an affiliation may have in-game repercussions, as members of the group may not take kindly to learning that a character has deserted them.",
			"",
			"When a character abandons an affiliation, she cannot gain new options from that group until her affiliation with the group is restored. However, she does not lose access to options she already has, and can still gain access to affiliation options via alternative means. If a character has a prestige class or archetype associated with a group, she can continue to gain levels in that class or archetype, regardless of her current affiliation status with that group.",
			"",
			"As an alternative way to gain more affiliation slots rather than abandoning one, a character could take the [Additional Affiliations](feat/additional_affiliations) feat to expand her set of affiliations without having to sacrifice existing affiliations. And of course, if a character's Charisma score (and thus her Charisma modifier) permanently increases, she can gain access to new affiliation slots as a result.",
			"",
			"### Important Note",
			"",
			"The affiliations listed below have been lifted from [Adventurer's Guide](source/adventurer's_guide) and converted into generic entities, removing proper names and Pathfinder-specific lore that likely isn't considered Open Game Content."
