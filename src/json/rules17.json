			"Typically, player characters find themselves buying and selling magic items as they gain levels to keep up with the increasing threats they face. Items come and go from each character's inventory with such frequency that they hardly have the chance to impact the game's story. Scaling items, however, increase in power along with the characters who carry them, allowing an old and cherished item to develop and retain its utility rather than being sold and forgotten.",
			"",
			"Scaling items work like normal magic items, but they gain new powers as their wielders gain levels, and their existing powers sometimes also improve. Additional item powers appear in a scaling magic item's entry with a header indicating the character level at which they unlock.",
			"",
			"The caster level of the item scales up as well. A scaling item's effective caster level is its listed caster level or the character level of its wielder, whichever is higher, to a maximum of the item's highest-level ability. For instance, if an item has a base caster level of 5th and additional abilities at 7th and 9th levels, it's treated as caster level 8th in the hands of an 8th-level character, but is treated as only caster level 9th in the hands of a 10th-level character.",
			"",
			"Each scaling item has a base price that represents its value to a character whose level is equal to or less than the item's caster level. As the item's caster level increases in the hands of a more powerful character, the item's value increases as well. The values of such items fall into three categories (baubles, prizes, and wonders), which indicate the rough percentage of the character's wealth a scaling item represents.",
			"",
			"The weakest items, baubles, represent 5% of a PC's [character wealth at her level](rule/placing_treasure) and can be compared to consumable magic items (even though baubles aren't destroyed by use). Items in the middle category, prizes, represent 15% of a PC's suggested wealth and correspond to magic items of moderate power. An item of the most valuable category, wonders, represents 30% of a PC's suggested wealth and corresponds to a major magic item, such as a fighter's most beloved and powerful sword. Wonders exceed the normal cost assumptions of the game at their highest level. Such items approach the power of minor artifacts, though they're not indestructible and can still be created normally."

			"***Per Character:*** If you apply the scaling item treasure reduction for each character, do so after dividing up shares of treasure for the characters. Reduce the treasure received by a character with a scaling item by the percentage listed for the item's category (5% for baubles, 15% for prizes, and 30% for wonders).

Since the value of a scaling item is based on wealth for an entire level, apply this adjustment to every treasure allotment the character receives. If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power. In any case, this substance should be treated as almost worthless to sell, and therefore useful only for upgrading scaling items.",

			"***Group Basis:*** You can use the scaling items of the whole party to adjust treasure. This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4)."

			"To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.",
			"",
			"***Pricing the Base Item:*** First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the [normal rules for creating magic items](rule/magic_item_creation). Then, using the column on [Table 4-13](rule/adjusting_treasure) that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level.",
			"",
			"***Adding Scaling Abilities:*** Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.",
			"",
			"***Adding Unlockable Abilities:*** Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) so well.",
			"",
			"***Adding Spells:*** Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. Table 4-14: Spell Prices includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does [fireball](spell/fireball)), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for [fireball](spell/fireball). Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.",
			"",
			"Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.",
			"",
			"***Assigning an Unlock Level:*** Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).",

Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook.

Its wearer gains the constant effects of [endure elements](spell/endure_elements) against cold conditions only.",

			"***7th Level:*** As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.",
			"",
			"***10th Level:*** As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels.

			"***18th Level:*** When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as [wind walk](spell/wind_walk) except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one [Huge ice elemental](monster/huge_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VI](spell/summon_monster_6).",

When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can also choose to summon 1d4+1 Huge ice elementals, 1d3 [greater ice elementals](monster/greater_ice_elemental), or one [elder ice elemental](monster/elder_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VIII](spell/summon_monster_8). She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall.",

Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",

			"An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding [Koriana's Blade](magic-relic/koriana's_blade), the sword wouldn't gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs' third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a [bag of holding](magic-wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1), for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",

For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",

In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there.

Or maybe a PC was rescued from slavery at a young age by members of the [Bellflower Network](rule/aff_antislavery), and has modeled his life upon heroes from that group. This starting affiliation must be approved by the GM, who may say that certain affiliations are off-limits or some organizations must be contacted in-play before joining.",
			"",
			"***Subsequent Affiliations:*** Once play begins, a PC must seek out and contact agents of an organization before attempting to join or gain affiliation with it. Upon making contact, she must convince that agent that she would make a good addition to the organization. Players should speak with their GM out of the game when they make the decision to pursue affiliation with a group, since the GM has final say as to which groups (and thus which options) are available. An affiliation should never be something players just decide they have on their own - it should be the result of gameplay and interaction with NPCs associated with the organization. Additional information on how to earn affiliation is presented in each group's section, along with a short example encounter GMs can use as inspiration for setting up the attempt to affiliate with the group.",
			"",
			"### Affiliations for Adventuring Parties",
			"",
			"At the GM's discretion, an entire adventuring party can have a group affiliation. In such a case, the assumption is that the campaign the GM has chosen to run involves the whole party being agents of a specific group. Once the GM assigns a group affiliation, all members of the party are treated as if they were affiliated with that group. This affiliation does not take up any individual PC's affiliation slots.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, a party can use rules for membership in groups, such as those presented in *Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Faction Guide*, or joining a group could be a significant part of a campaign, as in the case of the Silver Ravens in the Hell's Rebels Adventure Path. In such a case, a character automatically gains affiliation with a group once he successfully joins the group in question.",
			"",
			"### Afiliations for NPCs",
			"",
			"An NPC should typically have only one affiliation (if any), and the GM gets to decide what that affiliation is. Yet there is no maximum number of affiliations for NPCs-an NPC can have as many as are needed for the GM to tell the story she wishes to tell. It's generally unnecessary to list in an NPC's statistics what affiliations he has, since that should be clear from the NPC's background.",
			"",
			"### Rivals",
			"",
			"Note that certain groups have rivals listed in their group stat blocks, representing long-standing conflicts with other groups. The [Aspis Consortium](rule/aff_profiteers) and the Pathfinder Society are perennial enemies, and the [Hellknights](rule/aff_lawknights) and the Bellflower Network have long been at odds. There's no reason that characters of rival affiliations can't exist in the same adventuring party (although such a group will likely be more prone to party strife than others), but a single character cannot normally have an affiliation with two rival groups.",
			"",
			"### Abandoning Affiliations",
			"",
			"A character can abandon an affiliation at any time, but she cannot replace the abandoned affiliation with a new affiliation until she has gained at least 1 character level (unless the GM decrees otherwise). Once a character has abandoned her affiliation with a group, only exceptional circumstances can allow her to regain her affiliation with that group. Abandoning an affiliation may have in-game repercussions, as members of the group may not take kindly to learning that a character has deserted them.",
			"",
			"When a character abandons an affiliation, she cannot gain new options from that group until her affiliation with the group is restored. However, she does not lose access to options she already has, and can still gain access to affiliation options via alternative means. If a character has a prestige class or archetype associated with a group, she can continue to gain levels in that class or archetype, regardless of her current affiliation status with that group.",
			"",
			"As an alternative way to gain more affiliation slots rather than abandoning one, a character could take the [Additional Affiliations](feat/additional_affiliations) feat to expand her set of affiliations without having to sacrifice existing affiliations. And of course, if a character's Charisma score (and thus her Charisma modifier) permanently increases, she can gain access to new affiliation slots as a result.",
			"",
			"### Important Notes",
			"",
			"***1:*** The affiliations listed here were printed in [Adventurer's Guide](source/adventurer's_guide) and have been converted into generic entities, removing proper names and Pathfinder-specific lore that likely isn't considered Open Game Content.",
			"",
			"***2:*** There was also a separate publication with rules for [Factions](rule/factions) that can be used with/instead of these rules."

			"Prepare for your PCs to step into a larger world. In the classic roleplaying tradition, the PCs are independent heroes, and though they may undertake missions for powerful patrons, their association is usually temporary, with no long-term benefits. This book is about something different.",
			"",
			"The concept of factions is familiar from books and movies: mysterious organizations with hidden agendas, some secretive and others very public with their activities. Their members are contacts, associates, and informants for the heroes of the story, able to provide information, resources, or even backup or rescue in a pinch. The heroes might meet them by chance, seek them out for help, or be sought by them as their own reputations increase.",
			"",
			"This book, though, is not simply a guidebook about factions, as most of these groups are already detailed in other books. Instead, it's a guide to how you and your players can create characters that are integrated with those groups and with the campaign you want to run. Each group entry talks about the mission and outlook of the group, why PCs might want to be a part of it, and what the advantages are (both social and mechanical) of membership in a group.",
			"",
			"The Faction Guide is part of a style of play that presumes characters are actively plugged in to the power brokers and organizations of the world. Moreover, their connections with these organizations are rich and deep, affording characters both benefits of membership as well as the opportunity to advance. A party of adventurers may include members of several different factions, all of them working toward a common overall goal but each individual member having received special instructions from his faction regarding information or actions of particular importance to him and his faction.",
			"",
			"Working factions into your home campaign requires some extra effort on your (the GM's) part, either tailoring published adventures or adding details to adventures of your own design to incorporate the idea of characters as members of secret (or not-so-secret) societies, fellowships, and orders with goals and visions beyond the next payday. You may have some decisions to make concerning which factions you want to use; you want players to find factions that interest and excite them, but some factions may not fit for the campaign because of alignment, location, mission, or focus. The reward for this extra effort is a richer campaign, one where PCs really feel themselves a part of a living, breathing campaign world.",

			"PCs improve their standing within their faction by succeeding in missions relating to or coming from a faction. In a given adventure, or even in between adventures, you should think about the factions the characters in the party have chosen to represent. Their factions might ask them to assassinate a crime lord, protect an innocent merchant caught in a crossfire, save a kidnapped child, hand off an important letter, foil an assassination, recover a specific stolen relic, or locate a letter of marque. Whatever the mission, a positive outcome earns the character a **Prestige Award (PA).**",

In this section, you'll find an expanded system of rules that describes the kinds of rewards and privileges a character can access as her **Total Prestige Award (TPA)** increases and how she can use her Prestige Award for a variety of benefits that reflect her faction's willingness to assist her in times of need.",
			"",
			"### Faction Secrecy",
			"",
			"Governments and religious, political, mercantile, or cultural organizations may vary a great deal when it comes to dealing with factions and their activities. Some factions are blatantly public in their actions and their efforts to recruit others to their cause. Others are subtler in their plots and operate in the shadows; even where their presence is known, local leaders often turn a blind eye to their existence and activities as long as they don't make trouble. The more secretive factions often look down on those who act openly, but every faction must weigh the value of a public presence and reputation versus the ability to operate without interference. Factions have alliances and rivalries to be sure, but they usually avoid open conflict with their rivals in the interest of keeping the favor of local governments that allow them to operate freely in their territory.",
			"",
			"### Choosing a Faction",
			"",
			"Every faction has a unique history, culture, style, and specialty. Each has its own modus operandi in the ongoing struggle for power and influence on Golarion, and each offers its members different boons. Choosing a faction can be as important as choosing a character class or race: it defines a character in the campaign and ties him to his faction's destiny. Before you allow your players to choose their factions, peruse each faction carefully and see which ones fit well with the theme of your campaign. If you don't wish to allow evil characters, for instance, you might think twice about allowing characters to become part of evil-aligned factions, and if your campaign is set in a forested alpine wilderness, it might be reasonable to disallow factions from a desert land as they have little interest or influence there. It's not about restricting your players; it's about creating a rational and logical campaign setting where options fit together and where players won't be frustrated by making a choice that won't have much to do with the campaign. That said, if a player has a great character concept that he's excited about for a faction that you don't think would work, give the player a chance to pitch the idea. Explain the reasons why his faction choice might be hard to play in the campaign, but if he really wants to try it, let him give it a go.",
			"",
			"Bear in mind that a PC need not be from a particular country to become a member of a faction, even if that faction itself is closely associated with that country. Likewise, characters of any class can join a faction. PCs are not necessarily bound to work with a single faction. Although it is simplest to stay with one faction for a character's career, there is no reason a PC can't gain prestige within more than one group (though trying to work with two rival groups is unlikely to turn out well). Lastly, characters should not be required to join a faction. Those uninterested in the idea can ignore it, but those who find it appealing have an additional option for customizing their characters and how they fit into the world."

			"A character's ***Prestige Award (PA)*** is an abstract way to track his growing renown and reputation within a faction.",
			"",
			"### Total and Current Prestige Award",
			"",
			"Just as a character has a maximum hit point value when fully healed and a current hit point value when injured, that character has a ***Total Prestige Award (TPA)*** and a ***Current Prestige Award (CPA).*** TPA represents the character's overall reputation within a faction. CPA represents how much influence the character currently has within that faction in terms of favors owed to him and his ability to influence others and make use of the faction's resources.",
			"",
			"Characters may spend CPA to acquire goods or services (see Spending Prestige Award), which means that a character's CPA is usually less than his TPA, just as an adventuring character's current hit points are usually less than his total hit points. CPA can never be higher than TPA.",
			"",
			"### Earning Prestige",
			"",
			"Characters earn prestige for performing missions for a faction or otherwise advancing the faction's goals. For example, a character allied with the Eagle Knights gains prestige with that faction for breaking up a slaving ring, while a Razmiri cultist gains prestige for converting unbelievers to the faith and sending tithes back to Razmiran. At your discretion, a character may earn prestige for an adventure even if it's not part of an \"official\" mission for a faction; a 7th-level paladin who's freed many slaves probably has earned prestige with the Eagle Knights even if she's never taken orders from a member of that faction.",
			"",
			"When a character's Prestige Award increases, her TPA and CPA increase by the same value. For example, Jothalia has 5 TPA and 2 CPA with the Eagle Knight faction; if she completes a mission for them and her PA increases by 2, she now has 7 TPA and 4 CPA.",
			"",
			"Not every adventure or encounter needs to relate to a faction mission, nor does every faction have an interest in every possible adventure, but as a general rule you should strive to provide equal opportunity for PCs of all factions to earn prestige. If you cannot find a place within a given adventure for the interests of a particular PC's faction, make a point of integrating opportunities later on for that PC to achieve some faction goals.",
			"",
			"The ability to earn prestige should be routine, but it need not be automatic. If a PC fails at her appointed tasks or passes up opportunities to further her factions' goals, she does not earn prestige simply because her player showed up to play. By choosing to play using a faction, a player is agreeing to \"play along\" with faction goals in order to obtain faction rewards. If the PC does not fulfill her obligations as a member of the faction, she should not expect to rise in the faction's esteem.",
			"",
			"The rate at which characters' prestige increases varies depending on the whether you use Fast, Medium, or Slow advancement (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 30), but on average, characters should be able to increase their PA by 3 to 5 points per experience level, whether acquired by completing several small missions or tasks or one more difficult or significant task. Over the course of a long campaign like a Pathfinder Adventure Path, characters might expect to increase their PA by 40 or more points, especially if the campaign is tightly linked to the factions players choose.",
			"",
			"If you want to expand how you use prestige in a game, you could also use the characters' PA to replace or supplement standard treasure awards. In a campaign where looting the dead or robbing tombs is frowned upon, you could use PA to help fill the gap in character resources that would normally be satisfied by pillage and plunder.",
			"",
			"### Losing Prestige",
			"",
			"Prestige should be seen as an enticement rather than an instrument to punish PCs, but a character can lose prestige for betraying faction secrets to outsiders, causing the death of a faction member, stealing from or lying to their faction brethren, befriending or allying with members of opposed factions, and so on. A typical penalty would be the loss of 1-3 CPA. In extreme situations, however, a character might incur such a negative reputation within his faction that his CPA and TPA decrease by 5 or even 10 points for a major transgression, possibly resulting in loss of rank and privileges within the faction. This does not force characters to forfeit boons already acquired, but it may prevent them from obtaining any new boons or benefits for which they no longer qualify at their lowered TPA, and they must work to get back in the good graces of their peers.",
			"",
			"### Benefits of Prestige",
			"",
			"A character's Total Prestige Award represents her trustworthiness and status within their faction. The simplest representation of this prestige is that for every 10 points of her Total Prestige Award, she gains a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks with members of that faction. In addition, she may learn certain feats or spells or be able to purchase unique magical items or other goods that are restricted to those whose TPA reaches a certain benchmark. Her faction contacts can allow her to buy or sell goods whose value exceeds the normal gp limit of the local area or that might be of questionable legality. Finally, depending on the organization, a character's TPA might afford her certain titles and incidental privileges.",
			"",
			"### Dealing with Allied Factions",
			"",
			"Many factions have close associations and alliances with other groups, and earning prestige in her faction can allow a character to enjoy some of the benefits of membership and prestige within allied factions as well. Each faction entry describes whether that faction is allied with any others. When dealing with members of an allied faction, a character may treat her TPA as if it were half its actual amount, including the related bonus on Diplomacy checks with, and buying and selling goods through, the allied faction; she can also spend CPA to obtain boons from an allied faction, though the costs are increased by 1.",
			"",
			"### Dealing with Opposed Factions",
			"",
			"Just as factions have allies, so too do they have enemies. The very same prestige that can make a PC famous within her faction and among allies can make her infamous in the eyes of opposing factions, and avoiding attracting unwanted attention from her faction's enemies or those friendly to them is one reason that some characters keep their faction allegiances secret. If a character's faction allegiance is known, the initial attitude of an NPC of the opposing faction is treated as one step worse than normal (for example, Indifferent becomes Unfriendly, Unfriendly becomes Hostile), and for every 10 points of the character's TPA, she takes a -1 penalty on Diplomacy checks to influence that NPC. If the NPC's faction opposes more than one of the PC's factions, only the faction with which the PC has the highest TPA counts.",
			"",
			"### Spending Prestige",
			"",
			"A character's CPA total reflects the goodwill, political capital, and personal favors she has built up through service to the organization. While a character's TPA can provide certain titles and privileges, most tangible benefits of faction membership are acquired when a character spends his CPA on temporary boons, favors, aid, spellcasting, or other service. Regardless of whatever honorific titles a character has earned through his Total Prestige Award, the cost for obtaining boons remains the same.",
			"",
			"Once a character's CPA is spent, it is spent permanently; it is not recovered automatically like lost hit points or ability score damage. The character can, of course, earn more PA, which adds to both her TPA and her CPA, but spent points are gone.",
			"",
			"Characters may not spend CPA during combat, and for the sake of simplicity you may limit characters to spending CPA once per gaming session (this keeps players from saving up their PA in large amounts and spending it all at once, making an adventure too easy). It is possible for a player to spend his character's PA even if the PC is dead; in essence, this represents the PC having made prior arrangements with his faction to perform certain actions on his behalf, such as recovering his dead body and returning it to a specific location or having it raised.",
			"",
			"You can add to the services presented in this book or create your own factions. The monetary equivalent of 1 point of PA is approximately 375 gp, though characters should normally only be able to spend PA on services, not physical goods.",
			"",
			"PCs may not pool their earned prestige to obtain items or services, or for any other purpose, even if they are members of the same faction. As a general rule, PA is designed to be spent by characters on themselves; PA costs increase by 1 when the benefit is to other characters instead of to the member of the faction. However, PCs in a home game are ultimately free to spend their PA as they see fit.",
			"",
			"A character's ability to spend PA is dependent on his being in contact with other members of his faction, and unless noted otherwise, most factions tend to have agents, contacts, or headquarters in settlements that are at least the size of a large city. To reflect the difficulty of contacting a faction agent in a smaller settlement, PA costs increase by 5 in communities smaller than 5,000 people. This change, of course, can vary by organization; for the Green Faith, for example, the opposite is true - PA costs increase by 5 in communities larger than 5,000"

A bard of any level can learn these songs from the faction.",

Anyone with at least 1 rank in Perform (sing) may begin singing a battle song as a standard action and maintain it each round as a free action; he gains the minimum benefit described for the song, which does not advance with the singer's level. The singing is otherwise like bardic performance by a novice bard (requiring a standard action to start a new performance, ending if the singer is unconscious, and so on). A non-bard in range of a bard singing the same battle song only gains the benefit of the highest bonus from that song (typically the bard's). For example, a non-bard singing the song of steadfastness gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC (no matter what his level is), but if in range of a bard whose version of the song grants a +2 dodge bonus, he only gets the bard's +2 (not his own +1 and the bard's +2). Of course, a bard who has used all his bardic performance rounds for the day can sing for his own benefit as long as he has at least 1 rank in Perform (sing)."

Some of these writings contain versions of the spells that are 1-3 levels lower than the normal version of the spell (such as a level 3 version of contact other plane) or arcane versions of divine spells (or vice versa).
