With this latter solution, you should work with ranger players to help them anticipate the terrains featured in your upcoming campaign, with new categories like crystalline (for realms in the Plane of Earth or under Elysium, where immense crystal formations are common), living (for truly sentient realms like portions of the Abyss), or void (for empty reaches in the Astral Plane or the energy planes) potentially becoming new options for rangers to select from."

While this might strike some as going against the ranger's usual respect for nature and the creatures of the wild, trophy hunters understand that they are just more pieces in nature's grand puzzle, and that the laws of the jungle-the right to kill and feed on those weaker than you, and the need to establish dominance through cunning and bloodshed-are both their rights and their duty as the current top of the food chain.",

			"In addition, whenever a yokai hunter sees a favored yokai that is disguised or has not made its otherworldly essence known, he gains an automatic check to identify the creature as such. To make this check, a yokai hunter rolls 1d20 and adds his yokai hunter level and Charisma modifier (DC 10 + 1/2 the yokai's Hit Dice + the yokai's Cha modifier). A successful check means that the yokai hunter recognizes the creature's ties to the spiritual world. Regardless of whether the check is successful, a yokai hunter gains the bonus on weapon attacks and damage rolls against favored yokai.",

			"**Yokai Sense (Su):** At 7th level, a yokai hunter can sense yokai he has identified with his favored yokai ability as though he had blindsense out to a range of 60 feet. This ability replaces woodland stride.",
			"",
			"**Resist Yokai (Su):** At 12th level, a yokai hunter can attempt to shrug off the magical energies of a yokai. He gains a +4 insight bonus on saving throws to resist the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of favored yokai. In addition, once per day as a standard action, a yokai hunter can shed an effect placed on him by a yokai as break enchantment, using his yokai hunter level as his caster level. This ability replaces camouflage."
