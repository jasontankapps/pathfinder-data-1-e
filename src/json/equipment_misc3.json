Each book is written in multiple languages and provides a vast array of information on a specifc topic, but the information it contains is often oddly specifc and lacks context. A single Pnakotic record focuses on a single subject within the confnes of a single Knowledge skill, such as a presentation on the nature of deep one religious practices in worshiping Cthulhu (Knowledge [religion]), the mechanics of a shoggoth's biology (Knowledge [dungeoneering]), or the methods of creating portals between worlds (Knowledge [arcana]). By studying a Pnakotic record for 8 hours, a reader can attempt a single Knowledge check of the appropriate type when researching the book's corresponding subject to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on the check."

			"This fine alchemical salt has been developed to work against particular types of foes. A batch of repellent salts is attuned to undead or a selected outsider race, such as angels, demons, or devils. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dose of repellent salts can be applied to a 5-foot-square area that functions as difficult terrain for the salt's attuned creature type. Any creature can sweep the salts aside as a move action (or as a full-round action for an attuned creature, which deals that creature 2d4 points of acid damage in the process); moderate wind also disperses all repellent salts in a square (including the draft created by a winged creature of at least Medium size that flies within 5 feet of the salts). Alternatively, a vial of repellent salts can be used as a splash weapon against the target creature, with a successful hit dealing 2d4 points of acid damage to the creature struck (or 1 point to an attuned creature within 5 feet of the target and thus exposed to the attack's splash)."

The mask heals its wearer regardless of the type of channeled energy used and whether the target is living or undead. This healing does not prevent the wearer from dying because of hit point damage, and is mainly used to provide instant healing when a cleric is occupied or can only channel a harmful kind of energy.

One pound of sunsoil covers a 20-footby- 20-foot area of regular earth and takes 1 minute to distribute evenly. A treated area allows plants to grow without sunlight for 4 months. Light-based spells and magical effects trigger an alchemical reaction in sunsoil. Any spell with the light descriptor cast on a pound of sunsoil causes all areas covered in the soil to be treated as areas of bright light for 1 round. This light counts as natural sunlight for creatures vulnerable to such effects. After being subjected to such an effect, sunsoil immediately becomes normal dirt."

A sureseal bladder is made of a thin membrane that won't allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater, and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full. Potions rely on drinking the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just like drinking a potion above the waves. Either type of sureseal bladder can be used only once."
