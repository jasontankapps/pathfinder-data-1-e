			"**Evisceration (Ex)** A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or those it has grappled. When a mi-go makes a successful grapple check, in addition to any other effects caused by a successful grapple, it deals sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs).

			"The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty.",
			"",
			"Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs."

If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean skeleton and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the target's outward features, which contribute to the ooze's primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.",

Mindspin rams are 4 feet tall and 6 feet long, and weigh up to 500 pounds."

			"Nothing holds a grudge like a minotaur. Scorned by the civilized races centuries ago and born from a deific curse, minotaurs have hunted, slain, and devoured lesser humanoids in retribution for real or imagined slights for as long as anyone can remember. Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet.",
			"",
			"The traditional minotaur's lair is a maze, be it a legitimate labyrinth constructed to baffle and confuse, an accidental one such as a city sewer system, or a naturally occurring one such as a tangle of caverns and other underground passageways. Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.",
			"",
			"Minotaurs might also be found in the employ of a more powerful monster or evil creature, serving it so long as they can still hunt and dine as they please. Usually this means guarding some powerful object or valuable location, but it can also be a sort of mercenary work, hunting down the foes of its master.",
			"",
			"Minotaurs are relatively straightforward combatants, using their horns to horribly gore the nearest living creature when combat begins."

			"A hopeless, claustrophobic maze alone is enough to induce fear and despair, but the presence of a labyrinth guardian turns the situation into a nightmare. Relentless, ruthless, and almost unstoppable, these undead monstrosities have an unquenchable thirst for destruction. Dedicated servants of Baphomet or Lamashtu, labyrinth guardians rule their tiny, maze-like kingdoms with fearless power. Depraved minotaurs flock to their banner, hoping for protection and to appease whatever material or divine power the guardian serves.",
			"",
			"In life, guardians stood vigil over catacombs, dungeons, or lost cities, and were unique not for their combat prowess, but rather for their endless devotion to their duty and foul gods. This loyalty, coupled with vile rituals whispered by their patrons, bound the guardians' souls to the iron of their armor and resurrected them as twisted, ageless defenders. The same sense of commitment that enabled the guardians' transformation also shackles them to their labyrinthine territories. This stunts the guardians' dreams of expansion, limiting them to steadily adding on to their sprawling, confusing complexes. Over time, the legend of an ancient labyrinth guardian often exceeds that of the maze's original treasure."

			"**Bronze Mask (Su)** A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex)** A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet. They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive, tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent guardians of Baphomet's bewildering maze of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth. Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs resemble their mortal counterparts, as each has the form of a massive, burly humanoid with thick fur on the chest and legs and a horned, bovine head. The hairless skin of a labyrinth minotaur's head is thin and stretched so tightly over the bone that the beast appears to have just a skull atop its neck. This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets.",
			"",
			"Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, \"How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye\"?).",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation: each is mystically connected to its mask.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.",
			"",
			"When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind."

They can control their aggression well enough to benefit from hit-and-run tactics, charging an overwhelming force before falling back to lure their enemy into an ambush, a rockslide, or-in the case of flying pests like harpies-nets. Thanks to their varied responsibilities and opponents, marauders train until they achieve incredible skill with both axes and bows. They make the most of the labyrinthine caverns and twisting canyons of their domains to confuse and separate foolish enemies who press into their lands.",

			"Weaker than many of their brutish kin, tangle tenders instead apply their racial cunning and understanding of complex systems to mechanical devices, constructing ingenious traps that whittle away those lost in the labyrinths with little or no direct danger to themselves. They build and reset traps, alter or conceal carefully whatever trails their victims attempt to leave, and strike from the shadows only once their victims are desperate, exhausted, and at each others' throats. Their tactics aren't motivated by cowardice; rather, these cruel creators love to inflict misery by outwitting their enemies rather than out-muscling them. Tangle tenders belong to the maze; they are intimately familiar with every twist and turn, and are keen to introduce interlopers to each in turn. Among minotaur tribes, tangle tenders hold a strange position, both necessary and loathed. They never shy away from bragging about their genius, and their kin recognize the value of a tangle tender's devices for trapping prey. But minotaurs respect strength, courage, and aggression first and foremost, and these clever rogues excel at none of those qualities-most thus see these trapsmiths as socially stunted, needlessly sadistic (even by minotaur standards), and physically weak to the point of embarrassment. Few voice these opinions, however, as those who do frequently face tragic accidents deep within the maze."

A creature can harvest 1d4 doses of mire nettle toxin from a freshly slain plant with a successful DC 20 Survival check. Mire nettle toxin retains its potency for 6 hours after the plant's death, but certain alchemical processes (requiring a successful DC 20 Craft [alchemy] check, 30 minutes of work, and the expenditure of 50 gp of reagents per dose) can extend the potency of the toxin to 1 week."

			"**Mirror Sight (Ex)** A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.",
			"",
			"**Scrying Focus (Su)** Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Soul Mirror (Su)** The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies.",

			"At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.",
			"",
			"While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their lookingglass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however: any caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",

			"For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.",
			"",
			"There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.",
			"",
			"### Construction",

			"The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents are large snakelike beasts that soar as easily through air as they do water. Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to guard their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, mirror serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, mirror serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn't resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving mirror serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to guard. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. Mirror serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Mirror serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.",
			"",
			"A mirror serpent's body stretches out to a length of 15 feet and weighs 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike most other creatures, mirror serpents don't permanently die unless their remains are purposefully destroyed to prevent rebirth. Each mirror serpent carries within its body an egg that holds the seed of its next life and matures along with its natural aging. If a mirror serpent dies prematurely, the egg within it simply decays along with the rest of the creature's internal organs. When a mirror serpent dies of natural causes, however, its soft tissue is absorbed into the egg as a final act of fertilization, leaving the egg amid the hollow husk of the serpent's reflective skin. Water is the most ideal location for the egg's 13-month incubation to take place, and thus when dying, most mirror serpents head for the nearest large body of water. The egg has an exceptionally hard, crystalline shell that protects it from predatory fauna and other dangers while it incubates. Additionally, shortly after an egg is fertilized, it becomes naturally invisible as a defense mechanism. If the egg remains intact, it eventually hatches, releasing a young mirror serpent into its predecessor's territory. While the newborn mirror serpent has its own personality, some echoes remain of the previous incarnation, such as intuitions on safe and dangerous areas nearby and an instinctual gravitation toward its old lair.",
			"",
			"While mirror serpents resemble snakes in many regards, their snouts are elongated and toothy, like the face of a gharial, and pair of crystalline horns crowns their brows. The reflective sheen of a mirror serpent's scales can be quite dazzling in bright sunlight as it dives into or leaps out of water, chasing birds and fish with equal prowess. The structure of a mirror serpent's scales resembles that of actual glazed mirrors, making the creatures vulnerable to sonic attacks. Mirror serpent flesh is hardy and resembles cloudy glass, and they bleed slightly luminescent blue liquid when they're wounded.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents' primary diet consists of amphibian and avian animals that live in or near their territories, though they are typically not opposed to eating those humanoids foolish enough to blunder into their domains, especially if the mirror serpent guards treasure of particular power, secrecy, or value. These serpents rarely fight to the death unless they feel there's no other choice. One function of their hunting is to keep major predators away from their territory so that when the mirror serpent dies, its egg has a better chance of surviving its incubation period. Mirror serpents use their natural invisibility when investigating whether creatures are food or a threat. When they choose to fight, mirror serpents make sudden attacks and retreats, turning invisible in order to hide their movements and strike from a new vantage point. They use their savage bites to separate their foes and attempt to fling them into water, where the serpents can take advantage of their superior mobility.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most mirror serpents lair near or within ancient Azlanti ruins so they can seek out and collect treasures and trinkets that lie forgotten among Earthfall's devastation. Each lair is usually located near a body of water, and its opening is most likely overlooking or hiding below the water's surface. A common place for a den is on the side of a natural cliff or a part of a ruined tower that has no other access points. Even when the entrance is below the surface, the actual living area is situated above water level. When in their lairs, mirror serpents lie curled in the center, while their treasure is spread against the surrounding walls. Not all of the treasure-or even most of it-is of actual monetary value, since items need only to gleam and be beautiful to catch the attention of the serpents. Mirrored scales, or even a complete husk, are often found among the piled treasure as the newest incarnation has dragged the glittering remains of the previous mirror serpent into the lair.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents hate creatures that defile nature or deface structures within their domain, causing them to become violent from the outset. It's possible to communicate with mirror serpents by speaking Azlanti; the knowledge of that language was imbued in the creatures during the ritual of their creation and remains with them through each rebirth. Once a person has entered the territory of a mirror serpent, there's a small window of opportunity to speak up in order to keep it from attacking and driving the intruder away. An offering of treasure or ornate trinkets goes a long way toward appeasing a mirror serpent to allow swift safe passage through its domain. If the territories of two mirror serpents are adjacent to each other, minor clashes may arise between the two beasts. Such fights rarely lead to death, as one them eventually yields to the more powerful rival, accepting defeat over endangering even its greatest enemy's cycle of rebirth.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpent scales are a valued material for those who craft magical armor. With proper techniques, it's possible to forge a suit of scale mail that retains a portion of the spell-reflecting ability that mirror serpents have. If a person comes upon a mirror serpent egg, she can attempt to train the newly hatched serpent and turn it into a guardian or a companion. However, the echoes of lifetimes it has spent free in the wild make this a challenge."

A mngwa knows the direction and general distance to its focus of hate (or the nearest member in the case of a group). This sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. While its focus of hate exists, a mngwa destroyed through violence fades away and reappears fully restored in 1d4+1 days.

When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage.

This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey!",
			"",
			"Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar.",

			"",
			"When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, seeking out lone targets much as they did in life.

Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life's work of slaughter and murder as best they can.",
			"",
			"Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society's dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg's attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg's control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.",

At times, unusual methods of execution can trigger equally unusual mohrgs. The extreme nature of these executions are such that these variant mohrgs are only rarely created by accident; more often, they are deliberate creations by officials who themselves dabble in necromancy and may in fact be as vile as those they put to death.",
			"",
			"**Desert Mohrg (+0 CR):** A desert mohrg rises from a violent criminal who has been executed via torturous means in arid, hot environments, typically methods designed to kill through exposure and draw out the criminal's expiration. Being affixed to a rock, tree, or other object and being buried up to the neck and left to bake in the sun are both methods that can result in the creation of desert mohrgs. A desert mohrg looks leathery and dry, not moist, but has the same statistics as a typical mohrg. Spawn created by a desert mohrg rise as [burning skeletons](template/skeleton) rather than fast zombies.",
			"",
			"**Fleshwalker Mohrg (+0 CR):** When a criminal is executed through methods that leave no physical mark upon the body (such as by poison or a death effect), and then the corpse is preserved via a [gentle repose](spell/gentle_repose) spell, a fleshwalker mohrg is the result. While these mohrgs function as normal mohrgs, their flesh does not decay; further castings of gentle repose are unnecessary. Only upon close inspection (whereupon one might notice a faint underlying charnel stench, or might note the lack of breathing with a DC 30 Perception check) or in combat (when the creature's hideous tongue extrudes from its mouth) is the truth apparent.",
			"",
			"**Frost Mohrg (+1 CR):** Distinctive for the icy sheen over the blue flesh of its innards and tendrils, a frost mohrg's genesis is similar to that of a desert mohrg-a violent criminal that is executed via lingering exposure to the elements, only in this case, in a cold environment. Frost mohrgs look partially frozen and retain much of their flesh, albeit flesh blackened by frostbite. A frost mohrg has the [advanced](template/advanced) creature simple template, and its attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit.",
			"",
			"**Mohrg-mother (+1 CR):** Perhaps among the most perverse category of mohrg arises when the executed murderer is also pregnant with child. The unborn, undead infants of these nightmarish monsters cling to the exposed entrails of the mohrg, but do not grant any additional powers. All mohrg-mothers always have the [advanced](template/advanced) creature simple template. Once per day, a mohrg-mother can choose to animate a recently slain victim as another mohrg instead of as a fast zombie."

Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind.",

These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations of larger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them.",
			"",
			"Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation.",
			"",
			"Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host.",

A slugspawn's host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a nearinstantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren."

Alternatively, the morgodea can inspire visions of insects crawling under the target's skin, sickening the target for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 15 Will save negates either effect.

Compelled to corrupt and debase, these disgusting creatures deal in a pleasure that can plunge their victims into the depths addiction and madness. Morgodeas appear as human or elven vagrants covered in dirty rags. These \"rags\" are actually layered flaps of hide the morgodea can open to reveal a brood of cockroaches crawling amid its waxy, yellow flesh. Large pores in its body constantly weep a pale, thick jelly that sustains its nest of vermin and inspires euphoric visions in humanoids.",

The fey itself can extend a hidden chitinous pincer from its abdomen, and needlelike stings from the palm of each hand. It uses its massive claw to restrain victims while it injects them with its addictive venom again and again. A victim caught in this way is overwhelmed by the morgodea's druglike poison, and the prey's consequent hallucinations render its attacker indistinguishable in the teeming mass of hissing, gel-smeared insects, even as the morgodea holds it in place. A morgodea stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas originated in the First World, where they once cleaned the filth and refuse from the Eldests' glittering cities. Some ancestral crime corrupted their entire bloodline, and saw their people banished to the Material Plane, where their bodies twisted and warped to mirror their foul, covetous hearts. They can eat any sort of rotting organic matter, but prefer the flesh of humanoid creatures rendered comatose by their addictive jelly. These awful monsters keep such victims alive as long as possible, carefully consuming only those parts of their victims' bodies that will not necessarily kill the prey. The addict's brain is the foremost delicacy, and saved for a final feast.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas reproduce by inserting a single egg into a comatose addict. Within days, the egg develops into a larva, which burrows its way into the brain and consumes it, and then begins to merge with the brainless body. Throughout this time, the parent keeps its young hidden away in a foul place, while the body emits a pheromone to attract cockroaches from the surrounding area to inhabit the corpse-laying eggs and multiplying by the hundreds-while feeding from the jelly produced by the growing larva. After 4 weeks, the body reawakens as an adult morgodea, already host to a large swarm of the insects and covered in porous, waxy flesh that weeps its own supply of morgod jelly.",

			"Morgodeas are strongly attracted to sprawling urban areas, where they nestle against the dark underbelly of civilization. Such settlements must be large enough to provide a level of anonymity to their inhabitants. Morgodeas' secret infestation of cities is like a foul disease creeping through the bloodstream to infect the vital organs of society. An infestation begins with a lone morgodea claiming a lair-often an abandoned building or sewer-and clearing the surrounding area of other predators before it begins selling the dubious pleasures of its jelly to the desperate and demented. Soon thereafter, the monster's growing number of thralls secure its place in the underworld and bring it rotting meats and fruits, strong alcohols, and sugary sweets in payment. Eventually, those overwhelmed by addiction slip into a nightmare-filled coma before becoming a meal or a newborn morgodea.",
			"",
			"A morgodea's nest slowly grows alongside its influence and stock of customers. A full infestation of morgodeas rarely contains more than five or six of the creatures, and even then, only the largest of cities and metropolises that can sustain such numbers without rapid detection of the nest. Morgodeas in excess of this number leave the nest to seek out new settlements to infest, or else are devoured by their own families long before they gestate from their larval states.",

They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these \"larders\" live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.",

			"**Corrupting Touch (Su)** An etioling can corrupt living flesh with her touch as a standard action. This attack inflicts a number of d6 equal to its CR in damage (10d6 for most etiolings). This damage is not negative energy-it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, as are undead and creatures with the mortic subtype; otherwise, the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A successful DC 24 Fortitude save halves the damage dealt. An etioling cannot turn this ability off.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic Seep (Su)** An etioling's body constantly weeps ectoplasm-a physical manifestation of the bleachling apathy her body can no longer contain. Any creature touching or being touched by an etioling, or attacking her with a melee weapon, must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be coated in this fluid apathy, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, caster level checks, saving throws, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls until the ectoplasm can be scraped off as a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

While moving through a wall or other solid object in this way, the etioling treats the structure as difficult terrain and must use additional movement to pass through it.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Perhaps the most miserable of the mortics-humanoids infused with necrotic energy-etiolings are born from gnomes who have already begun to suffer from the Bleaching. The burst of negative energy into their living flesh twists the process and awakens connections to the First World and long-lost fey magic, leaving the surviving creature ethereal, manic, and overflowing with the vital essence of fey. While they resemble bleachling gnomes, veins of primal, First World energy pump beneath an etioling's pale flesh. Occasional pulses of unchecked energy crackle across their flesh and hair.",
			"",
			"Their transformation is hardly one of redemption. An etioling's touch decays living flesh to fuel the supernatural furnace that rages inside them, and their bodies shake uncontrollably as the churn of primordial magic and negative energy causes tremors and muscle spasms. Focusing for more than a few moments becomes impossible, and etiolings become creatures of instinct and impulse, acting on vague memories and emotional connections. Like ghosts, they stick for days or weeks into a routine, reliving some pivotal memory and assigning familiar identities to new people they meet. Etiolings suspend not only their living functions but also their physical connection to the living world, becoming ethereal when they hold their breath.",
			"",
			"An etioling stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 25 pounds.",
			"",
			"Outwardly, etiolings seem carefree and giddy-almost unsettlingly so-as they struggle to focus or hold still. Their existence is a constant battle of wills between the heady, screaming rush of euphoria provided by their rekindled connection to the First World and any semblance of rational thought. The struggle to maintain themselves can be overwhelming, and those who don't succumb to mania are often aggressive and irritable instead. This supernatural wellspring of emotion forces bleachling apathy from their bodies, manifesting it as a physical ectoplasm capable of turning aside attacks and infecting other creatures.",
			"",
			"Like most mortics, etiolings spring forth from disaster. Anywhere negative energy intrudes on the living world - especially in powerful surges - gnomes risk this unnatural transformation. The infusion of necrotic power hijacks the Bleaching that most gnomes succumb to, warping their minds and reigniting ancient connections to sylvan magic. Most mortic gnomes develop unsettling or \"ghostly\" magic focusing on illusions, fear, and confusion, but others develop more primordial and fey magic that hijacks others' emotions and inspires endless revelry.",
			"",
			"Whether courtesy of the negative energy replacing their souls or the powerful fey magic that burns inside them, etiolings can briefly slip from the physical world and become ghostly apparitions capable of flight and passing through solid matter. This ethereal state silences the mania bubbling from within and allows the crushing bleachling depression to flow over them, providing painful respite from their energetic lives. Because this unearthly state severs them from the wellspring of emotion that powers their magic, they cannot use any of their sylvan magic while incorporeal.",

			"**Family:** [Mortic](family/mortic)",

			"Those etiolings who survive their radical change with their minds largely intact often band together in small communities for support. More often, evil and abusive fey flock to the mortic gnomes-attracted by the sylvan magic and primal emotion like flies to honey-and orbit the etioling to bask in the chaos they create or prey on creatures weakened by the dread gnome's deadly caress.",
			"",
			"Thanks to their magic and incidental allure to fey, etiolings usually find homes in primeval wildernesses. Even those who take up residence in permanent structures find their magic and unwanted followers transforming any dwelling into an overgrown ruin within weeks. Because they cannot control their corrupting touch, anything the gnomes interact with regularly is scrubbed clean of life, from insects and moss to gardens to mortal neighbors. While the world around them flourishes, their own circles decay into tumbledown sterility.",
			"",
			"Storms bring some measure of calm to the etioling's mind-as if the primordial energy within them were siphoned off by the more powerful forces swirling about- and the mortics can seem truly mad as they rejoice in dangerous weathers. Most are simply intoxicated by the terrible but awesome displays of nature, though a few become true servants of powerful weather-controlling outsiders or fey, striking grim bargains to bring suffering to others in exchange for control over their own unstable minds."

			"",
			"**Rotting Flesh (Su)** Gurgists are forever slowly rotting, their flesh growing soft and discolored and eventually sloughing off in rancid slabs. The only way a gurgist can arrest this decay is to consume raw meat. A gurgist begins to rot if she goes more than 1 week without eating roughly 10% of her body weight in raw meat. After 1 week, she takes 1 point of Constitution damage and 1 point of Charisma damage each day until she can feed. This damage cannot be healed until the gurgist has fed. A [gentle repose](spell/gentle_repose) spell extends the amount of time a gurgist can go without feeding for the duration of the spell.",

			"A gurgist [mortic](subtype/mortic) is a keen mind trapped within a rotting, hungering body. Gurgists can feel the decay of their flesh, just as they can feel the urgings of their gullet to rend and consume meat until they bloat with it. But unlike zombies and other carnivorous undead, mortics still have their wits about them and use their minds to find solutions to their nature. They hunt and herd to keep the rot at bay, they obsess over crafts or skills to distract from the hunger, and they wear extravagant masks and colorful garments to hide their hideousness.",
			"",
			"Gurgists are the same size as humans, averaging 5-1/2 to 6 feet tall, and weighing about 160 pounds.",
			"",
			"Gurgists are among the more common mortics, created whenever a human being is afflicted with a little too much negative energy. A [zombie's](template/zombie) bite will do the trick, but so too will a [mummy's](monster/mummy) curse or a necromancer's enchantment, giving rise to a metaphysical anomaly that causes the gurgist's body to think itself dead and free to rot. The body first grows pale, and then develops purple-red splotches on its skin as the blood stills and stagnates. If the gurgist isn't careful, her flesh then grows gray or waxy and begins to rot, with hideous sores opening. A gurgist who allows this to persist will eventually see large parts of her body liquefy, which usually proves fatal to the gurgist in question.",
			"",
			"The only way for a gurgist to stop the process is to eat raw meat-the more, the better. Through some occult means, the gurgist's half-dead biology then repairs itself and can even reverse smaller changes. A recently fed gurgist can mostly pass for a human, albeit a pale and sickly one, and gurgists who deal with the living are scrupulous in maintaining a daily feeding schedule.",
			"",
			"As part of their cursed biology, gurgists suffer from a powerful hunger for meat, preferably fresh raw meat or offal. This hunger is a constant, gnawing sensation at the back of a gurgist's mind, and while it doesn't drive her to madness, it certainly drives her to distraction. Luckily for all involved, gurgists have at best a very mild preference for human flesh, and so most subsist on enormous quantities of raw beef, pork, or wild game.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Mortic](family/mortic)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Few gurgists can pass for long in mortal society. Their unceasing rot marks them, and their dietary needs limit them. Instead, most live in small villages out on the outskirts of civilization, in wild lands where law breaks down and a community of masked half-dead can live, if not unnoticed, then at least unmolested.",
			"",
			"Gurgist villages devote great effort to dealing with the twin problems of rot and hunger. Gurgists ensure there is always plenty of meat around, and so they often become herders and hunters. Many extend their animal-tending skills to other beasts as well. Gurgists are infinitely creative when it comes to taming the local wildlife, and their half-dead hardiness means they can risk dealing with creatures that other people would avoid, such as [ankhegs](monster/ankheg), [chimeras](monster/chimera), [griffons](monster/griffon), and [mammoths](monster/mammoth). Gurgists also think of weaker undead as just one more type of beast to train, though no gurgist willingly deals with zombies of any stripe: the similarities are simply too close for comfort.",
			"",
			"Dealing with the hunger is harder. Most gurgist communities use distraction to keep themselves sane. Gurgists find a hobby or activity and focus all their will and drive on that one thing, until it becomes greater in their minds than their hunger. Gurgists might become master animal trainers or leatherworkers, painters, carvers, poets, or anything else that keeps the edge of hunger at bay. In some gurgist villages, all residents choose the same mania, elevating it to something akin to a religion. More often, they each pursue their own private obsessions, placing their skills in the service of their communities.",
			"",
			"Masks and clothing are vital parts of gurgist culture. While there are exceptions, most gurgists find their slow rot no more pleasing to the eye than outsiders do. They instead make beautiful and colorful garb, with particular emphasis placed on unique and eye-catching masks. Gurgists wear their masks constantly, tying them with leather bands or in extreme cases even sewing them to their half-rotted flesh, and many gurgists consider their masks to be their true faces. Gurgist masks also often say something about the gurgists' roles in their community. Hunters or warriors have small, elegant masks, while artisans have more extravagant masks adorned with symbols of their trade.",
			"",
			"Gurgist communities tend to be standoffish but not actively hostile to others in the area. In wilder areas, such as in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse or near the Crown of the World, gurgists are sometimes even accepted as neighbors by local human communities-not necessarily comfortable or friendly, but as allies against more dangerous forces."

The fact that lifeleechers consume their foes' life energy with their maws leads many of them to gravitate toward cannibalism in general, and even those who do not partake of cannibalism tend to prefer their meat fresh and raw.",

			"Lifeleecher mortics enjoy an almost celebrity status in orc settlements, both feared and revered for their strange ability to shrug off death blows. In a society where might makes right, death-defying lifeleecher mortics quickly climb their tribal hierarchies as their ability to defeat their orc cousins proves their strength and worthiness to rule. In other cases, powerful mortics find themselves quickly sold off to large gladiatorial stables in Belkzen and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the savage, tusk-lined fighting pits within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Many managers enjoy having a lifeleecher mortic champion in these blood-soaked arenas, as the mortics' prolonged fights and supernatural displays both wow and terrify crowds in a gruesome spectacle often talked about for several seasons after the bout itself.",
			"",
			"Unfortunately, lifeleechers' penchant for animating those they defeat into wights, even temporarily, stirs many orc superstitions regarding death and magic. Tribes whisper insults depicting the lifeleechers as undead creatures themselves or suggest that they are possessed by fiends. Of course, most orcs would never say such things to a lifeleecher mortic's face; they are far more likely to grovel at the lifeleecher's feet to garner favor from their much stronger kin.",
			"",
			"Many soothsayers, shamans, oracles, and witches believe lifeleecher mortics hold the spirits of fallen orc heroes killed before they fulfilled their destiny, and it is this power that drives these nigh-indestructible warriors. When a lifeleecher mortic takes a mate, it prefers others of its kind; however, due to their orc heritage, these mortics can also breed with orcs and humans, and their often-high status gives them plenty of opportunity to do so. A mortic's offspring, whether orc or half-orc, all have potential to manifest as lifeleecher mortics when their racial ferocity triggers. Unfortunately, tribes all too often attempt to hasten this phenomenon, risking the lives of young orcs to spark this heritage, and it is more likely for a young orc with a lifeleecher mortic parent to die than for the child's mortic abilities to be unleashed.",
			"",
			"Lifeleecher mortics who live apart from orc settlements fare far worse than their half-orc cousins in similar communities. Something about their mannerisms, especially their dead eyes, is off-putting to non-orcs. Add to that their proclivity for cannibalism, and lifeleecher mortics find they do not assimilate well outside of gladiatorial pens or spectacle sideshows, and the public quickly drives them out into the wild when they discover the lifeleecher mortic's questionable heritage and unsavory diet. This suits most lifeleecher mortics just fine, as outside of orc lands they gravitate towards loner lifestyles as explorers, big-game hunters, and practitioners of guerrilla warfare."

			"**Fatal Accident (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a relictner can focus its deteriorating curse to wreak havoc around them. When using this ability, a relictner chooses a structure or manufactured object within 60 feet no larger than 15 feet by 15 feet, such as a statue, treasure chest, or support pillar. The chosen object falls, crumbles, or is otherwise compromised in such a way that it damages any creature adjacent to it, dealing 12d6 points of damage to each creature, or half as much damage to each creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. Alternatively, the relictner can deal only 6d6 points of damage and also attempt a ranged bull rush, trip, or sunder maneuver check as a free action with a +4 racial bonus against each target that fails its Reflex save (sundering in this way deals 6d6 points of damage). This attack may deal more or less damage depending on the object chosen and the GM's discretion, and it typically creates difficult terrain in the area around it. The DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Ruin Bond (Su)** A relictner forms a bond with the structure it calls home. Single relictners form bonds with huts or houses, families of relictners bond with castles or temples, and clans can bond with entire ruined cities. All structures in a relictner's bonded ruin lose 1 hit point per day and can be reduced to a minimum of 10 hit points. Within its bonded ruin, a relictner gains a +10 bonus to AC and on saving throws against environmental effects and any traps. A relictner can have only one bonded ruin at a time but can create a new one by living in a suitable structure for at least 1 week. A relictner who spends more than 24 hours away from its bonded ruin becomes fatigued and shaken until it returns to the ruin.",
			"",
			"**Ruin Sense (Su)** A relictner is instantly aware of any creature that dies within its bonded ruin, as well as the direction and approximate distance of the dead creature.",
			"",
			"**Weathering Aura (Su)** A relictner radiates an entropic aura of decay and disrepair. All objects within 30 feet of a relictner, including held and worn nonmagical objects, have their hardness reduced by 5, to a minimum of 0, as long as they are within the area of the weathering aura and for 1 round after leaving the area. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A relictner mortic is two entities in one: a vicious, grasping curse and its half-undead dwarven host. The hosts resemble gaunt, prematurely aged dwarves, their hair gray and ragged, their faces nothing but masses of wrinkles. The curse, however, is a strong and subtle thing, rotting and weathering everything the relictner sees or touches until only ruins are left. Outcast and eternally bitter, most relictners remove themselves to abandoned halls and forgotten ruins that they remake into shrines of mortal despair, filling their new homes with traps and pitfalls to snare the unwary.",
			"",
			"A typical relictner stands about 4 feet tall and weighs 125 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, when a dwarf survives the affliction of a [mummy's](monster/mummy) curse, a sliver of that dread power remains in her blood, lying dormant for years or even generations. The curse mutates, and its host mutates in turn to become the half-dead creature known as a relictner. The two grow together in a kind of twisted symbiosis, until it becomes hard to tell where the relictner ends and its curse begins. Removing a relictner's curse (possible only with [wish](spell/wish) or [miracle](spell/miracle)) kills it instantly, as the curse has long since taken over the host's vital biological functions.",
			"",
			"Soon after its curse manifests, a relictner feels an urge to claim some kind of structure or building as its own. A relictner considers its home a vital part of its being, much like a hermit crab's shell, and few relictners willingly leave their chosen lairs. A relictner forced to leave its home experiences bouts of twitchy, agoraphobic mania interspersed with melancholic lethargy. This is not to say that relictners don't sometimes grit their teeth and travel-a relictner is an intelligent creature, after all-but it takes quite a lot of motivation.",
			"",
			"A relictner's curse encompasses its chosen home, weakening it, desecrating it, and turning even the greatest example of dwarven architecture into a barely standing ruin within a matter of months. Relictners' ruins are places where terrible accidents can happen with little warning, and where lives can be lost in sudden structural collapses. Relictners themselves are almost never in any danger, however. The mortic's curse may not be alive in any conventional sense, but it does have some tiny spark of awareness, enough to make a point of never harming its host.",
			"",
			"Whenever someone dies inside the cursed ruins of a relictner, the mortic feels a sudden rush of energy and confidence as its curse fulfills its true purpose. The more painful, agonizing, and despair-ridden the death, the greater the subsequent high. The same ability also makes it easy for relictners to stalk prey within their domiciles, as they can usually find survivors nearby.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Mortic](family/mortic)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A few relictners try to hide in larger dwarven society, though their destructive aura makes it difficult: people tend to notice when fine dwarven workmanship falls to pieces in a matter of weeks. And to dwarves, relictners are nothing less than abominations, horrific blasphemies that by their very nature destroy everything that dwarves strive to create. Those relictners who manage to hide do so by pretending to be older than they are and by living in slums or shantytowns, places where one more ruined building won't be remarked upon. More often, though, relictners are exiled or forced out. These bitter outcasts seek existing ruins, where they either live alone as hermits or in small, orderly clans, and from which they plan their revenge on the living.",
			"",
			"Relictner ruins tend to be terrifying places to visit. Relictners generally seek out the most impressive ruins they can find, ideally those with curses or undead residents of their own; relictners are immune to other jinxes, and they get along very well with [liches](template/lich) or mummies, offering service in exchange for residence. They are expert trapmakers and delight in devising creative ways to violently mutilate and kill their victims.",
			"",
			"Of course, creating traps that never get triggered is boring, so relictners routinely lure visitors to their ruinous homes. Particularly duplicitous relictners have even been known to hire adventuring parties as unwitting meat for their grinders, finding these capable targets a satisfying test for their skills."

			"**Deadwood Curse (Su)** When a mosslord confirms a critical hit with one of its claws, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or a horrid curse transforms one of its limbs into an immobile wooden branch. Roll 1d4 to determine which limb is affected (1-right arm, 2-left arm, 3-right leg, 4-left leg; adjust the die as necessary for creatures with fewer or more limbs). The cursed limb hardens and becomes entirely immobile until the curse is lifted. If an arm is affected, the victim's Strength is reduced by 2 and it cannot wield weapons in that hand or use the hand in any way. If a victim's leg is affected, the victim's Dexterity is reduced by 2 and its base speed is reduced by 15 feet. Each time a creature is affected by this curse, a new limb is affected, and the effects stack. If a cursed limb is amputated and regrown via magic, the new limb regrows as deadwood as long as the curse persists. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Perennial (Su)** When a mosslord dies, its body decomposes normally but regrows in 60 days. A dead mosslord cannot regrow during winter months or when there is frost or snow on the ground where it was slain; in such a condition, its regrowth is delayed until the thaw. If the region where the mosslord was slain is affected by a lasting winter (either via magic or as a result of natural conditions), its regrowth can be delayed indefinitely. Even completely destroying a mosslord's body won't stop its eventual regrowth. A blight or diminish plants spell applied to a mosslord's remains can ensure its permanent death if the caster succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check. A mosslord slain on any plane other than the Material Plane remains dead permanently. Obscure rituals can also aid in the permanent death of a mosslord, at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"**Sheets of Moss (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, a mosslord can cover a 20-foot-square area in a thick blanket of toxic moss at a range of up to 90 feet. Living creatures in the area are automatically entangled and sickened and must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round until the moss dissipates or is destroyed. The moss has 25 hit points per 5-foot square, but can only be damaged by cold or effects that specifically target plants (such as blight) or deal additional damage to plants (such as horrid wilting). Otherwise, the sheets of moss wither away automatically after 1d4+4 rounds. The sickened effect and Constitution damage are poison effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Mold Blast (Su)** As a standard action, a mosslord can swiftly extrude a puffball and hurl it up to 60 feet. Upon impact, the puffball bursts into an unusually thick and potent cloud of [yellow mold](rule/slimes_molds_and_fungi) spores. This cloud of spores fills a 10-foot-radius area, obscuring vision as if it were a fog cloud and affecting all creatures within the area with yellow mold, except the Fortitude save to resist the mold's poisonous effects is DC 30. A creature that takes Constitution damage from these thick spores is also nauseated for 1 round. The cloud of spores persists for 1d4 rounds, after which it automatically dissipates. Creatures with greensight can see through these clouds of spores with ease. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Tales of the wretched mosslord have existed for as long as humanity has dared dwell amid the forests of the world. It appears in grotesque pictographs of long dead civilizations, covering the walls of lost cities on sunken continents or hidden in overgrown jungles. So ancient is the creature that its true origin remains unknown. In the cultures whose lore and legend tell of the mosslord, it is described as the living incarnation of the forest's vengeance against the encroachment of civilization, a fury given mind and focus toward the destruction of humanity. To date, no one has ever reported spotting more than a single mosslord at a time, prompting speculation as to whether more than a single mosslord exists, or if it is a singular entity that simply regrows itself each time it is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Most tales of the mosslord's intentions hold true, although the legends of there being but one mosslord are a false hope-in truth, multiple mosslords exist, and wherever one surfaces, ruin inevitably follows. Yet mosslords are hardly the simple, violent juggernauts that old legends purport. Instead, these wickedly intelligent creatures mastermind elaborate campaigns against civilization. Capable of commanding hordes of plant creatures, they typically spend months or even years seeding a target before launching an incursion-even if their attacks seem sudden and unprovoked to the victims. They are clever combatants, shielding themselves from direct attacks and avoiding melee if at all possible, in order to command and maneuver allies. Still, the creature is an able warrior in addition to having a potent arsenal of spells, and it doesn't shy from engaging opponents in melee when directly faced with an immediate opponent. Among all humanoid forms of life, they despise humans and halflings in particular.",
			"",
			"A mosslord has no known or ties to the fey world or to those worlds or planes beyond the material realm. Though the mosslord is no deity, it is a wholly supernatural being and the apocalyptic texts of over a dozen different religions depict its wrath. These texts often revile the mosslord and condemn those who would worship it or pay it reverence. Despite ominous warnings, history reports a handful of occasions when doom cults praised, venerated, and pledged fealty to mosslords. Some even credit or blame such cults for the creation of the first mosslords, for it seems odd that plant creatures would naturally form upon the wooden frames that hold its fungal flesh in the form of a bipedal humanoid. Regardless, such efforts tend to be short lived; as soon as the cultists capture the mosslord's attention, they find they have only attracted its relentless and utter destruction.",
			"",
			"The mosslord's body consists of a large skeletal frame that towers over 15 feet tall, fashioned from rough-cut pieces of wood. A thick layer of moss encompasses this frame, creating the appearance of flesh. While a mosslord's body appears constructed, the creature is fully sentient and highly intelligent. Despite their similar hateful and destructive views of civilization, mosslords do not cooperate with blights or whisperers, and they often compete with these strange entities for control over their woodland territories."

The majority are at least 10th-level clerics, and are often kings or pharaohs who have called upon dark gods or sinister necromancers to bind their souls to their bodies after death-usually as a means to extend their rule beyond the grave, but at times simply to escape what they fear will be an eternity of torment in their own afterlife.",

			"",
			"**Bog Mummy:** A bog mummy's DR changes to DR 10/slashing and is vulnerable to cold instead of fire. A bog mummy causes grave ichor (see below) with its slam instead of mummy rot.",
			"",
			"**Ice Mummy:** An ice mummy, sometimes called a mountain mummy or a glacial mummy, lacks a mummy's normal despair and mummy rot abilities, and instead gains the chilling touch and entangling wrappings variant mummy special abilities (see below).",

			"**Source** [Pathfinder #81: Shifting Sands pg. 71](source/pathfinder_#81_shifting_sands)",
			"",
			"The abilities of a mummy reflect the circumstances of its creation. Mummies that arise from traditionally embalmed corpses usually exhibit standard abilities; those arising from natural mummification or more exotic embalming rituals may not.",
			"",
			"Several variant mummy abilities replace a mummy's basic despair or mummy rot abilities, as described in the ability, and do not alter its CR. Exceptional mummies may gain additional abilities instead of having their powers replaced. GMs modifying mummies with additional or variant abilities should check the final monster and adjust the CR appropriately.",
			"",
			"These abilities can also be applied to undead with the mummified creature template. For purposes of variant abilities, any ability that replaces despair can replace burst of vengeance, and any ability that replaces mummy rot can replace dust stroke. Optionally, to create a mummified creature with the same special abilities as a traditional mummy, simply replace the mummified creature's burst of vengeance with despair, or replace its dust stroke with mummy rot.",
			"",
			"Many variant abilities are described in terms of a standard, linen-wrapped mummy. Adjust the description appropriately for mummies with different origins. For example, an ice mummy grapples and constricts its victims by chilling them to the bone with waves of cold instead of by wrapping them in linen strips (as presented in the entangling wrappings ability).",
			"",
			"### Chilling Touch (Su)",
			"",
			"This mummy's touch carries the chill of glaciers and mountain heights. Its slam attack deals an additional 1d6 points of cold damage, and creatures struck by it are slowed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude negates).

			"### Entangling Wrappings (Su)",
			"",
			"A mummy with entangling wrappings can unravel and detach some of its linen strips to make a grapple check against a creature up to 10 feet away (or twice the mummy's reach for larger mummies). This attack doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. It can constrict for an amount of damage equal to its slam attack with a successful grapple check. The linen strips remain wrapped around the victim and attempt a grapple check to pin each round on the mummy's turn. They continue to deal constrict damage on a successful grapple check. The wrappings cannot be damaged by any attack or effect while detached, but turn to dust if their victim escapes or dies, or if the mummy is destroyed. If the mummy still lives, its wrappings reappear at the end of its next turn.",
			"",
			"The mummy is not inconvenienced in any way while its wrappings are detached and grappling, but it cannot use its wrappings to entangle again until they return. This ability replaces either despair or mummy rot.",
			"",
			"### Infested (Ex)",
			"",
			"An infested mummy carries a scarab swarm inside its body cavity. The mummy can release its swarm as a standard action, or it can do so as an immediate action after taking damage from a slashing weapon. The swarm is completely under the mummy's control, and can't be harmed while inside the mummy, though it streams out of the mummy's body if the mummy is destroyed. If the swarm is destroyed, a new swarm grows to replace it in 24 hours. For variation, instead of carrying a scarab swarm, an infested mummy can hold any swarm of CR 3 or lower. An infested mummy's CR is 1 higher than that of a normal mummy, or this ability can replace despair and mummy rot and not affect the mummy's final CR.",

The total spell levels scribed cannot exceed the mummy's Hit Dice, and the spells must be of a level no higher than half the mummy's Hit Dice. This allows a standard 8 HD mummy spells of up to 4th level that add up to no more than 8 levels. The spells need not be from the same spell list, and arcane and divine spells can both be used in the creation of a spellscribed mummy. Individual spells cannot be repeated. The mummy can use each spell scribed in its wrappings once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to its Hit Dice. Save DCs are Charisma-based. A spellscribed mummy's CR is 1 higher than that of a normal mummy.",
			"",
			"Lesser: A lesser spellscribed mummy bears a single1st- or 2nd-level spell in its wrappings, usable once per day with a caster level equal to half its Hit Dice. Its CR does not increase.",
			"",
			"Greater: A greater spellscribed mummy operates as a normal spellscribed mummy, but its wrappings can hold as many spells as it has Hit Dice. The total spell levels scribed cannot exceed twice its Hit Dice, and the spells must be of a level no higher than half its Hit Dice. Spells cannot be repeated, but spells of a level no higher than one-quarter the mummy's hit dice can be used 3 times per day instead of 1. (For example, a standard greater spellscribed mummy with 8 Hit Dice can have up to 8 different spells, of no higher than 4th level, and a total of not more than 16 spell levels. It can use spells of 2nd level or lower 3 times per day, and spells of higher levels once per day.)",

			"### Variant Mummy Rot (Su)",
			"",
			"Those afflicted with the dreaded mummy's curse wither and fade, resisting all healing until they finally crumble into dust. Other forms of mummy rot exist, affecting the victim in the same fashion as classic mummy rot except where otherwise noted. Typically, the method of mummification determines which type of rot the mummy causes. These alternate strains of mummy rot do not alter the mummy's CR.",
			"",
			"**Corpse Chills:** Corpse chills manifest as bitter cold and frostbite. Those suffering from corpse chills gain vulnerability to cold and resist fire 10. Immunity to cold prevents and suppresses corpse chills, but does not cure the disease if it has already been contracted.",
			"",
			"**Grave Ichor:** Water saturates the skin of victims of grave ichor until their very flesh breaks down and sloughs off their bodies. Grave ichor deals 1d4 points of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma damage. The loose skin caused by grave ichor grants the victim a +4 bonus to CMD against grappling.",
			"",
			"**Phantom Infestation:** The victim's skin breaks out in welts, but it exhibits no other trace of infestation until the body bursts in an eruption of scarab beetles at the instant of the victim's death. Phantom infestation imposes a -2 penalty on all ability and skill checks.",
			"",
			"**Swamp Crumble:** This affliction causes 1d3 points of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma damage. The disease dissolves the bones, leaving behind a putrid mass of skin and organs after death. Bludgeoning weapons and effects deal 1 additional point of damage per die against those afflicted with swamp crumble. As the diseases progresses, the victim's hair turns the color of fresh-spilled blood."

Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his resurrection, a mummy lord retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate both the living and dead.",

			"The walking fungi known as myceloids feed off of decaying organic matter like many other fungi, yet unlike typical mushrooms or molds, they take particular pleasure in feeding from the rotting bodies of humanoids. Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like \"innocence,\" \"despair,\" and \"hope\" in the ripeness of rancid meat, although whether this is true or simply part of the myceloids' twisted sense of humor is unclear.",
			"",
			"Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with white lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores grow tenaciously in living flesh, causing a rapid spread of painful purple lesions that, in advanced stages of the sickness, sprout tiny purple mushrooms; plucking these mushrooms is painful to the victim and causes bleeding. This condition, known as purple pox, is the method by which myceloids both season their meat and procreate.",
			"",
			"Myceloids prefer to capture victims alive for later infection and control. To a myceloid, a living creature has three uses-first as a slave, second as a host from which to birth new myceloids, and finally as a banquet to feast upon once the first two destinies have played out."

If the nachzehrer establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage to its victim. The nachzehrer heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.",
			"",
			"**Bound to the Grave (Su)** Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a helpless nachzehrer (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the nachzehrer is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and anointed with holy water, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet underground.",
			"",
			"**Call the Fallen (Su)** Once per day as a standard action while within any forest, the nachzehrer can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that have died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies to rise from the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the nachzehrer. These juju zombies don't provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the nachzehrer's control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can't rise in this way from any surface that isn't natural soil (such as the floor of a structure or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.",
			"",
			"**Fey Disguise (Su)** While in any forest, a nachzehrer can take on the illusory appearance of any Small or Medium fey creature. This does not affect the nachzehrer's statistics or give it any special abilities. A nachzehrer so disguised exposes its true nature through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts with the glamered nachzehrer can see through its disguise with a successful DC 25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Horrifying Vision (Su)** A nachzehrer can channel the foul energy of the terrible fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack are panicked for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma the nachzehrer endured, but the target can reduce this effect to shaken with a successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A nachzehrer can choose not to inflict its horrifying vision on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The saving throw is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence's origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.",
			"",
			"Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although rare no matter the location, nachzehrers are most likely to be found in blighted forests or in woodlands that have recently suffered sweeping bouts of disease. Many nachzehrers were once fey creatures whose bodies managed to resist a polluting blight - such as the Abyssal Darkblight that infects the deepest Fangwood in Nirmathas - that might have warped their bodies and minds (see the [blighted fey template](template/blighted_fey)). However, these fey nonetheless contract debilitating, wasting diseases that visit terrible suffering upon them until they finally succumb. The most unlucky of these fey find themselves returned to unlife as nachzehrers. In fact, dying from such diseases is the hallmark of all nachzehrers' rebirth.",
			"",
			"When nachzehrers arise, they do so in a weakened state-typically, nachzehrers begin unlife with only 1 hit point. Since most find themselves risen in graves that contain other fey creatures who also succumbed to disease, nachzehrers feed off the stagnant blood in those bodies, gaining vigor even as they drain the corpses of those who once loved them. In the rare case that a nachzehrer arises near no easily obtainable source of blood, the wicked creature typically slinks back to its ancestral enclave, waiting to pick off young and weak members of its former clan to drain the blood it needs to gain strength.",
			"",
			"Although they remember little about their lives before undeath, nachzehrers retain terrible memories of the pain and suffering they experienced during the infections that killed them. Worse, they can transmit these horrifying experiences to their enemies-and they count all living creatures as such, regarding them with equal parts hate and jealousy. Most nachzehrers wish to destroy life simply for the sake of doing so, but the oldest and most heinous of their number want to see as many creatures as possible suffer the same agony they did so long ago. Thus, because they don't need blood to survive, some nachzehrers capture victims and continually torture them with horrifying visions, without ever granting them the release of death.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because they suffered so deeply before rising as undead, nachzehrers particularly hate their ancestral fey clans, whom they blame for not finding a way to cure their disease or at least mitigate their agony. As a result, most nachzehrers stalk their former comrades, terrorizing them and waiting for opportune moments to steal lone victims. In the case of nachzehrers whose clans are gone-either wiped out by disease or otherwise fled from the area-the creatures roam about the woods, looking for other groups of living creatures to torment.",
			"",
			"Wandering nachzehrers are often drawn to places of great suffering in the hope that they might drown out some of the agonizing memories they continually relive. In fact, the most common place to find an unmoored nachzehrer is the site of a destroyed fey village in a blighted area or at the crossroads of woodland paths. Here, nachzehrers absorb the area's latent suffering while waiting for new victims to stumble upon their new lairs. Although their behavior is practically feral, nachzehrers are fiercely intelligent creatures. They are at least nominally aware that they're undead abominations, and that the hateful actions they commit are intensely evil. Thus, nachzehrers assume that nearby fey or benevolent humanoids will eventually seek to destroy them, and they fear nothing more than the arrival of planar allies such as angels to send them to oblivion.",
			"",
			"Nachzehrers hate and are uncommonly terrified of creatures that bear coins, which they assume are payment for a coming planar ally. Though nachzehrers can fight against coin-bearing individuals freely, placing a coin in a nachzehrer's mouth paralyzes it as much as a stake in the heart incapacitates a true vampire. Savvy adventurers can fully destroy a nachzehrer incapacitated in this way by going through the same grisly ritual they'd use to kill a child of the night. Those clever enough to lure a nachzehrer into helplessness find that this is the easiest way to dispatch the creatures. Tragically, though, all but the most discerning adventurers and scholars tend to mistake nachzehrers for their more common vampiric kin, and attempt to destroy them as they would true vampires, without using coins-always to disastrous results."

			"More bestial than their surface cousins, deep nagas jealously guard their lairs in the lightless depths of the Darklands. Deep nagas live near ley lines and other places of power because they hunger for magical energy, which they are able to siphon from their surroundings. Their volatile natures make them dangerous to deal with, but creatures who manage to appease them can earn safety within their territory.

They are able to sustain themselves in hibernation on nothing but magical energy when sources of meat are sparse, but deep nagas have a fixation on magic that goes beyond mere survival and is more akin to an addiction. What deep nagas lack in sophistication compared to the innate magic of their surface cousins, they make up for in raw power.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas that reside in places of great magical power are able to extend their lifespans to centuries and beyond, and even their reproduction cycles are tied to magical energy. Once adult deep nagas have found a place with a steady flow of magic, they are able reproduce asexually, laying anywhere from one to three large eggs every few years.",

			"Deep nagas can be found throughout the Darklands, from the deepest Vaults of Orv to the uppermost reaches of Nar-Voth. Wherever magical energy runs strongest along ancient ley lines, deep nagas make their isolated lairs and protect them with a fervor unmatched by other naga species. Deep nagas tend to be solitary creatures in the upper layers of the Darklands, where they are rarer and surrounded by races like the dark folk, derros, drow, and duergar. These nagas even drive out their progeny as soon they can fend for themselves, so that the offspring won't wrest the lair from their parent as they grow in power. Deep nagas of Orv form nests in ancient sites of power, with the founding deep naga lording over several generations of her progeny, the number depending on her age-though even in Orv, the strong drive out the weak if the number of deep nagas grows too high for the lair to sustain.",
			"",
			"Solitary deep nagas and smaller nests are more likely to allow tribes of troglodytes, skum, or degenerate serpentfolk to live in their territory for mutual benefit. These tribes tend to treat deep nagas as fickle, godlike creatures who are dangerous but offer protection to those that placate them, for the nagas are extremely hostile toward intruders within their territory. Treating with deep nagas usually falls to the shamans of the tribes, and some tribes have even formed cults that worship the creatures. These tribes bring offerings of flesh and magic to deep nagas who share their territory with the tribe. The nagas especially enjoy the flesh of magic users, which makes dealing with them even more dangerous for the shamans. If a naga is in a bad mood, the head shaman might be tempted to send an apprentice in his place because-as the tribal lore teaches-a great serpent that has feasted is easier to deal with. Ever paranoid, a deep naga is never too far from turning on a tribe that worships her if given a reason, imagined or real. If creatures of another race aren't useful to the deep naga, they are treated as food or threats to be extinguished.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas are very particular about and protective of their lairs. They exert a substantial effort to find one that suits their needs, so they don't give them up without a fight. Unless the source of magic depletes or they are driven out by a more powerful deep naga, they rarely abandon their lairs. However, if a deep naga learns of an even more potent magical site, she might try to conquer this new lair for herself. Deep nagas do not usually care what tribes that serve them do, as long as the offerings keep coming, but they might push the tribes to conquer a superior place for a lair."

			"Inhabitants of the Dimension of Dreams, dream nagas fly through dreamscapes as part of an unknowable plan to alter the destiny of the multiverse. Most creatures that encounter dream nagas do so while they sleep, as their dreams provide convenient shortcuts for the dream nagas' paths through the various dreamscapes. Even after these dreamers awaken, the sight of these beautiful creatures remains ingrained in their minds. Many cultures consider seeing a dream naga a sign of a special destiny. But when a dreaming creature gains the full attention of a dream naga, it is no mere chance encounter. For convoluted and arcane reasons that only they truly understand, dream nagas enter dreams and interact with the sleepers-sometimes relaying knowledge to the sleepers, and other times tormenting them. Such dream encounters often don't make sense to the dreaming creature until some point far in the future, if ever.",

A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries.

			"",
			"With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.",
			"",
			"As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs' usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.",

The final anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master's artistry, creativity, and personal preferences-as well as any specific goals it has in mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft's \"teeth\" could actually be dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its chest rather than in a distinct head.",

The creator must stitch, glue, or otherwise bind the parts together in the desired configuration, then cast animate dead and make whole to complete the construction (the material component cost of animate dead is 50 gp per Hit Die of the final necrocraft). The creator can't create a necrocraft with more Hit Dice than her caster level. As with animate dead, the necrocraft is under the creator's control when created.

A nehushtan can treat diseases and poisons (as per the Heal skill) without attempting Heal checks merely by remaining in continuous physical contact with the creature to be treated for 10 minutes. Additionally, a creature that takes a nehushtan as a familiar gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease or poison so long as the nehushtan remains within 1 mile of its master. A creature with at least 1 rank in Heal can use skin shed by a nehushtan to craft a draught that, when consumed, functions as either a potion of remove disease or a potion of neutralize poison, as chosen by the crafter. A nehushtan sheds enough skin to craft a single draught every 3 months, and crafting this draught takes 10 minutes.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Injury-bite; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 fire damage; cure 1 save.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In many of Golarion's cultures, serpents symbolize wisdom, medicine, and the healing arts. This association may have its roots in nehushtans, a rare breed of bronze-colored serpents prized and venerated for their miraculous curative powers. Nehushtans' lustrous scales contain potent curative properties, making the snakes' shed skin extremely valuable to healers and apothecaries. In regions where nehushtans live, desperately sick or poor people sometimes turn to scavenging the hills, hoping to find the discarded, metallic skins in order to either use them or sell them.",
			"",
			"Were it not for their peculiarly metallic scales, nehushtans would be virtually indistinguishable from vipers of comparable size. A nehushtan's body is 4 to 5 feet long, and it weighs 5 to 7 pounds.",
			"",
			"According to folklore, Sarenrae created the first nehushtan to answer the prayers of a priestess whose tribe was plagued by venomous serpents. The Dawnflower commanded her priestess to craft a bronze serpent and carry it among her people atop a large wooden pole. The visage of this \"nehushtan\" repelled mundane serpents, and those faithful who laid their hands upon the bronze idol found themselves miraculously cured of the vipers' venom. Once its holy work was done, Sarenrae rewarded the bronze idol for its service by imbuing it with the divine spark of life.",
			"",
			"True or not, this story explains the nehushtans' antagonistic attitude toward other snakes. The creatures take great pleasure in hunting and killing venomous serpents, particularly when such creatures encroach on inhabited areas or endanger humanoid populations. Though a nehushtan usually consumes the snakes it kills, it attacks even serpents too large for it to swallow. Nehushtans' innate immunity to poison makes them extremely effective at hunting venomous creatures, and these make up a large part of their diet. Nehushtans are otherwise opportunistic carnivores, and feed on whatever small prey they can catch and swallow.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans are venomous, and possess a potent venom that combusts when exposed to living flesh. Nehushtans use this toxin to painfully cook their prey from the inside out, and generally prefer to consume cooked or burnt flesh rather than raw meat. Nehushtans generally reserve this venom for their prey, and though they may bite to defend themselves or their young, they don't usually inject venom unless the target is particularly aggressive or persistent.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans shed their skins two to four times a year, with younger nehushtans molting slightly more often. They shed throughout their lives, which are comparable in length to a human's, and their skin grows increasingly powerful with each desquamation. Rare nehushtans live for hundreds of years, growing to incredible sizes and have skins that can cure any ailment. A nehushtan's discarded skin grows rigid after it is shed, resembling a mangled bronze leaf.",
			"",
			"Popular folklore claims that nehushtans shed during certain times of the year, such as the month of Sarenith, but this is not true. Nehushtans can shed during any part of the year, with different individuals shedding at different times. Nonetheless, many hunters intensify their search efforts during the weeks preceding and following Sarenrae's holy days, hoping to gain favor from the goddess in the form of nehushtan skin.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The temperaments of nehushtans vary. Some congregate in large extended families, while others associate with other nehushtans only long enough to breed and raise young. A nehushtan mother lays a clutch of two to four eggs, and both parents remain close to the nest until the young hatch. Unlike most serpents, nehushtans continue to care for their young after hatching, and stay with their children during the 2 to 3 months required for the young to fully mature into adults. During this time, the ordinarily peaceful creatures become fiercely protective, and most nehushtan bites are the result of unwary travelers stumbling too close to a nehushtan's nest when its young are present. Nehushtans prefer to dwell underground, taking over animal burrows or crawling into disused basements. They usually hunt in rocky environments.",
			"",
			"Given the miraculous healing powers of their scales, many humanoids have tried to domesticate nehushtans. These attempts invariably meet with failure. Nehushtans languish if confined for more than a few days, and cannot survive more than a month in captivity no matter how comfortable their accommodations are. After this time, the miserable captives undergo a strange transformation-their scales grow dull and tarnished, and eventually the nehushtans loses their luster and turns into aggressive but otherwise mundane vipers. Some see this as a sign of Sarenrae's displeasure at mortals who would exploit her sacred gifts. Others suspect nehushtans require some unknown dietary or environmental factor that their captors can't provide.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who willingly choose to live among humanity suffer no ill effects. Entire families of the serpents sometimes establish colonies in human settlements, and thrive just as well as their wild counterparts, provided they are allowed to come and go as they please and generally left to themselves. These colonies enjoy residing in hospitals, temples dedicated to healing, and other places where the sick and infirm dwell.",
			"",
			"The presence of a nehushtan greatly enhances a patient's recovery and survival, and so mortals who operate infirmaries welcome these mystical serpents. Some healers even venerate nehushtans, and give offerings of milk and burnt meat to placate and honor the bronze serpents. In earlier days, hospitals that hosted nehushtans advertised this fact by incorporating bronze serpent motifs into their decorations. These symbols have long since become iconic for all houses of healing in the warm, dry regions from which nehushtans hail.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who choose to serve spellcasters as familiars likewise suffer no ill effects. They favor Sarenrae worshipers as masters, though any particularly devout or compassionate spellcaster can entice a nehushtan into service. Nehushtans adapt well to the adventurer's life, and particularly relish the opportunity to reduce the suffering of others by doing good works. Nehushtans are quick to abandon masters who grow cruel or merciless, and may even attack masters who radically shift in alignment. A good-aligned spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a nehushtan as a familiar."

In such a guise, the creature can infiltrate the home and begin working all kinds of mischief, using its innate magical abilities to terrorize the home's residents, often while enjoying all the comforts that home provides. Ultimately, the nekomata's goal is to ruin the health and reputation of the head of the house before killing every member of the family. Once its vile work is done, the creature moves on to find another home to destroy. In its true form, a nekomata appears as a two-tailed house cat about 7 feet long and weighing 200 pounds."

These spirits may be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a harm or slay living effect.

The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1 mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to deliver ranged touch attacks.

The neothelids themselves were spawned by even more horrific entities, ageless horrors from strange dimensions beyond the edge of known reality-the neothelids see themselves as the chosen agents of these malevolent forces, working to ready the world for their return."

This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Coordinated Attacks (Ex)** A neothelid overlord can make attacks with the three tongues in each of its two heads. It can attempt to swallow two targets at the same time, but if the neothelid overlord instead attacks the same target with all six tongues, it gains a +4 bonus on all combat maneuver checks to grab and swallow that target, regardless of how many tongues successfully hit. On a round in which it uses its breath weapon, a neothelid overlord can still attack with the three tongues belonging to its other head.",
			"",
			"**Divided Consciousness (Ex)** The neothelid overlord's two heads share a split consciousness that allows it to operate as though the overlord were constantly under the effect of a divide mind spell.",
			"",
			"**Trace Teleport (Ex)** A neothelid overlord telepathically and reflexively learns the mental coordinates of the destination of all creatures that use a teleport spell or effect within 60 feet of it, gaining an awareness of the location equivalent to \"seen casually.\" This knowledge fades and is lost after 1 minute. This ability does not grant any environmental information about the conditions of the destination.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Those who have learned secrets of the deepest vaults of Orv know of the neothelids of Denebrum. In fetid pools of poisonous swamps and surreal forests of twisted, phosphorescent fungi, these gigantic worm-things rule and wage war against Orv's other denizens and each other. While most know that the neothelids are ancient creatures, spawned by eldritch beings in a time and place far removed from the known world, very few are aware that some neothelids are old beyond imagining. In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.",
			"",
			"Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. The change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords' ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying-even maddening-to behold.",
			"",
			"An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature's head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid's intellect. The new neothelid overlord's enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. The creatures' tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. The functions of overlords' tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. They reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship-the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.",
			"",
			"In The Dream Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes. The text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari's dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed."

They ambush opponents by jumping down from trees, grabbing the creatures, then retreating to find a safe place to eat.

A nependis's sharp hooves allow it to climb trees as well as a great cat, leaving telltale scars in the bark.",

			"Nereids are capricious and often dangerous aquatic fey that appear as strikingly beautiful women, often seen bathing unclothed in the water. Many sailors have met their doom following a nereid, for though a nereid's beauty is otherworldly, her watery kiss is death. Others seek out nereids, for if one can secure control over the creature's shawl, the cloth can be used to force the nereid's compliance. A nereid forced to obey in this manner immediately attempts to slay her master as soon as she can secure her shawl's safety."

			"**Aura of Alien Dread (Su)** A neshmaal's presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Dominate Person (Sp)** A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its dominate person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.",
			"",
			"**Kiss of the Void (Su)** Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerability to Sonic (Su)** Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned for 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in the unholy blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites. Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.",
			"",
			"A neshmaal's body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Neshmaals are incorporeal in the Material Plane. They may be corporeal in their own dimension, but no one has journeyed there and returned to verify this. In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks, perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since outsiders don't normally need to eat, the neshmaals' ravenous hunger for the energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the life force from living creatures, though it's assumed they also derive some nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in particular.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Neshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.",
			"",
			"Neshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful otherworldly beings from the Dark Tapestry. Some scholars believe these creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.",
			"",
			"Humanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond, though doing so places the conjurer's sanity in terrible jeopardy. The process is maddening, and the conjurer's safety is not diminished once the neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal's goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those they serve. A neshmaal's most common request is a never-ending chain of humanoids for them to drain of their life force.",
			"",
			"It's unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so, they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace. The book Secrets of the Dreaming Dark (which is thankfully rare) provides the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically referred to as the \"Black Alluvion Dream.\" Even occult scholars, astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea Region."

Ghol-Gani soldiers often trained these beasts to follow them into battle and fight alongside them, and present-day cyclopes who encounter ngogas inevitably feel a sort of kinship to the similarly monocular beasts, enticing them with gifts of fruit and meat in order to gain an ally in their destructive conquests.",
			"",
			"Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the dense jungles of central Garund, and many of their kind can be found as deep as Usaro, where the destructive Gorilla King trains them as warmounts for his smaller minions and relies on their bestial speed to stage ambushes against any who would dare t Ngoga o intrude upon his realm."

			"**Creeping Dark (Su)** The nightprowler's natural attacks leave a stain of dark shadows that linger in and around the wounds, known as the creeping dark-this condition can be resisted with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save. If the victim fails, it becomes staggered for 1 round, after which the creeping dark affects the victim further by preventing healing and hampering vision. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by the nightprowler's creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all damage afflicting the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Shadowpounce (Su)** Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability, they can also make rake attacks.

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Only a fool would underestimate the danger presented by the hateful nightprowler, despite its position as the least powerful of the undead monsters collectively known as nightshades. The bestial nightprowler is a fearsome opponent armed with the same cruel and calculating intelligence possessed by all nightshades.",
			"",
			"Nightprowlers are feline quadrupeds that seem to be composed of living shadow. Their eyes, like the eyes of all nightshades, glow with red light. A nightprowler is 16 feet long from head to tail and weighs 8,000 pounds. Nightprowlers have all the [nightshade traits](subtype/nightshade), except that they have darksense out to only 30 feet.",
			"",
			"Spawned by the fusion of pure darkness and the depraved souls of fiends, nightprowlers originate in the fell borderlands between the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. These creatures are weak by nightshade standards, but truly terrifying to most mortals unlucky enough to encounter them.",
			"",
			"Although a nightprowler appears similar to a great cat, no tiger has ever had claws so long and sharp, and no lion has sported as murderous a maw. These creatures relish the taste of living flesh and the sight of life leaving a creature's eyes, but most of all, they enjoy fear. If a nightprowler feels confident in its kill, it prefers to attack with tooth and claw until the victim is crippled, then plunges the area into darkness and glories in the sight of the helpless creature struggling in vain to escape. On an even battlefield, or if a nightprowler realizes that it is outmatched, it summons shadow allies to harry its opponents. Nightprowlers do not respond to bribes or pleas for mercy, and will chase their prey to the ends of the earth.",
			"",
			"Nightprowlers do not retreat from fights, even when near destruction-they trust that they will be reborn in the umbral cradle that originally gave them unlife. Even so, these beasts value their own existence, and their powers of judgment do not allow them to undertake obvious suicide missions. If a nightprowler locates a formidable enemy, it often bides its time until it can recruit other undead to the cause. To this end, a nightprowler may promise allies pieces of the spoils, but often reneges on payment once the fight is finished. The other creature, surprised by the betrayal and weakened from battle, then becomes easy prey for the treacherous nightprowler.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Nightshade](family/nightshade)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Like all nightshades, nightprowlers hail from the Negative Energy Plane. Born in that dread gulf and spurred by a seething hatred for all life, nightprowlers find cunning and clandestine ways to leave their horrid spawning grounds and travel to other planes. They particularly like to follow on the heels of other, more powerful nightshades, knowing that there is a share of the slaughter to be had in the wake of mightier allies.",
			"",
			"While nightprowlers often work with other nightshades, primarily playing reconnaissance roles, they don't serve living masters willingly. Even a truly sadistic mortal doesn't merit a shred of respect in the eyes of a nightprowler. If one of these deadly undead is forced into the service of a mortal master, it makes a poor servant at best. It remains patient and opportunistic, striking at the master's first sign of weakness. While nightprowlers despise mortal existence in all forms, they are known to accept the offerings of creatures that foolishly seek to become their minions. The mortal servants of such a creature are typically psychotic or sociopathic killers who see in the nightprowler a patron of murder and mayhem. Nightprowlers accept the supplications of their minions for a time, but out of either boredom or capriciousness, they inevitably turn their claws on their former servants.",
			"",
			"A mortal who wishes to catch the attention of a nightprowler must carry out a series of gruesome murders as sacrifices to the creature. Any killings will do, but nightprowlers prefer such sacrifices to be innocent victims or the clergy of good-aligned deities. Quick kills displease nightprowlers, while signs of torture on the offerings delight them. Supplicants who kill friends or family members garner special notice from nightprowlers. While pleasing a nightprowler is relatively easy initially, it demands ever-greater massacres using increasingly cruel methods, and it soon tires of even the most wicked mortal master.",
			"",
			"From time to time, nightprowlers stalk the Material Plane alone or in groups. They generally keep to caves, deep forests, and the cover of night when traveling this way. Nightprowlers prefer to move as solitary hunters, but are intelligent enough to collaborate when necessary. Packs of nightprowlers are loosely organized and can erupt into chaos in an instant. A pride forms when a particularly vigorous nightprowler lures others to its cause with promises of tender flesh and glistening entrails. This leader must mastermind sufficient destruction to keep the pride obeisant, for boredom in a nightprowler is a dangerous thing.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the common goal of all nightshades is nothing less than the desecration of all that is pure, and the death of all that lives. Mortals in the grip of madness rant of the coming night when nightshades great and small will march to rid all the planes once and for all of the curse of life. Nightprowlers will be the outriders in that terrible army, the mad ones warn, bringing undead allies with them into that final fray. It is easy to ignore these fevered prophecies or label them the ramblings of the insane. But in the baleful dark, when all lights have been extinguished save for a pair of red eyes, the potential truth in those words is undeniable."

			"Violent xenophobes, the creatures typically called nihilois, devashades, or shadow lords pose a rising threat to interlopers into their umbral realm. In ages immemorial, these creatures enjoyed vast empires upon the mysterious Plane of Shadow, but through the millennia incursion by immigrants and interlopers have eroded their way of life and scattered their numbers. In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared.",
			"",
			"Nihilois-as the first travelers from Golarion termed them, believing them to be members of an ancient mythical race-resemble gaunt, vaguely humanoid creatures shrouded in ever-writhing shadow stuff with fountains of dark tendrils jutting from their backs. They often hold these thin limbs in tight bunches that appear like strange, dense wings, but unfurl them easily and with shocking speed to lash out against their enemies. Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand. Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues."

			"Nirentos are predatory plants with brutish intelligence, their thorny vines able to tear foes limb from limb. A nirento lures prey toward it by swaying its branches and vines in a visually stimulating dance, striking at victims mercilessly once they are within range of its natural weapons. Slain prey then piles up around the tree's base and is absorbed through its roots. Nirentos' spongy bodies ensure they absorb most physical blows, though they remain susceptible to slashes and cuts, and when so injured, a translucent green sap oozes from their wounds.",

			"**Island Bond (Ex)** A nisid who resides on a small, uninhabited island for an extended period of time forms a strong bond with the land, gaining a number of powers meant to protect the sanctity of its territory. The island must be no larger than 1 square mile in area per Hit Die the nisid has (usually 6 HD), and the nisid must be the only intelligent creature on the island for 1 uninterrupted year to cement the bond. After the bond has been formed, the nisid gains the isolation and never come back abilities (see below), and receives a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks while on his island. A nisid who leaves his island for more than 1 hour per Hit Die or whose island is inhabited by an intelligent creature for longer than 1 month per Hit Die loses its island bond and must restart the bonding process, either on a new island or on the same island once all prerequisite conditions are met.",
			"",
			"**Isolation (Su)** A trespasser on the nisid's bonded island must succeed at a DC 17 Will save every full day she remains on the island or she takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage as the nisid magnifies the trials of survival on an uninhabited and dangerous island with little hope of rescue. This Wisdom damage does not heal naturally until the trespasser leaves the nisid's island (though it can be healed through magic normally), slowly driving her mad. The nisid can suppress this ability at will; typically, it does so until it determines the trespasser will not soon leave of her own volition or is otherwise going to be trouble. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Never Come Back (Su)** The nisid's ties to its island help keep it hidden from repeat visits, ensuring that even trespassers who want to return find doing so difficult. When a trespasser leaves a nisid's bonded island, she must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. Failure results in her memories of the place becoming hazy-especially when it comes to locating it again. She takes a -10 penalty on Survival and Knowledge (geography) checks to determine the island's location or find it again, and the island and the nisid are treated as though under the effects of a permanent [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell for any divination spells the target casts (use the nisid's caster level to determine the difficulty of overcoming this effect). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Nisids are castaway spirits, protectors of uninhabited or deserted islands. These little fey look like they might once have maintained a more delicate and youthful appearance, but after having spent decades or centuries alone, they look haggard, with unkempt hair and tough skin. Nisids rarely wear clothing, as they have little need for modesty or protection. They are excellent survivalists, living off what their island can provide.",
			"",
			"Loners by nature, a nisid claims and forms a bond with a single uninhabited island as his territory, and he seeks to preserve the island's untouched sanctity-and his own solitude. Should someone happen upon a nisid's island, whether as a castaway, stranded by a storm, or deliberately seeking something, the nisid first spies on the interloper using [invisibility](spell/invisibility) and [detect thoughts](spell/detect_thoughts) to assess her intent. If he determines that the trespasser simply wishes to get off the island, the nisid often offers to help his guest survive and escape (if only to hasten the process and return the island to its isolation). Using magic and his natural skill at survival, he may give the castaway access to water, food, or shelter-in exchange for leaving the island unsullied when she leaves. Those who agree and please the nisid might even be gifted with a final [gust of wind](spell/gust_of_wind) to send them on their way.",
			"",
			"However, those who arrive with no intention of leaving hastily, or who drastically overstay their welcome without hope of escape, find the nisid a more hostile host, as a nisid finds murder a small price to pay for solitude. Unwelcome guests find the trials of survival and hopelessness to be maddening, and every day drift closer to insanity through the nisid's isolation ability. Once the trespassers have been driven toward madness, the nisid attempts to turn them against each other, sowing distrust and casting [confusion](spell/confusion) on large groups. If all else fails, the nisid might coax charmed animals, the nisid's only companions, into attacking interlopers: nothing says \"get off my island\" like a giant beast crashing out of the jungle.",
			"",
			"With no desire to die-only to be left alone-the nisid eschews direct combat as much as possible, preferring to have his enemies deal with each other or succumb to the dangers of the island itself. If pushed to combat, he casts [call lightning](spell/call_lightning) and attempts to strike down his enemies from hiding, using his knowledge of the island to his advantage.",
			"",
			"Even when helping agreeable castaways, the nisid won't make life too easy, lest the trespassers decide to extend their stay. He makes just enough food and water available to sustain the \"guests,\" using abilities like [hallucinatory terrain](spell/hallucinatory_terrain) to keep any particularly bountiful areas of the island hidden. Should the island be a truly deserted one, perhaps where an ancient civilization once flourished, a nisid is especially vigilant in keeping ruins or artifacts that could attract further interest in the island well hidden. And once a castaway leaves a nisid's island, she rarely finds a way to return.",
			"",
			"A typical nisid stands 4 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.",
			"",
			"Not much is known of nisids, since they are rarely encountered and even more rarely remembered. The first nisids may have been castaways themselves, banished from the First World until they discovered the small islands on which they could be alone, or other fey spirits who found their little pieces of land suddenly cut off from everything else. Whatever their origin, most nisids have lived solitary lives for decades or centuries-and prefer it that way, finding solace in solitude and having no desire to share their hidden homes.",
			"",
			"Nisids can be any gender, but have little interest in companionship or reproduction. With no one around to impress, they don't care about their appearance-though their fey nature still shines through despite their neglect. Over time surviving alone, their hair becomes ragged and their skin grows exceptionally tough. They craft their few weapons out of whatever the island has to offer.",
			"",
			"Nisids have no interest in treasure, as they have no use for it; however, they tend to collect the belongings of those who wash up on their shores and don't escape. They keep their treasure troves well hidden to prevent attracting interest from other trespassers.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nisids might choose any small, uninhabited island as home, regardless of climate. Jungle isles filled with strange fauna are equally as appealing to them as barren rocks in the icy north or island ruins in temperate climes. Some nisids favor deserted islands that once held civilization of some kind as homes. Those who choose such locales have the additional goal of keeping their islands' ruins a secret from outsiders; the last thing a nisid wants is a boat full of explorers and adventurers arriving on his island to plumb its depths, and he will use his abilities to keep such adventurers away.",
			"",
			"Nisids are introverts to the extreme. They have no interest in any kind of company, and engage in conversation for only as long as it takes to accomplish their goals. There is never more than one nisid on an island. No one has learned why nisids prefer such isolation, or what they do in their long years alone. Perhaps they spend time meditating on their leave of the First World-or seek a way back.",
			"",
			"A nisid's only companions are the local fauna, which the nisid charms to act as guardians. Small islands far from continental land are known for their oversized animals, and a canny nisid in residence holds the threat of such beasts as motivation for trespassers to leave or to avoid the island's inner depths-perhaps unleashing the animals upon them should their stay provoke hostility. However, their relationships with dolphins are a bit antagonistic, as the creatures delight in attempts to force the nisid to socialize and guide travelers to their isolated islands."
