				"Aashaq's wyverns resemble the typical wyverns commonly found throughout the Inner Sea region in many regards, but they have been warped by magic. Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists.",
				"",
				"Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth. Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting influence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic.",
				"",
				"A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length (including its bifurcated tail) and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin, the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their \"superior\" status over the lesser specimens found on other islets."

			"description": [
				"An abandoned armory is an animated mass of weapons and armor, both magic and mundane, as well as spell-imbued items of offensive utility. Moving with uncanny locomotion, these constructs scour battlefields seeking objects of war that once held special significance to previous owners who were slain in combat. Due to the faint psychic imprints of the slain combatants from which they collect these artifacts, abandoned armories make it their mission to reunite the items with their past owners or find new owners worthy of wielding their finds. This process proves to be fatal, however, as the constant psychic echoes cause an abandoned armory to believe everyone is unworthy and slay them in hopes of finding a new suitable owner for that individual's equipment. This behavior has led abandoned armories to become something to be feared on the battlefield as they tear through an area, slaying every combatant they encounter.",
				"",
				"An abandoned armory is roughly 15 feet wide, cresting up to 20 feet tall, and weighs about 15 tons.",
				"",
				"Abandoned armories are rare, as their creation requires an unlikely confluence of environmental conditions and historical circumstances, along with a fair bit of luck. Across Golarion, only a handful of battlefields and other sites of mass death and suffering contain sufficient psychic echoes of terror and pain, as well as buried or hidden implements of war-magic weapons, armor, and other trinkets-to give rise to an abandoned armory. In addition to the psychic imprints that serve as the foundation for the constructs, the genesis of abandoned armories hinges on the application of additional, formidable arcane or divine power, often as an unintended consequence of unrelated events. A leaking seal on a long-forgotten eldritch prison, a thinning of the veil between planes, or a potent ritual to summon a demon may provide the energy needed for an abandoned armory to lurch into animation. When the psychic imprints and magical energy mix at a perfect balance, it can form a small abandoned armory. Once animated, the abandoned armory is quick to grow into the massive terror that is the bane of all battlefields.",
				"",
				"The magic binding that binds armories together does eventually fade away, causing the constructs' various collected items to become open for the taking. These mounds of equipment, typically overgrown with vegetation and hidden by the passage of years, contain treasure troves of items that are prized by fortune hunters. The process for an abandoned armory's collapse usually happens in one of two ways. The more common method is through the destruction of the construct. This usually damages many of the constituent items and makes the process of salvaging this equipment tedious at best. On the other hand, abandoned armories naturally collapse and dissipate when the magic that fuels them is exhausted. This usually happens to \"longer-lived\" abandoned armories that consume the innate magical energies after countless battles. The energy required to activate an abandoned armory's various abilities slowly saps these magical energies until the abandoned armory lacks enough energy to maintain its form."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"The abandoned armory is solitary, lacking the intelligence or empathy required to create bonds with other entities. No one claims to know what would happen if two or more abandoned armories happened to meet on some devastated ancient battlefield. Perhaps the constructs would sense an alignment of purpose, and fuse together to create a larger, even more formidable tide of metal destruction. Alternatively, the abandoned armories might simply clash mindlessly against one another until their constituent metal melted to slag and their magic power was spent.",
				"",
				"Certain creatures have taken an interest in abandoned armories, almost to the extent of representing a symbiotic relationship. Scavenging tribes of goblins who forage at the edges of legendary battlefields have developed a near-religious awe of the constructs, and they regard the appearance of an abandoned armory both as a good omen and a prime opportunity to comb the destruction left by its passage for interesting new tools and trinkets. To attract an abandoned armory, the goblins erect crude fetishes at the edges of their territory, making offerings of assorted \"magic\" items in the hope of drawing the attention of the construct. The rare occasions when an abandoned armory does indeed appear are just as likely to result in the hopeful goblins being destroyed by a tide of unstoppable metal and magic as they are to fulfill the goblins' greed for treasure."

				"Abhominals are a result of a failed experiment in which an [aboleth](unknown:aboleth) employed ancient Azlanti technology to alter sentient humanoids. Though the test subjects died during their transformation, the strange energies involved animated them as undead horrors bound to serve their aboleth creator. These abominations share a hive mind, chattering telepathically with each other to determine a common purpose. All of them can be called into action instantly if their aboleth master issues a telepathic command, the dominating words reverberating from one connected mind to another. Abhominals hunger for the life energy of living beings, but their masters can keep their hunger in check in order to make them hunt new subjects to use in further experiments (who might end up sharing the fate of their captors).",
				"",
				"The midsection of an abhominal rises to a height of about 2-1/2 feet, though its barbed tentacles go much higher than that. They weigh over 250 pounds.",
				"",
				"An alghollthu that experiments with modifying sentient creatures routinely introduces a part of its awareness into the process so it can exert control over the resulting abominations. The specific transformation that resulted in the first abhominals was particularly grueling and led to many of the subjects dying. However, some subjects survived the initial process, which landed them in a holding cell for further observation. The transformation of the subjects continued within their bodies, and to date the flawed experiment has always culminated in the subjects' death. In their final moments, they are pale and feverish, and their abdomens become bloated. Their nascent telepathy whispers dissonant echoes of the abhominal hive mind reaching out to them. Upon the moment of death, their bodies convulse, limbs snapping at weird angles, and black bile spills from their open mouths. Finally, a mass of tentacles bursts out of the subject's abdomen, and the newborn abhominal screams out a telepathic call to others of its kind.",
				"",
				"On the outside, abhominals are reminiscent of the living beings they once were. In addition to their tentacles and twisted postures, their insides have been transformed into something completely alien. When an abhominal is cut, its wounds ooze a brackish black liquid instead of blood. This liquid permeates their entire bodies, coloring their glistening eyes completely black. The creatures have a hardened carapace beneath their skin, allowing them to shrug off deadly blows with ease. Their hands and feet are covered in fine branching bristles that burrow into surfaces, allowing them to scramble effortlessly along even the smoothest walls and ceilings. Their tentacles are covered in microscopic barbs that inflict profuse bleeding. In addition, abhominals are able to leech vitality out of their victims with their tentacles as they tighten around the unfortunate souls.",
				"",
				"Abhominals use their telepathic connection to coordinate their movements when hunting their prey. Abhominals make good sentries-if one of them notices an intruder, then all of its kind within reach are telepathically notified of it as well. When the need arises, their alghollthu master can take a more direct role, commanding its abhominals to utilize more advanced tactics to combat intruders or abduct new captives."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"When the number of abhominals reaches a large enough number, their nesting habits tend to fall into a particular pattern. Abhominals nest high above ground, writhing together in a clump that spreads from the ceiling downward, their tentacles entwining like a web between them. They prefer areas such as caverns or chambers with passages and openings leading to areas below, in which they tend to form a central hive that eventually expands to smaller nests located within telepathic range around it. Once the central hive is established, abhominals use hidden routes to traverse between the hive and its peripheral nests, and smaller groups of the creatures rotate between staying in a nest and prowling the areas around it. Similarly, a rotation of abhominals periodically shifts between the central hive and its outlier nests.",
				"",
				"Abhominals are quite dependent on the telepathic connection that binds them together, which results in them going berserk if they are separated from the hive mind. This behavior became evident as soon as the first abhominal came into existence: it raved like a rabid beast, lashing out at anything that came near unless its alghollthu creator exerted psychic influence over it. When the alghollthu's experiments resulted in more abhominals, the abominations started to exhibit more intricate behavior and purpose, and their master found it could direct the newly formed hive mind to serve its own needs. Ultimately, the creatures' usefulness outweighed the annoying reminder of an experiment that continued to fail.",
				"",
				"If the abhominals' numbers grow too large, the thoughts of those swarming in the central hive begin to harmonize, exhibiting higher levels of cognizance that could pose a threat to the alghollthu's control over its creations. It's possible that if the abhominals were left unsupervised, an oversized hive could find a way to turn captives into abhominals on their own, though this is not something their aboleth creators would ever willingly allow. It's important for an aboleth master to regularly reaffirm its dominance over the abhominals under its command to keep the psychic leash that controls them intact.",
				"",
				"When under the rule of an aboleth master, abhominals follow that master's directions regarding other creatures. If left without guidance, abhominals are more likely to give in to their hunger and attack all living creatures they encounter; other undead are typically left alone unless they pose a threat to the abhominals. It's possible that certain types of undead could form a mutually beneficial arrangement with a hive of abhominals, consuming the flesh of any humanoid corpses that the abhominals leave during their hunts."

Far smarter than their animalistic form might suggest, achaierais prefer to hunt in shrieking packs and use their prey's confusion and their own reach to their advantage, circling their quarry and darting in to attack as soon as the victim becomes distracted, then retreating again before the prey has a chance to retaliate. They have been known to wander through battlefields in the lower planes, picking over dying and regenerating creatures and souls, which has earned them the nickname \"Hell's vultures.\" As achaierais are immune to the toxic clouds of others of their kind, they often work in conjunction to use these clouds to herd or scatter enemies, form long lines of black clouds to protect their retreat, or merely panic opponents in large melees. Achaierais are fond of disemboweling their targets and feasting on the hot entrails while their mortally wounded prey screams itself to death. Of course, as outsiders, achaierais have no need to eat, and their elaborate hunting routines are simply the bird-beasts' sick form of entertainment."

Adaptive oozes can break down both organic and inorganic substances and incorporate those materials into their bodies to grow their mass.

However, their digestive process is very slow, so they need to disable creatures that might fight back or attempt to flee. Adaptive oozes go through a cycle of accumulating mass until they split into two in order to propagate, after which the cycle begins anew. Adaptive oozes that have just split begin life with the young creature simple template. Adaptive oozes that are in resource-rich areas can accumulate mass very rapidly, gaining the giant creature simple template before they reach the end of their reproductive cycle.

With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seaf loors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat.",
				"",
				"Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities.",
				"",
				"In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone.",
				"",
				"Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims."

				"Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle.",
				"",
				"Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu.",
				"",
				"Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims.",
				"",
				"Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death."

A creature adjacent to the adherer can attempt to pry off a stuck weapon with a DC 17 Strength check, but doing so provokes an attack of opportunity from the adherer. The adherer's adhesive flesh gives it a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks. It can attempt to grapple a foe without spending an action whenever a creature successfully hits it with a natural attack or an unarmed strike. An adherer does not gain the grappled condition when it grapples a foe, nor does it provoke attacks of opportunity when it attempts to do so. Fire can temporarily burn away an adherer's adhesive coating-whenever an adherer takes at least 10 points of fire damage, it loses its adhesive special quality for 1d4 rounds. Universal solvent, alchemical solvent, or a similar fluid removes an adherer's adhesive quality for 1 hour if it fails a DC 15 Reflex save, or for 1d4 rounds if it makes the save.

			"description": [
				"Agnoias are not yet deemed outcasts by the ranks of aeonkind, but they teeter on the edge of exile from the ranks of the caretakers of reality. Like all aeons, agnoias work to maintain a precarious cosmic balance-in their case, this balance is between the dissemination of knowledge and the preservation of ignorance. Although these aeons once worked to keep this balance in careful check by distributing truths across planetary and planar gulfs and obliterating dangerous truths from mortal minds, agnoias collectively decided several years ago that the sum total of knowledge in the multiverse had reached dangerous heights. Creation had become too well informed to sustain redoubts of ignorance for long, and the balance agnoias worked to maintain was in danger. As a group, the agnoias agreed that they would wholly forsake their duties regarding the spread of learning and instead focus on fostering ignorance, returning the multiverse to a safely unenlightened level. Agnoias connected to universities and libraries turned on their associates, setting controlled fires and transporting scholars to isolated wildernesses. This rapid change in direction, nearly unprecedented by aeon standards, caused most other aeons to mark agnoias as reckless and dangerous.",
				"",
				"Agnoias see this change as absolutely vital to the performance of their overall function as arbiters of knowledge and ignorance. In fact, some agnoias express frustration that the drive to obliterate universal knowledge wasn't initiated much sooner, when knowledge was more centralized in nascent civilizations and therefore easier to manage. No agnoia would dare to blame the Monad directly for this error in intellectual administration, as they see it, but most agnoias express some satisfaction for finally being able to act as they deem fit rather than remaining shackled to a higher power.",
				"",
				"Agnoias have a particular dislike for mortal explorers and planar travelers. As mortals learn to travel quickly across their worlds and between the planes, they spread their knowledge like a plague, disrupting nascent civilizations and exposing long-sequestered secrets. Such travelers are agnoias' most frequent targets, as these aeons consider them vectors for spreading the disease of enlightenment. Agnoias work to close planar gates and sabotage transport vessels, first seeking to control the transmission of knowledge and then working to eradicate it. Although they have little concern for mortal lives that might be lost in a sinking ship or a burning library, they aren't cruel and usually time their actions to minimize the loss of innocent-and particularly ignorant-life. Agnoias often work alone, but this is primarily because they view their tasks as urgent and their numbers are very few. When given the opportunity to work together, agnoias operate in eerie concert, each seeming to predict the actions of the others with automatic prescience.",
				"",
				"Agnoias don't apply their recent knowledgeobliterating directive to their own kind. Many agnoias in fact hoard knowledge, and they are surprisingly well informed on a broad variety of topics. Most have labored for years in academies or universities, absorbing minutiae on particular specialties and adding this information to their vast mental storehouses. Getting an agnoia to part with its knowledge is all but impossible, however, as each knows that any information might start yet another cascade of erudition it must later extinguish.",
				"",
				"In combat, agnoias prefer to reduce their enemies' intellects as quickly as possible. Their preferred tactic is to afflict their most intelligent opponents with feeblemind, which agnoias augment by removing targets' memories not only from the targets' own minds, but also from the consciousness of reality. Victims of this attack have their intellects reduced, and their effect upon the cosmic network of knowledge is dulled-people once familiar with a victim find their recollections clouding over, and any intellectual influence a victim may have had (such as authored works, public lectures, or tales of daring exploits) is removed. This effect even extends to printed works; a shelf of books authored by a victim transforms into paper covered with incomprehensible marks, unable to convey meaning or knowledge. Although this power is permanent, it is reversible, unfortunately for the agnoias. If a victim's intellect is restored, so too are her works and the memories of her.",
				"",
				"Agnoias are keen observers; their eyes drift around their bodies and switch from one side to another with a mere blink. They are particularly difficult to surprise, and their keen vision allows them to detect even magical auras with ease. Agnoias are also apt judges of character and have several lifetimes of experience interacting with mortals. As a result, they can predict actions and motivations with shrewd consideration that is as much a factor of their experience as it is their magical ability to detect creatures' thoughts.",
				"",
				"Agnoias appear as columns of fog and shadow. Within their roiling forms, the shadows never obscure the fog and the fog never conceals the dark shadow. Although an agnoia can walk on the three clawed feet protruding from the bottom of its column, it can just as easily fly with a thought. An agnoia's three claws are spread radially around its torso. Despite their vaporous appearance, agnoias aren't insubstantial, but they can compress their forms to fit into small spaces.",

Each force blast deals 10d6 points of damage and has a critical threat range of 19-20. This is a force effect.",

A lipika gains an insight bonus to its AC equal to its Wisdom modifier (+7) for 1 round after it has taken damage from a melee or ranged attack. If damaged by an attack that deals energy damage, the lipika gains immunity to that type of energy for 1 round. Additionally, when a spellcaster successfully casts an offensive spell that penetrates the lipika's spell resistance, the spellcaster is also affected by the spell as if it were reflected by spell turning (even if the spell would normally not be affected by spell turning, such as a spell that affects an area).",

Multiple failed saving throws against karmic link increase the duration but have no other effect. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
				"",
				"**Karmic Strike (Su)** When a lipika is hit by a melee or ranged attack, it can make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked it.

			],
			"description": [
				"Lipikas-also known as the Lords of Karma-are among the highest order of aeons. Unlike other aeons, their duality springs not from opposition but from understanding that all actions and reactions are the crests and troughs of the same cosmic wave. While it may seem to a casual observer that the Lords of Karma simply wander the universe looking for random events of importance, from the momentous to the mundane, what they are actually observing is the rhythm of causality, the way that one action becomes another and affects everything in the grand scheme of reality. Whatever they find, they inscribe in the cosmic memory of all aeons, and occult scholars believe that this cosmic memory finds its way to the Akashic Record, deep within the heart of the Astral Plane.",
				"",
				"These powerful creatures not only observe and report; they also meddle. Lipikas consider themselves the judges of willful karma, sometimes manipulating the cycle of mortal lives and reincarnations. This often leads to friction with psychopomps, other agents of Purgatory, and those who would steal, use, or destroy souls-such as daemons and night hags. The reason for the aeons' interest is difficult to ascertain. There seems to be no overriding philosophy concerning the nature or purpose of the souls lipikas manipulate. This has led many occult scholars to theorize that the lipikas' connection to the Akashic Record is more direct, going so far as to suggest that these aeons are its agents.",
				"",
				"Lipikas use their specialized abilities to interact with specific entities across the planes, especially ones who have been or are fated to be reincarnated-often at the lipikas' own hands. Sometimes the aeons act as guides to such creatures, while at other times they set these subjects upon a new course entirely undirected. Unlike others of their kind, a lipika uses some bits and pieces of language to convey its messages-though often in a pidgin of all known languages that have existed or will exist-and takes considerable time and care when communicating with its subject, at least compared with other aeons. Lipikas give their subjects guidance on how to adjust their actions within their current forms to achieve some karmic imperative or progression of personal enlightenment. Often such advice seems to contradict any sense of intuition, reason, or cultural concepts of morality. A lipika is just as likely to chastise a righteous person for her charity and goodness as it is to scold an evil creature for its misdeeds. To the lipika, the balance of alignments and morality is inconsequential beside the realities of action and the bonds of cause and effect.",
				"",
				"When not focused on performing a specific task, lipikas deliver messages, omens, and portents to both those who seek their wisdom and those who do not. These messages are often signs of enormous events of great significance that might not occur within the recipients' lifetimes, but the lipikas maintain that the subjects' actions are nonetheless influential. At other times, lipikas appear merely to guide reincarnated souls or spirits destined to be reincarnated. A lipika that is focused on a specific task-whether observing a significant historical event or delivering a message to another being-typically ignores other creatures unless they attempt to delay it from performing its assigned task, at which point it may become violent in its reactions. While it seems they would rather manipulate events subtly, lipikas are capable of great force when faced with those who would thwart their plans.",
				"",
				"On rare occasions these aeons appear and create conflicts, claiming that great damage to the multiverse is being done by actions taken by a civilization-actions that are often so minute their consequences might seem arbitrary to the subjects of the aeon's attention. Worse still, the appearance of a lipika can herald the coming of even greater displays of aeon power. Sages of occult lore theorize that the information lipikas inscribe into the Akashic Record directly informs the agenda of the concept or entity known as the Monad, and that this information is disseminated to pleromas-more powerful aeons who are direct representatives of the Monad. If this theory is correct, the information scribed by lipikas is of grave consequence to entire civilizations, as pleroma aeons are tasked with acts of creation and destruction that can sometimes impact entire worlds. Those who subscribe to more traditional theories of the multiverse see the connection between lipikas and pleromas in more direct terms. If a lipika cannot accomplish its goals, it calls in a pleroma to enact the strange and inexplicable will of the aeons, often to devastating ends. However, the goals of lipikas are typically so abstract that their intervention often seems random, and few mortals have figured out how to placate them.",

The paracletus serve the aeons as agents who connect with mortals and study the influence of emotions (particularly the dualistic nature of raw emotion) upon mortal behavior. They wander the planes seeking mortals with particularly strong emotional or logical capabilities (characters with high Charisma or Intelligence scores). Once a paracletus locates such a creature, the paracletus remains nearby, studying the target's relationship with emotional and logical input and choices. Often, the paracletus will use its emotion aura on the target in order to study how outside influences affect the subject. Unfortunately for the target creature, whether or not the paracletus uses a helpful or harmful effect is, for all intents and purposes, a matter of random chance-even though to the paracletus's complex reasoning, nothing is left to actual random chance.",

One who gazes upon a pleroma could spend days studying the continual changes of its form, which most resemble the shifting of celestial bodies within the universe sped up to a pace at which the swirling of galaxies and the tumble of planets form a strange dance.",
				"",
				"Pleromas view the concepts of creation and oblivion not so much as separate processes, but rather as two parts of a cyclical passage that everything in existence must explore. Pleromas guide this progression, ensuring everything remains balanced, such that whatever is created can be destroyed, and that nothing becomes so static that these two processes slow to a halt. For everything that attains a state of semi-permanence, there must be many more things that do not, or rather that cannot ever be reformed into a state of permanence. While pleromas believe in eternity, they understand that eternity is cyclical and infinity is something that repeats itself. Therefore, eternity and infinity are states that can be changed, or altered, if only slightly. Pleromas maintain such changes are necessary to keep the cosmos from becoming static and unbalanced, a state they refer to as apocalypse, or the end of everything.",
				"",
				"Of all the aeons, pleromas possess the strongest connection to the entity or concept they refer to as Monad. All aeons believe themselves to be extensions of this entity, and while they act freely and independently of the entity, they always act within the constricts of its will or needs. This behavior is not so much a state of servitude as a symbiosis in which the actions of the pleromas are universally beneficial to both themselves and the entity they are part of. Pleromas describe Monad as the sentience of the multiverse, from which all things are created through the recycling of everything that ever existed.",
				"",
				"Pleromas typically travel alone. Their arrival in a region almost always heralds some sort of dramatic change. They pay little mind to the wants and needs of other creatures, and remain entirely focused upon their primary task. They avoid conflicts of ethics, wars, and similar pursuits, save when manipulating such events would help to restore the balance between creation and oblivion. Should any be so foolish as to attempt to interfere with or sway their work, pleromas immediately retaliate by bringing all of their significant powers and devastating abilities to bear until the intervention is destroyed."

Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds.",
				"",
				"On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will.",
				"",
				"Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who-ve become acquainted with bishops' complex ways."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions.",
				"",
				"The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region.",
				"",
				"Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told.",
				"",
				"Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop."

However, given their tendency to protect locations for long periods, those on the Material Plane occasionally fall in love with mortals. If such a relationship results in children, the chelonidal parent remains until its offspring come of age, departing only if a great need arises; the lords of Nirvana understand that the duty to protect must be counterbalanced with duty to family. Such children are usually [idyllkin aasimar](unknown:idyllkin_aasimar) rather than more powerful half-celestials."

				"Chelonidals guard the peaceable plane of Nirvana. Whether guarding the celestial realm's sites or marching in formation along its roads, chelonidals stand ever vigilant to repel assault. As their appearance suggests, they are also at home in the water; while their normal phalanx tactics are of less use in three-dimensional underwater combat, they make up for it with additional mobility in aquatic environs.",
				"",
				"On Nirvana, most chelonidals serve more potent agathions without complaint. The empyreal lords Dalenydra and Ylimancha, in particular, often associate with chelonidals. Every so often a chelonidal feels the urge to wander; while it never leaves a post without securing a replacement, once one is found, the agathion wanders for a time before settling down again. Some find their way to the Material Plane during this period. Without a specific task, a chelonidal on the Material Plane often finds a secluded but vulnerable location, such as a remote fishing village or shrine, and defends it until protectors can be found or trained.",
				"",
				"While chelonidals defend those who cannot defend themselves, they are at their strongest when they stand alongside those with the strength and will to fight. A single chelonidal can bolster a mortal legion, keeping the troops fighting until reinforcements arrive. In greater numbers, chelonidals form a phalanx, trusting in allies to clean up any foe that makes it past their guard. On those rare occasions when the agathions must march to war, chelonidals form the core of their armies. Led by [cervinal](unknown:cervinal) knights and supported by soaring [avorals](unknown:avorals), a chelonidal legion is a force potent enough to make any fiendish combatants think twice."

However, some draconals have metallic or gem-like coloration; for example, a yellow draconal may appear mustard yellow or metallic gold, while a white draconal may be chalk white, pearlescent white, or metallic silver. Draconals can change their coloration after a lengthy period of meditation, but normally only do this in response to some horrible evil that requires their direct intervention. This change affects the draconals' personality, and may alter their physical shape or apparent gender.",

That does not mean they are incapable of defending themselves, though, and they wield clubs, cudgels, quarterstaves, and saps with aplomb. A single muldnal's efforts may be only an annoyance as it harasses intruders, but an entire labor of muldnals can collapse tunnels or pen in foes while they summon the aid of more powerful allies (often silvanshees or vulpinals).

Numerous legendary underground grottos, such as the Cave of a Thousand Stars in Vudra and the Emerald Veldt in Molthune, are the works of muldnal moots. In these locations, the barrier between the Material Plane and Nirvana is much thinner-these are places where enlightenment and perfection can be touched, and therefore, they are sought after by monks and scholars alike.",

Experienced muldnals are expected to teach younger muldnals everything they know, and pass it along verbally as they travel and work together.

They deal 2d8 points of lethal bludgeoning damage, though the mustelidal can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on his attack roll. The mustelidal applies his full Strength modifier on all damage rolls with his unarmed strike. A mustelidal's unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that modify either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A mustelidal's unarmed strikes are treated as magic, cold iron, silver, and adamantine weapons for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness.",

During this time, the mustelidal suffers no further effects from the poison, and cannot be roused from this deathlike trance by any means. At the end of the 10 minutes, the mustelidal awakens completely cured of any poisons that were affecting him. This doesn't heal the mustelidal of any existing ability damage or drain the poison may have already caused. If the mustelidal succumbs to a poison that causes unconsciousness, this ability triggers automatically.",

The mustelidal can leave this state as a free action only after reducing an enemy to 0 hit points or fewer or when there are no enemies in the mustelidal's line of sight."

				"Tenacious warriors, mustelidals are the protectors of the good and neutral burrowing creatures of the universe, fending off such evil underground threats as neothelids, purple worms, and shaitans. These agathions are difficult to kill and see defeat in battle as little more than an annoying roadblock delaying their eventual victory.",

They often wear open yet loose-fitting clothing that shows off their toned physiques and allows them more freedom of movement in battle. They prefer to dress in deep, rich browns accented with warm colors, such as yellows and oranges. An average mustelidal stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.",
				"",
				"Mustelidals are fashioned from the souls of goodaligned mortals whose determination and perseverance kept them fighting long after they should have given in. The more times such a mortal has been resurrected in order to prolong its fight, the greater the chance that her soul is transformed into a mustelidal after finally receiving Pharasma's judgment. Just after they are \"born,\" mustelidals are eager to return to the Material Plane and engage in battle with the forces of evil.",
				"",
				"When in a conflict, mustelidals rely on their natural defenses a bit too much, often getting in over their heads and attacking large throngs of enemies or foes who eclipse them in size. In such situations, mustelidals tap into a well of courage that usually allows them to survive against all odds. These agathions use their ability to summon Large earth elementals only to distract their foes at the start of combat or in dire circumstances when the mustelidals need a way to cover their escape.",
				"",
				"At the end of a protracted conflict, mustelidals burrow into the nearby dirt or use their meld into stone spell-like ability to allow their regeneration to restore them to full health. They also take advantage of their poison purge ability at this time if any toxins are coursing through their blood. If the mustelidals weren't victorious in the previous fight, they use their skills to track down the surviving foes to attempt to finish the job."

			"habitat": [
				"Because of mustelidals' unwillingness to back down from a fight, other types of agathions often use them as personal bodyguards, especially when traveling to other planes. Those with crucial missions frequently bring along a small retinue of mustelidals, though they must convince the badger-headed outsiders that they will be face a fair challenge; mustelidals are uninterested in wasting their talents against foes they can defeat without any effort. Occasionally, mustelidals are tasked with protecting a good-aligned outsider or a particularly important mortal. Mustelidals consider such a duty sacrosanct, and never abandon their charges when things get dangerous, not even to chase down an enemy to finish it off-while mustelidals enjoy fighting, they are clever enough to recognize that an apparent retreat may simply be an ambush in disguise.",
				"",
				"When not protecting charges, mustelidals prefer to remain in burrowed dens, letting the cool, musty smell of soil fill their nostrils. They enjoy claustrophobic spaces and darkness, and often react violently to intruders who threaten their solitude with either their presence or light. In other contexts, however, mustelidals are quite friendly, if a bit intense. They tend to speak in brief sentences and their laughs, which rarely occur, are short, staccato bursts. The condition of a mustelidal's fur often indicates how long it has been idle; one with dirt clumped and matted in its coat hasn't been in a fight in weeks or months. A mustelidal who has spent some time outside of Nirvana is much more freshly groomed.",
				"",
				"Of all the races on the Material Plane, mustelidals have a certain fondness for gnomes. This may be because the two races share the ability to speak with animals, giving them both an appreciation of the natural world-or perhaps because mustelidals appreciate the way gnomes fight so hard to stave off the Bleaching, despite its seeming inevitability. Whatever the reason, a mustelidal sometimes forms a strong attachment with a particular gnome, rescuing him from fatal situations but otherwise content simply to observe his antics. Many campfire tales have been told about gnomes who have garnered these literal guardian angels.",
				"",
				"**Calling a Mustelidal**",
				"",
				"Mustelidals are among the more powerful outsiders that can be called with greater planar ally. Although they do not need to eat, they enjoy the taste of honey, and each 8-ounce jar included in the material components of the spell counts as 200 gp worth of offerings. A mustelidal will eagerly accept the task of watching over a worthy person, halving the payment requested, though such tasks require a specific time frame and cannot be open-ended. Mustelidal protectors are often willing to lay down their lives to ensure the people in their care survive whatever dangers prompted them to employ the agathions' services in the first place. Particularly zealous mustelidals have been known to check in on their former charges from time to time, even years after the terms of their original agreement ended, offering their services again. While they require a new agreement to serve the mortal again, they can be very persuasive, and former charges who find themselves in perpetual danger may employ the same mustelidal a dozen or more times over the course of their lives, so long as the threats that the agathions are defending against present suitable challenges."

				"Procyals are mischievous agathions who take great pride and pleasure in acting just outside the boundaries of imperfect, mortal societies. Unlike many agathions, who are born from the souls of those who seek enlightenment through self-understanding, procyals are born from those who understand the balance of society and the individual.",
				"",
				"Procyals view society and the individuals therein as entities in a symbiotic relationship. They believe that individuals can be truly happy or free only within a society when they have access to luxury, commerce, and choice, and that society basically exists as a structure centered on the freedom of the individuals within. It is critically important to procyals that all individuals realize that society isn't something greater than themselves, but that they are intrinsically part of it and vice versa. Procyals commonly say that \"you are not in the city, you are a part of the city\"-and this serves as a reminder to those they visit that every member of the community is important.",
				"",
				"Procyals present a far more active force than most agathions, as they understand that neither societies nor people are static; rather, they believe that both are constantly growing and changing, and so must be willing to change to attain perfection. They move about the various planes constantly, humbling the prideful, praising the meek, striking down unfair laws, and building the structures that keep society in order. They happily see their work as never truly being complete, since healthy societies are constantly growing and changing. It is the goal of all procyals for this change to always be positive.",
				"",
				"Procyals are exceptional shape changers, able to effortlessly take the form of humanoid creatures they have met during their travels. This change is rarely more than cosmetic, however, for procyals are not interested in impersonating the person's normal behavior. Instead, they do things geared toward the creature's ultimate good-or at least the ultimate good of that creature's community. When all is well, procyals sometimes take on particular individuals' appearances just to play goodnatured pranks on them-though never harmful ones. Some favorites include shadowing that person through town to befuddle onlookers, making public appearances in multiple places at the same time, or asking \"themselves\" for directions, only to watch the mimicked creature's face twist in confusion.",
				"",
				"Despite their ability to take on specific forms, procyals are unable to assume a humanoid form of their own invention. Instead, they choose from the forms available to them as appropriate for a given task. They may, for example, portray old crones to relay important messages or powerful mercenaries to deliver threats.",
				"",
				"Procyals typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh 180 pounds.",
				"",
				"Most procyal agathions have short, reddish fur, and gray muzzles that suggest old age. Rarely, a procyal has black or white fur; such creatures are treated with great respect by their fellows. Like raccoons, procyals have sharp teeth and small claws that could potentially serve as weapons, but they prefer to fight with manufactured blades when possible, viewing unarmed combat as distasteful even if it is sometimes necessary.",
				"",
				"They do not need to eat or drink, but they greatly enjoy such activities and always endeavor to ensure that food and drink are in abundant supply. Likewise, they enjoy dressing in the trappings of high society, wearing elaborate outfits and carrying only the finest tools. After all, they believe the availability of such luxuries is an indication society is working as it should-provided, of course, that these indulgences don't come at someone else's expense.",
				"",
				"Although procyals resemble raccoons, they take great offense to the suggestion that they might resort to rooting through the trash to satisfy their hunger or might engage in other undignified pastimes. Though they may wear fancy clothes, procyals make a point not to try to flaunt their wealth, and earnestly attempt to ensure that others are able to satisfy their own needs. Procyals are more than willing to go without or donate their time and energy in order to ensure that others have enough."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Procyals are one of the only types of agathions that build entire cities in Nirvana, and they take great pains to ensure that their home settlements are suitably beautiful. Instead of imposing laws, they establish order through hundreds of maxims that discuss every aspect of daily life, from what clothing to wear to how to speak with strangers. Procyals don't follow every axiom at all times; instead, they use these proverbs as behavioral guides, and they expect visitors to do likewise. They record these maxims in large, bound tomes kept in the hearts of their cities, available for all to read.",
				"",
				"Procyals are gregarious creatures who are always eager to meet new people while on their travels, whether they are in Nirvana or on the Material Plane. They prefer to travel frequently from one community to another, experiencing each one fully and guiding it as needed before once again setting out toward the next settlements along their paths. Once they have experienced a community, they never forget about it or its needs, and they often return when they know their services will likely be needed. However, procyals rarely spend significant time in one place.",
				"",
				"The exception is when procyals cross paths with obvious evil, whereupon they stop, often for years at a time, to establish and carry out complex and long-term plans to undermine it. They don't see evil as a force to be met head on and fought, but instead as something that needs to be weakened over time, so that good can naturally rise up in its place.",
				"",
				"This is especially true when it comes to governing bodies, as procyals see some administrations as fundamentally better than others: democratic groups and wise councils are among their favorite forms of government, while dictatorships, monarchies, and military states must ultimately be replaced. In cases of particularly tyrannical rulers, they even go so far as to actively encourage or provide assistance to bands of revolutionaries or heroes who might usher in a fundamentally better government. Procyals are hesitant to meet even a weaker foe in direct combat if they can avoid it. Instead, they prefer to trick enemies into attacking another stronger opponent, especially if that will weaken both antagonists at the same time. When they must fight, they fight dirty, and they take any advantage they can. Procyals typically focus on damaging their opponents' faces as they fight; if they are forced into unarmed combat, they gouge eyes and tear off ears whenever they can.",
				"",
				"On the Material Plane, procyals are rarely wholly trusted. Since procyals love to chasten the powerful and to play pranks on the highand- mighty, few talented creatures are willing to enter into long-term alliances with them. Individuals in the lower classes are frequent exceptions. They tend to welcome procyals with open arms. For here among the poor and downtrodden, where society exists in its most imperfect state, nearly every action that a procyal takes has a positive and lasting effect."

Such relics often appear mysteriously within a temple or home, placed carefully among other objects.

Unobtrusive and able to blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions), they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil influences. They can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters who utilize the Improved Familiar feat and meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sith or cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies-and not necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid strangers.",

Indeed, for a vulpinal, there are few greater pleasures than sharing their knowledge-acting as sages of the planes, teaching songs and dances from exotic places, and composing poems about beautiful places in the natural world.

Whether from the entrance of its aquatic home (typically a sunken mass of trees or a flooded cavern) or the thick reeds and flora that grow at the water's edge, an ahuizotl remains watchful for any intruder that might trespass into its territory. Upon sighting such prey, the beast uses its uncanny ability to mimic the sound of a humanoid in distress to lure victims near, so it can snatch them with its tail claw. Ahuizotls are particularly fond of feasting upon a victim's eyes, and their tail claws are particularly adept at swiping away such organs for the beasts to feed upon. Teeth and fingernails are another of the creature's favorite meals, and the appearance of mutilated bodies missing eyes, teeth, and nails along a river's banks is sure evidence of an ahuizotl attack.",

Will-o--wisps and ahuizotls often find themselves in such cooperative relationships, with the will-o--wisp coaxing creatures near the ahuizotl's lair and then lingering to feed upon the victims' fear as the ahuizotl drags them into the depths. Some wily humanoids who fall into an ahuizotl's clutches-typically lizardfolk, boggards, or swamp-dwelling humans-have successfully managed to bargain away the lives of others in exchange for their own. Such arrangements always lead to a series of vicarious murders, as the aquatic predator's proxy coaxes new victims into the swamp for its fearsome partner to dine upon.",

At night, they creep into humanoid settlements in search of their favorite food: the grime that accumulates in abandoned or unwashed houses.

Akanames are shy and avoid humanoids, but dislike being disturbed while they feed, and are known to attack individuals who get up to relieve themselves in the dark of night.",

Akanames hold an almost religious reverence for otyughs, and the presence of one of the massive aberrations can attract several akanames to a single location.

In addition to serving as an object of worship, the otyugh also provides protection for the akanames' communal lair.",

				"**Soul Engine (Su)** An akaruzug draws the energy it requires to function from a living creature crucified upon its frame. An active akaruzug (or another creature working with an inactive akaruzug) can spend 1 minute to bind a helpless or willing creature to the construct. Once the victim is restrained, the akaruzug can attempt to draw the creature's soul into it once per round as a free action- the victim can resist with a successful DC 24 Will save. On a failure, the victim dies and the akaruzug becomes active. If the body crucified upon an active akaruzug is removed, the soul within the construct is freed and the akaruzug deactivates after 1d4 rounds. An akaruzug's victim cannot be resurrected while its soul is trapped within the construct, but destroying an akaruzug releases a trapped soul. While an akaruzug is active, attacks and effects directed specifically at the victim crucified to the akaruzug treat the attack or effect as if it targeted the akaruzug instead. However, a creature can attempt to remove a crucified body from the construct, but doing so first requires the creature to successfully pin the akaruzug. Once this occurs, the creature can attempt a combat maneuver check to wrench the body free. On a success, the corpse is removed and the akaruzug deactivates in 1d4 rounds. A deactivated akaruzug can take no action other than to attempt to draw in the soul of a creature crucified on its body to reactivate itself. It does not have an Intelligence score while deactivated, nor does it gain the benefit of any of its feats or skill ranks. It can't fly or move at all, and loses all benefits of its soul shield defensive ability. It retains its lawful evil alignment while deactivated. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

				"",
				"**Soul Slave (Sp)** Using a trapped soul, an akaruzug can manifest a ghostly representation of its victim to attack its enemies. A soul slave appears as the akaruzug's victim did in life and wields a weapon favored by that individual, but otherwise functions as per [spiritual ally](unknown:spiritual_ally) cast by a 20thlevel caster (and, as such, has an attack of +24/+19/+14/+9 and deals 1d10+5 points of force damage on a hit).",
				"",
				"**Soul Steal (Su)** An akaruzug can draw additional soul energy into itself. Once every 1d4 rounds, the construct can unleash a blast of soul essence that seeks to flense the life force of any living creature within a 20-foot burst. Any living creature in this area must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. A victim can remove those negative levels 24 hours later with a successful DC 24 Fortitude save. Each time an akaruzug successfully uses this ability, it regains a number of hit points equal to 5 times the number of creatures successfully affected by soul steal (regardless of how many negative levels any one creature suffers). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Unhallow (Sp)** An akaruzug emanates a 40-foot aura of unholy energy, as per [unhallow](unknown:unhallow). The construct's creator determines what, if any, additional spell effects are tied to the akaruzug's unhallow aura at the time of its creation. The construct benefits from any spell effects tied to its unhallow aura. Common choices are [darkness](unknown:darkness), [detect good](unknown:detect_good), [freedom of movement](unknown:freedom_of_movement), and [invisibility purge](unknown:invisibility_purge).

				"To create an akaruzug, a powerful warrior is entombed alive within a massive sculpture of lead, granite, or iron. As the statue's shape is refined and empowered-a process involving the efforts of a skilled artisan and a magic-user adept at channeling diabolical powers-the warrior inside slowly expires, her weakening screams and futile struggles resounding through the sculpture. The statue is then bathed in hellfire, a process that reduces the body inside into a substance similar to packed ash. These remains and the magic woven over the construct prevent the escape of the lingering soul within. At this point, the akaruzug's \"soul engine\" is complete, but the construct still requires further spirit energy to become fully active. A second infusion of stolen life force activates the akaruzug, causing it to rise into the air and spread its profane aura.",
				"",
				"With their ominous shapes, their unsettling abilities, and the corpse displayed upon their breasts, akaruzugs are often used as terrifying messengers, blasphemous retaliations against those who would stand against the constructs' creator. When the Taldan knight Arstlan besieged the tower of Vodcross' the home of the cruel wizard Cheseive, Poison Lady of Ganholm-he was not heard from for weeks. He reemerged crucified upon the breast of a serpentwinged akaruzug bearing his face. The thing laid waste to Ganholm, and hovered soundlessly above the ruins for 13 years before finally being felled by the adventurers known as the Order of Vermilion."

Due to the cruelty required to create an akaruzug, becoming the master of one of these fiendish creations is in itself a damning act. As the plans for creating these creatures are well documented in the libraries of Hell, conniving devils often assure that these formulas fall into the hands of cruel, ambitious, and desperate spellcasters in answer to their vile wishes."

Lone aboleths are often advance scouts for these hidden cities, seeking out new slaves."

			"description": [
				"Of all the races of alghollthus, none are as poorly understood by the scholars of the surface world as the enisysians. Their very existence is only a rumor, kept a closely guarded secret by an elite group of veiled masters known as the Fifth Dictum. These individuals coexist with enisysians in an asymmetrical physical and psychic symbiosis. In exchange for their protection, the much weaker enisysians grant their veiled master hosts not only increased mental capacity but also the ability to use their powers to influence other alghollthus. This relationship is far from equal, however, as the enisysians have been bred to be subservient to their masters for thousands of years, directly in opposition to the second dictum of their people: an alghollthu is to control. It should therefore never be controlled. Members of the Fifth Dictum rightly fear that should it become known that they created a race of alghollthu slaves, their kind would quickly turn against them.",
				"",
				"Enisysians were first created during the Age of Darkness from aboleth stock by the Fifth Dictum as a response to the cataclysm of Earthfall. These veiled masters had been vocal opponents of the human experiment (as they called the Azlanti civilization) from the beginning, believing that the humanoids were too free willed and unpredictable to be of lasting use. The destruction that Earthfall caused not only to the surface races but also to the alghollthu civilization at the time confirmed their worst fears. In the ruins of their broken cities, the Fifth Dictum began secretly fleshwarping the enisysians in order to give themselves the power to intervene against their own kin and prevent such a disastrous decision from ever being made again. Over the following millennia, however, members of the Fifth Dictum have grown arrogant, and they now believe themselves to be the true masters of alghollthu culture.",
				"",
				"A typical enisysian is about 3 feet in length and weighs approximately 40 pounds.",
				"",
				"An enisysian appears as a small tentlike creature with gray skin and trailing tentacles that end in small hooks. Its upper body resembles that of a jellyfish, but with three large, lidless eyes with vertical black pupils arrayed in a line. On the underside of its body is a small double-hooked beak used for eating and attaching to its host. While on land, four of its tentacles act as legs while two of them are used for defense or to manipulate tools. In the water, the enisysian propels itself with its tentacles like a squid.",
				"",
				"An enisysian is custom-bred to serve a single veiled master for its life. Like other alghollthus, an enisysian is basically immortal, able to repair almost any damage to its body over time or even enter a chrysalis state to wholly regenerate itself. Designed and bred to be subservient, an enisysian allows itself to be attached to the underside of its veiled master host at a young age. Once the bond between the alghollthus forms, the enisysian disguises its shape to appear as a remora or any other species of suckerfish common in its biome, reverting to its true shape only when it dies. It remains attached throughout its life, drawing its nutrition from the veiled master's blood and by filtering micronutrients from the water around it."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Until very recently, enisysians have had no cultural or even personal identity separate from that of the veiled masters they served. Genetically bred for dedication and obedience, they communicated telepathically only with their bonded veiled masters, not even acknowledging others of their kind. This has begun to change over the last several centuries, as natural genetic mutations have decreased the enisysians' inbred subservience and enhanced their self-awareness. Individual enisysians have begun to secretly communicate with one another, slowly awakening others of their kind to their enslavement while reaching out to alghollthus beyond their masters' control for support. Although the process of their emancipation has been very slow due to the Fifth Dictum's paranoia and secrecy, knowledge of their existence has begun to spread among the other alghollthu races, and surface-dwelling scholars have even theorized about the existence of the enisysians in certain works."

Omnipaths possess a keen intellect and recall everything they (and those within the mesh) experience, leading to a wealth of varied information that is shared between omnipaths as a sort of experience library. Omnipaths also serve as an alarm system for the veiled masters they serve, for each omnipath can communicate with all creatures in its telepathic mesh simultaneously.

The omnipaths' library of experiences provides them insight into the cultures and practices of the surface, allowing them to feign the expected responses on behalf of their dominated victims. In some cases, friends and family of a victim have failed to recognize that something was amiss with a victim's behavior for years, and sometimes the deception is never uncovered, giving the omnipaths-and those they serve-spies within the surface world that serve until their deaths.",

				"One of the largest alghollthus, the raylike plizeazoths are merciless predators that torment their victims' minds, breaking them for impending service to other alghollthus. Plizeazoths rely on their primal instincts rather than intelligence to complete their tasks. Despite their powerful mental and psychological talents, many plizeazoths do not comprehend the true power they have, long ago bred into a life of subservience to their [veiled master](unknown:veiled_master) overlords. For millennia, the veiled masters subjugated their humanoid victims themselves, but eventually they decided to delegate this joyous yet time-consuming task to others. The veiled masters approached their ancient alghollthu rulers and requested subservient creatures to complete this task. The resulting plizeazoths were impressive in their physical might and ability to efficiently deal pain, but they were immune to such sensations themselves and thus unable to truly comprehend their value within alghollthu society. The brutish beasts are generally content to carry out their masters' orders, with little will of their own or motivation for them to break from their monotonous existence.",
				"",
				"Because they generally do not leave the alghollthus' deep underwater territories' and even then only to carry out specific orders given to them by the society's true masterminds' plizeazoths are largely unknown among land-dwelling cultures. Even their victims recall only their pain and suffering, with at best foggy recollections of their tormentors; the emotional and psychic scars left on their minds scour away all memory of the creatures. The rare victim who escapes a plizeazoth with her mind and memories intact recounts brutal assaults to her psyche, breaking down her reality into a twisted landscape of pain and crushing despair, the only escape from which, she believed, was eternal servitude to the plizeazoth's master.",

A typical plizeazoth is about 22 feet wide and weighs approximately 4,400 pounds.",

Each plizeazoth has a tentacle on each side of its wide sucking mouth, which it uses both as a natural weapon and to manipulate tools and its environment in the rare event it needs to do either. A plizeazoth's hardened scabrous tail can likewise be employed as a weapon, but the alghollthu lacks the dexterity to do more than simply slam it broadly into an enemy. A plizeazoth's body is malleable, which allows it to easily squeeze into tight caverns and small structures. This also allows it to make subtle alterations to its normal raylike form, moving its vital organs around to accommodate a number of different configurations.",

Plizeazoths don't typically create homes or lairs for themselves, and the creatures are content to simply graze near deep trenches for food until they receive a telepathic command that spurs them into action. Plizeazoths are usually solitary creatures, but if the need arises, the veiled masters have been known to give a pair a mission and instructions to cooperate in carrying it out.",

With years of evolution, however, plizeazoths that gain self-awareness and an increased intellect could become a threat even to other alghollthus.

Thalassic architects have four tentacles, two of which end in clawed appendages capable of manipulating objects. Dark bands of scales typically ring their silvery bodies.",

Initially, the uldraaghus could move and shape only earth and stone, while they directed the ulat-kini to perform the most tedious labor. Now, given thousands of years of evolution, They've developed the skills to break apart and reassemble matter on a minute level.

Typically, this suggestion (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master and submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master implants other suggestions (such as a suggestion to attack the first person the creature sees).",

A veiled master's symbol spells are difficult to disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2.",

The creature's new flesh is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the creature takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes.

These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful touch attack and also blast a creature's mind with waves of mental energy. A creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration of this effect by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must attempt concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level).

These were the veiled masters-if one were to foolishly attempt to impose human hierarchies upon this alien race, veiled masters would be considered the nobility among their aboleth kin. In truth, while aboleths do treat veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are not regarded as the rulers of the race. Stranger and still more dangerous entities rule over veiled masters from the deepest trenches below the sea.",

The people knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very long. The veiled masters quelled such suspicions by doing violence to the bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. When the veiled masters first learned of humanity's growing hubris-of their belief that they were greater than their patrons-these manipulators punished humanity. At first, the punishments were minor, yet to the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, they only strengthened humanity's resolve. In the end, destruction was deemed the answer, and as human culture fell into ruins, the veiled masters retreated to the depths of the sea, content for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never be forgotten.",

While allips have no way to kill creatures, those knocked unconscious by an allip's Wisdom-draining touch often emerge from the state suffering from insanity (see pages 250-251 of the GameMastery Guide)-a fate that many would say qualifies as worse than death.",

Once implanted, anything that the creature ingests is instead consumed by the alpluachra, including such substances as elixirs and potions or ingested alchemical items, diseases, drugs, or poisons. Once the alpluachra is implanted, the host creature begins suffering the effects of starvation and thirst. Due in part to its numbing slime, an implanted alpluachra is difficult to detect.

After the newtlike fey is detected, it can be removed either by consuming at least half a pound of salt or a gallon of salt water, by a remove disease spell cast on the host creature, or by treating the host with a successful DC 15 Heal check. When a Heal check made for this purpose fails by 5 or more, the host creature takes 1d6 points of damage. If the host attempts to remove the alpluachra by eating salt or drinking salt water, it must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d8 hours from the reaction with the alpluachra.

Once they find potential hosts, alpluachras stealthily slither up and slide down their snoring gullets.",

A living creature can survive in this state for 1 day for each point of Constitution it has, after which it suffocates but remains preserved indefinitely as if by a gentle repose spell. Each day, a preserved creature can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) to break free of the amber shell.

If this penalty exceeds the creature's Dexterity score, it is paralyzed until the resin is removed. An ambergrim normally spits out paralyzed prey so it can target a new creature. A paralyzed creature outside the ambergrim that is not affected by its preserve ability can attempt a Strength check (DC = 10 + the ambergrim's Constitution modifier) each round to free itself, but the entangled condition remains as long as any Dexterity penalty persists.

				"Creeping masses of honey-colored slime, ambergrims are scavengers and collectors of the forest, rolling up unwanted bits of undergrowth and unsuspecting animals to preserve for later in timeless stockpiles hidden throughout their domains. Little more than aggressive, human-sized globs of sap and resin, they hunt by the twin graces of surprise and their incredibly sticky bodies, which naturally adhere to other creatures and draw them deeper into the ambergrims' bulk. The oozes' name describes both their rich, warm coloration as well as their ability to immobilize their prey within soft, amber-like capsules, which they can harden into tough cocoons to preserve food for later. Anything from rabbits to unwary human travelers is fit fodder for these oozes' endless hunger.",

				"Ambergrims vary immensely in size and coloration depending on their environment and parentage, but the most common are roughly 4 feet across and weigh around 200 pounds.",
				"",
				"Ambergrims are aberrations born from a relatively common blight that infects a variety of temperate and arctic trees. The fungus creates large, resinous bulges in the trunk, but upon infecting a treant or similar ambulatory plant, the growth inherits some measure of its parent's mobility and eventually hatches into a newborn ambergrim. Already full-grown and hungry, it wanders away-often ignored by its relieved, erstwhile parent-to begin hunting immediately.",
				"",
				"Ambergrims do not reproduce, making them rare except in cases when blight-obsessed druids cultivate them or groves of treants grow them as guard beasts. Each ooze is effectively immortal, living and hunting until it is destroyed or slowly starves to death.",
				"",
				"With every movement, ambergrims leave a film behind, slightly diminishing themselves with every undulating motion. To make up for this continual loss, they are ravenous, feeding slowly on twigs, leaves, and insects as they creep through the underbrush, but they prefer larger prey. They digest what they can, but in times of plenty they eagerly engulf and preserve additional creatures to store for leaner periods. This hoarding leads many to assume ambergrims possess some rudimentary intellect; however, much like squirrels, the oozes simply stockpile as much food as possible, increasing their odds of coming across a cache months or years later. Desperate wanderers in the forest may be blessed to stumble into an ambergrim's territory and discover its ample stores of food-providing they can escape the notice of the hunter.",
				"",
				"Ambergrims' bodies are made of a sticky, sap-like substance, making them natural grapplers. In quiet times, they hunt passively by sitting motionless and attracting insects and small animals to the sweet scent they exude, trapping such creatures in their adhesive mass. These oozes' cytoplasm hardens into an especially dense crystal, allowing them to coat prey in an impenetrable shell for later consumption. Bits of an ambergrim's surface harden from ordinary exposure to the air when the ooze remains still, forming tough crystalline protuberances that stud its surface. Ambergrims use these as rudimentary teeth to \"bite\" and hold prey as they attempt to engulf it. These same gems also focus light, forming simple eyes that grant the ambergrim unsophisticated vision rarely possessed by other oozes. Able to identify colors and movement, they are among the few oozes that actively hunt, attacking sleeping or otherwise motionless prey that would be invisible to predators that rely wholly on blindsense to locate and target potential meals."

				"Treants show a variety of reactions to an ambergrim infection, though most are as repulsed by them as any human might be by a parasite. Many attempt to remove the warty growths before they burst open, but this is a painful process that creates deep and easily infected scars. Rare groves of treants instead form a symbiotic relationship with ambergrims, letting the oozes reproduce in their bodies and using them to keep the treants' forest homes clear of smaller parasites and predators. These groves are then free to engage in to long periods of quiet introspection akin to hibernation, depending on their ambergrim pets to defend their territory as the treants quietly muse and communicate with one another and the trees around them.",
				"",
				"Ambergrims are unintelligent and solitary creatures born by circumstance, but they attract strange attendants. A variety of scavengers follow in their wake, preying on the preserved leftovers the oozes stash in their gemlike cases. Human scavengers flock to ambergrim territory as well, selling the creature's preserved sap as true amber-though it has none of the magical or alchemical properties of true amber-or harvesting those preservative cysts as a valuable ingredient in tanglefoot bags and alchemical glue. Some scholars find use for the ambergrim's preservative powers, either using captive subjects to preserve valuables or else extracting humors from the creatures to mix elixirs and poultices to extend life. On rare occasions, sickly or aging druids or fey actively seek out an ambergrim, hoping its preservative cocoons can sustain them in hibernation to offset their inevitable demise. Though a creature preserved in an ambergrim's preservative gems typically suffocates within a few weeks, the safety of the gem preserves its remains well enough for the creature to be easily resurrected-provided the ambergrim does not return later to make a meal of it."

				"Ammuts live among the ruins scattered throughout the Osirian deserts, often lairing in abandoned and lost temples of the gods of Ancient Osirion. When outside their lairs, ammuts bury themselves in sand to await the arrival of a suitable meal.",
				"",
				"An ammut is covered in fur ranging from sandy-colored to dark brown, with shorter fur on its back and legs, and a long mane behind its head that covers its shoulders. Its snout and face are layered in reptilian scales that are usually crusted with sand that has partially fused into glass from the heat of its breath.",
				"",
				"Ammuts never tire, and once an ammut notices a creature that it considers suitable prey, it's unrelenting- stalking its prey for hundreds of miles if need be before running it down. These terrifying chases generally don't last long, as the ammut makes use of a high-pitched scream that dazes prey long enough to allow the beast to catch and devour them. If that tactic fails to net the ammut its meal, it can also use its powerful force of will to dominate its prey, using telepathy to convince the victim to approach. Creatures that try to hide from an ammut using illusions soon find those plans foiled, as ammuts can see through illusions cast by even the most powerful mages. The only way to truly escape an ammut once it selects you as its quarry is to confront and defeat the beast.",
				"",
				"Fire burns within the core of an ammut, and the heat generated by an ammut's inner fires can sometimes fuse the sand it passes through into glassy depressions in the desert floor. The best desert guides can recognize these signs (called \"blaze bowls\") and avoid areas in which an ammut might be lurking."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Ammuts are lone predators, and are so rare their social structures (if any) and method of reproduction are unknown. No live specimen has ever been caught for observation, because the inner fires of the ammut consume the creature's body quickly upon its death, leaving little to be studied besides ash and brittle glass formed from fused sand. Every so often, a peddler in the markets of Eto or Shiman-Sekh will claim to possess a rare piece of an ammut's body (such as one of its teeth or an eye) that they try to sell to foreigners and treasure hunters. Most native Osirians know to ignore such claims, but outsiders may be gullible enough to buy the extremely expensive fakes as souvenirs. One of the few things peddled in these markets that actually has a connection to ammuts are pieces of their blaze bowls. Sometimes brave explorers come across one of these glassy depressions, and remain in the area long enough to try to carefully remove the fused sand in one whole piece. More often than not these efforts are fruitless, as the brittle glass often crumbles if mishandled.",
				"",
				"Because ammuts are so rare, the libraries of Osirion contain records of only two-dozen confirmed sightings, though it's likely that many more encounters ended with no one left to report the event. Osirian scholars have estimated, based more on reports of the telltale blaze bowls than of actual ammuts, that there are perhaps twenty to thirty of the creatures roaming the vast wasteland between the Junira River and the River Sphinx, though a single sighting near the Ruins of Tumen suggests the ammuts are not confined between those waterways. No record of a peaceful encounter with an ammut exists, suggesting that they have no interest in anything other than feeding on the souls of those who cross their paths.",
				"",
				"The origin of the ammuts is shrouded in mystery, though it's thought that they descended from a single creature of their kind that was more powerful than all existing ammuts combined. This mythical ammut is sometimes referred to in Ancient Osiriani scrolls where it has the position of judging the souls of the dead-a role already assumed by Pharasma. Because of this conflict, scholars argue about the creatures' true origin.",
				"",
				"Though it is generally agreed that ammuts migrated to Golarion from another plane long ago, many scholars disagree on the exact planar origin. Some scholars claim that ammuts are perhaps descended from a race of devils, while others claim the lineage stems from the divs. The most logical association of a fiendish origin is rooted in daemonkind. That ammuts are connected with souls and have the ability to utterly consume them certainly lends to this hypothesis."
			],
			"description": [
				"Ammuts are beastly but cunning creatures that consume souls in an attempt to satisfy their insatiable hungers. Few ammuts exist, and those that do wander the vast deserts of Osirion preying on the souls of any creature they can catch. These creatures prefer the taste of thoroughly evil souls or those who have experienced full and complex lives. Ammuts show disdain for creatures of inferior intelligence, but also tend to leave them alone, as they claim their souls are shallow and flavorless. The rarity of ammuts and their nomadic nature makes it difficult to determine how long they live, or even if they age at all. Ammuts are approximately 20 feet long and 9 feet tall at the shoulder. Their rounded and muscular hindquarters makes them denser than would be expected for their size, and ammuts can weigh up to 10 tons."

The winds themselves obey an anemos, and greater sky deities often task four anemoi with controlling the wind patterns for an entire world on the Material Plane.",

While an anemos always honors such agreements, such heroes may find the weather turning against them at a crucial moment many years later.",

Councils of anemoi occur perhaps once every millennium, when the four anemoi who oversee a particular world assemble to confer and debate.

They appreciate musical talent in their followers, allowing sirens and other creatures with musical skills to join their courts. Despite anemoi's aloofness, skilled mortal musicians can earn their way into the creatures' good graces, and romance between anemoi and mortals, while extraordinarily rare, is not impossible.",

They can faultlessly recite conversations they heard hundreds of years before. They also have the power to erase portions of their own memories, which they do (usually under orders from superior angels) to protect sensitive information.",
				"",
				"**Lesser Protective Aura (Su)** A cassisian has a lesser form of the protective aura possessed by more powerful angels. This protective aura grants the cassisian a +2 deflection bonus to its AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures. This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can only benefit one additional creature other than the cassisian at any one time. A cassisian's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the cassisian, or as soon as the cassisian fails a saving throw against an evil source, its protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The cassisian can reactivate its protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task."

				"Cassisians are the weakest sort of angel, but are absolutely dedicated to the cause of good. They serve as messengers for more powerful angels, and on the Material Plane they are often bound to good mortals to serve as familiars, acting as spiritual guides, reciting platitudes and quoting scripture from various benign faiths and philosophies (some forgotten for centuries). A 7th-level lawful good with the Improved Familiar feat can select a cassisian as a familiar.",
				"",
				"A cassisian's true form is a helmet possessing a pair of bird's wings. The exact style of helmet varies by the deity the angel serves-most appear to be steel with angular cheek-plates, though some resemble bascinets, skullcaps, great helms, or even samurai helmets, and a few older cassisians appear to be bronze or even leather. Though cassisians can assume other forms (that of a child-sized angelic humanoid wearing a proportional helmet matching the cassisians' true form, a dove, a dog, or a fish), they find it strange and rarely stay in that form for more than a few minutes.",
				"",
				"Typically formed from the souls of trustworthy and pious soldiers, some cassisians arise spontaneously from the spiritual fragments of great angels destroyed while defending the celestial planes against fiendish incursions. In many cases, the lowly cassisian retains fragments of its previous life's memories, and friends of that old soul may visit with the cassisian to reminisce with what remains. Unfortunately, the reincarnated angel's memories are more like something memorized from a book, and lack the character and camaraderie the friends expect."

				"**Celestial Charge (Su)** A mounted erelim is a force to be reckoned with. An erelim receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2), and does not take any penalty to AC after making a charge attack while mounted. In addition, if an erelim confirms a critical hit on a mounted charge, the nearby area is washed in holy light. Each evil-aligned enemy in a 20-foot-radius burst takes 2d8 points of damage and is blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 15 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the blinded effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Inspiring Presence (Ex)** When an erelim is mounted, all good-aligned allies within 60 feet that can see the erelim receive a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against evil-aligned creatures.",
				"",
				"**Righteous Challenge (Ex)** Three times per day, an erelim can challenge evil foes. As a swift action, the erelim chooses one target within sight to challenge. The erelim's melee attacks deal 2d4 additional points of damage to the target (or 2d6 points of damage to evil outsiders). The erelim takes a -2 penalty to AC, except against attacks made by the target of the challenge. An erelim's challenge and additional damage only apply to evil-aligned creatures; if an erelim attempts to challenge a creature that is not evil, that use of challenge is expended for the day with no effect. The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends.",
				"",
				"**Shining Mount (Su)** As a standard action, an erelim can conjure forth a quasi-real mount made of pure light. This functions as per phantom steed (CL 8th), conjuring a mount with an Armor Class of 18, 15 hit points, a speed of 100 feet, and the ability to run or charge over sandy, muddy, or marshy terrain without penalty. The mount glows with a brightness equivalent to a daylight spell. Only the erelim who conjured it can ride the mount, and the erelim must be astride the mount to use celestial charge and inspiring presence. An erelim can dismiss the mount as a free action."

			"description": [
				"Erelims serve as cavalry in celestial armies, charging into battle atop steeds of pure light and inspiring allies with valiant words and deeds. These angelic knights laugh in the face of overwhelming odds and love nothing more than to face destruction without fear, even going so far as to scorn armor. Honorable and respectful, erelims obediently follow the commands of celestial generals, but sometimes their fervor for righteous battle makes them frustratingly difficult to organize or call to retreat.",
				"",
				"Erelims appear as a variety of humanoid races from the Material Plane, though usually with dark, close-cropped hair. An erelim's wings are smaller and more elegant than those of other angels. A typical erelim stands 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.",
				"",
				"Erelims arise from the souls of valiant mortals who fell honorably in battle, or who died defending the weak against insurmountable evils. Many paladins, cavaliers, and other crusaders find themselves among this legion after death, but even a humble peasant may find herself among the knights of Heaven so long as she stood up to evil while others backed down. The appearances of the angels may vary greatly from the mortal forms they once inhabited, and many erelims arise from the celestial planes spontaneously-from wisps of soulstuff collected from a dozen or more brave petitioners-rather than emerging from a single, courageous warrior. They may present a huge variety of racial features in one stunningly beautiful and athletic form.",
				"",
				"Erelims who stand out thanks to cunning and resourcefulness in battle-for all erelims are blessed with bravery and prowess-are sometimes \"promoted\" to higher angelic choirs. If erelims can be said to covet anything, it is the title of deva."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Erelims are best suited for combat on the open fields of battle in large-scale conflicts between the forces of good and evil. They depend heavily on their shining mounts' projections of their own radiant souls-as their wings are smaller and weaker than most of the angelic host. Most guard the borders of Heaven, or ride across the yawning planes of Elysium on constant patrol for protean intruders. They serve as the cavalry for celestial forays into the evil Outer Planes, but lack the cunning and restraint to act as covert agents. Despite their zeal, erelims are careful to avoid civilian injuries or destruction, and work to steer conflicts away from unaffiliated settlements.",
				"",
				"Very rarely, erelims take mortal form on the Material Plane to act as knights or field marshals for armies they deem righteous. These erelims are fair but uncreative strategists, relying heavily on straightforward tactics and superior numbers to win the day. While erelims see any resulting casualties as a failure of their leadership, they tolerate the deaths so long as an important objective is won in the process. Erelims on the Material Plane attempt to disguise their celestial nature, only reverting to their true forms in times of desperation. Once danger has passed, such revealed erelims return to the Outer Planes.",
				"",
				"The concept of relaxation is alien to erelims. Their free time is filled with endless drills, jousts, patrols, and short breaks to maintain their weapons or strategize with other angels. Such a warlike existence leaves them suited for little else. Even in times of peace, most erelims find it difficult to lay their duty aside and embrace simple pleasures; without some measure of routine, many become anxious and reactionary, seeking conflict even when engaged in the most mundane activities.",
				"",
				"Erelims who serve together in a celestial formation share a camaraderie akin to that of many mortal armies. Members of an erelim formation learn to act in harmony, and grow as close as siblings, able to coordinate and work together without speaking a word. Multiple formations brought together into a single host often develop friendly rivalries, becoming especially competitive in battle, to the point of recklessness. Celestial commanders frown upon this divergence in the ranks, but can rarely discourage the boisterous angels for long.",
				"",
				"**Calling an Erelim**",
				"",
				"Erelims can be called with planar ally, and the payment they require depends on the boldness of the request. These angels belittle any tasks that don't test their mettle or call for incredible heroism, and demand to be presented with extravagant weapons or for large sums to be donated to an appropriate church. Conversely, they exuberantly agree to requests that put them in direct conflict with powerful evil beings, and often ask no more of the callers than to fight alongside them as equals. Erelims do not accept obviously suicidal tasks, but sometimes vastly underestimate the threat mortal dangers can pose."

				"Iophanites comprise a unique classification of messenger angel in service to Iomedae. Energetic, enthusiastic, impulsive, and outgoing, it constantly looks for ways to aid the forces of righteousness in the wars against fiends and villainy. As a being of pure righteous spirit in a burning physical form, an iophanite is often confused for an exotic form of harbinger or lantern archon. Its form is slightly mutable, and it can deform itself into an oval curved like a shield, or manifest simple tendrils to manipulate objects or lash out at opponents. When interacting with mortals, an iophanite usually manifests ripples of flames or pulses of light that thrum in time with its speaking. Most creatures have a difficult time telling iophanites apart, but these angels can always recognize each other.",
				"",
				"Iophanites are talkative and have excellent memories, making them naturally inclined to carry news, battle orders, and other critical information. Their bodies are hot to the touch, but do not ignite combustibles unless the iophanite wishes it, allowing it to carry scrolls or other flammable goods without risk of destroying them. Of the lawful angels, they tend to be the most creative in terms of working around rules and the most forgiving of others' failures. They are also inclined to serve as the guardians of mortals, being mindful of virtuous and selfsacrificing heroes who might be destined for greatness in much the same way Iomedae herself was.",

The kuribu can appear as a statue indefinitely. Most kuribus first present this face when dealing with mortals, changing to one of their other faces only if combat begins.",

This protective aura grants the kuribu a +2 deflection bonus to AC against evil foes, and a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made against evil effects or spells cast by evil creatures (this does not stack with the resistance bonus from the kuribu's ox countenance). This aura extends to a radius of 5 feet, but can benefit only two additional creatures other than the kuribu at any one time. A kuribu's protective aura is fragile, and as soon as an evil creature successfully strikes the angel, or as soon as the kuribu fails a saving throw against an evil source, the protective aura fades away and is no longer applicable. The kuribu can reactivate the protective aura by spending 1 minute concentrating upon the task."
			],
			"description": [
				"Though one of the least powerful kinds of angels, kuribus are trusted with the protection of sacred places such as churches and blessed bowers. Their ability to stay as still as statues allows them to stand sentinel over their charges for decades, or even centuries. When their guarded locations are invaded, kuribus take flight and pepper their foes with arrows, altering their countenances as the situation requires. If outmatched or outnumbered, the majority of a flight of kuribus sacrifice themselves, while a lone kuribu retreats to fetch reinforcements, be it angels from a higher choir or a nearby hero.",
				"",
				"Kuribus look like small, round-cheeked humanoids, and have pale, flawless skin that is actually as tough as stone. This both aids them in disguising themselves as statues and affords them protection. Their child-like forms lend them an air of purity and innocence. A kuribu has two sets of wings, with the smaller pair at the base of the spine allowing a greater amount of control when flying. A typical kuribu stands 3 feet tall but weighs 60 pounds as a result of the angel's dense, stonelike flesh.",
				"",
				"Kuribus are fashioned from the souls of good mortals who died protecting a treasured place or ideal. As these spirits traverse the River of Souls, they undergo several metamorphoses, gaining the qualities that eventually become their blessed aspects. The majority of kuribus can take on the countenances of eagles, lions, and oxen, but a few variant kuribus possessing the aspects of different animals do exist. However, all kuribus can blend in with the architecture of a church, appearing as innocent-looking statues with wide eyes and plump cheeks.",
				"",
				"Kuribus have a remarkable amount of patience and tolerance for boredom, as they may be assigned to watch over particular locations for years. Mortal generations pass swiftly for kuribus, with years blurring in much the same way days might for mortals. However, their senses are always alert, and the slightest destructive act against their charges can cause them to spring into action. While this self-defensiveness certainly extends to vandals and evil beasts, kuribus have boundless patience for the birds and small mammals that sometimes make homes upon their bodies or shelter beneath their wings. While kuribus would never let a terrible crime transpire before their eyes just to protect a pigeon's comfort, there have been instances of these angels revealing themselves only after their avian residents have migrated away for the season. This has more to do with kuribus' otherworldly sense of urgency and time than any particular affinity for animals."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"As kuribus protect sacred areas, they are witness to, but rarely interact with, many different types of good-aligned outsiders. Unless these outsiders seek to cause harm, the kuribus see no reason to interrupt them on their business. As such, other angels tend to consider kuribus to be more decoration than fellow animate beings. Kuribus think nothing of this prejudice, as they are confident in the importance of their duties.",
				"",
				"Occasionally, an angel important enough to employ a flight of kuribus to safeguard their own sanctum will develop a certain fondness for the smaller outsiders. The overseer angel speaks pleasantly with the kuribus, keeping them informed of the important events of the Outer Sphere, not expecting responses. In turn, the kuribus grow fiercely loyal to the more powerful angel. Eventually, this relationship blossoms into something more familial and playful, the kuribus trying to move from their positions without the other angel noticing. In times of crisis, however, this whimsy is immediately dropped in favor of the defense of the holy sanctum.",
				"",
				"On the other hand, kuribus rarely form close relationships with other kuribus. When part of a flight that protects a single location, kuribus work together well, but solely as professional associates and nothing more. If, for some reason, a single kuribu has different ideas than the rest of the flight about the best way to defend their charge, that angel quickly falls in line with the others. Kuribus hold their duties above their pride.",
				"",
				"In rare cases, kuribus might find themselves lingering in areas that were once holy but have been abandoned or despoiled. In such cases, a kuribu often stoically waits for goodly folk to return, whether as a congregation restoring the site or heroes who might help cast out a lingering evil.",
				"",
				"**Calling a Kuribu**",
				"",
				"The payment requested by a kuribu called with lesser planar ally is often a donation that helps to rebuild or refurbish a church or other holy site. As a kuribu considers these places to be very important to the appropriate deity, the angel will halve any payment required if asked to guard such a location. A few kuribus even accept long-term, open-ended requests to protect a piece of sacred ground from a worthy caller. A small number of cathedrals on the Material Plane are home to kuribus selected for such a service decades ago, and whose original callers have long since passed away."

Their hands retain the selected special ability until they choose another special ability to replace the previous one. These weapons cannot be removed or sundered. They fade away when the ninkonda dies and cannot be used by any other creature. As a standard action, a ninkonda can fling a volley of four spikes from their arms. Make a separate attack roll for each spike-all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spikes have a range increment of 20 feet.

A lawful creature gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +8 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack).

Up close, the creatures present a more intimidating and bizarre appearance: dozens of iron spikes impale their arms, shoulders, and hands, and the faceplates of their helms are smooth and featureless. Ninkondas hunt once-honorable mortals who have committed heinous sins, such as treason against good nations or betrayal of celestial confidences. Ninkondas don't slay their quarry; instead they wordlessly encourage redemption by reflecting the creature's soul in the mirror inset in the angels' broad chests.",

Ninkondas have no faces; a blank helm topped with a golden crown sits atop each ninkonda's thick neck. Despite lacking facial features, ninkondas have supernaturally sharp senses and can speak in a deep, somber voice (although they rarely choose to do so). Ninkondas are good at recognizing truth and find dishonesty particularly repugnant.",
				"",
				"The iron spikes that impale ninkondas' arms and shoulders are physical manifestations of their past misdeeds. These spikes cause ninkondas a constant dull ache rather than a sharp pain, but ninkondas embrace this discomfort as an ever-present reminder of how wickedness can be overcome. The reflection in the broad mirror across a ninkonda's chest is always hazy and inexact, as it shows spiritual truth rather than physical reality.",

A ninkonda who identifies a candidate for redemption pursues this quarry tirelessly, dispatching the mortal's irredeemable lackeys (such as undead and fiends) with nail-studded fists and confronting the mortal personally. In the ninkonda's broad chest-mirror, the quarry sees not only the stains on its own soul but the repercussions of all its past transgressions. For those who are truly repentant when confronted so directly with their wickedness, the ninkonda offers atonement and helps them back onto the path leading a righteous life."

				"Ninkondas are few in number. Though they originate from the ranks of archons, only the most erudite scholars of Heaven can describe how ninkondas come into existence. Many archons begin as virtuous mortal spirits who are transformed into lantern archons or other lesser servitors, then ascend predictably through the hierarchy of Heaven. Some of these virtuous spirits, however, have not always been so: some lived mortal lives of startling wickedness before repenting of their evil ways and joining the ranks of Heaven. Although the archons do not fault each other for mortal wrongs, a rare few archons dwell on their own dimly remembered misdeeds. These transgressions vex their thoughts like splinters. Eventually, some of these archons decide that redeeming other mortal wrongdoers is a higher calling than the service of Heaven's hierarchies; when such archons advance, they slip from the usual ranks and are reborn as ninkondas. Their mortal misconduct takes physical form in the spikes that pierce their flesh.",
				"",
				"Ninkondas prefer to work alone, but form small squads against groups that fell into wickedness together (such as a band of desperate revolutionaries or a couple of accidental murderers). The ninkondas hope to redeem all the members of such groups together, so that they can find strength and courage in each other's company once the ninkondas have gone. Ninkondas working together rarely confer, instead deferring automatically to the most experienced among their number.",

				"Solars are the greatest type of angel, usually serving at the right hand of a deity or championing a cause that benefits an entire world or plane. A typical solar looks roughly human, though some physically resemble other humanoid races and a rare few have even more unusual forms. A solar stands about 9 feet tall and weighs about 500 pounds, with a strong, commanding voice that is impossible to ignore. Most have silvery or golden skin.",
				"",
				"Blessed with an array of magical powers and the spellcasting abilities of the most powerful clerics, solars are powerful opponents capable of single-handedly slaying mighty evils. They are the greatest trackers among the celestials, the most masterful of which are said to be able to track the days-old wake of a pit fiend flying through the Astral Plane. Some take on the mantle of monster-slayers and hunt powerful fiends and undead such as devourers, night hags, night shades, and pit fiends, even making forays into the evil planes and the Negative Energy Plane to destroy these creatures at their source before they can bring harm to mortals. A few very old solars have succeeded at this task and bear slayer-names of dread creatures that are now extinct by the solar's hand.",
				"",
				"Solars accept roles as guardians, usually of fundamental supernatural concepts, or objects or creatures of great importance. On one world, a group of solars patrols the energy conduits of the sun, alert for any attempts by evil races such as drow to snuff out the light and bring eternal darkness. On another, seven solars stand watch over seven mystical chains keeping evil gods bound within a prison demiplane. On yet another, a solar with a flaming sword stands watch over the original mortal paradise so that no creature may enter.",
				"",
				"In worlds where the gods cannot take physical form, they send solars to be their prophets and gurus (often pretending to be mortals), laying the foundation for cults that grow to become great religions. Likewise, in worlds oppressed by evil, solars are the secret priests who bring hope to the downtrodden, or in some cases allow themselves to be martyred so that their holy essence can explode outward to land and grow in the hearts of great heroes-to-be.",
				"",
				"Though they are not gods, the solars' power approaches that of demigods, and they often have an advisory role for younger or weaker deities. In some polytheistic faiths, mortals worship one or more solars as aspects or near-equal servants of the true deities-never without the deity's approval-or consider notable solars to be offspring, consorts, lovers, or spouses of true deities (which they may be, depending on the deity).",
				"",
				"Unlike other angels, most solars are created from an amalgam of good souls and raw divine energy to directly serve the gods, but an increasing number of these powerful angels have been \"promoted\" to their existence as solars from lesser creatures like planetars or devas. A few rare and powerful good souls ascend directly to the status of solar. The oldest solars predate mortality and are among the gods' first creations. These strange solars are paragons of their kind and have little direct interaction with mortals, focusing on the protection or destruction of abstract concepts such as gravity, dark matter, entropy, and primordial evil.",
				"",
				"Solars who spend a long time in the Material Plane, especially those in the guise of mortals, are sometimes the source of half-celestial or aasimar bloodlines in mortal families, due either to romantic dalliances or simply the mortals' proximity to celestial energy. Actual offspring are rare, and when they occur, it is always a mortal mother that bears the child-while solars can appear as either sex, the gods have not granted them the capacity for pregnancy or motherhood. Indeed, this fundamental truth is often what drives a solar to seek out a mortal lover. Since begetting a child upon a mortal is generally frowned upon by other solars, a solar father rarely interacts directly with the fate of his lover or child, so as to avoid bringing shame upon himself or his responsibilities. Yet such solars still watch over their progeny from afar, and in times of peril, they might even be moved to intercede to aid one of their endangered children, albiet in subtle and mysterious ways.",
				"",
				"All angels respect the power and wisdom of solars, and though these mightiest of angels usually work alone, they sometimes command multiple armies led by planetars, acting as great field marshals for massive incursions against the legions of Hell or the hordes of the Abyss."

			],
			"description": [
				"Peaceful and kindly woodland creatures, anhanas tend to forest trees and befriend animals and foresters. Although an anhana has the general appearance of a young halfling woman, her unnatural eyes and erratic demeanor mark her as a fey creature. Anhanas are wise, clever, and helpful. They use their magical shears to tend to the forest, encouraging its growth and development so that nature and civilization can exist in harmony. Anhanas return kindness with generosity, but they use their otherworldly abilities to confound and delay enemies of the forest.",
				"",
				"An anhana stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.",
				"",
				"Anhanas are never children; they step fully formed from mature oak or maple trees in deep forests. Although an anhana forms at her full-if small-size, she is unclothed and her skin is covered with wedges of bark matching the tree that produced her. A newly sprouted anhana has the Hit Dice and abilities presented above, but cannot speak and has only an unformed impulse to aid others and protect the natural world. The anhana's tree produces a low, celebratory thrumming for a few days after the anhana sprouts. This noise carries far, but is audible only to fey and plant creatures. Mature anhanas recognize the thrumming and seek out the new arrival to welcome her into their sisterhood. Anhanas share clothing and other gifts with their new sister and teach her music, kindness, and woodcraft. Most anhanas absorb their bark-like coverings within a few weeks, but all anhanas can temporarily extend sharp wedges of bark from their skin to deter foes.",
				"",
				"A tree that produces an anhana is usually one with a benevolent history or divine connection, such as having shaded a weary saint or growing where a nature goddess once stepped. Hamadryads hint that they have the ability to tend a tree with magic so that it sprouts an anhana, but they keep the precise process secret.",
				"",
				"All anhanas are friends of the natural world. They speak freely and softly with animals, attempting to befriend even predators. They prune flowers and trees to encourage growth rather than harm or cull the plants. Anhanas in a sisterhood can amplify their understanding of the natural world and communicate with streams and lakes.",
				"",
				"Although benevolent in their stewardship of the forest, anhanas understand that nature preys upon itself. An anhana does not mourn a fat rabbit captured by an owl or a creeping vine that kills a host tree. Similarly, an anhana does not begrudge a woodcutter his livelihood, but instructs the woodcutter how to harvest wood with the least impact on the forest.",
				"",
				"Anhanas subsist on a diet of nuts and berries. They prefer not to spend all their time gathering sustenance, so they carefully prune and tend berry bushes and nut trees to maximize their yield. Lacking any particular connection to these particular bushes and trees, however, anhanas are likely to wander to some other part of the forest and leave the nuts and berries for another to find and enjoy.",
				"",
				"Anhanas can live to be several centuries old. As their physical appearance does not change as they age, it is nearly impossible to distinguish an old anhana and from a young one. If an anhana does not die of disease or misfortune, she eventually feels a calling to return to nature. The anhana-aided by her sisters if possible- journeys to a deep stream or lake, sinks below the surface of the water, and permanently diffuses her essence into the water itself.",
				"",
				"Anhanas can sprout in any climate, but they are most common in temperate forests. In boreal forests, anhanas sometimes retain their woody skin (these anhanas have a +2 natural armor bonus, but lack the thorn body spell-like ability). Jungle anhanas are skilled climbers and often live their lives among the canopies of great trees instead of on the ground (these anhanas have a climb speed of 30 feet, but they lack the speak with water spell-like ability)."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Anhanas are uncommon, but several groups inhabit the Verduran Forest and the Duroth Wood of Iobaria. Those few anhanas that live in the Fangwood are susceptible to the Blight, and most anhanas who sprout there have the blighted fey template.",
				"",
				"Although these kindly fey originate in deep forests, they enjoy helping civilized folk who have good hearts and intentions. Anhanas often loiter near well-traveled paths or on the outskirts of settlements that abut an old forest. They spend their days tending to the forest so that it exists in harmony with people, and can be seen pruning back overgrown thornbushes, explaining directions to lost travelers, and entertaining local foresters with their cheerful songs. Though generally peaceful, they use their abilities to confound and oppose those who would destroy or irreparably harm forests.",
				"",
				"Unlike many fey, anhanas are not shy. They eagerly approach strangers on forest paths to say hello and offer assistance. Believing that it is impolite to startle others, they often announce their presence by rustling bushes or using ghost sound to simulate the sound of a tinkling bell or babbling river. Anhanas don't seem to understand that this \"courtesy\" is sometimes alarming to others.",
				"",
				"Anhanas prefer to congregate in groups of their own kind called sisterhoods. Sisterhoods sometimes occupy a single grove or glen for decades, earning a reputation as kindly forest spirits, while other sisterhoods wander throughout their forests. Sisterhoods dissolve when individual members disagree about whether or where to travel, although the members separate peaceably.",
				"",
				"Anhanas have a sixth sense for the emotions of others. They hide from angry or hateful people but are attracted to happy travelers. Anhanas are also drawn to the scared or desperate, such as lost children or starving runaways, and do their best to provide aid. At times, this aid is as simple as sharing a nourishing handful of nuts or giving clear directions back to a main road, but an anhana might also offer more direct assistance, such as confounding a wicked pursuer. Anhanas have little understanding of or regard for the laws of civilization, and they just as eagerly aid a goodhearted fugitive as they would a well-intentioned sheriff.",
				"",
				"Anhanas are fundamentally flighty and erratic, despite their goodly nature. They rarely carry through with long-term plans, no matter how sincerely agreed to, and they are prone to wandering away from an area for no reason at all, even if they have carefully tended to it for months or years.",
				"",
				"Although most anhanas enjoy being helpful, they have a strong sense of personal space and don't like being too close to people or animals. They have an irrational phobia of being touched by any creature besides other anhanas, and they almost reflexively activate their thorn body ability if physical contact seems to be imminent.",

Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside.",
				"",
				"Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible.",

				"Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers.",

It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever."

However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank's creation requirements-beyond the body of an intact tank-an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank.

While within a shadow, an anisydaemon is considered incorporeal and takes half damage from spells and magic weapons. Ghost touch weapons affect it normally. An anisydaemon that dies while possessing a creature's shadow is immediately ejected to a random empty space adjacent to the creature. An anisydaemon can leave a shadow it is possessing as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

The Horseman of Pestilence uses these daemons during outbreaks of sickness to convince the healthy their only hope of survival is to eliminate the sick, as such violence often ends up helping sickness spread anyway. Under the Horseman of Death, these fiends whisper of the horrible fates that await mortals after death and watch as the subsequent worry leads mortals to commit heinous acts to lengthen their life spans, ironically leading their souls closer to Abaddon in the process."

				"Ankhegs are an all-too-common plague upon the rural areas of the world. These horse-sized burrowing monsters generally avoid heavily settled areas like cities, but their predilection for livestock and humanoid flesh ensures that they do not keep to the deep wilderness either. Their preferred habitat is rural farmlands, as the loose soil of such regions makes it easy for the creatures to burrow. Tales speak of larger ankhegs that dwell in remote deserts-such creatures likely feed primarily on giant scorpions and camels, and rarely come in contact with civilization due to their remote locations. (A desert ankheg is a Huge advanced ankheg.)",
				"",
				"In combat, an ankheg prefers to attack with its bite. Against multiple foes, an ankheg often grabs one of the available targets and then attempts to retreat to safety, burrowing into the ground. A creature carried underground can still breathe with difficulty (the ankheg needs to breathe as well, so its tunnels are relatively porous), but is often eaten alive before its allies can rescue it.",
				"",
				"Ankhegs burrow with their legs and mandibles, moving with unsettling speed through loose soil, sand, gravel, and the like-they cannot burrow through solid stone. Burrowing ankhegs can construct tunnels by pausing frequently to shore up the walls with a thicker, less caustic secretion from their mouths. If an ankheg chooses to make a permanent tunnel when burrowing, it moves at half speed. A typical ankheg tunnel is 10 feet tall and wide, roughly circular in cross-section, and from 60 to 150 feet long ([1d10 + 5] x 10). Clusters of ankhegs often share the same territory and create intricate winding networks of tunnels under farmlands, sometimes resulting in sinkholes where too many burrow at once.",
				"",
				"Although ankhegs resemble immense vermin, they are in fact much more intelligent than the typical arachnid and, given time and a talented trainer, can even be trained to serve as mounts or beasts of burden. The fact that even \"domesticated\" ankhegs are prone to squirting acid when frightened or startled makes them unsafe at best in most heavily populated regions, but for more savage races like hobgoblins, troglodytes, and particularly orcs, ankhegs make popular guardians or even pets."

				"Ankhravs, also called \"ankheg queens,\" are fearsome predators most common near the Skittermounds. These six-legged beasts are larger than regular ankhegs, but the most telling difference between them and drones is the pair of razor-sharp, mantislike arms located at the front of the thorax. While these arms provide no locomotive aid- their scissorlike edges are too delicate to support any weight-these additional appendages allow ankhravs to quickly bring down prey that would take ankheg spawn much longer to swarm and slay. Ankhravs are rarely encountered alone, and then only when a young queen travels from her home nest to establish a new colony. In most cases, when they venture from their lairs, ankhravs hunt accompanied by ankheg drones.",
				"",
				"Though a significant danger to locals, ankhravs are also a highly valued resource for local tribes and the humans of Trunau. While they and their spawn wreak havoc on any attempts to build settlements in their territory, their sturdy carapaces and valuable organs can be worth a fortune if sold to the right alchemist or collector. There are always a few scouts and trappers willing to risk the dangers of hunting ankhravs.",
				"",
				"Every winter, ankhravs retreat into their hives to give birth to the next generation of ankhegs. During this time, each ankhrav is tended to by ankheg drones as its flared abdomen produces an incubating egg sac nearly the size of its body. Sustaining this sac uses much of the stores claimed by the ankhrav's hunting season, and without ankheg servants most ankhravs would starve to death, drained by the process of birthing the next generation of drones. If an ankhrav has a large hive with scores of drones and plentiful food, it may give birth to one or two young ankhravs, which leave their birthplace to establish their own hives at 2 years of age.",
				"",
				"A fully grown ankhrav stretches to a length of 14 feet and can weigh as much as 4,200 pounds."

Occasionally, however, an ooze in the presence of a powerful psychic spellcaster becomes infused with some measure of both sentience and personhood, and yearns to join the company of civilized beings. When a spellcaster completes a particularly stressful ritual or powerful mental feat in close proximity to the right mixture of primordial slimes that make up a nascent ooze, a piece of the spellcaster's mind breaks off and infuses the ooze, creating a being called an apallie.",

Its greatest desire is to join the society of its progenitor, and it alters its form to insinuate itself into humanoid settlements. Such impostors are easily discovered, however, as an apallie's true nature reasserts itself as soon as the sun begins to rise. An ooze discovered in this way often finds itself run out of town, forced to try its luck in the next settlement, though some particularly stubborn apallies simply assume a new form and return the next night under a different guise.",

Even when its form is forcibly reverted, an apallie insists it is truly a member of its creator's race, and that it has somehow been subjected to a terrible curse. Despite the ooze's relatively high intelligence, this unreasonable attachment to its self-image persists even in extreme circumstances. If the apallie's creator was a different size from the apallie, the apallie still tries to imitate that creator, attempting to pass as a small elf, human, or member of another race to which its progenitor belonged, and refuses to acknowledge the size difference.",

				"The primary inhabitants of the perfect city of Axis are the race known as axiomites, outsiders born of lawful neutral souls whose primary focus is to serve Axis in one of three ways: the construction and tending of inevitables, the expansion and maintenance of the city itself, and exploring and calculating the laws and constants that underpin all reality in hopes of using this knowledge to bring order to the Great Beyond.",
				"",
				"But the axiomites are ill-suited to interactions with mortals. As creatures of pure order, they find it difficult to deal with creatures who have the free will to choose their own destinies and to interpret (or even willfully ignore) laws. Ancient axiomites long pondered a solution to problematic encounters with visitors from the Material Plane. The answer they arrived at was the creation of a new form of life-a melding of their own perfection of order with the unpredictable and fragile bodies and minds of mortal humanoids.",
				"",
				"Thus, the first aphorites came to be. Although these women and men were always welcome in Axis, the perfect city was not their true home. Infused with a spark of mortality and the influence of the Material Plane, aphorites were created to serve as diplomats, translators, and envoys between the axiomites and the myriad cultures of the countless Material Plane worlds. As native outsiders, aphorites have free will of their own, and they live and die just as other mortals do. Though akin in many ways to other native outsiders such as aasimars, ganzis, and tieflings, the aphorites differ in that they are not the results of unions between outsiders and mortals. While the original population was forged in Axis by the axiomites, new aphorites are born to aphorite parents. In cases where an aphorite and a humanoid have a child, the offspring is either a newborn aphorite or a member of the humanoid parent's race. Originally, the aphorites were created with nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified as a result of generations spent on the Material Plane. Today, an aphorite always appears humanoid in form with golden skin that flickers and periodically coruscates with sparkling crystalline dust, and eyes and hair that tend toward metallic hues (with copper, gold, and silver being common colors). Beyond this, they can appear similar to dwarves, elves, and humans, or any other Medium humanoid race. The heritage of the immutable order of Axis has long prevented the formation of aphorites of other sizes, but exceptions have occurred with increasing frequency as each new generation of aphorites is born on the Material Plane.",
				"",
				"Aphorites do not exist in large numbers on most Material Plane worlds, and Golarion is no exception. The first aphorites to arrive on Golarion did not seek to establish their own race as a distinct cultural element, but instead to assimilate into established societies to help guide the formation of laws and bolster potential interactions with the citizens of Axis. But as the aphorite race spread, something that the axiomites should have anticipated occurred: as native outsiders with the ability to choose their own destinies, many aphorites became intrigued by the societies they were living in. There are some limits to this acceptance of new societies; aphorites who embrace chaos are considered outcasts and troublemakers by their kin, despite the fact that these aphorites are natural expressions of mortals' defining characteristics.",
				"",
				"Smart and strong, aphorites are as likely to become the focus of attention and admiration as they are the victims of jealousy and hatred. Their ordered and structured personalities often cause strained relations with more capricious or mischievous neighbors and can be a source of conflict with cultures who highly value individual expression of thought, such as that of the elves. Races with stronger tendencies toward law typically build stronger bonds with aphorites. Dwarves in particular enjoy the company of aphorites and find the birth of an aphorite among their own kind a welcome event, as aphorites have an intuitive understanding of the crafting so integral to dwarven society.",
				"",
				"While not all aphorites are inherently lawful, most relish structure and order in their lives. Ideas of morality, however, are less clear cut to aphorites. While most can appreciate scholarly studies of the philosophy of good and evil and recognize the differences between them, this divide does not influence them to the same extent that the structure of law versus the disorganized madness of chaos does. Consequently, most aphorites are lawful neutral. Typically, aphorites drawn to theology choose lawful gods as patrons, with the worship of Abadar in particular resonating with their inherent desires and goals of building a perfect society. When an aphorite embraces chaos, other aphorites often treat their wayward kin with a mix of curiosity, horror, and pity. Chaotic aphorites themselves tend to be loners and have little interest in the traditions of their own kind, instead seeking out other societies to join.",
				"",
				"Most aphorites, no matter the culture they are raised in, eventually experience a longing to see the world beyond the boundaries of their birthplace. Be it by choice or chance, aphorites seem predisposed to the life of an adventurer. Always seeking to better understand not only the world, but themselves as well, aphorites excel when they are placed in situations where their intellects might shine. Being both cunning of mind and naturally strong, aphorites gravitate toward classes which blend the arts of spellcasting and combat, such as magus or warpriest.",
				"",
				"Aphorite names typically reflect the society they are raised in, so an aphorite raised among humans would have a name befitting a human child, while an aphorite raised by dwarves would have a name drawn from dwarven heritage."

When clustered in swarms of a few hundred individuals, they develop a hive mind and a distinct personality. This personality is as mutable as the swarm itself; a mote archon swarm that loses a few dozen members might become grim or despondent, while a swarm that gains more members becomes cheerful. As mote archon swarms speak little, these differences in temperament often manifest through the lethargy or agitation of individual lights within the swarm. Regardless of their current personalities, mote archon swarms remain driven to help the sick or injured and cannot stand idle in the face of suffering.",

As each mote archon has sharp edges, a darting swarm of the creatures can shred skin; however, the swarm has sufficient control over its component motes for it to flay enemies but leave allies unharmed.

Celestial armies commission mote archon swarms as field medics, and the glittering swarms accompany the Heavenly forces in their wars against the legions of evil. In these great clashes, mote archon swarms dart about the battlefield, attacking foes while healing allies. A mote archon swarm's desire to heal sometimes overcomes its better judgment, however, and it might staunch an enemy's mortal wound or target a desperately injured enemy along with its allies when it uses its mass cure light wounds ability. Mote archon swarms see this not as an error, but as a measure of grace that lowers the aggregate amount of suffering in the universe.",

				"Mote archons are generated as a celestial byproduct during the ascension of an archon into a more powerful form. An archon who has served Heaven as a warrior or crusader produces few or no motes, whereas a diplomat or peacemaker might produce as many as a dozen, and an archon dedicated to easing suffering and healing the sick might engender dozens of motes each time it ascends to a higher form. The motes thus produced are mindless, inclined to do no more than seek out others of their kind and avoid causing harm. (A mote caught between these two directives-such as a mote cupped in clasped hands that could escape only by slicing free with its sharp edges-simply oscillates in place until a resolution presents itself.) Only when motes gather in large numbers does a personality appear, but this is independent of the personalities of the archons who shed the component motes.",

When creatures under their care have recovered sufficiently, mote archon swarms abandon the immediate area, giving in to wanderlust. Mote archon swarms encountered outside of Heaven have usually slipped through a portal or gateway in such meanderings. Although these itinerant swarms find healing work to occupy their time, they eventually pine for the familiar fields of Heaven.",

			"description": [
				"Though bastion archons are among Heaven's most powerful defenders, their formation results from the intertwining of lesser archons, starting with the least of them all, lantern archons. Rarely, when a group of at least nine lantern archons is turned back by an overwhelming invading force of fiends, the group can use their gestalt ability to form a whirling globe that stands its ground.",
				"",
				"This brave act of defiance usually lasts only half a minute, buying the lantern archons' allies time to escape before the gestalt is overcome. In such dire situations, a nearby shield archon-a combatant of Heaven more suited to serving as a bulwark against tides of evil-can transpose itself with the squad of lantern archons, using teleportation to take their place. But this interaction of abilities has unpredictable outcomes, and rarely, rather than swapping places, the two entities meld in a brilliant flash of light that sends nearby evil outsiders reeling, leaving a crater with a nascent bastion archon lodged in its center. The bastion archon is initially stuck in the ground where it formed, but it retains many of its component creatures' defensive and offensive abilities. If it survives, it eventually pulls together a huge, four-armed body from the surrounding terrain until it is clad in the stone of the Holy Mountain itself, in the process becoming infused with power greater than that of any other archon. A fully formed bastion archon stands 30 feet tall and weighs 15 tons.",
				"",
				"Even after a bastion archon has freed itself from its creation crater, it rarely moves far, preferring to defend the place that was once so nearly overcome by invading forces. Indeed, convincing a bastion archon to abandon its self-selected post is so futile that \"trying to budge a bastion\" is a common phrase in Heaven for attempting the impossible. However, there have been a few rare instances when a particularly large crusade into Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell has prompted a bastion archon to serve as a forward base for the forces of Heaven, helping establish a formidable foothold that requires a truly terrible counteroffensive to uproot.",
				"",
				"In battle, a bastion archon is akin to the eye of the storm, standing firm and unmoved by the chaotic melee around it as its allies clash with invading fiends. It provides shelter to Heaven's servants, slamming enemies into dust or holding them aloft just long enough to rend them to shreds with its magnificent beam of holy light. Given the choice between pursuing a retreating evil army or tending to the wounded, a bastion archon almost always prefers the latter, following its indelible instincts to protect and heal.",
				"",
				"The one threat most likely to stir a bastion archon from its typically rigid methodology is a balor, the fiery winged demons that sometimes serve as generals during demonic invasions. Given the opportunity, a bastion archon wades through a vast army of demons in a single-minded effort to get to the strategic head and cut it off, leading to a confrontation that often ends explosively-either when the archon falls or the balor erupts into massive fireball during its death throes.",
				"",
				"Bastion archons hold in reserve an explosive last resort in the event they are felled in battle: an explosion of light that destroys the archon, heals its allies, and consecrates the ground around it. This final sacrifice gives its (likely overwhelmed) allies a last-ditch chance at victory, and the site of a bastion archon's death is often thereafter considered a sacred place of remembrance.",
				"",
				"A particularly unusual bastion archon by the name of Anvil Fist serves in the deepest caverns of the Forgeheart in Heaven, patrolling without end to keep invaders from the Abyss at bay. Anvil Fist is one of the longest-serving of its kind, and it has recently begun to act strangely, wandering into empty tunnels and staying there for days, speaking only in vague aphorisms when questioned. Some worry that Anvil Fist's millennia-long battle against chaotic abominations has begun to destabilize the archon, while others believe its uncharacteristic behaviors are the result of a qlippoth lord's vile machinations. Still others theorize that Anvil Fist may be nearing an apotheosis to something greater, perhaps becoming the first incarnation of an archon of power akin to the mightiest balor lords, infernal dukes, or veranallia azata elders."

Although a codex archon's expertise allows it to more easily slay creatures of the type it studies, it usually prefers to avoid violence and uses its knowledge to coax more information out of creatures it meets. A spellcaster who calls or summons a codex archon can generally conjure one with whatever specialization she seeks unless the foe or topic is one that is little known to the forces of Heaven or an unorthodox combination (GM's discretion). Though they prefer their heavenly homes to the chaotic Material Plane, summoned codex archons may deign to serve for a time as assistants or even instructors in mortal libraries, academies, and temples."

				"**Axiomatic Barrage (Su)** As a standard action, a hammer archon can slam the head of his hammer against the ground, creating an ordered pulse of energy in a 30-foot-radius burst. Only chaotic and neutral (nonlawful) creatures are harmed by this energy, which deals 10d6 points of damage to chaotic creatures (or 10d8 points of damage to outsiders with the chaotic subtype) and slows them for 1d6 rounds (as per slow). A successful DC 26 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the slow effect. This ability deals only half damage to creatures that are neither chaotic nor lawful, and they are not slowed. Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful DC 26 Will saving throw. A hammer archon can use this ability once every 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Immovable Object (Su)** When not in the archon's possession, a hammer archon's lucerne hammer can be picked up or moved by only another hammer archon or a lawful outsider of at least the same CR as the hammer archon. A hammer archon's lucerne hammer has double the hardness and 50% more hit points than a normal lucerne hammer. This quality persists for 24 hours after the hammer archon's death.",
				"",
				"**Inevitable Sunder (Ex)** When a hammer archon attempts a sunder combat maneuver against an item held or wielded by a chaotic- or evil-aligned creature (or a creature with the chaotic or evil subtype), the hammer archon ignores the target item's hardness.",
				"",
				"**Reverberation (Ex)** A hammer archon's body is harmonically attuned to provide it with extraordinary defenses. The archon is immune to bludgeoning damage. Additionally, whenever a character strikes a hammer archon with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality."

			"description": [
				"Hammer archons are the unstoppable champions of celestial armies, called to fight against paragons of evil and chaos when all hope seems otherwise lost. Their powerful hammers sweep through lesser enemies and shatter shields and weapons with ease. Each hammer archon's plate armor gleams like polished silver and resists even the strongest blows from hammers and other bludgeoning weapons.",
				"",
				"A hammer archon stands 10 feet tall and weighs approximately 900 pounds.",
				"",
				"Those archons who continually proves themselves in battle, either by striking down hordes of demons or by holding back a single pit fiend long enough for reinforcements to arrive, may get promoted to the rank of hammer archon. This process can take centuries, even millennia, but the lawful-aligned outsiders would brook no shortcuts. Many hound archons and shield archons with martial inclinations ceaselessly endeavor to rise to the heights of power that being a hammer archon represents.",
				"",
				"The most ambitious hammer archons strive to prove themselves worthy of becoming star archons, often taking on positions of authority in important conflicts. Those who show they can lead squadrons of other archons to victory against overwhelming odds or can make tactically sound decisions under pressure take the first steps to a legendary transformation. Other hammer archons are content to remain as they are, with the knowledge that an army with too many generals and not enough soldiers is no kind of fighting force at all."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Hammer archons spend the majority of their time on the fields of battle, whether assaulting an outpost of Hell or clashing with legions of daemons over a nexus of power on the Material Plane. Unless injured by a particularly potent foe, these archons require only brief respites before charging back into the fray. When not fighting, hammer archons struggle to not betray their impatience to re-enter conflict. They pass their idle hours polishing their armor and maintaining their lucerne hammers. As such, the areas of Heaven where these celestials reside are often filled with the rhythmic sound of hammers ringing against steel.",
				"",
				"A hammer archon without his hammer is a diminished version of himself, so each archon fervently guards his weapon, sometimes forming such a deep bond with it that it gains a modicum of sentience. Though not fully intelligent, these weapons respond to their owners' moods with noticeable alterations of the symbols on their heads and hafts. No matter what, a hammer archon who is divested of his weapon in the heat of battle ignores all other threats until he can retrieve it. This sometimes forces the archon to make poor strategic choices, a fact that savvy foes take advantage of when fighting one of these celestials.",
				"",
				"Hammer archons often have only cursory relationships with other hammer archons. They are usually sent on solo assignments or asked to lead armies of other celestials, so they rarely have opportunities to interact with one another. When they do, they speak only of past conquests in cool but cordial tones. A hammer archon knows that others of his kind are unflinching followers of law, so he never questions the others' actions or decisions. When required to act as a team, hammer archons understand that the situation must be dire indeed. They discuss strategy with the same professional attitude, and often reach a consensus very quickly.",
				"",
				"Though hammer archons and shield archons vary greatly in rank and strength, they sometimes form close ties. The hammer archons see themselves as mentors to the other celestials, offering advice and providing opportunities for the shield archons to gain the power they need to ascend. More often than not, these relationships prove to be quite dangerous for the shield archons, as the hammer archons drag them into battles that are well beyond their capabilities. However, those few shield archons who survive these ordeals gain enough experience to take class levels and eventually transform into more powerful archons.",
				"",
				"Many hammer archons share a particular hatred for mariliths. These demons can possess a martial prowess equal to that of hammer archons, and are usually at the command of fiendish armies. A marilith's many bladed weapons can bypass a hammer archon's damage reduction and immunities, so hammer archons seek to sunder them before they can cause too much damage. A battle between a hammer archon and a marilith is an awe-inspiring sight to behold, as the two titans struggle to gain advantage over each other."

Harbingers can also be bound into service as familiars, a role they accept eagerly, taking full responsibility for guiding their masters' souls toward salvation.

Harbingers shed light as brightly as a torch under normal conditions, but can dim to a faint glow if desired, and frequently spin off bits of their essence into dancing lights.",

Often, their light fluctuates along with their words or tones, punctuating their speech with sparks of light or gentle pulses. As a swift action, a lantern archon can dampen its light to that of a candle for 1 round. Only death can extinguish this light.

Especially brave lantern archons might eventually be promoted into a more powerful kind of archon, but most are content with their status."

				"**Resounding Burst (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, an Ardoc moilant can snap its vise-pincers closed with enough force to produce a shock wave of sound and disruptive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. The moilant attempts a single bull rush combat maneuver check and applies the result to each creature in the affected area. A creature pushed by the shock wave takes 2d6 points of sonic damage for every 5 feet it is pushed. In addition, the wave dispels magic in the area as per [greater dispel magic](unknown:greater_dispel_magic) (CL 13th). An Ardoc moilant cannot use this ability if it is grappling a creature with its vise-pincers.",

When an Ardoc moilant successfully establishes or maintains a pin, it applies its constrict damage to both the target and the target's armor or shield (Ardoc moilant's choice)."

				"Ardoc moilants are hulking thaumaturgical workhorses created to move earth or perform other heavy labor. Efficient and powerful in their movements, Ardoc moilants carry out instructions with determination and a keen awareness that betrays a higher intelligence. The Ardoc family of Kaer Maga has achieved great success by mass-producing these constructs, which sell quickly due to their adaptability, durability, and ability to work for long periods with little need for oversight.",
				"",
				"Ardoc moilants are roughly humanoid in shape, with strong arms that end in massive gripping pincers. Moilants have large, shovel-shaped heads that they can lower to push aside dirt and stone. Of course, these tools that make the moilants so suited for heavy labor can also be used to make devastating attacks against those who interfere with their tasks.",

				"",
				"Every component of an Ardoc moilant's form is designed for labor, from its low, squat shape with wide feet to prevent destruction of valuable terrain, to its rune- engraved pincers that can both bore through stone and lift delicate cargo. Although not built with combat as a primary function, Ardoc moilants can be used in battle with no additional modification. They are sometimes employed as secondary enforcers or guards to watch over valuable mines, factories, or palaces under construction. An Ardoc moilant's impressive size is often sufficient to dissuade any potential threats, but persistent trespassers soon find that a moilant's gripping pincers and shovel-shaped head are formidable weapons. Although every component of an Ardoc moilant is created by or enhanced with magic, its magical nature is most apparent in its rune-carved pincers, which can create powerful magical shock waves.",
				"",
				"Ardoc moilants are particularly clever, able to evaluate outcomes and approach assigned tasks with a keen understanding of engineering principles. One of the many secrets the Ardocs keep about the construction process is that this sophisticated programming relies on patterning from a human soul. Though this patterning is vital to the moilants' utility and popularity, the patterning ritual is exceptionally painful and sometimes fatal to the human source."

				"As constructs built by the Ardocs' arcane masters, moilants have no society in the traditional sense-at least according to the Ardoc family. Customers have noted, however, that Ardoc moilants seem to exhibit patterns of behavior that hint at a deeper level of consciousness and an inner drive for companionship. Unless presented with constant activity, the labor-constructs tend to gather in small groups, or even with other machines or constructs. Most Ardoc moilants are created with the ability to speak a language selected by the buyer. They speak only rarely, and their deep, gravelly voices sound like metal scraping on metal. All moilants acquire distinctive personalities and notable quirks over time, such as collecting certain types of small items or pushing rubble into shapes that mimic the runes on their pincers. Diligent owners might demand a readjustment or refund from the Ardoc family when their moilants start to demonstrate too much individual initiative, but some moilants leave their masters and strike out on their own before this readjustment can occur."

				"Ashen forgemasters are massive, undead [salamanders](unknown:salamanders) tasked with eternally toiling at a forge, crafting armor and weapons. They begin their lives as living salamanders but are bound to a forge, continuing their work eternally, long into their undeath. Centuries spent in seclusion erodes their personality, and they eventually grow into paranoid, violent, and sadistic creatures. Forgemasters surround themselves with the weapons and armor they have crafted over the years, the designs and shapes of which grow more bizarre as the forgemaster's delusions grow.",
				"",
				"An ashen forgemaster stands between 9 and 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"Throughout history, those with the power to control salamanders have used them for their metalworking prowess. Such powerful beings sometimes bind a salamander to a forge to keep it in servitude. These salamanders might be imprisoned for decades, tasked with performing whatever their captors require of them. An ashen forgemaster is created when a salamander dies while bound to a forge. These salamanders are reborn as undead, forced by the binding spells to continue their work.",
				"",
				"Early in their unlife, ashen forgemasters retain the appearance of flames, as a live salamander might have. As it continues to exist, however, an ashen forgemaster's flesh gradually dulls to gray and then white, until it looks like a statue of its former self. Despite their burnt-up exteriors, ashen forgemasters smolder with all the heat of the Plane of Fire. As their bodies decay and crumble away into dust, they periodically collect the remains, mix them with molten metal, rebuild themselves, and continue their eternal work.",
				"",
				"The forge used to bind a salamander is generally covered in ritual runes that strengthen the binding and protect the forge from harm, preventing the salamander from destroying its prison to escape. A single forge cannot host more than one salamander in this way, though some spellcasters will link multiple forges at once to enslave many salamanders simultaneously."

			"habitat": [
				"Most forgemasters rarely see other creatures after their transformation, as they interact with only their captors. Spellcasters willing to bind a salamander to eternally work its forge seldom care about the salamander's wellbeing and see the creature as a mere tool to be used when necessary, ignoring it for years at a time.",
				"",
				"A forgemaster's weakened mental state makes interaction with it dangerous. A forgemaster lashes out against those it sees as interfering with its work or attempting to steal its creations. In cases where a forgemaster is not abandoned, or when its task can actually be completed, it might retain its sense of self. These forgemasters are fiercely driven to accomplish whatever is necessary for their release, even making deals with their hated efreet enemies. Multiple salamanders bound to nearby forges often form close bonds with each other.",
				"",
				"Forgemasters litter the area in their vicinity with weaponry and sculptures in a feeble attempt to remain grounded in reality. Many chain themselves to their forge to symbolize their slavery and measure out the distance they can safely roam.",

				"An ashen forgemaster's soul is bound to a massive forge similar to the way a [dryad](unknown:dryad) is bound to its tree or a [lich](unknown:lich) to its phylactery. As long as the forge burns, the forgemaster is rejuvenated after it is destroyed. The ritual that originally binds the salamander also directly connects the forge to the Plane of Fire, so extraordinary measures are necessary to extinguish it. Powerful water- or cold-based abilities, such as the breath weapon of an ancient or older [silver dragon](unknown:silver_dragon) or the drench ability of an [elder water elemental](unknown:elder_water_elemental), can suppress or sever this connection long enough to douse the forge's flames. The forge then becomes mundane and can be dismantled to prevent the forgemaster from rejuvenating."

				"Blind, contemplative artists from the lightless depths of the Elemental Plane of Water, ashullians coaxed sounds, tastes, and other diverse stimuli into miles-wide galleries among the plane's freezing currents. A powerful race of subterranean humanoids beneath Kaer Maga coveted the ashullians' abilities and tore open a planar rift that captured several ashullians but also flooded the humanoids' underground chambers with icy water. The humanoids vanished, and their ashullian prisoners now haunt the Kaer Magan caves known as the Drowned Levels. For generations, these creatures have prowled the chambers of their vanished captors. Ashullians seek objects that realize their eclectic and unpredictable aesthetic sense and showcase whatever oddities they find-which could include anything from a sodden scroll or a jeweled brooch to a severed foot-by wearing them in their flesh or displaying them in their magical bowers.",

Its torso splits into two thick tails as long as the rest of its body. An ashullian's transparent, leathery skin reveals a body cavity with swirling iridescent ribbons of fluid in place of organs. Ciliated clefts and soft, flexible spines-the ashullian's sensory apparatuses-run along its back and arms.",

Their artistic abilities are stunted, degenerate versions of those of their progenitors, who may still swim within enormous sensory galleries in the Elemental Plane of Water. Ashullians on Golarion can realize their grand visions only within their bowers, exercising incredible control in pursuit of their inscrutable artistry. Within a bower, the diverse contents' own sensory elements' such as the coarse texture of rusted mail, the sour taste of reagents, and the stink of decaying flesh-are combined with whorls of scent, sounds, and other minor manifestations injected by the ashullian. An ashullian can create and move objects within its bower by thought alone, and can even suspend basic physical laws there; if an ashullian chooses, an object remains eternally suspended in the water in defiance of gravity, or remains dry despite being submerged. An ashullian revels in the synesthetic glory of its bower, but other creatures find the multisensory experience overwhelming.",
				"",
				"The ancient magic that brought ashullians to the Drowned Levels keeps most of them trapped there. A few, though, have escaped their prison via purloined magic, while others have simply vanished without a trace. Ashullians whisper that these paragons transcended their existence through ultimate artistic mastery and seek to follow these mythical examples.",

				"When not tending to their individual bowers, ashullians search the Drowned Levels for inspiration and clues to a means of escape. Ashullians are not the only occupants of these dismal, sodden halls; water elementals and other aquatic creatures swim through the ashullians' domain. Ashullians are generally content to let familiar creatures pass, although they have an intense fixation on visitors from the surface. These visitors are first pestered for trinkets and curios, but eventually restrained and stripped layer by layer so the ashullian can experience their full sensory measure. Occasionally, visitors escape an ashullian's attention by presenting a novel artistic display and fleeing while the creature is occupied. Ashullians are rarely welcome within another ashullian's bower, as each considers its own artistic experiments to be superior to those of its kin and is unabashedly critical of others."

Anyone within a 1-mile radius must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or feel inexplicably drawn toward the aspidochelone by the most direct route possible. This effect is not an overwhelming compulsion, but more a subtle suggestion. The save DC is Charisma-based with a -10 penalty.",

While hibernating, it appears to be little more than a rocky outcropping or, in the cases of the largest aspidochelone, an entire island.

After entering its hibernation, a aspidochelone sleeps for 2d10x10 years, rousing naturally after this time has elapsed. An aspidochelone about to awaken usually sleeps fitfully for the last year of its rest, quivering with tremors that feel like earthquakes to creatures upon it. These tremors are treated as a minor version of the earthquake spell that affects the entire island, forcing creatures on the ground to make a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid falling down and causing 30 points of damage to all structures. An aspidochelone might be awakened immediately if it takes 100 or more points of damage in a single day.

The preponderance of plants, seabirds, and even other beasts gives the creature the appearance of a rocky but natural island.

Anyone standing on or swimming within 100 feet of the aspidochelone when it dives must make a DC 29 Reflex save or take 10d6 points of damage from the crushing waves and pressure, and be pulled 100 feet below the water. Even if a creature escapes the undertow, the water within 100 feet of a passing aspidochelone is treated as rough water, requiring a DC 20 Swim check to move at half speed.

Yet, upon tethering their boats to the whale's tough hide and lighting a fire to ward off the cold, many castaways discover to their horror that the spur of land they have beached upon is in fact an enormous creature. This realization comes too late for many unfortunate souls as the creature plunges beneath the waves, dragging trespassers down with it.",

From tail to snout, the creature generally measures more than 500 feet in length, and weighs upward of 100,000 tons. Few ever see an aspidochelone for what it actually is, however, having only glimpsed the pitted and uneven skin of its topside. As seabirds and other creatures come to rest upon the hibernating creature, they carry with them plant seeds and dirt. Over time, the accumulated plants and wildlife gives an aspidochelone the appearance of a small, densely inhabited island."

				"The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant that collects its own grisly fertilizer by grabbing and crushing animals and depositing the carcasses near its roots. These remarkable plants can see minute movements in the earth and air and detect changes in light and heat through their broad leaves, giving them exceptional awareness of the area around them. Possessing no intelligence or agenda, they lash out at whatever living things pass nearby, regardless of the target's size, sentience, or potential deadliness. A mature plant consists of a main vine, about 20 feet long; smaller vines up to 5 feet long branch off from the main vine about every 6 inches. These small vines bear clusters of leaves, and in late summer they produce bunches of small fruits that resemble wild blackberries. The fruit is tough and has a hearty and typically bitter flavor, although some say the berries change in taste depending on what victims composted a given plant's roots. The most murderous assassin vines supposedly produce the sweetest berries.",
				"",
				"An assassin vine can move about, but usually stays put unless it needs to seek prey in a new vicinity. The plants use simple tactics, lying still until prey comes within reach and then attacking. Once an assassin vine is engaged, it pursues prey (albeit slowly) in order to catch and compost the creature. The plants prove tenacious, as long as their quarry remains within sight. Once a creature moves beyond the plant's ability to perceive it, the unthinking vine falls still and lies in wait for the next passerby.",
				"",
				"Assassin vines lurk within dense forests and swamps, but some might encroach upon poorly tended fields and vineyards. The vine's seeds might be spread far by birds swift enough to pluck them and escape. Tales often tell of assassin vines appearing in flower beds or infiltrating greenhouses, murderous surprises planted by rivals and enemies or arbitrary doom dropped by unsuspecting wing."

Once an asurendra directs a spirit blade to attack a foe, the blade continues to make a single attack against that foe each round on the asurendra's turn until directed otherwise by the asurendra and as long as the foe remains within 50 feet of the asurendra. As a move action, the asurendra can direct all currently attacking blades to switch targets to new foes within 50 feet. These weapons attack using the asurendra's base attack bonus modified by its Wisdom modifier (+29 for most asurendras), and deal 3d6 points of damage plus an amount of force damage equal to the asurendra's Wisdom modifier (3d6+7 for most asurendras). Physical attacks do no affect these blades, but disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a rod of cancellation (touch AC 25) causes them to vanish. If a spirit blade's target dies or moves beyond a 50-foot range and the asurendra does not retarget that blade by the end of its turn, the blade vanishes. Likewise, any blades that are not within 50 feet of the asurendra at the end of its turn also vanish."

				"With the notable exception of the unique asura ranas, asurendras are the mightiest of their kind. Although few asurendras possess anything resembling an extended realm, in Hell or elsewhere, these asuras are the \"wise ones\" of asura kind. Most dwell within shrinelike fortresses in which they can practice their ruinous mysticism and command lesser asuras who seek their teachings. To most asuras, an asurendra's order is something akin to a deific edict.",
				"",
				"Each asurendra is a humanoid creature of immense proportions. Their exact appearance varies just as the appearances of humanoids vary, but all asurendras have six arms and multiple eyes and heads. An asurendra's body is an example of physical perfection, athletically and gracefully built, but its face has monstrous or inhuman features, such as tusks or bizarrely placed features. Most asurendras are 19 feet tall and weigh 8,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"Few asurendras were born to their might-they achieve their power only over the course of countless lifetimes spent as lesser asuras. Throughout each incarnation, these tenacious asuras sought unity with some concept of destruction. Eventually, through dark meditation and vile action, the asuras ascended to a state of being united with some aspect of unmaking. They also gained power over their own being and slowly reshaped themselves into a vision of their perfect selves, instruments of annihilation ideally suited to fell gods and their divine works.",
				"",
				"In battle, an asurendra does its best to destroy all enemies, taking a moment to ensure death when any foe falls. Asurendras enjoy eating the bodies of fallen foes, and some can even use the flesh and bone of those they consume to create new asuras to serve them.",
				"",
				"**Blasphemous Sages**",
				"",
				"Each asurendra follows its own bliss toward a specific method of vengeance against the divine. Like philosophers dispensing wisdom, they teach their ways to others so that more asuras might ascend into perfection. Listed here are some ideas of the vile ways asurendras might use their \"enlightened\" hatred.",
				"",
				"Death: All living things can die. Instead of war, an asurendra can focus on the aftermath of war. Such an asurendra replaces quickened baleful polymorph with quickened slay living and quickened blade barrier with quickened circle of death. Its spirit blades deal negative energy damage, not force damage, and can thus be used to heal allied undead creatures as easily as they can serve as weapons against the living. Sacrilege: Blasphemy is joy to any asura, but truly impious asurendras learn talents that mimic divine miracles. Cults to these asurendras, which almost always seem benevolent on first glance, turn people from the worship of real deities. These asurendras do not possess a spirit blade special attack, but can use miracle as a spell-like ability once per day as long as the miracle granted is in keeping with their blasphemous design. Shaping: Some asurendras like to remake what the gods have created. Nothing escapes a shaper's vision, and its enemies find their bodies, minds, and souls are like clay in a shaper's hands. An asurendra sage of shaping lacks a spirit blade special attack, but gains the following special ability. Create Asura (Su): As a full-round action, an asurendra can turn a creature that it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a tripurasura (see page 26) that it then excretes into existence. Such tripurasuras remain loyal to the asurendra that created them as long as they remain tripurasuras. If an asurendra has enough tripurasuras at hand, it can consume them as well and transform them into more powerful asuras using this ability. An asurendra can transform any tripurasuras it has eaten within the last 24 hours into a number of Hit Dice worth of other asuras equal to the number of tripurasuras it has consumed. An asurendra can create as many tripurasuras as it wishes with this ability, but can only create more powerful asuras by combining multiple tripurasuras once per day. An asurendra cannot create another asurendra with this ability. A newly formed asura considers the asurendra to be its master. Not all of a creature's soul is consumed when it is used to create a tripurasura-beings swallowed and used to create asuras in this manner are dead, but can be restored to life as normal."

The deity heard the tearful cries of the mortals, pleading for mercy and insisting that any kindly god would never visit such hatred upon his people. The god felt an upwelling of shame for having engineered such violence, but rather than accept responsibility or undo the damage, the god appeared before the city and forsook the divine champion, insisting that it was a raving beast sent by some less caring patron than himself. Empowered by their lying god's words and magic, the people praised him, rallied, and killed the champion.

				"Thinking her divine realm so glorious that all must envy it, a goddess once sought a powerful oracle to identify her enemies. The oracle told her that she had no reason to fear invaders, for her death and ruin would come from the covetous barbs of enemies within. Distressed, the goddess returned to her palace, scoured her halls for any such traitors, and at last came upon her three demigod children practicing archery. Certain that her children would one day slay her, she tore them to pieces and cast their bodies and bows far from her realm. The first japalisura formed from these eviscerated remains.",

Japalisuras never want for ammunition, plucking arrows from the air as if drawing them from some invisible quiver. It's unclear from where exactly these arrows originate, although every japalisura's ammunition shares the same fletching and design. One theory is that these asuras are drawing replicas of the arrows carried by the slain demigods, though effects that inhibit summoning don't impede their ability to draw forth these arrows in any way.",

				"Japalisuras have a knack for extracting embarrassing truths from the universe, hatefully manipulating their prophecies as though they were independent or even in defiance of conventional soothsaying. Where magic fails, they are adept at reading humanoid emotions, making up attractive lies and pandering to biases to confirm their clients' worst fears and prejudices."

				"Like most asuras, japalisuras favor temples and churches as their lairs. The more a location is associated with prophecy, the better. As a result, japalisuras often settle in and around druids' groves, oracular caves, cyclops lairs, and the like, especially if those locations continue to attract the occasional pilgrim seeking answers. This makes abandoned sacred sites of Magdh, Pharasma, and Sivanah especially attractive. Japalisuras take a special delight in identifying perilous romantic relationships, posing as servants of Naderi and stealthily presenting at least one of the lovers with predictions of future difficulties to encourage self-destructive behavior.",

				"Japalisuras know that their fearsome miens tend to distress visitors, yet the asuras lack any supernatural means of disguising themselves. Instead, many japalisuras favor hiding out of sight and dealing with visitors from behind screens or within darkened alcoves. In these circumstances, the asura rarely emerges unless doing so would convince a reticent visitor to cooperate or if necessary to destroy someone who poses a threat to the asura's ongoing operations. Rarely, a japalisura operates openly, relying on either its reputation or its monstrous allure to attract disciples. Such is the case for Holkomion of Iblydos, who claims to have rediscovered the sacred art of mythspeaking. At least one warrior claims to have attained mythic power as a result of Holkomion's guidance, yet most find that the japalisura's prophecies in fact direct petitioners to assassinate hero-gods.",

				"More often, a japalisura maintains a small cult to communicate its oracular guidance. A japalisura accepts only the most devout followers into such coteries. With such humanoid puppets, the asura can dispense divinations telepathically without having to show itself. These cults take myriad forms but typically operate outside of large population centers to avoid too much scrutiny. The japalisura Zalmiac poses as the Varisian harrower Madame Vhelanosz, virtually never leaving the wagon from which she interprets her cards. Her pernicious prophecies have incited scores of murders-especially against Desnans and Pharasmins, whom she goads into killing each other-and her loyal cohort of ex-Sczarni assistants ensure nobody asks too many of the wrong questions."

The tripurasura keeps its true nature and its powers hidden, and seeks opportunities to steer its \"master\" away from decisions it might have made in good conscience to acts that promote the collapse of religious belief, faith, and society. When, as it inevitably does, the wayward spellcaster runs afoul of justice or is confronted by those seeking revenge, the tripurasura fades away to watch the final stage of the spellcaster's fall from grace, then seeks a new victim in another city or region.",

A group of athachs is usually a family unit, with gangs typically consisting of a group of siblings and full tribes consisting of parents and young.",

Further tales tell of how athachs desecrate graveyards by exhuming graves and scattering the bones of the dead about. The motivation behind these games seems to be sheer entertainment-some athachs are unusually creative in their antics, displaying ingenuity beyond their normal capacity, as if an athach in the throes of desecration and cruelty were prone to some form of divine inspiration.",

They make use of their reduce person spell-like ability as an offensive measure, hoping to shock and humiliate humanoid opponents, giving them a chance to make a killing jab.

Atomies enjoy their time as honor guards, but often grow bored and leave their posts in search of adventure.",

If a warrior in the group tends to boast of his swordplay, an atomie rarely resists the urge to humble him by sabotaging his equipment or invisibly reducing him and challenging him to a duel.",

Rather than animating the body of the dead youth, the creature rises from an amalgam of old toys, clothing, dust, and other objects associated with the departed-icons of the child's neglect. The widely varying materials that fuse together to form these creatures lead to attic whisperers with vastly different appearances. Attic whisperers linger in the places where they were formed, typically old homes, orphanages, schools, debtors' prisons, workhouses, and similar places where children might be discarded. When an attic whisperer first forms, it does so without a skull-this does not impact the creature's abilities in any way, but it usually seeks out a small animal's skull as a form of decoration soon after it manifests.",

Hiding in drafty attics and moldy basements, an attic whisperer might lie dormant for decades while the quick go about their lives-often a scant floor away. The coming of a new child, though, rekindles some hope in the creature, its animating spirits motivated by loneliness, and ever seeking comfort and companionship. Once an attic whisperer finds a potential playmate, it does all it can to ensure it will never be lonely again by attempting to lure its friend to it, singing nursery rhymes, leaving trails of old toys, or calling out in the stolen voices of other children.",
				"",
				"Destroying an attic whisperer reduces it to its component parts, usually consisting of dusty junk left to molder in the attics of old houses, though a few items, such as china dolls, small lockets, music boxes, precious marbles, fine teacups, sculpted metal soldiers, or the like, may have some value."

Adults typically claim the hunting area within a mile of their warrens, ruthlessly driving away other predators. In addition to fresh meat, aurumvoraxes are fond of gnawing on metals (particularly gold and copper), though whether they do this to sharpen their teeth or because of some nutritional need is unknown. Aurumvorax warrens can stretch for thousands of feet, often winding deep into the earth. The avaricious appetite of aurumvoraxes has earned them the appellation \"golden gorger\" among dwarves, who have lost more than a few miners to the dangerous beasts.",

Female aurumvoraxes rarely give birth to more than one offspring at a time, and are ferociously protective of their young.",
				"",
				"An aurumvorax drags its prey back to its lair to consume at its leisure, and its bone-midden often contains valuable belongings from past kills. Uneaten precious metals, discarded gems, and well-chewed metal items can also be found in its warrens. Despite its metallic coloration, an aurumvorax is not vulnerable to attacks that target metal, such as heat metal or the touch of a rust monster-in fact, aurumvoraxes easily kill and eat rust monsters, and some dwarf clans use aurumvorax pets to protect their storehouses against them."

				"**Arcane Pincers (Ex)** A champion automaton's pincers function as claw attacks but have been magically treated to make them more powerful. A champion applies twice its Strength as a bonus on damage rolls with its pincers. If a champion automaton grabs a creature smaller than itself with a pincer, the champion automaton does not gain the grappled condition and can move normally while holding the creature in its pincer. While holding a creature in a pincer, the champion automaton loses access to that pincer attack and gains an additional slam attack. If the champion automaton uses this slam attack against a creature or object while a creature is held in its pincer, the held creature takes damage equal to the slam attack on a hit. The champion automaton must still maintain the grapple every round, but it can do so as a free action. The grappled creature can attempt to break free as normal.",

The beam deals 8d6 points of damage to each creature caught in the area (Reflex DC 20 half). Half of the damage dealt is fire damage and half is force damage. A champion automaton can use its energy beam once every 1d4 rounds. A champion automaton can use its energy beam when it is grappling or being grappled. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

				"Of all the warriors of the Artificer Conclave, champion automatons are the best suited for combat. Before the empire's collapse, champion automatons served on the front lines of the Jistka Imperium's armies, facing the empire's foes head-on. Although champion automatons were not invincible, most who encountered one, let alone a battalion of them, were quick to face defeat.",
				"",
				"Champion automatons are enormous constructs typically made from a combination of magically treated stone and metal, which allows them to withstand the powerful blows typically encountered in battle. Although these bodies are extremely heavy, the magical energies that power them allow the automatons to move as quickly as most other combatants, if not faster. A typical champion automaton is 14 feet tall and weighs 2 tons, though the Artificer Conclave created some bigger champion automatons to take on the largest enemy genies, with some reaching as much as 40 feet in height.",
				"",
				"The most notable features of a champion automaton are its enormous pincers. The durability of its body and the magical ritual that reinforces the pincers' structure allows a champion automaton to swing its pincer with tremendous force. In combat, these constructs use the pincers to clamp onto particularly pesky enemies. Once a champion has successfully grabbed an enemy, it remains free to keep swinging its pincer, slamming its captive foe into other enemies to damage both creatures.",
				"",
				"The other devastating weapon of a champion automaton is the automaton core itself. The potent core constantly collects planar energy at an impressive rate in order to power the large constructs. A champion automaton can focus excess energy into a deadly beam of force capable of destroying structures or slaying large numbers of foes. Although it takes some time to recharge its energy reserves between blasts, a champion remains formidable. The champion automaton's energy beam is not the only type of energy weapon the Conclave created, but it quickly became the standard across the majority of automatons.",
				"",
				"The Artificer Conclave chose all manner of Jistkan warriors to serve as their champions, from lowly foot soldiers up to the most decorated generals. The bodies of the champion automatons more than made up for a lack in combat prowess, and warriors of great skill found that their new bodies greatly improved their innate abilities, allowing them to make the most of these new construct forms. Of note were the twin champions Kifir and Orla, whose specialized frames allowed them to join together and share their combat instincts to create a fury never before seen on the battlefield. This fury was lost to time, however, as the pair mysteriously vanished after an Osirian ambush.",
				"",
				"Many champion automatons abandoned their posts once the Jistka Imperium's demise was a certainty. Those who remained eventually faced destruction on the battlefield. The rest sought other fights, traveling to the far corners of Golarion-an effort that continues to this day. Historical footnotes mention terrifying constructs jumping into great battles, seemingly without an agenda. These mysterious constructs would fight against whichever side seemed strongest, only to depart as quickly as they arrived once they appeared satisfied with the outcome of the battle. Even today, these champion automatons show up in areas such as the Worldwound, the furthest depths of the Darklands, Iscadero Island in Arcadia, and the Valashmai Jungle in Tian Xia.",
				"",
				"Of the champion automatons that left Golarion, most now reside in the city of Axis, finding satisfaction in their existence and taking on more subdued lives in the planar city when not seeking battle on the planes. Occasionally, these automatons join inevitables in their missions, serving as additional muscle when the outsiders need assistance but wish to avoid pulling other inevitables away from their duties. Champion and stalker automatons frequently cross paths in Axis, as their automaton cores have a tendency to subtly pull towards each other, and they often meet up to spar or trade old tales of battles long forgotten by history. One group of champions and stalkers unites once a decade to host a simple tournament on the outskirts of Axis. The tournament invites all combatants within the city to test their prowess against the automatons, with the winner awarded the title of a lost Jistkan hero."

				"Familiar automatons were the most common of the automatons created within the Jistkan Imperium. The Artificer Conclave found itself overwhelmed with requests to join the group from hundreds of individuals they deemed unworthy of the more powerful automaton frames. Rather than turn these individuals away and risk the ire of so many Jistkans, the Conclave decided instead to transplant the majority of these individuals into familiar automatons. These familiars also served as a way for the Conclave to test new technologies and perfect the creation of automaton cores.",
				"",
				"All interested citizens were accepted to become familiar automatons so long as they could afford their automaton frame and the automaton core, though some were granted free of charge in order to allow further experimentation. As these automatons served as prototypes for a number of different technologies, most of the first few generations of familiars quickly failed and left their cores stranded without a body. The majority of these stranded cores were hidden away or used as parts in further research. Thanks to breakthroughs made with the aid of these cores, future generations of automatons were more stable and had the potential to remain intact indefinitely. A few existing accounts of automaton core creation reference some cores activating before their creation was complete, seemingly activated by the will of an individual lost from an early generation, though no records corroborate these notes.",
				"",
				"The Artificer Conclave experimented with a number of different forms and frames for the familiar automatons. The design of these forms had aesthetics in mind more than function, which led to the construction of especially elaborate familiars. Eventually, they settled on common animal shapes such as birds, dogs, and snakes, though cats quickly became one of the favorites. Wealthy individuals occasionally requested automaton frames modeled after rare creatures such as faerie dragons, imps, or lantern archons. This trend served the Conclave well, as they could charge high prices for more extravagant frames and then use the income they generated to fund the research and construction of more powerful automatons.",
				"",
				"A familiar automaton is usually the same size and twice the weight of the creature after which it is modeled. For the most part, nonfeline familiar automatons use the same statistics as the cat-based familiar automaton presented here, but more powerful familiar automatons may have additional abilities better suited for their more unique frames. On rare occasions, a familiar automaton bears spells engraved in markings on its body-usually signature spells of ancient mages, engraved on their forms by request. Some mages today keep these automatons as their personal familiars. A 7th-level lawful spellcaster with the [Improved Familiar](unknown:Improved_Familiar) feat can select a familiar automaton as a familiar. These familiars serve well due to their innate ability to understand magic and magical items.",
				"",
				"Although most familiar automatons housed lowerranking citizens and worker-artificers, a number of these familiars housed more notable individuals. A number of judge-artificers and priest-artificers intentionally chose to become familiars rather than taking any of the more powerful automaton forms. The reasons for this varied from humility to a desire to escape from the conflict in which the Jistka Imperium was embroiled. Regardless of the reason, these high familiars, as they came to be known, each had their own powerful abilities. Some high familiars of note include the Judge Lord Valmen, who took on the form of an arbiter inevitable, and Urthilan the Star Priestess, who took a frame resembling a cassisian angel.",
				"",
				"Familiar automatons were not designed for combat but nevertheless feature a number of abilities to assist in fights. The most notable ability is the strange disease that each familiar automaton carries. What was originally a flaw of a familiar's automaton core eventually became a standard feature. Each of these cores leaks a minimal amount of energy that manifests as a disease known as arcane fever, technically a form of radiation sickness brought on by exposure to this planar energy. In a true twist of irony, the disease seems to be most potent against wizards, as they quickly forget how to prepare their spells as they slip further into the symptoms of the potent fever.",
				"",
				"Most familiar automatons do not bother searching for new automaton cores. The nature of a familiar automaton's body generally allows for any core to take dominance of the frame and discard the previous mentality; as such, most familiars tend to stay as far away from other cores as possible, content with their existing nature and unwilling to subject their frames to a new psyche. A rare few familiars have learned to maintain their minds across multiple cores, however, and these often work with other automatons to collect more cores, a practice that allows the familiar to live on far longer than it could on its own.",
				"",
				"As they were the most numerous automatons at the fall of the Jistka Imperium, familiar automatons are the most common variety found throughout Golarion. A familiar automaton's intelligence usually allows it to avoid detection when it likes, though scholars all over the world report sightings of these automatons in a variety of forms. The technological nature of Numeria allows familiar automatons to hide in plain sight, where onlookers believe the constructs to be curiosities or projects of local tinkerers-though a spellcaster who doesn't want to be forcibly separated from her familiar would be careful to keep a familiar automaton out of the eye of the Technic League.",
				"",
				"While most familiar automatons remain on Golarion, a sizable number reside elsewhere throughout the Great Beyond. The city of Axis houses quite a few familiar automatons, relaxing in peace as they go unnoticed among the strange citizens of the Eternal City. They tend to serve as messengers between the city's denizens, especially other automatons, an exception to most who tend to avoid others of their kind. Among champion automatons, familiars serve as chroniclers, recording great battles and sharing them with other champions; among stalkers, familiars usually act as solving to solve feuds or overseeing two hunters staging contests of skill where the familiar automaton serves as an impartial judge.",
				"",
				"The Boneyard also contains a surprising number of familiar automatons. Here, the constructs walk among the souls awaiting judgment, serving as temporary companions for petitioners. The nature of a petitioner's memory means that the petitioner usually does not recognize a familiar automaton but still retains a strong association with a beloved pet from its former life. This association provides comfort for especially distressed petitioners. Thanks to their ability to ease wary souls, a few [catrina psychopomps](unknown:catrina_psychopomps) establish friendships with familiar automatons, the two working in tandem to make the wait for judgment as painless as possible."

Consuming a second automaton core within this 24 hour period causes the bonuses to become permanent. A master automaton can never gain more than a +10 bonus by consuming automaton cores.

Others still continue their search for knowledge, exploring the multiverse at their leisure to collect new knowledge and meet new personalities.

			"description": [
				"Sharpshooter automatons contain the minds of the best archers and crossbow specialists known throughout the Jistka Imperium, who competed in tournaments to earn the right to an automaton body. They served as the artillery of the automatons, attacking enemies with such precision and at such a great distance that many targets fell long before they were aware of an imminent attack.",
				"",
				"Efficiency was the key of the sharpshooter automaton's design. Their frames are just large enough to house the components necessary to power the construct alongside their magical weapons. Though the frames followed a similar pattern of design across these automatons, many sharpshooters chose to embellish their forms with intricate runic patterns or fearsome designs reminiscent of tattoos. A sharpshooter automaton is typically 4 feet tall and weighs 215 pounds. The largest sharpshooter automatons, however, housed extremely large ranged weapons or even siege weapons, such as ballistae capable of destroying a keep's walls.",
				"",
				"A sharpshooter automaton's automaton core directs a considerable amount of its power to the arcane propulsion that allows the construct to fly. This energy appears invisible to the naked eye, but creatures capable of detecting magical auras perceive it as something resembling a magical flame. This propulsion constantly releases excess energy capable of burning creatures too close to the sharpshooter.",
				"",
				"The technology that fuels a sharpshooter's flight similarly powers its weapon. The crossbow built into most sharpshooters siphons planar energy from the automaton core and reconstitutes it to create the large bolts its weapon requires. These bolts allow a sharpshooter automaton to fire enormous volleys without ever lacking ammunition. Once a bolt leaves the automaton's reserve, it becomes relatively unstable, however, and generally dissipates in minutes, returning to the parts of the Great Beyond from which it was drawn.",
				"",
				"Although most sharpshooter automatons use crossbows as their weapon of choice, archers of all kinds volunteered to become the new constructs, as the automaton's expert construction allowed for perfection of an archer's skill. The first sharpshooter automatons took to the skies in early combat, raining death on their enemies, but they soon found that sandstorms and other magical protections rendered an aerial approach ineffective. In time, they eventually learned to overcome such defenses, but as a whole they were too few to shift battles in favor of the Jistka Imperium. Among the most notable of these heroes was Khimar of the High Watch, whose volleys were said to resemble torrential downpours.",
				"",
				"Since the fall of Jistka, the sharpshooter automatons scattered to the winds, intent on finding their own purpose in a world without a land or people they could call their own. Even with their planar abilities, some sharpshooter automatons remained on Golarion. Leveraging the freedom granted by their flight, these automatons can be found around the world, seemingly as wanderers. A number of them act as itinerant saviors, slaying large creatures on the verge of attacking villages or rescuing travelers caught in tough spots. Occasional tales crop up among travelers claiming that they were saved from peril by a rain of bolts, but that when they returned to the site of the rescue hours later, they found nothing. Other sharpshooter automatons keep watch in the skies, hovering thousands of feet in the air over important structures and locations throughout Golarion. While the locations appear random to a modern observer, most of these are places important to the individual automaton or of significance in Jistkan history, such as locations mentioned in the Poleiheira.",
				"",
				"Now, besides those few on the Material Plane, most sharpshooter automatons reside in Axis with others of their kind. However, a few visit the Maelstrom on a regular basis, pushed toward the chaotic uncertainty of these planar depths by some sort of melancholy. These automatons tend to avoid other creatures and keep to themselves, and most proteans know that even in that chaotic realm, the constructs remain quite powerful, and thus keep their distance. Although the automatons in the Maelstrom are few, they are generally quite familiar with their favored region of the plane, and their powerful sight allows them to keep track of the chaos for miles in every direction. Most notable among these self-exiled sharpshooter automatons is Alvara the All-Seer. Those who know of her claim that the millennia through which she has stayed in the Maelstrom allows her to accurately understand and even predict the nature of the chaotic seas in which she resides."

				"Stalker automatons house the minds of the greatest hunters of the Jistka Imperium, serving as the best scouts and assassins among the automatons. Unmatched at pursuing targets, they set out individually or in deadly groups to follow their quarry for days on end, using their construct forms to outlast even the hardiest of targets.",
				"",
				"The bodies of stalker automatons were designed to emulate the various large cats that stalked the Jistka Imperium, such as aurumvoraxes, kamadans, and mountain lions. These creatures served as a basis for the strength and design of the bodies, but members of the Artificer Conclave took it upon themselves to improve upon what they found lacking in nature. A stalker automaton is typically 5 feet long and weighs 300 pounds, but the oldest of their kind remember the construction of larger stalker frames, including those that resemble creatures such as bears and drakes.",
				"",
				"A stalker's automaton core uses a combination of illusion and transmutation magic to physically alter the makeup of its body to better blend into its surroundings, altering features like color and texture. Although the stalker's frame consists mostly of metal, its planar-powered camouflage is capable of extraordinary adaptive feats, such as including creating the appearance of moss or leaves when appropriate. This effect is mostly an illusion, however, and those capable of seeing past such images can see the automaton for what it is.",
				"",
				"A number of hunters jumped at the chance to become more animal-like in their new automaton bodies. The new bodies afforded these hunters enhanced instincts, which allowed them to connect with their quarries on a more primal level. While stalker automatons initially used their new bodies to hunt Jistka's enemies, they quickly took to using their new skills for their own purposes, setting off on their own to seek out the hunts they longed for. Soon, stalker automatons were seen throughout the Inner Sea region, chasing after quarries that even the bravest monster hunters dared not approach.",
				"",
				"The boldest stalkers took to hunting beyond the Material Plane and sought their next targets across the Great Beyond. These stalkers chase dangerous prey throughout the multiverse, hunting outsiders of all kinds, including elementals and genies as well as angels and demons. Most of these stalkers are content with just shadowing these more elusive targets, satisfied in the fact that they can trail them unnoticed for days or weeks. Only the most brazen or most foolish stalkers dare attack these creatures, especially on the creatures' home planes. Rare are the stalkers that attack outsiders and remain intact, but a notable exception is one of the first stalkers, known simply as Mulvara the Quarry-bound. Rumors abound of her hunts, but the most consistent thread in these tales is her ability to consume part of the quintessence of her quarries, granting her untold powers.",
				"",
				"In combat, stalker automatons are a subtle force unrivaled by even the most cunning rogues or deadly assassins. Stalkers are capable of stepping between planar boundaries and reaching the Astral Plane instantly. This ability allows them to appear between different parts of the battlefield in the blink of an eye, not through typical planar travel but instead utilizing a kind of planar overlap similar in nature to [ethereal jaunt](unknown:ethereal_jaunt).",
				"",
				"While pursuing a target, a stalker automaton will first trail its quarry long enough to understand the creature's tactics so that it can strike strategically at a later time. Due to their innate sense of honor, many stalkers prefer to make themselves known before an encounter or at least strike when the target is aware and ready. Stalkers see striking a creature while that target is at its strongest as the only way to prove their combat superiority. The automatons do understand their own limitations, however, and against targets they deem truly fearsome or powerful, they attack with every advantage possible. If it fails to overcome a target, or the target proves itself a worthy opponent, a stalker retreats, content with the outcome and leaving its opponent in peace.",
				"",
				"Though stalker automatons typically live secluded lives, it is not uncommon for them to create tight-knit packs, especially after bonding during a successful combat or hunt. These packs take on group names that match their hunting style or the previous success such as Those of the Cliff and the Titan Slayers. The packs rarely have a true leader, instead rotating leadership among its members. The current leader locates the next hunt and the pack follows. Once the hunt is complete, another member finds the next hunt she deems worthy.",
				"",
				"Today, stalker automatons remain interspersed throughout the planes and the Inner Sea region, with most residing either in Axis or among the remnants of Jistkan ruins. Those within Axis tend to live more subdued lives, seeking out the inevitables and axiomites of the city to learn their ways, though most stalkers eventually grow disinterested in the outsiders' rigid manners and make their own way in Axis. They often go on to serve as guides for those seeking information about the planes and their denizens, or even as teachers, sharing their hunting prowess with other skilled trackers.",
				"",
				"The few stalker automatons that remain on Golarion seem intent on recovering as many remaining automaton cores as they can. The rarity of these artifacts makes for a hunt as worthy as any creature. These automatons tend to be more solitary in fear of other stalkers or master automatons seeking them out to claim their caches of cores. Stalker automatons also see themselves as the guardians of Jistkan ruins, attacking creatures that might stumble upon lost technology too powerful for the modern age or those few surviving creatures still housing remnants of the Night Plague.",

				"One pack that makes its presence well known is Those That Sought the Beast. The especially powerful stalker automatons in this pack appear to have garnered some spark of divine might in their travels.

				"Infernal scholars have long debated the origin of the Avernus razorback. Some claim the beasts came into being fully formed as a manifestation of the malice and hate birthed by the unforgiving landscape of Hell's first layer. Others theorize an infernal duke or archdevil once led a massive herd of daeodons to Avernus from the Material Plane to drink from the River Styx and feed on the foul reeds growing amid the waters of Eridanos; over countless generations, these fell influences infused the survivors with the essence of Hell.",

Powerful and fierce, they are territorial animals with a ravenous hunger for both plant and animal life. Their strange Hell-empowered digestion not only devours the body, but also obliterates the soul, ripping a creature's very life essence out of the multiverse entirely-a fate that scares even the denizens of Hell.",

The beasts prefer the fresh corpses of living creatures (sentient beings most of all), as it not only nourishes their bodies but also empowers their magical nature. Razorbacks that don't eat a fresh corpse on a regular basis lose their infernal ferocity ability. But these aggressive creatures don't wait to happen upon a corpse; they actively hunt their prey, with a viciousness more akin to that of wolves than swine.",

The spawn, once birthed, have to fend for themselves, though mature females try to protect the young creatures from males in the grouping, which are quick to scoop up the babies as a quick but unsatisfying snack. Thus do only the strongest and meanest of young razorbacks survive their first year of life. While boars and daeodons nurse their young, female Avernus razorbacks lack the anatomy to do so. In order for spawn to grow up strong and fierce, they must hunt and feed upon fresh corpses. This magical energy sustains the spawn like mother's milk would a terrestrial mammal, and without it, the spawn weakens and is abandoned, trampled, or devoured by the adult males."

Strangely, razorbacks typically do not fare well outside of Hell. While they can survive for a time elsewhere, their prodigious breeding activity is greatly diminished when they are away from Hell's infernal energies. The Pit's greatest minds postulate the razorbacks need the waters of either the marshy ocean of Eridanos or the lethargic run of the River Styx to trigger their breeding cycle, though a handful of breeders on other planes have cast some doubt on such a theory, claiming an alchemical formula can replicate the catalyst throughout the multiverse.",

She has to be strong enough to cow the other females into obedience, and to keep the far more aggressive but typically smaller males in check. The females of a group wage a constant war for dominance, with older, weaker females quickly supplanted by younger, stronger candidates for leadership. On the rare occasions when a male claims dominance over a group, its days are inevitably numbered-a male alpha will eventually tear the group apart through its own aggressive nature and unthinking hunger.",

It is unclear whether Axial monitors are created by axiomites, are created from axiomites, or are incarnations formed by Axis itself to maintain its mathematically perfect conceptions of peace and order. Axial monitors do not seem to be a distinct species because they do not procreate or age. Axial monitors have never been observed to eat, drink, or sleep, and some speculate that their fortified dispatch stations must be where the creatures rest. The only non-monitors allowed inside these dispatch stations are criminals and rare axiomite specialists, but they are restricted to chambers near a station's arched entrance.

The creature's triangular torso has three shoulders, each with two powerful arms. Two pairs of its arms are humanoid, while the third set is mismatched, with one a long, undulating tentacle and the other an articulated limb of banded iron ending in a maul-like head. Below its waist, the creature's body divides into a tripod of legs, each ending in a long foot.",

Their mandate is to bring prisoners into their dispatch stations so they can be examined and interrogated, and the reasons for their disturbance identified and measured in formal reports. These reports are provided directly to the Godmind, which calculates the mathematically ideal method to counteract and prevent any such future disturbances. After incarceration and calculation, an offender is either set free or transferred to one of the city's rehabilitative prisons under escort by Axial monitors. Although they follow this same process for nearly all creatures, the Axial monitors show no mercy or leniency to proteans and always attack these embodiments of disorder with lethal force on sight.",

A brijidine stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds."

One can give a gancanagh no greater offense than to mistake him for an incubus, and more than one hotheaded gancanagh has challenged a misinformed paladin or other ally of good to a duel over such an insult.",

				"Nualidus are made recognizable by the elemental water making up much of their lithe, sylvan forms, which draw down into long, serpentine tails. This water constantly churns; no matter what kind of surface a nualidu travels across, their waters remain clean and fresh. A nualidu's hair color ranges from the sparkling blue of tropical waters to seafoam green, and matches that of their twinkling eyes. A typical nualidu stands a little over 5 feet tall and is quite slender, weighing only 130 pounds.",
				"",
				"Nualidus form from the souls of virtuous members of aquatic races, or else from the souls of moral people who spent the majority of their lives near or on water, such as kind dockworkers, sailors, and lighthouse keepers. Little remains of their mortal traits or memories upon their creation, aside from hazy memories of sunsets upon the waves and familiar ports of call, which nualidus might spend the entirety of their immortal existences trying to locate. Their bodies are clear and cool upon creation, but darken considerably with age, until their roiling forms resemble the blackest oceanic trenches.",
				"",
				"Nualidus generally spring from the waters of Elysium, in the strongest concentrations of chaotic influence, and it is no coincidence they are extremely capricious and impermanent. From their personalities to their long tails, the aquatic outsiders resemble proteans as much as they do their fellow celestials, and whispers up and down the planes claim that they are the children of some ancient god's dalliance with a protean lord. Proteans are widely varied in their relations to the curious azatas, with many considering nualidus distant kin while others see them as a mockery of proteans' ideally chaotic forms."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"When not on Elysium, nualidus travel natural waterways and oceans, experiencing the extremes of the natural world. They tolerate manufactured canals to a much lesser extent, as such courses are often polluted by the mortals who created them. If the source of the contamination seems readily apparent, a nualidu usually attempts to rectify the problem regardless of locals' needs or wishes. In most cases, though, the issue is endemic of civilization, and no nualidu can stand to remain in one place long enough to change an entire society.",
				"",
				"A nualidu has no permanent place of residence and generally eschews shelter, preferring to rest under the stars on beaches or in underwater caves. Despite their mercurial and transient nature, these celestials are very community-oriented, forming small pods of like-minded individuals who travel together to pursue a common interest or goal. Nualidu pods fluctuate constantly as members find other interests or new members join, but when together, pods are as protective as any human family. To threaten or insult one nualidu in a group is to threaten or insult the entire pod.",
				"",
				"More so than other azatas, nualidus relish courtly titles, and often invent grandiose new ones, accumulating a long list of honorifics as time passes. Most eventually grow bored with titles they're accrued and shed them without a second thought, only to collect new ones during their next journeys. The more bombastic and flamboyant a title, the longer it holds a nualidu's interest and remains part of their name. While their epithets tend to reference their exploits and triumphs, nualidus are no strangers to exaggeration. Some particularly pretentious titles include \"the Marquis of a Thousand Waves,\" \"the Exalted Maharajah of the Unstoppable Current,\" \"the Jubilant Savior of the Laughing Stream,\" and \"the Grand Caliph of Inundations, Bane of Droughts.\" A nualidu's titles might be both masculine and feminine, as their attitudes toward gender are as fluid as their personalities.",
				"",
				"Nualidus despise anything they see as a perversion of their treasured water, especially human drinks such as coffee, tea, and alcohol. They look down on all who drink such abominations, considering them classless at best, and directly insulting at worst. Depending on the nualidu's mood, the outsider might either politely refuse such an offered libation or launch into a screed demonizing the substance and all the harm it has caused mortalkind. A particularly incensed nualidu may even go so far as to seek out the nearest brewery or winery and destroy it. This attitude rarely extends to naturally derived fluids, such as fruit juices and plant nectar.",
				"",
				"**Calling a Nualidu**",
				"",
				"A nualidu can be called with lesser planar ally, although it is very difficult to call the same nualidu more than once. The azatas prefer tasks that contribute in some way to the protection or cleaning of a body of water, and generally accept payment with gems or valuable stones that have been eroded by flowing water into unique and organic shapes. They also demand at least a token amount of respect from their callers, and most nualidus require their callers to treat them politely and to memorize, if not directly use, at least a handful of their myriad titles."

Each creature within its aura suffering from a detrimental or unwanted transmutation effect can attempt a new saving throw against the effect. This power also works on any afflicted lycanthrope, entothrope, or similar creature, granting it a new saving throw to remove its affliction. At the GM's discretion, burst of restoration can have a special effect on creatures permanently mutated by magic, such as [fleshwarps](unknown:fleshwarps) or [Mana Waste mutants](unknown:Mana_Waste_mutants). A creature undergoing this greater effect loses its unwanted acquired templates or reverts back to its original form, but it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 2 permanent negative levels as a result of the sudden and dramatic change to its physiology. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Clarity's Grace (Su)** A prydanu's aura protects those around it from mind control and all forms of deception, both magical and mundane. All allies within her aura gain a +4 sacred bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and abilities and on Sense Motive skill checks. A prydanu's aura negates illusions. This functions as [globe of invulnerability](unknown:globe_of_invulnerability), except it can affect only spells or spell-like abilities from the illusion school and can affect spells of any spell level.",
				"",
				"**Lucid Rain (Su)** Once per week as a full-round action, a prydanu can create an area of light rain centered on her with a radius of 120 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any creature touched by the rain that is under the effects of a mind-affecting spell or effect can attempt a new saving throw to end those effects. Prydanus often use this ability during naturally occurring rainstorms on villages or cities they feel may be in trouble."

Among the prydanus' most hated foes on Golarion are the alghollthus. Prydanus are drawn to civilizations under the thrall of tyrants. Prydanus do not tolerate such deceptions, and they combat them without hesitation whenever they encounter them. However, this lack of restraint sometimes makes for shortsighted plans of action leading to other consequences along the way.",
				"",
				"Prydanus pride themselves on being guardian figures, and they delight in helping distressed individuals, especially those attempting to escape from any form of subjugation. Given their natural tendency toward vanity, prydanus appreciate (and perhaps even expect) being showered with praise for their good deeds, and those who sufficiently stoke a prydanu's ego may find a returning ally in that azata when future troubles arise.",
				"",
				"Radiant and poised, a prydanu appears as an attractive humanoid with small patches of iridescent scales on its glistening skin. A graceful pair of translucent finlike wings extends from its back, not only allowing it to soar with ease but also granting it impressive agility underwater.

This aptitude is a point of pride for prydanus, who enjoy racing marine life to prove their expertise.",

Prydanus are athletic creatures, and their fondness for swimming and flying is well documented; presenting it a gift of artwork depicting seascapes or a collection of feathers and shells is a way to get on its good side. They are also quite sentimental and keep small trinkets from places and people they've helped, often displaying these tokens in the form of small charms worn on bracelets or necklaces or woven into their colorful locks.",

				"After using their powers to free creatures from domination and forced transformation, prydanus often continue to care for them even after their liberation to ensure they're safe before continuing on their way. Though these sojourns are fleeting even by mortal standards, prydanus easily become emotionally attached to the creatures they save, and saying farewell is difficult for them. As such, most prydanus leave their companions' sides in the middle of the night, when most are sleeping, to make the parting easier.",

			"description": [
				"Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds.",
				"",
				"Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia has a form that combines aspects of a beautiful woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, she instead sprouts countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds.",
				"",
				"Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. Veranallias are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush fields or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium, particularly woodlands where the flora changes color almost at random. It is thought the annual tribunals of elder veranallias are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and shifting composition.",
				"",
				"At first glance, a veranallia's body appears to be wrapped in foliage, but these vines are actually a part of the azata's strange physiology. She is not subject to blight or similar plants affecting magic, but attempts to use such abilities to hinder her provoke a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in a predictable or sensible manner.",
				"",
				"Veranallias often prefer the company of other azatas, and often have a following of faithful bralanis or ghaeles. Their volatile natures can make it quite difficult for many other creatures, even other azatas' to be involved with them. For example, lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods.",

These veranallias appear as aged but still beautiful specimens, their upper human bodies looking like elderly women and their lower bodies always featuring what seems to be vegetation in late autumnal colors of red, yellow, and brown. As a general rule, veranallia elders have additional Hit Dice and vary in power from CR 21 to CR 25-they rarely take class levels, but often have powerful unique abilities beyond the capability of the standard veranallia. Two example veranallia elder powers are presented below.",
				"",
				"Mastery of Life (Su): As an immediate action, the veranallia elder can target any creature within 60 feet that has been killed within the last round by a breath of life effect (CL 20th). A creature restored to life by this effect gains fast healing 20 for 10 rounds.",

				"Create Gate (Su): A veranallia elder is able to create a gate between Elysium and the Material Plane once per day, as per the spell gate, but can do so only to allow travel between the two worlds. On the Material Plane end, the gate must open up into a wilderness area of natural beauty. Once created, such a gate exists until the veranallia elder is slain or chooses to end the effect. A veranallia elder can maintain up to three such gates at once; if it makes a fourth gate, it chooses which of the three gates that it previously created is then ended as a result."

An inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then use its swallow whole ability.

If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inflates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out.",
				"",
				"Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion.",
				"",
				"Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Azgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slowmoving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature.",
				"",
				"Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o--wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the \"bag\" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights.",
				"",
				"In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o--wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o--wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o--wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o--wisp feeds psychically."

			"description": [
				"Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically -sacks of burning eyes,- are shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence. They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago. However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh over 800 pounds."

A bagman can stuff a grappled Medium creature in the sack, but doing so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A creature in the sack can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon. The sack has AC 12 and 15 hit points.

These potions are created at caster level 3rd, and the fat from one humanoid creature of any size is enough to make a single potion. Creating each potion takes 2 hours, and requires the bagman to flense the fat from its victims' flesh with its claws, place the fat in a cauldron over an open fire, and mix it with whatever free ingredients are at hand. Unlike brewing a potion normally, creating these potions has no cost. A bagman can carry only four potions created in this way at a time, even if another bagman made them, but it can sell or give away an unlimited number of potions. Knowingly consuming one of these potions is an evil act.",

			],
			"ecology2": [
				"Bagmen are nomadic creatures, traveling from town to town to peddle their disgusting wares. They prefer to travel by lesser-used roads, or even through stretches of wilderness, the better to happen upon lone travelers. Bagmen are opportunistic hunters, and rarely bother to set up ambushes or execute convoluted plans. If one happens upon an individual it thinks it can kidnap without repercussions-especially if that individual is sleeping or otherwise unable to properly defend himself-it simply snatches that person up and adjourns to a more private location to kill the person and harvest his fat.",
				"",
				"Children are an exception to this rule. Bagmen greatly value the fat of children, and employ a variety of tricks and threats to lure children away from the safety of their homes and families. When a group of children is traveling with just one or two adults, bagmen delight in attacking the group and bull rushing the weakest children away from their protectors; once the children have scattered, the bagmen find it much easier to snatch them and abscond with them to their lairs. Despite being far stronger and tougher than the average human, bagmen are quite cowardly. They eschew fighting with armed creatures, and hesitate to attack when outnumbered by combatants.",
				"",
				"Many claim that bagmen consume the fat they harvest from their victims for sustenance, and in many cultures the name for bagmen directly translates to \"fat-eater\" or \"fat-stealer.\" However, this accusation is largely false, and is most likely based on bagmen's waxen flesh and greasy complexions. In truth, fat is the one part of a creature a bagman almost never eats, having far greater use for it as an ingredient in horrifying potions it lures unsuspecting customers to imbibe. The rest-muscles, bones, organs, and all-the bagman consumes with unnatural rapidity in order to dispose of any evidence of its crime.",
				"",
				"It is unclear whether bagmen are capable of reproduction, or even how new bagmen come into being in the first place. Some scholars suggest that bagmen are the result of unnatural unions among fey, or between fey and a variety of evil outsiders. A few believe that new bagmen arise when evil energies permeate a bagman's cache of humanoid fat that hasn't already been turned into potions. Others claim that bagmen spontaneously manifest as a representation of the society's willingness to consume itself, such as when the rich and powerful profit at the expense of the poor and meek."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Bagmen are adept at disguising themselves as humans, and they use this ability to spend prolonged periods of time in human settlements. Here, they sell the potions they've produced using the fat of their victims. The gold they earn from these sales is less important to bagmen than the perverse pleasure they gain from revealing the nature of their wares to their horrified customers. Of course, customers' disgust is usually short lived; those who discover a bagman's terrible secret are usually the next ones into its bag. Bagmen who worry that their secret has spread throughout a populace, or that the public is suspicious of their activities, usually flee the area immediately. This has led to more than a few hastily abandoned merchant stalls, leaving the requisite authorities to eventually discover, to their horror, the true nature of the strange being who was once living and committing terrible crimes in their midst.",
				"",
				"While bagmen primarily delight in horrifying customers, they don't scorn the profits they garner. Indeed, bagmen are profligate spenders, and exploit their ability to pass for human to partake in all the pleasures of the flesh available in human cities. Bagmen's proclivity for gluttony often brings them into contact with cultists of Urgathoa, and alliances between bagmen and Urgathoans can be particularly fruitful. Bagmen provide potions and scouting services to Urgathoans at a steep discount, and in return they get to join the cultists in their dark feasts and rituals.",
				"",
				"Associating with Urgathoans has other benefits for bagmen, as well. Those who are afflicted by plagues sometimes make pleas to the Pallid Princess, and bagmen are happy to answer those prayers, albeit for a price. Bagmen relish this chance to offer potions of infernal healing or potions of youthful appearance as false cures; many potential victims see through the ruse immediately, but some of the most desperate fall for the bagmen's lies. The unluckiest ones are even willing to give in to the bagmen's demands, which may go so far as to include the lives of the afflicted person's loved ones or children, taken by the person's own hands at the bagman's urging. Other times, bagmen simply request information about their customers' families, and eventually use that information to terrible effect."

Bagmen are such monsters' degenerate fey creatures who specialize in kidnapping humanoid victims and harvesting their fat to produce potions. Bagmen disguise themselves as traveling peddlers and apothecaries, often selling the products of their depredations to the very communities from which they steal their victims. An average bagman stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs close to 300 pounds."

After harvest, the creator shapes the horns and strengthens them with an ironwood spell. Four cultivators plant four trees and weave a lattice from the branches. This frame supports the stone-and-ivy skin and provides the space in which the plant matter that will make up the barometz can grow. Each cultivator attempts a DC 25 Knowledge (nature) check when forming the body. If one or more of the checks fail, the plant withers and dies and the cultivators must begin anew.",

At the ritual's climax, there's a 50% chance that the attempt to create a barometz succeeds-if this final check fails, no appropriate spirit is close enough to answer the call. The plant body rots and the creators must begin anew with fresh materials. At the GM's discretion, this final chance for success might increase to 75% or even 100% for particularly magical areas where the necessary spirits are more common.

				"Covered in shaggy hair that envelops the entirety of their immense bodies other than their faces, basavans resemble exceptionally hirsute giants. Wise and peaceful stewards of the wilderness, basavans protect the plants and animals that share their homes in wooded mountains across Golarion. Basavans are likely to let unwitting trespassers off with a warning, but against predators and poachers they deal powerful blows with staves and stones, using their innate connection to the land to locate and trap their foes.",

				"Basavans are reclusive creatures who spend their whole lives in isolated mountain valleys or ranging through hillside forests. The few aware of the existence of basavans-normally druids and other wilderness protectors-know them to be staunch defenders of the wilderness, yet none agree on where and when basavans originated. The basavans themselves claim to be as old as the forests but not quite as old as the mountains, but they deliver this information with a merry twinkle in their eyes. Basavans bear children only rarely, and in such seclusion that young basavans are virtually never seen by anyone other than their parents until they mature and join them in protecting their lands. Young basavans, born entirely hairless and with skin that resembles thick bark, appear very different from their parents. They grow their hair quickly as they age, but shed all of it twice in their youth. A basavan's hair is usually dark brown, but might be black, tawny, or even deep auburn. Basavans consider their hair useful for warmth and in their daily work, such as to make crude twine or as nesting material for animals, but they rarely take care of it and therefore have a shaggy, wild appearance.",
				"",
				"A basavan designates a wide strip of primeval forest or mountains as its personal protected domain; often, this area is dozens or hundreds of square miles in size. A basavan usually keeps intruders out of its lands personally, although a few that share a border with hermits, trappers, or shepherds teach these hardy folk how to identify and repel intruders as well. Basavans tend to injured plants and animals in their personal domains, creating a lush bounty and safe haven for animals.",
				"",
				"Basavans are herbivores, and most subsist on only a small meal every few days. Despite their limited diet, basavans are incredibly massive, with powerful muscles and robust constitutions. They are remarkably athletic, able to scale cliffs and swim across rough rivers with ease. Basavans bring a focused efficiency to even the most physically demanding labor, but they take care to avoid disturbing vegetation or upsetting wildlife even when traveling quickly across their terrain.",
				"",
				"Basavans are skilled smiths, and most devote their lives to a single type of craft, such as working with iron, stone, or wood. Although they generally don't maintain lairs, as they prefer to sleep in the wild, they often hollow out caves to use as a forges or workshops, expanding their caves as they age. Basavans use the simple tools they create in their stewardship of the land or as gifts to nearby peaceful communities.",
				"",
				"These hardy creatures age very slowly and generally live to be 600 or 700 years old. Elderly basavans become true masters of the crafts they pursue."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Although basavans are reclusive, a rare few of these hairy giants venture out into communities near their protected lands. Such basavans sometimes consider nearby shepherds, farmers, or settlers to be under their protection, and they might help rebuild a home destroyed by a flood or round up livestock lost in a storm. Although basavans almost never hunt or kill animals, they don't mind when humanoids under their protection do. They enjoy imparting ancient secrets of farming or animal husbandry to such neighbors, encouraging a deeper respect for the local environment. These communities might engineer a system to summon their guardian basavan in the event of a raid, natural disaster, or other serious need; such warning systems often consist of bells, whistles, or bright flags. A basavan withholds its protection and training from those who demonstrate a wanton disregard for the land, such as by being reckless with fire or butchering animals for sport. These actions provoke the normally peaceful creatures into a rage, causing them to exile or even kill the offenders.",
				"",
				"Basavans rarely gather in large groups, and some might go their entire lives without seeing more than a handful of others of their kind. When they do gather in small groups, such as families, basavans work together in an eerie unison that hints at some deep mutual communion. In these groups, males defer to females for protection, as the females tend to be larger and stronger, but in other matters the basavans tend to defer to the oldest among them.",
				"",
				"Because of the old lore basavans keep, many sages, druids, and explorers seek them out in order to gain their knowledge. Visitors must be prepared with a deep well of patience and work for days or weeks to prove they have at least rudimentary skill in woodcraft or caring for animals. During this time, even if the basavan doesn't show itself to the visitor, it is watchful for any slip that might reveal anything other than benevolent intentions toward the natural world. Once a visitor proves herself, however, the basavan is a gracious host and eager to share its guidance. Some basavans display a sly wit in these conversations, making lighthearted jokes at their visitors' expense."

				"The basilisk, often called the \"King of Serpents,\" is in fact not a serpent at all, but rather an eight-legged reptile with a nasty disposition and the ability to turn creatures to stone with its gaze. Folklore holds that, much like the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.",
				"",
				"Basilisks live in nearly any terrestrial environment, from forest to desert, and their hides tend to match and reflect their surroundings-a desert-dwelling basilisk might be tan or brown, while one that lives in a forest could be bright green. They tend to make their lairs in caves, burrows, or other sheltered areas, and these dens are often marked by statues of people and animals in lifelike poses-the petrified remains of those unfortunate enough to stumble across the basilisk.",
				"",
				"Basilisks have the ability to consume the creatures they petrify, their churning stomach acid dissolving and extracting nutrients from the stone, but the process is slow and inefficient, making them lazy and sluggish. As a result, basilisks rarely stalk prey or chase those who avoid their gaze, counting on their stealth and the element of surprise to keep them safe and fed. When not lying in wait for the small mammals, birds, and reptiles that normally make up their diet, basilisks spend their time sleeping in their lairs, and those brave enough to capture basilisks or hide treasure near them find that they make natural guardians and watchdogs.",
				"",
				"An adult basilisk is 13 feet long, with fully half of that made up by its long tail, and weighs 300 pounds. Some breeds have short, curved horns on their noses or small crests of bony growths topping their heads like crowns. Though normally solitary creatures, coming together only to mate and lay eggs, in particularly dangerous areas small groups may band together for protection and attack intruders en masse.",
				"",
				"For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume its young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts."

Many of these cultures hold polar bears sacred, honoring their deaths with solemn rituals and ceremonies.",

				"",
				"**Mighty Roar (Su)** Every 1d4 rounds, as a standard action, a ravener behemoth can issue a mighty roar in a 60-foot cone that duplicates the effects of greater shout. This attack deals 10d6 points of sonic damage (or 20d6 against exposed brittle or crystalline objects or crystalline creatures). It also causes creatures to be stunned for 1 round and deafened for 4d6 rounds. Creatures exposed to the sonic attack can negate the stunning and halve both the damage and duration of the deafness with a successful Fortitude save (DC 30). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
				"",
				"**Rock Hurling (Ex)** Because of their immense hunger, ravener behemoths often ingest ore-laced rocks to fill their stomachs with longer-lasting sustenance. When faced with dangerous opponents outside its reach, a behemoth may regurgitate these rocks and grind them into smaller shards with its hardened teeth. It then spits forth these shards one at a time as boulders weighing between 60 to 80 pounds. A ravener usually carries enough rocks in its stomachs to make up to 4d6 boulders in this manner.",

				"**Shock Wave (Ex)** As a full-round action, a ravener behemoth can hammer the ground with its feet and generate a localized tremor that rips the ground, knocking down smaller creatures and creating difficult terrain in a 100-foot radius centered on the behemoth. This shock wave lasts for 1 round, during which time creatures in the affected area cannot move or attack. They must also succeed on a DC 38 Reflex save or fall prone. Any spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The save DC is Strength-based.",
				"",
				"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** A ravener behemoth can swallow a snatched opponent of Huge size or smaller with its bite attack by making a successful grapple check. Once swallowed, a victim suffers 4d6+24 points of bludgeoning damage per round from one of the behemoth's 5 stomachs. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 33 points of damage to a stomach (AC 27). Once the creature exits, that stomach regenerates 15 hit points per round. A ravener behemoth may gorge itself upon multiple creatures, shunting each victim to a different stomach each time. Each of a behemoth's 5 stomachs can hold 1 Huge, 4 Large, 16 Medium, 64 Small, 256 Tiny, or over 1,000 Diminutive or smaller creatures."

				"Ravener behemoths walk the land as the ultimate consumers of all things. This includes every manner of beast, plant, and mineral caught in their path. They indiscriminately fill their five ever-hungry stomachs by cutting wide swaths through tangled jungles, digging through mountains for precious ores, and razing settlements and strongholds to get at those sheltering inside.

Multiple horns and tusks sprout from its face and head, helping it root through even the hardest soil and rocks in search of food. It quickly reduces anything stronger into rubble with its earth-shattering roar and stomping feet. A rocky hide grown from the many minerals it routinely consumes protects it from harm even as lichen, small plants, and trees take root along its back, out of reach of its ravenous mouth. Divine blessings bequeathed by the gods ensure only the most powerful spells or adamantine weapons can lay a behemoth low. As a result, the ravener behemoth fears nothing and eats everything.",

				"Long before the Thassilonian empire rose to power on the western shores of Avistan, ancient tribes of stone giants migrated into the western reaches of Varisia and settled in the region now called the Mindspin Mountains. As their culture grew, so did their devotion to the deities who blessed them with the riches of the earth. They worshiped gods, the spirits of the wild world around them, and their ancestors. To show their respect, they erected dozens of small temples throughout the region. In later centuries, much of their culture was torn apart. Those who clung to their beliefs were slaughtered, and their temples were sacked, looted, and burned. Anything left behind fell into the care of aging priests, and over the centuries, as their caretakers passed on, these remnants slipped into obscurity.",
				"",
				"One strange ritual from this time, typically practiced by the ancient priests of the giant goddess Fandarra, involved the preparation of corpses for the journey to the afterlife, but created benaiohs as a side effect. Corpses were prepared by decomposing them within a clay vessel that the priests believed would allow the soul to escape after the body decomposed. To augment this process, the priests used slender, flesh-devouring worms that were imbued with divine blessings. Over the course of a lengthy ritual, priests sealed the deceased's entire body in sacred clay. As the clay hardened, they sculpted it to resemble the likeness of the deceased, forming a sort of statue-like sarcophagus that stood upright. The only portions of this clay vessel that were left unsealed were holes that allowed access to the individual's eyes and mouth. Then Fandarra's priests placed three of the sacred worms into each of the vessel's openings. Lastly, the priests sealed the openings with wax. In this manner, the priests believed they were separating the deceased's physical body from its soul, leaving the soul free to follow Fandarra (or her servitors) on to its final rest in the Great Beyond.",
				"",
				"As a side effect, this strange burial practice provided guardians for the tombs, as the divinely imbued worms eventually animate their clay vessels as benaiohs. Since the worms are able to breed rapidly and then maintain a stable population indefinitely, benaiohs are capable of standing vigil for millennia. A benaioh in its clay vessel stands just over 12 feet tall and weighs 2,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"A benaioh is an ooze-like colony formed by a swarm of divinely imbued worms that live within a morass of their own waste and digestive secretions. When first created, the colony consists of only nine worms; however, the creatures breed rapidly, particularly when they have a readily available source of flesh. Over the course of several months, the worms reproduce hundreds of times, quickly increasing in population until they fill the clay vessel. During times of dormancy or when meat is scarce, the worms sustain their population through cannibalism, eventually balancing their reproductive and mortality rates. If the colony senses warm flesh, though, the worms stop eating each other. These worms never exhibit this type of swarming behavior when encountered naturally, which indicates that the divine ritual is necessary to create a colony.",
				"",
				"The worms are coated with a fleshy, gelatinous slime that forms as they devour flesh, and eventually this slurry of worms and slime gains the ability to animate the clay vessel in which they are interred.

The worms innately sense nearby motion as well as the body heat of most living creatures.

This splits the berbalang's current hit points in half between its body and its spirit. The berbalang's spirit body gains the incorporeal subtype and special ability; otherwise, it retains the same statistics as its physical self with the following changes: AC 19, touch 19, flat-footed 14 (+4 Dex, +4 deflection, +1 dodge), single incorporeal touch attack that deals 1d4 Constitution damage on a hit as its sole attack. This spirit projection can travel no more than 1 mile away from the berbalang's body. Because the creature is only partially in existence when in this state, its body gains displacement as the spell. When separated in this way, the berbalang's body is unconscious and helpless. If the berbalang's body is injured while in this state, the separated projection immediately returns to its body, and the body loses displacement. If the physical body is slain, the spirit body immediately dies as well. If the spirit is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it returns to the body immediately. A berbalang in spirit form can end the effect at any time as a standard action, at which point the spirit immediately returns to the body.

				"In ages past, humans didn't live apart from nature as they do now. They had no cities, no farms, and no metal tools. In this primitive time, humans lived as beasts, hunting and foraging in the savage wild, living and dying by the cruel whims of nature. To these early humans, a successful hunt sometimes meant the difference between the life of the tribe and utter extinction. For this reason, the land and the animals who lived on it commanded great respect among the tribes. The environment represented more than just food or clothing or territory; it was an ally, an enemy, or even a god unto itself.",
				"",
				"There was need in those days for people who could pass from the physical world and into the world of the spirits, where they could intercede with the spirits of the land and the animals to ensure the tribe's survival. From this need came the birelus, manifestations of humankind's desire to bridge the boundary between humans and nature. These ancient beings served as guardians and travelers of the paths between worlds.",
				"",
				"A birelu seems to both stand upright and walk upon all fours at the same time, its form shifting and flowing incomprehensibly between the two poses. Even while partially hunched in this manner, a birelu stands over 7 feet tall when in its natural state.",
				"",
				"Birelus are ancient beings, having existed since time immemorial. It may be that they were born at the very dawn of time, champions of a unity between humankind and nature that would not exist on the Material Plane for eons hence, and simply waited to intrude upon the world when it was ready for them. More likely, they owe their existence to humankind itself, springing to life as the manifestation of ideas held sacred by the early mortal races. Whatever the case, birelus came to Golarion when the mortal races were still young. In those primordial times, they acted as guardians and guides, teaching the first mortal shamans how to cross the boundaries between the physical world and the spirit world, and bringing terrible destruction upon those who violated that sacred boundary. These early birelus sought to guide humanity, to groom its growth in harmony with nature as a way to restrict the destructive tendencies of civilization. Despite these efforts, humanity marched forward through time to establish cities, discover arcane magic, and usher in the destruction that the early birelus had attempted to hinder.",
				"",
				"As outsiders, birelus don't need to eat or drink to survive, though they take great pleasure in hunting and feeding on wild prey. Most often they hunt while possessing the body of an animal, usually the apex predator of the local environment. Occasionally, a birelu stalks its prey in the possessed body of a humanoid, though typically this is done to honor the humanoid host. As much as they delight in such behavior, birelus never over-hunt an area, and they seem to have an innate sense about the state of the local ecology."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Birelus have no set habitat, nor do they hold territory, preferring instead to wander the wild places of the world. Birelus don't often intrude upon inhabited areas, though when they do, the results are often disastrous. They find the trappings of civilized life distasteful, even blasphemous, and focus their attentions on destroying the objects of their ire. Often they accomplish this by possessing people and turning them against their own homes and their fellow citizens. Birelus can sometimes be reasoned with and convinced to depart in peace, but this is rare, as their attacks are often confused for the actions of lycanthropes, and are met with violence rather than diplomacy by mortal humanoids.",
				"",
				"For the most part, birelus are solitary creatures. They don't scorn the company of their own kind, but neither do they delight in it or seek it out. Birelus who meet in passing are more likely to ignore each other than to interact in any meaningful way. Some have speculated that there may in fact be only one birelu, and that those specimens encountered on Golarion emanate from it or serve as its avatars.",
				"",
				"A birelu's attentions are drawn to animals more often than to any other kind of creature, earning them the title \"spirits of the beasts\" in some cultures. Birelus seem to delight in possessing animals and using their bodies to explore and interact with the world. Upon entering new territory, a birelu uses its call animal spell-like ability to draw in potential hosts, choosing the strongest and fastest of the native creatures to inhabit. Birelus are very protective of their wild animal hosts, and they abandon a creature's body if the animal is at grave risk rather than fighting to the host's death. Domesticated animals-or those serving as animal companions to the birelu's enemies' don't receive the same consideration.",
				"",
				"Birelus' interactions with humanoids are more complicated. Civilized peoples hold no interest to them, and in fact often earn their scorn. Birelus react with hostility toward those who openly bear the signs of civilization, such as worked metal or agricultural tools. A birelu's attitude is much softer toward less civilized humanoids. Primitive tribes of hunter-gatherers and those who shun the cities of the world and live in communion with nature are often able to make peaceful contact with a birelu. In return, the birelu might draw in prey animals to feed the tribe, or guide them to more fertile lands in times of scarcity. It may even join the tribe's warriors in combat against their enemies, leaping from warrior to warrior in order to grant them the benefits of greater animal aspect."

				"Black shucks are monstrous hounds that haunt the countless footpaths and byways threading through lonely coastal regions and sweaty fenlands. Some say black shucks are grotesque children born of witches who consort with forest demons, while others believe them to be the remains of witches burned alive in marshy terrain. These theories are likely born of the undeniable affinity the dog-creatures have with witches, and the hounds often masquerade as lonely travelers, lost and afraid in the wilds, thanks to their ability to take on the form of such woebegone souls. However, some tales contradict this entirely, telling of black shucks that take care of travelers who cross wild places alone and take vengeance on those who would harm defenseless wanderers. Many suspect that these latter stories are spread by the monstrous canines themselves when in human form and desperate for a meal.",
				"",
				"Many black shucks live lonely lives, shunning civilization and those who hunt at its fringes, but others are found in the company of hags and witches, and some are able to leech greater powers of witchcraft from long association. Sometimes a coven attaches itself to a black shuck and uses it as a guide or hunter, or it might unleash a black shuck on a small coastal village as a distraction from some grander scheme.",
				"",
				"Often mistakenly identified as barghests, black shucks are magical beasts that are encountered in breeding pairs only in extremely rare circumstances. Habitual loners, they are foul and dirty; they resemble the most neglected of their mortal kin while embodying the most feral aspects of wild dogs. Dwelling for the most part in rank bogs or brine-soaked coasts, black shucks often drive out other animals with their mere presence, leaving their territories even more bereft of noise and life than would usually be the case. Black shucks have ravenous appetites and can readily clear a large area of prey, leaving only their own foul droppings and scentmarks behind.",
				"",
				"Even well-coordinated efforts to drive a black shuck from an area often fail, as the creature can compound the difficulty most humanoids have navigating its favored terrain by using its ability to create dense banks of fog. Combining this with its intimate knowledge of its territory and a well-hidden lair, a black shuck can evade even the most determined militia for a nearly indefinite period, even picking off careless hunters who wander too far from their group.",
				"",
				"A famous legend has it that an old shuck called Foul-Eye once single-handedly eradicated a contingent of elite Chernasardo Ranger scouts at the edge of Nirmathas's Southern Fangwood. Unlikely as this tale is to be true, it is well-known enough that even the rumor of a black shuck's presence is often enough to scare travelers away from a path for months."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Black shucks are natural loners; thus, barring the outside influence of a cover, they rarely form bonds with any other creatures, even of their own kind. However, black shucks develop a particular affinity-and even affection-for particular paths and byways, often using the same such routes over and over again, and sometimes even forming their own paths through gradual wear. So great is the creature's bond to its homeland that forcing it to leave its chosen territory often causes a black shuck to wither and die of homesick longing.",
				"",
				"Black shucks maintain lairs that they return to during the day when they rest; they hunt only at night except in times of desperation or on the foggiest of days. A shuck's primary lair is almost always somewhere well hidden or difficult to reach, whether in the center of a tangled gorse patch, among the loose stones at the foot of gravelly cliffs, or within the briar-infested corners of long-disused graveyards. Occasionally a black shuck keeps several lairs spread across a larger territory, which allows it to prey on travelers for longer stretches of time without raising too much suspicion in any one community.",
				"",
				"Black shucks often take advantage of the camaraderie of travelers, changing into human forms and luring lone wanderers further into a foggy moor with promises of a cache of food, a comfortable camp, or simple companionship. Once a victim is in a black shuck's preferred killing ground, the beast transforms into its true form and viciously ambushes the poor soul, whose picked-clean remains are almost never found, having sunk into the moist ground to join countless others.",
				"",
				"Rarely, a black shuck develops a curious benevolent edge to its hunting, watching over lone travelers along a particular path or swampy stretch instead of attacking them. Such hounds prefer to prey on robbers and thieves who attempt to victimize those in their territory, and they sometimes even take on the form of vulnerable and lonely human travelers to attract villains to them. Those who have found themselves aided by such a shuck often claim its eye was colored deep blue, not green.",
				"",
				"**Old Shuck**",
				"",
				"The black shuck's close association with witches and witchcraft has led to countless local variants of the hound, as foul rituals have changed the already-fearsome creatures into even more nightmarish beasts. One of the most commonly encountered variants is that known as an old shuck, a beast often formed when a coven of witches or hags adopts a black shuck and adapts it to their needs. These leaner, more brutish versions of a black shuck have 13 Hit Dice and the ability to cause storms in their home territory. Once per day, by spending 10 minutes pacing its territory in a specific pattern, an old shuck can call forth a storm as per [control weather](unknown:control_weather) (CL 13th). The type of storm created and its effects depend upon the prevalent climate and season. In addition, once per day when a target fails its save against the old shuck's green-eyed gaze, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or perish. The save DC is Charisma-based. Old shucks are CR 10 creatures."

				"Desert blights are personifications of blistering heat, thirst, and the bleached bones of all creatures that have ever died among arid dunes. They are particularly fond of forging alliances of convenience with free-willed mummies and other desert undead to combine their power and scourge the living from their already harsh domain. Often, a desert blight sets itself up as the mastermind behind the scenes, urging its undead allies to march upon the living realms while it remains safe in the deeper reaches of the wasteland. Although desert blights have no inborn method of creating new undead minions and allies to replace those inevitably lost in such wars, they understand that in the great deserts of the world, there is no shortage of lost cities to recruit replacement troops from as the need arises. The most canny desert blights seek to dominate necromancers to help bolster their armies.",

				"Blindheims are grotesque, frog-like creatures that dwell beneath the surface, subsisting on meals of fungi, rodents, and other underground creatures. They live in the darkest, dampest regions of cavernous sprawls, particularly enjoying underground bogs, lakes, rivers, and swamps. Although not aquatic, blindheims are excellent swimmers. They prefer to latch onto branches or rock outcroppings, where they maintain the high ground while in pursuit of food. They use the light from their eyes to attract prey, but go dark when larger creatures approach. A blindheim uses its blinding gaze to disorient both prey and possible threats, then deactivates its gaze to scuttle away in the dark if the threat is too great. In very large caverns inhabited by blindheims, distant areas often flicker from brightly lit to absolutely dark as the creatures feed and flee. Though of animal-level intelligence, blindheims are cunning enough to coordinate their hunting tactics with others of their kind, using one creature to act as a lookout and make hit-and-run attacks with its gaze until its fellows can arrive to help finish off the prey.",
				"",
				"Blindheims can convey simple information through gestures and flashes of their lights, and tend to be rather silent in combat, adding an eerie element to battles with them. They cannot be taught to perform humanoid-appropriate labors and thus make poor slaves, though the duergar and drow sometimes use them as bait or distractions when raiding. Other races have been known to train these creatures as mobile light sources when going on long underground expeditions.",
				"",
				"Stout and thick-skinned, a blindheim is just under 4 feet in height and weighs 150 pounds. A blindheim gives birth to small litters of three or four young. Though gestation can last up to a full year, it only takes about 4 years for a blindheim to mature and become self-reliant, at which point the creatures generally form broods that stick together, only striking out on their own if their brethren have perished. Blindheims can live for up to 25 years."

Despite their intelligence and friendly natures, blink dogs tend to avoid humanoids, keeping their packs either hidden or frequently on the move.

Packs are typically led by an older, experienced male or female, called an alpha.",

Honor is paramount to blink dogs, and different packs often have unique traditions (such as whether a pack's alpha is male or female, or an oath to always protect and aid a particular humanoid race like elves or halflings) in addition to those shared by most blink dogs. Blink dogs have a great interest in the stars and movements of celestial bodies. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for constellations, and through this zodiac they note the seasons, births under auspicious stars, and omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. Blink dog names often contain a reference to a specific constellation under which the dog was born.",

A blink dog sage also decides when a pup is old enough to join his first hunt, performs birth and burial rites, and counsels the alpha on the meaning of omens or upon tactical matters involving interactions with neighboring races and creatures. In some packs, the sage is the alpha's mate, while in others the sage is always a gray-muzzled elder hound beyond breeding age."

				"Blood algae evolved from a species of river algae in the Jalrune River and has since spread to other rivers in Taldor and Qadira by adhering to the hulls of sailing ships. Individual creatures in a blood algae swarm consist of cells within a fat, gelatinous, wormlike matrix 4 inches long. A swarm of blood algae is at least 10 feet wide and consists of hundreds or thousands of these wormlike organisms.",
				"",
				"Blood algae colonies form in river bends and places where the water flows slowly or forms stagnant pools seasonally. Multiple swarms make up a blood algae colony, which can spread across an entire river and writhe along its banks. Individual swarms rarely travel far from their colony unless flushed away by a flood or drawn away by a large log or river vessel-although a blood algae swarm may drift downstream when food is scarce to find a more plentiful area of the river.",
				"",
				"Blood algae swarms are diurnal, floating toward the water's surface in sunny weather and sinking to the bottom at night. These creatures absorb some nutrients directly from the water, but to survive longer periods of time, they must feed on living creatures such as crustaceans, fish, or mammals. Blood algae attach themselves to their prey's skin, inserting needlelike protrusions in the flesh, through which they can feed.",
				"",
				"Blood algae reproduce both sexually and asexually- although a swarm usually uses the latter method only when recovering from losses caused by environmental dangers or predation. A swarm of blood algae consists of a roughly equal number of male and female individuals, but members of the same swarm don't usually reproduce with one another. Instead, a swarm seeks out another swarm for a violent-looking mating ritual, which churns the water with blood-red pigment.",
				"",
				"Because blood algae swarms can color the water red, there are many superstitious beliefs in Taldor about evil spirits that turn the water into blood to punish people."

				"Many an unsuspecting victim has been lured to a blood lily by its large radiant blossom-a ball of scarlet spikes reminiscent of a sea urchin. Those who live near blood lilies know to be wary of the plants, but as nonanimate blood lilies also grow in such areas, it can be difficult to tell the dangerous plants from the inert ones. To complicate matters, blood lilies have learned to hide their scarlet petals when hunting. A favorite trick of these plants is to disguise themselves next to ordinary blood lilies, using their harmless kin as a distraction. When travelers pass by, the predatory blood lilies then attack from concealment.",
				"",
				"Blood lilies commonly grow in tropical areas near coastlines, where they hunt both in and out of the water. Fish and other aquatic creatures are drawn to the blood lily's brilliant petals, sometimes mistaking them for colorful tropical fish. Blood lilies can slaughter and consume dozens of small fish in under a minute if a school draws close enough. Though blood lilies devour such prey whole, the masticating action of the edges of a blood lily's digestive orifice leaves clouds of blood in the water. Their blossoms also attract giant insects, which can be dangerous and damaging to the plant creatures. Blood lilies can easily defend against most of these vermin, but they almost never eat insects, preferring warm-blooded prey above all others.",
				"",
				"Blood lilies have an animalistic cunning and can use surprisingly sophisticated tactics for plants. Blood lilies that grow near the settlements of intelligent creatures (such as humans on land or merfolk underwater) keep their petals hidden and hide among other plants to better ambush their prey. When they grow in remote areas far from any settlements, they keep their petals exposed to draw in animals. Blood lilies remember the location of fertile hunting grounds and adapt their tactics based on the prey they seek. Surprisingly mobile, they sometimes travel long distances to hunt and feed at these fertile locations. A few naturalists have recorded rare blood lilies that never remain in the same area for long, roaming far and wide until they mature enough to enter a transformative hibernation.",
				"",
				"A blood lily is composed of a thick trunk plated with extremely tough but flexible green bark. An orifice lined with large thorns splits the trunk about halfway up its length. The blood lily uses this opening to devour its prey. Potent acids inside the creature's trunk dissolve fleshy organic matter quickly, allowing the lily to eat much more than would seem possible given its size.",
				"",
				"A lily's vines are covered in the same hard bark as its trunk, and the vines are lined with tiny thorns that seep poison. The blood lily gets its name not only from their vivid coloring but also from the disturbing effects of their toxin. Creatures affected by a blood lily's poison bleed from their pores, coating their skin in a light sheen of crimson. The blood lily focuses its attacks on bleeding victims, assuming they have been weakened by its toxin. However, a blood lily cannot distinguish between a creature bleeding from the blood lily's poison and one bleeding from a wound. Individuals traveling in areas where blood lilies are common sometimes carry bladders of animal blood to splash nearby during combat, confusing any blood lilies as they attack.",
				"",
				"Though most blood lilies live and hunt alone, they occasionally come together to form small pods. In particularly rich hunting grounds where the lilies don't have to compete for prey, they work together in pods to bring down victims. Pods are adept at felling large creatures or groups of smaller creatures by working in tandem. Though a pod's tactics are simple, it can take on even dangerous creatures. The blood lilies in a pod spread out and conceal their petals until their target is in range, and then they all unleash their petal barrages at once. The nearest lily then moves to attack with its vine lash while the other lilies continue to fire petal spikes until they deplete their reserves. All lilies then move in to finish off their victim with vine lashes.",
				"",
				"Blood lilies reproduce asexually. Once a lily matures, it begins to grow a small bulb-like structure called a bulbil near the base of its stem, protected by its foliage. The bulbil takes 12 to 18 months to mature, at which point it drops off the parent plant and grows into a mature blood lily within a year. If released on land, a bulbil takes root in the soil, from which it draws sustenance; if released underwater, it drifts with the currents, drawing sustenance from the water as it grows. Blood lilies don't protect their released bulbils; many are consumed by predators, and in areas where hunting is poor, adult blood lilies might even consume their own immature sprouts. If a sprout reaches maturity, it gains the ability to move under its own power and begins to hunt.",
				"",
				"Mature blood lilies can live for decades if hunting remains good and they aren't killed by other predators. A blood lily that survives for at least 10 years sometimes enters a hibernation phase during which its petals fall off and its vines wrap around its trunk, forming a cocoon-like structure. After a season of dormancy, the blood lily sprouts larger, darker petals that carry the same toxin as the thorns in its vines. The blood lily's vines undergo a growth spurt, gaining an extra 5 feet in length. These blood lilies are hardier than their lesser kin and can challenge even the deadliest predators. They have the advanced creature simple template, they add their poison to attacks with their petal spikes, and their reach with slam attacks increases by 5 feet."

				"**Change Foliage (Su)** Three times per day as an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a blood maize plant can make itself appear as a different type of plant.

			"ecology2": [
				"It's said that blood maize plants arose spontaneously in ancient times at the sites of great battles, where blood pooled like rainwater and the plains were covered in broken bodies. In these legends, crops left to wither and rot due to raging wars adapted to their harsh new environs via a mixture of natural hardiness and the latent energies of suffering that permeated the land. The results were the first blood maize. Sustenance would not come to the blood maize, and so the plants developed a way to hunt down their own nourishment, and the blood that once choked their roots instead became their food. Many believe blood maize is evil due to its affinity for blood and the plant's eerie ambulatory nature. However, despite its purported origin story, blood maize is actually unmotivated by anything other than the need for nourishment, albeit via a strange biology born from its dark origins.",
				"",
				"While the uninformed often associate blood maize with vampires and other blood-drinking creatures, the plants don't actually drink blood or grapple enemies to drain them. Rather, they instinctually seek to slice the skin of victims; any creatures that bleed are potential prey, though they most commonly stalk humanoids. Blood maize plants slice their prey with their large, sharp leaves, which peel away from their stalks to serve as appendages. These leaves are durable and can stiffen, and the edges are razor sharp. When a blood maize stalk strikes a victim, it roots into place while its leaves lash outward and slice into the victim's flesh. Blood maize plants absorb spilled blood through their root systems and can do so even while they are mobile. To aid their search for blood, they can uproot themselves to move without impediment, and they can use their roots to dig a firm purchase in the ground. Blood maize can both see and sense movement remarkably well; the plants migrate and search for food at night, and so they are finely attuned to the ground vibrations they use to locate prey.",
				"",
				"Although blood maize stalks that haven't fed in days or weeks are tenacious in combat, these plants often try to withdraw from a fight once they've sliced one or more victims to death. When their thirst has been sated, they use their defensive abilities to avoid further violence, though this is more of an instinct for self-preservation than an actual desire to avoid a fight. Foremost among these defensive measures is the blood maize's ability to release a pollen cloud, which allows the plant to retreat from a battle while its enemies are distracted. This cloud is dense enough to block sight for a moment, and though the pollen dissipates quickly, creatures that get it in their eyes discover that it stings painfully. Once its enemies are distracted, a blood maize stalk disguises itself as an innocuous environmental plant in the hope that its enemies will leave the area and not discover the ruse.",
				"",
				"Blood maize plants are perennial, and they are reduced to only their root structures during the winter. They regrow their stalks as well as their sweet corn cobs in the spring, and maintain this form throughout the fall. They reproduce only once in their life cycles through a special red kernel produced on one cob, usually in the plant's second year. The other cobs produce normal corn, which is not only safe to eat, but delicious and wholesome. In fact, some hardy frontier homesteaders or settlements prize this corn as a delicacy and mount regular, if perilous, missions to harvest it. Blood maize plants typically live for 4 or 5 years, but there are reports of some in remote locations that reproduce each year and live for a decade or more."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Blood maize plants are found in temperate climates. They are wild plants, but they tend to grow most robustly in rural areas, likely due to the abundance of prey that surrounds them there. Blood maize plants are attracted to gardens and farms, as the stalks can relocate easily in tilled soil and find that birds, livestock, and unsuspecting humans make for relatively easy meal sources. Farmers who don't care to harvest blood maize's corn consider it a dangerous pest, while evil-inclined druids and witch covens sometimes use blood maize to protect gardens and thickets where rare alchemical and spell components are grown. Of course, these villainous gardeners can't control the plants' bloodlust; if they drop their guard around the stalks, they often find themselves fending off razor-sharp leaves.",
				"",
				"Blood maize is rare in the Inner Sea region, but it's more frequently found in Arcadia as well as occasionally on the surviving islands from the shattered continent of Azlant. One account from Vudra describes similarly mobile plant creatures that resemble bamboo but are as bloodthirsty as their blood maize cousins."

				"Named not for their physical coloration but for their thirst for spilled blood, the plants known as blood maize plants are insidious creatures. They look like common cornstalks, except their leaves are larger and more knifelike and their root systems are much more robust and mobile. In each specimen, the latter includes at least one long vine-like tendril that the plant can use to root itself deeply in the earth as it attacks its victim. Despite its fearsome nature, blood maize produces ears of sweet corn larger than those of traditional corn plants. A full-grown blood maize stalk is typically 7 feet tall and, including its root system, weighs about 70 pounds."

Any kuru linked to in this way must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to carry out the Blood Queen's telepathic commands to the best of its ability. In addition, a linked kuru gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and is immune to mind-affecting effects. The blood link lasts for 1 minute or until the Blood Queen ends the effect (a free action). When the blood link is broken, the affected kuru takes 1 point of Intelligence damage and cannot be linked to again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

After the creature has finished gestating, it is regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently explode.

The Blood Queen may create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are Constitution-based."

				"Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today, convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular sacrificial victims and offerings of blood.",
				"",
				"The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se-rather, what look like angry pustules all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to manipulate objects and electrify victims.",
				"",
				"The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral. While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too large to fit through any of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder at the prospect.",

				"The Blood Queen's favored deacons are known as kuru surrogates, and such monstrosities are created when the horror digests a creature and entombs the victim in one of its paralytic sacs for long enough. The creature that emerges is essentially brain-dead, having been completely stripped of its wits and nervous system. A kuru surrogate remains in its vegetative state until it starves, is killed, or is affected by a heal spell or a similar effect of equal or greater power. Kuru surrogates are revered among the Blood Queen's devout, who transport the immobile things around the Cannibal Isles, perpetually caring for the \"blessed\" individuals. The Blood Queen acts through these surrogates and uses them to augment and command its kuru followers, linking with its minions in order to capture any who oppose it or its wicked cult of cannibals."

Perhaps worse, the crimson parasites carry a debilitating disease known for sapping the vitality of its victims. Because of this potent mix of teeming esurience and virulent pestilence, bloodhaze mosquitoes panic almost any community they threaten. Legends describe crimson clouds decimating entire populations on their flight from breeding pool to jungle interior. Only high winds, drought, and torrential rain consistently keep them at bay. Thankfully, the swarms also wax and wane with fluctuations in local prey populations. In combination with the mosquitoes' relatively short lifespan, competition for food helps keep their numbers under marginal control.",

Vines like the rigging of a ship run from its sightless \"head\" toward its posterior, and fist-sized stomata peek from leaves and appendages across its form.",

				"Bloodplate bursters are ruthless predators at the top of their food chain. Acidic secretions allow quiet, cilia-driven passage through softened earth while the plants use their keen senses to assess the size and health of prey and threats from underneath the ground's surface. A bloodplate burster's lateral sensory nodes pick up vibration in a wide swath around it as it burrows, and its olfactory system is highly attuned to the smell of blood-injured prey attract particular attention, and a burster generally tracks and isolates the largest possible meal that is the easiest kill.",
				"",
				"The plant maintains a complex internal system of pressurized caustic fluid, regulated by an internal gas bladder that aids in circulating the acid through numerous stomata. This exchange produces a constant, characteristic hissing that intensifies when the bloodplate burster first attacks its prey. In a wet, sibilant rush, the bladder can exert tremendous hydraulic force to push thick spines through the burster's opened dorsal stomata. The spines pierce flesh to inject pressurized fluid whose caustic nature cauterizes the wounds, causing pressure to build in the victim's body. The burster then surfaces to lash prey with its thick lateral vines. When brought into forceful contact, the vines' reinforced stomata adhere to flesh and inject further bursts of fluid that build up excruciating pressure over repeated blows. The burster relentlessly strikes its prey with its vines until its barrage of spines drives the victim's internal pressure to uncontainable levels and the victim explodes in a shower of gore and shredded flesh.",
				"",
				"With its hunt complete, the massive plant settles into the ground beneath its kill to feed. The absorbed blood turns the burster's dozens of dry armored plates into ballooning leaves that remain above the soil and absorb the sun's rays, aiding the creature's metabolization."

Vigilant shepherds, trade caravans, and army patrols-especially those mounted on heavy-footed elephants-listen carefully for bursters' trademark hissing and look for knee-high clusters of glistening ruby fins.",
				"",
				"Though rightly feared, these creatures are infrequently encountered. Ingesting a kill's blood is a months-long process during which a bloodplate burster remains dormant unless roused. Its vital fluids are more caustic while feeding, but it exudes moisture and warmth. These secondary effects of blood metabolization can even make the burster the center of a temporary microclimate: birds adapted to its acidity feed on its engorged leaves, and the seeds they carry sprout into plants and wildflowers that attract other organisms' soon, what began as a blood-soaked graveyard flourishes with new life. Even in death, a burster becomes a home for other creatures as rodents carve dwellings from the remnants of its fibrous husk.",
				"",
				"When not hunting or feeding, these territorial beings patrol their expansive holdings. They mark their perimeters with boluses of acid deposited in the soil. The enzymatic compositions of these clusters repel other bursters, and the slightest vibration near a marker triggers a seismic signal. Bursters react to this information according to their hunger or territorial need. Two juveniles may share territory thanks to a tacit instinctual agreement, or an elder burster may repel a younger creature's invasion. Those too weak to defend their territory use their flagging blood reserves to bud the next generation; the resulting dog-sized offspring consume the organisms attracted to the senescent burster.",
				"",
				"Some daring opportunists find good reason to risk their lives with the aggressive plants; the creatures' untriggered perimeter markers eventually condense into pearlescent ovoids with supposedly wondrous properties, and the singular composition of bursters' plated leaves makes them well suited for use in crafting armor and durable textiles.",
				"",
				"Despite a bloodplate burster's solitary, territorial disposition, travelers have occasionally had no choice but to face multiple bursters at once. The seismic disturbance of a marching army, wagon train, or herd of migrating beasts can provoke multiple bursters, leading to the formation of a temporary, semicoordinated pack. Ashen-faced traders speak of hundreds of bison torn apart in a frenzy of cresting plants and rupturing hide, leaving clouds of bloody mist drifting for miles on prairie winds.",

A feeding bloodplate burster has only half its usual natural armor bonus, and the DCs of its hydraulic surge and rupture abilities are reduced by 2. A feeding burster also gains fast healing 2, and creatures that hit it with natural attacks or unarmed attacks take 2d6 points of acid damage."

Acceptance into the clan then depends on the young boggard's successful hunt to kill a sentient humanoid. Those who fail are exiled from the clan. As boggards age, they continue to grow and lose their coloration. Exceptionally old boggards bear completely white skin covering massive corpulent bodies. Some of these boggards rank among the caste of priest-kings and enjoy a life of grotesque pleasures ruling their clans.",

				"Malicious and furtive, boggarts are believed to be brownies that were mistreated or somehow corrupted. Unlike brownies, who sometimes form mutually beneficial relationships with particular families and take up residence within those families' houses, boggarts rarely occupy homes. Instead, they lurk in swamps, in marshes, and on riverbanks, favoring areas where people have vanished or drowned. A boggart's relationship with nearby households and homesteads is almost always disruptive.

When preying on its victims, a boggart uses its familiarity with its home terrain to its advantage, preferring to induce foes to struggle against the natural environment rather than against the boggart. A boggart has very long arms, which it uses to pull creatures into water or onto marshy ground; it then psychically paralyzes its victims and allows the creatures to drown. A boggart is also quite skilled at setting traps and dragging its opponents into them. It sometimes uses aversion to keep people away from its home, but more often uses this power to prevent anyone from helping its chosen prey.",

				"Some scholars suggest the large, muscular body of the bogwid serves as little more than transport for its ravenous young-30 to 40 fist-sized, pustule-like protuberances that cling to its back, inflating and deflating, shifting and quivering with disturbing vitality. The bogwid attacks with two of its undulating tentacles, the bottoms of which are lined with ragged, bony ridges that can tear hungrily into exposed flesh. However, the more disturbing danger is those pulsating orbs of flesh on its back: larvae that are capable of launching themselves as far as 10 feet and attaching to creatures with their fanged sucker mouths. Once one of these disgusting things sinks its jagged teeth into flesh, it begins sucking blood and does not release its grip until it or the target is dead.",
				"",
				"When a bogwid makes a kill, several of its young jump upon the warm carcass and feed greedily. If the victim is a Medium or larger creature, these rapacious larvae fight for the opportunity to burrow into the corpse. Over the course of 2 weeks, the burrowed creatures gestate, and the cadaver bloats until an adolescent bogwid (a bogwid with the young template) gruesomely bursts forth. The larger the kill, the more of the bogwid's young can burrow in and hatch out as adolescents; a Large victim can accommodate two larvae, a Huge victim four larvae, a Gargantuan victim eight larvae, and a Colossal victim 16 larvae. A creature smaller than Medium doesn't possess sufficient nutrition for bogwid larvae to gestate properly. As a result, adult bogwids tend to completely consume smaller kills instead of leaving them for the larvae. Bogwids that inhabit seaside haunts are not averse to eating carrion. Indeed, a sizable sea creature whose carcass washes ashore (a whale, for instance) is usually set upon by a nearby bogwid, whose ravenous larvae tunnel their way into the rotting flesh, and several days later erupt like a crawling, monstrous plague. In this way, large clutches of these foul beasts can come to infest coastal areas.",
				"",
				"The bogwid is generally nocturnal, though it is not unusual for one to hunt during the day if it has gone a long time without feeding. A bogwid hunts patiently, concealing itself well in its natural habitat by heaping sand, seaweed, vegetation, and other detritus onto its body. Though a bogwid possesses limited intelligence, its animal cunning allows it to employ natural hazards to its advantage, setting up ambushes that cleverly integrate drop-offs, natural pits, and quicksand. As these creatures are also able to climb, it is not uncommon for bogwids to roost on rocky overhangs or in large trees, dropping down on unsuspecting victims from above.",
				"",
				"Alchemists pay a significant price for the glands in bogwid tentacles that produce the foul, viscous liquid the creatures excrete. However, these glands are difficult to extract fully intact (DC 25 Heal check) and must be properly stored in water after removal. Appropriately dissected and transported, the glands fetch 25 gp apiece on the right market. Alchemists employ this putrid substance in various formulae to augment their effectiveness."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Though great numbers of bogwids take up residence in temperate, swampy, coastal regions and the damp caves that are sometimes found in such places, plenty of the creatures inhabit inland marshes as well. They have been known to adapt to warmer climes, but tropical bogwids are much rarer. The fetid creatures tend not to flourish near major settlements, even if those settlements are in close proximity to the bogwids' natural habitat. The reason is that the presence of a beast like this near a town strikes such revulsion and fear into a population that they quickly post sizable rewards for the destruction of the beast. Rangers who traverse marshes and wet caves eagerly seek out such lucrative bounties. Indeed, the fact that these monsters have not been hunted to extinction is a testimony to their revolting fecundity.",
				"",
				"As these creatures are asexual, bogwids also tend to be solitary, driving off gestated offspring soon after they reach maturity. Recently matured bogwids seek out their own territory. On the few occasions bogwid clutches form, they most often include a single adult accompanied by two to eight adolescents. These abhorrent creatures have a life expectancy of about 10 years. An older bogwid can be identified by its flesh, which becomes gray-green and increasingly dry as the creature ages. The larvae an older bogwid carries about eventually lead to its own downfall. In the end, the strongest of its young fight off weaker kin and burrow into the dying parent, exploding forth from the corpse in the usual manner 2 weeks later.",
				"",
				"A bogwid does not tolerate other major predators in its territory, hounding them relentlessly until such competitors are killed or find alternate homes for themselves. The bogwid is especially aggressive against crocodiles, which tend to be its chief rivals for prey in swampy regions. In fact, a telltale sign of a bogwid having laid a claim to territory is the discovery of a crocodile corpse lying on its back, the stomach bloated with gestating larvae or torn out as though something exploded from within, suggesting an adolescent bogwid is not far away."

			"description": [
				"Aberrant beasts of ancient origin, bogwids are loathsome, skulking predators that inhabit the gloomy swamps and damp subterranean places of the world. Looking like a bloated, eight-limbed, greenish-black mix of frog and tentacled beast, this asexual creature is most notorious for the larvae it carries on its back."

Just as with boggards, bogwiggles lose their coloring as they age, and particularly old bogwiggles are often pale gray or almost white.

				"Resembling immense serpents or wingless dragons, bollas are remorseless gluttons that spend much of their time hibernating in remote mountain ranges. They have little concern for other creatures except as food, but particularly prize the taste of intelligent prey. Fortunately, the creatures are as lazy as they are hungry; despite their aggressive dispositions, they rarely rouse themselves from their mountain lairs to assail the smorgasbord of civilization.",
				"",
				"Bollas have exceptionally keen vision, thanks to their silvery compound eyes. When disturbed, they often feign sleep or sluggishness to lure intruders close before lashing out with surprising speed. Their bite inflicts a magical lethargy on foes, making targets easy meals for the gluttonous beasts.",
				"",
				"A typical bolla is 30 feet long and weighs 2 tons.",
				"",
				"Born of foul experiments performed by the runelords of Haruka at the height of the Thassilonian empire, bollas are creatures of gluttony and sloth conceived as living weapons to further the machinations of their magical masters. Designed by Runelord Ivarinna and developed by her successor, Krune, the runelords' goal was to create a voracious war machine that could be easily returned to a torpor when not in active use. Bollas were bred from monstrous serpents native to the mountains of Haruka and infused with the essences of fiends, [linnorms](unknown:linnorms), and even stranger creatures of storm and sky. Due in part to Krune's preference for conjuring beasts when needed rather than engaging in the laborious process of breeding creatures over time, and in part to general indolence, bollas were never perfected and were deployed only sporadically.",
				"",
				"Bollas can remain in hibernation for many years. When not hibernating, they are driven by their ravenous urges and eagerly attack any creatures unlucky enough to cross its path. When given the opportunity, bollas prefer to attack intelligent creatures first, plucking knights from horseback or slithering around hunting animals to get at their humanoid handlers.",
				"",
				"Despite their vicious temperaments, bollas are intelligent, sometimes stalking foes for hours to analyze the foes' strengths and weaknesses before striking. When faced with multiple foes, bollas slither through the battlefield, cursing or swallowing weaker enemies to buy time to concentrate on tougher targets. On rare occasions, a bolla might strike a deal with creatures it finds too powerful to defeat, but these negotiations are always aimed at feeding its endless hunger.",
				"",
				"An adverse side effect of bollas' experimental origin is their keen but delicate compound eyes. While the mirror sheen of a bolla's eyes makes it impossible to determine exactly where the creature is looking-and even conceals whether it is currently asleep or awake-its eyes are particularly fragile. A bolla that has been robbed of its sight is both pitiful and desperate, lashing out haphazardly in a roaring frenzy.",
				"",
				"Bollas dislike others of their kind and usually attack them on sight. When the creatures occasionally come together to mate, they produce a small clutch of eggs and leave it in an isolated cave or canyon. The first bolla to hatch eats its siblings before taking a long rest, and thus begins its life alternating between gluttony and torpor. Unless killed by accident or violence, bollas can survive for millennia."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"During the time of Thassilon, Runelord Krune's agents deployed bollas as tools of extermination, loosing them into enemy camps to devour the inhabitants in a gluttonous frenzy. Once no more victims remained in a camp, the bollas would rest and their handlers would retrieve them. These handlers relied on powerful magic items to pacify bollas, as the beasts were always irascible, no matter how sated, and never truly loyal.",
				"",
				"In the aftermath of Earthfall, the surviving bollas retreated to the far corners of Golarion to wait out the darkness. A bolla that has been hibernating for a year might consume only a single person and then resume its slumber, while one in hibernation since Earthfall could embark on a nation-devouring rampage once it finally awakens.",
				"",
				"Unlike most creatures that hibernate for extended periods of time, bollas get stronger, rather than weaker, the longer they rest. Over years or decades, their bodies draw upon the fiendish essences instilled in their nature, growing more powerful and vicious. The outward manifestations of this metamorphosis are twofold. First, a hibernating bolla slowly sheds and replaces its furry skin, recovering from any injuries and regenerating any missing appendages. Second, its tongue grows and splits. While younger bollas have the familiar forked tongue of a snake, older bollas exhibit multiple tongue splits-their maws are filled with tangled masses of red, fleshy ribbons. Older bollas sometimes develop into kulshedras. A bolla's growth is slowed when it regularly consumes intelligent creatures, as the bolla feeds on the ephemeral spiritual residue of its victims rather than its own inner fiendish essence. Rumors tell of isolated settlements that make offerings of criminals or unlucky travelers to appease a bolla, hoping to keep its growth in check with these sacrifices.",
				"",
				"**Kulshedras**",
				"",
				"When a bolla has gone without eating an intelligent victim long enough for its tongue to split into nine forks, it undergoes a final, sinister metamorphosis. The bolla sheds its skin one last time and emerges as a kulshedra. Kulshedras are just as voracious as their lesser bolla kin, but they are more crafty and wicked. Kulshedras seek to cause strife on as wide a scale as possible, favoring indirect means such as conjuring storms and causing droughts. They enjoy watching desperate communities tear themselves apart. Unlike bollas, kulshedras do not hibernate, and they instead spend their time plotting the destruction of nearby communities. Kulshedras are bollas with the giant and fiendish simple templates. They gain an additional +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple foes due to their many tongues and gain [control weather](unknown:control_weather) as a spell-like ability usable once per day."

				"Predators of the oceans, the hulking undead monstrosities known as bone ships leave devastation in their bloody wakes. Formed from the collective consciousnesses of dead sailors bound within the bleached bones of giant aquatic creatures, bone ships hunt the seas without mercy, destroying ships and slaying the living wherever they are encountered. Bone ships stalk their prey with tenacious intelligence and single-minded purpose. They often trail their quarry for days, relishing the terror their sudden appearance on the horizon causes, and have even been known to continue the chase on land, the many bones of their hulls pulling them over the ground. Bone ships do not care for plunder, seeking only to add more victims to their unholy crews.",
				"",
				"The creation of a bone ship can occur in many different ways. Some bone ships arise as servants of evil gods, pawns to their vile wills. Certain powerful necromantic rituals can also create bone ships. Such rituals typically require those performing them to sacrifice dozens of humanoid creatures and trap the victims' souls. Other bone ships result from ships being destroyed in horrific and catastrophic events. The souls of the sailors who died in such a disaster, unable to find peace, slowly form a bone ship on the ocean's bottom before rising to the surface to take vengeance on the living. No matter how they're created, bone ships retain jumbled memories of the previous lives of the souls bound to them-though all bone ships attack any creatures they encounter, each ship's unique origin and collection of souls burns a particular objective into its very nature. A bone ship created by an evil god might target ships bearing the flags of an opposing faith or enemy of that god, while a bone ship created in a ritual is ingrained with a specific purpose that forces it to enact its creator's will. Certain bone ships viciously target ships from one or more nations, either those from the dead sailors' former nation if they seek revenge, or those from a rival nation the sailors hated in life.",
				"",
				"Over time, legends and stories about a bone ship's capacity for destruction arise. A bone ship never takes a name for itself, but living sailors may ascribe it an epithet based on its origin, purpose, unique characteristics, or notable attacks. Though all bone ships possess the same abilities, a particular bone ship can be identified by its hunting area and appearance. Bone ships eventually display certain unique features such as glowing barnacles that cover its hull, a masthead featuring the skull of a particular sea creature, the bones of a unique and rare sea monster, or an unusual configuration of the musculature holding together its hull. Many of these changes are the result of a bone ship scavenging remains off the ocean floor to repair itself.",

				"No living crew-or even other undead creatures-have ever been seen sailing in a bone ship. These undead ships operate independently, and don't form alliances even with others of their kind. Merely attempting to communicate with a bone ship is dangerous, as even such means as telepathy produce only the howling voices of the suffering, ghostly crew, spreading their insanity to those foolish enough to contact them.",
				"",
				"Though a bone ship is a single creature, the numerous souls it contains create a hive mind. A bone ship can reshape certain aspects of its hull by using its knotted muscle to move the bones within it. This transformative ability allows a bone ship to quickly sprout cannons from its hull that can attack in any direction, and each ship keeps a collection of bones and debris within its own body to use as ammunition. It can also tap into the unholy energy giving it unlife to fire a devastating beam of negative energy at its enemies, and those who close with a bone ship find that even its hull has the ability to drain away life force."

				"Arising from the bones sloughed from mortal bodies by souls moving on to their final planar destinations, bonewrought willows grow in lonely places in the Boneyard. Despite their undead appearance, these trees are actually alive, growing in the shape of weeping willows to symbolize the loss associated with the deaths that created them. Stray soul fragments remain in a bonewrought willow, giving it a dim intelligence and a keen awareness of living and undead creatures in its vicinity. Bonewrought willows serve as protectors of the dead. They often distrust the living and shake their rattling branches to scare such creatures away. When pressed into combat, a bonewrought willow usually starts by disgorging a spray of partially digested bone fragments at its enemies and then follows up with slam attacks.",
				"",
				"A bonewrought willow stands between 12 and 15 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.",
				"",
				"Bonewrought willows originated centuries ago in the Boneyard as skeletal echoes of Material Plane willows. [Psychopomps](unknown:Psychopomps) discovered these willows and carefully tended them, appreciating the trees' deep respect for the dead. The spiritual remains contained within these first trees found fertile ground in the Boneyard, allowing for new bonewrought willows to grow on their own. Today, entire copses of the trees thrive in the Boneyard, particularly in the region known as the Graveyard of Souls. Bonewrought willows produce tiny seeds that can drift for many years; a rare few of these blow through portals to other worlds and sprout near large concentrations of bones.",
				"",
				"Despite their bony appearance, bonewrought willows are living plants. They share many traits with undead creatures, due to their close association with the dead of the Boneyard, but they require sustenance to survive. Bonewrought willows do not draw nutrients from the soil through their roots; their rootlike appendages are actually phalanges that provide them with surprising mobility. Instead, they gain sustenance by absorbing bone matter. A bonewrought willow requires bones equivalent in size to a human skeleton each month; failure to meet this dietary minimum robs a bonewrought willow of its spray of splintered bones ability, and several months of nutritional deprivation causes the tree to starve to death. Hungry trees range far in search of bones to consume and might become desperate enough to hunt prey.",
				"",
				"Bonewrought willows also need light, but not necessarily sunlight, to survive; the moon that looms over the Boneyard is sufficient for their needs. Willows in perpetual shadow sag noticeably, their bark becoming brittle and their fronds sweeping listlessly along the ground. These light-starved bonewrought willows might shamble toward a bright light source, which can be an unpleasant surprise for a traveler carrying illumination.",
				"",
				"Bonewrought willows typically require 15 years to reach full size. During this time, the willows move erratically, if at all, and die if not planted where many bones are within easy reach. As they consume bones, bonewrought willows also acquire faint psychic impressions of the souls echoing in those bones; over many years, these impressions coalesce into a gestalt personality reflective of the willow's meals. A bonewrought willow grown in a corpse-strewn battlefield might be particularly aggressive, while one grown in a monastery's ossuary might be introspective.",
				"",
				"Although they protect caches of dead bodies to secure their food sources, bonewrought willows also instinctively protect spirits of the dead. Ghosts and other lost souls can find comfort and shelter beneath the willow's bony fronds, as the tree turns other creatures away from its spectral charges. When they grow in other planes, bonewrought willows extend their sheltering protection to creatures other than spirits. On Golarion, the willows harbor animals of every kind, and it's not uncommon to find birds' nests among the willows' bony branches or arboreal animals lairing in a bony bole.",
				"",
				"Bonewrought willows live for multiple centuries. Older willows are distinguishable from younger specimens by the yellowing bones in the branches, although the bones at the tips of branches remain in the best condition regardless of the willow's age."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Bonewrought willows primarily grow in the Boneyard, where they protect souls awaiting a final planar assignment. Many psychopomps cultivate these willows as a hobby or as a way to free up their time to attend to other business without leaving vulnerable souls unprotected. Some psychopomps teach their bonewrought willows specific frond movements to indicate agreement, pleasure, or alarm. Far cleverer than many other plant creatures, the willows often extrapolate these movements to an entire sign language, and they have been seen teaching this language to other bonewrought willows.",
				"",
				"Many souls wandering the Boneyard have not yet accepted their fate among the dead. These souls frequently see bonewrought willows as safe and comfortable places to stop and rest, even mistaking them to be ordinary willow trees despite their macabre appearance. Often, this sheltered respite is sufficient for a reluctant soul to realize its condition and come to terms with its recent demise.",
				"",
				"Clever or persuasive undead creatures sometimes trick bonewrought willows into acting as bodyguards. Although the trees have an instinctive desire to protect dead creatures from the living, they eventually abandon a ward that continually places them in danger. Particularly mistreated willows might turn on their charges entirely.",
				"",
				"Because they retain echoes of different souls from the bones they consume, bonewrought willows can be targets of spells that seek a corpse's knowledge such as [speak with dead](unknown:speak_with_dead). Although a bonewrought willow's responses are often more fragmented than normal for such a spell, it responds to questions in a deep, hollow voice. Bonewrought willows do not speak except when responding to spells."

				"A stain on the land it infests, a brambleblight slowly alters its environment, infecting the local vegetation with sickness through its blight aura. When the native vegetation dies, the area becomes choked with slashing plants tangled together much like a giant briar patch. It is within this prickly terrain that the brambleblight dwells. Where most would find themselves at the mercy of the hungry barbs found within this thorn-filled region, the brambleblight traverses this area with ease. A brambleblight is a deviant thing of decay, a tangle of rotting vegetation rising in a roughly pyramidal heap, crowned with an asymmetrical cluster of berry-red eyes. Its main body resembles a bundle of fetid mulch with several thorn-covered branches spilling forth like the intestines of a gutted pig. These branches provide the plant with locomotion akin to that of a slithering serpent.",
				"",
				"A brambleblight typically covers an area about 10 feet in diameter. From the creature's base to its crown of crimson eyes, it piles upon itself to a height of no more than 10 feet. A brambleblight weighs about 500 pounds.",
				"",
				"Brambleblights are not native to Golarion. They're believed by some scholars to be a terrible amalgamation of elements from the First World whose sole purpose is to spread decay and rot. The brambleblight attacks with its two primary vines, both covered in thousands of pricking barbs that shred exposed flesh. While the creature prefers to savor the decay of those who close in and succumb to its blight aura, it does have the means to defeat enemies who keep a safe distance. Besides the ability to fling dagger-sized thorns, the plant can also control the many barbed branches that make up its briar patch. While the brambleblight can animate only one branch at a time, that branch attacks independently until either it is destroyed, the brambleblight is slain, or the brambleblight moves out of controlling range.",
				"",
				"Thankfully, brambleblights are not long-lived creatures. Brambleblights tend to live no longer than 5 years; if they survive long enough to reach this age, they attempt to spread up to a dozen seeds in the hope that at least a few of them take root and grow to maturity. The last 6 months of a brambleblight's life are spent feeding on as much prey as possible in order to store up the energy needed to form seeds. These seeds grow along a specialized tendril that allows the brambleblight to fling its seeds hundreds of feet away in a manner similar to its rain of thorns special attack, though with a much greater range. A brambleblight dies shortly after releasing its seeds."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"While brambleblights prosper in the mutable realm of the First World where they originated, they fare well in only a few environments on the Material Plane. They seem to shun brightly lit places and thrive in dim and dank locations such as deep forests, where the thick canopy shields the forest floor from the sun's rays. They also tend to lair near caves and other underground locations. They are rarely found in open plains or forests with thin canopies because these areas tend to spend long periods exposed to sunlight.",
				"",
				"Brambleblights have no interest in others of their kind, and they must continually maintain their altered environments. They are thus reluctant to move to a new area unless their current location is completely depleted of prey. If a brambleblight uproots itself and moves on to another area, the region it blighted soon returns to its previous state. Likewise, when a brambleblight is killed, its tended patch withers and dies within days, eventually giving way once again to native vegetation."

				"Bramblelashes tend to grow in nutrient-rich, loamy soil that is further enhanced by the plants' attacks. As a result, other plants tend to sprout and thrive around them. The fertile clumps of vegetation attract more animals looking to feed, thus bringing in more targets for the bramblelashes to bleed, establishing a symbiotic relationship between the bramblelashes and the other plants.",
				"",
				"Occasionally, other carnivorous plants grow near bramblelashes to increase their own chance of finding prey. Assassin vines and tendriculoses make for a deadly combination with bramblelashes. Xtabays never grow near bramblelashes, however, as the latter's bleed attacks wake xtabays' victims before they can be consumed.",
				"",
				"A bramblelash has no intelligence and mindlessly attacks anything mobile that enters its reach, even creatures like constructs and undead that can't provide the nutrients the plant wants. The sharp leaves of the plant have rudimentary olfactory organs, small nubs that allow it to \"smell\" creatures within 30 feet. However, its tremorsense is much sharper-it senses any movement within 10 feet and immediately lashes out with its thorny vines. As the plant merely responds to stimuli, it has no fear and never attempts to flee.",
				"",
				"The main stalk of a bramblelash is a sinuous woody trunk, slender but tough. The average stalk measures 2-3 inches wide and several feet long. Mature bramblelashes can grow stalks up to 6 feet long. From the main stalk, up to a dozen thin, flexible vines branch off, each one covered in stiff leaves and small, jagged thorns. These thorns often catch in flesh and tear free of the plant, but the bramblelash quickly regrows missing thorns. A bramblelash's thorns are light brown and hooked at the tip, and its leaves are bright green and waxy. Druids and hunters sometimes collect bramblelash leaves and sew them together to make flexible tunics that blend in with local foliage. A tunic made from bramblelash leaves grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks in forests and jungles.",
				"",
				"The bramblelash's thorns contain the creature's seeds. The plant reproduces by attacking animals and lodging its thorns in their hides. When the animals flee, the thorns eventually drop off in new areas and germinate. A newly sprouted bramblelash stays where it grows until its food source dries up (from either a lack of animals traveling through the area or overcrowding in the patch). Once the bramblelash grows hungry enough, it uproots itself and begins traveling slowly through the woods, using its scent ability to follow any traces of fresh blood it encounters.",
				"",
				"If a bramblelash is somehow restrained or sedated, such as by being netted and grappled, a character can safely uproot the plant with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check. Anyone who understands a bramblelash's attack radius can safely avoid being caught in it, and a bramblelash will stay put as long as it's well fed."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Research indicates that bramblelashes are natural plants, not crafted by magic. The plants grow in temperate forests. They can withstand temperatures down to freezing and even survive light snowfalls. The plants do poorly in heat, though, wilting quickly in the summer sun. Bramblelashes can't survive on open plains, even in temperate regions, as the direct sunlight proves too much for them. They thrive in shaded areas beneath larger, overhanging plants.",
				"",
				"Bramblelashes' migrations are guided by instinct, not intelligence. The plants follow the first blood trail they find, regardless of where it leads or what caused the trail. For this reason, bramblelashes sometimes take root on battlefields, by the lairs of dangerous animals, near bandit camps, or even at the scene of a murder. Travelers who can recognize bramblelashes and understand their ecology know to travel carefully in areas where the plants are common, as their presence may signal the activities of larger predators, such as bears and wolves or even owlbears and chimeras.",
				"",
				"Varieties of Bramblelashes",
				"",
				"Other varieties of bramblelashes exist along with the common temperate variety. Plants similar in appearance to bramblelashes have been spotted in tropical jungles, but these plants are much smaller and have developed a poisonous thorn attack. Some botanists theorize that traders from northern climes sometimes bring bramblelash thorns in their clothes to their southern destinations, and that the bramblelashes there are trying to adapt to their new region. Thus far, the tropical bramblelashes have not spread far beyond Sargava, the Shackles, Mediogalti Island, and coastal cities in the Mwangi Expanse, but they could become common cultivars for those looking to harvest poison.",
				"",
				"Subterranean bramblelashes do exist, but these versions don't have any of the lush greenery that their aboveground cousins do. Instead, these bramblelashes resemble tangles of leafless roots protruding from dirt walls or floors. These underground bramblelashes are easier to spot, but have also developed layers of bark to defend themselves from the predators that hunt in such dark places.",
				"",
				"In areas where magical energy has seeped into the earth-such as in ancient ruins; sacred druidic groves; or spell-tainted wastelands like the Mana Wastes, the Worldwound, and Tanglebriar-bramblelashes can swell to much larger sizes. Magic-fed bramblelashes grow up to 12 feet long and can grab and hold smaller creatures with their vines.",

Though humanoids rarely understand the placid race's obscure and alien goals, brethedans do sometimes travel to and even colonize other gaseous worlds, and are believed to be the first creatures to have tamed oma for use as living spaceships. A typical Brethedan is 10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds."

Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades the \"final trick,\" using them only in the direst of consequences.",

They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard, but will harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and tend to avoid farms with dogs.",

				"The bugbear is the largest of the goblinoid races, a lumbering brute that stands at least a head taller than most humans. They are loners, preferring to live and kill on their own rather than form tribes of their own kind, yet it isn't uncommon to find small bands of bugbears working together, or dwelling in goblin or hobgoblin tribes where they function as elite guards or executioners. Bugbears do not form large warrens like goblins or nations like hobgoblins; they prefer smaller-scale mayhem that lets them keep their favorite acts (murder and torture) on a more personal level. Humans are a bugbear's favored prey, and most count the flesh of humanity as a dietary staple. Grisly trophies of ears or fingers are common bugbear decorations.",

				"Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, despite having superficial similarities, each represent a different face of evil. Hobgoblins are ordered and methodical in their evil, forming vast armies, warbands, and despotic nations. Goblins are the primal evil, seeking only cruelty and petty victimization as they can find it, be that among their own kind or against their neighbors. Yet the evil personified by the bugbear may be the most terrifying, for they actively seek to inflict pain and suffering in the most destructive ways possible. When a hobgoblin kills, it's because of tradition and order. When a goblin kills, it's for fun. But when a bugbear holds its blade, it kills only when it can be assured that the murder will cause maximum pain and suffering to those its weapon does not touch; to a bugbear, the true goal of murder is to strike not at the victim, but at those who held the victim dear."

Lacking other food, the bulette might gnaw on inanimate objects, yet for unknown reasons no bulette voluntarily consumes elf flesh-a peccadillo many point to as evidence that elven wizardry was involved in its creation. Dwarves are also rarely eaten by the beasts, though the bulette still slaughters members of either race on sight. Halflings, on the other hand, are among the beast's favorite meals, and no halfling with any sense ventures into bulette country casually.",

One of its favorite tactics is to charge forward and launch itself into the air in order to drop on its prey with all four razor-sharp claws extended. Folklore claims that the flesh behind the beast's dorsal crest is particularly tender, and that those willing and able to wait until the fin is raised in the excitement of combat or mating can target it for a killing blow-yet most who have faced the landshark agree that the best way to win a fight with a bulette is to avoid it entirely."

A bunyip typically inhabits large freshwater inlets or sheltered coastal sea caves where food is plentiful-the bunyip is equally at home in fresh or salt water. It prefers feeding on animals of Small size or larger, though it isn't averse to eating humanoids when presented the opportunity. Bunyips are quite territorial, and readily attack when intruders threaten their hunting grounds. Bunyips mate annually, during the late spring. During this period, bunyips become even more aggressive. After mating, couples split, with the female wandering off to find a place to birth a small litter of four to six pups. Females watch their pups for a few days, until they become independent enough for the mothers to move on.",

The species thrives in numerous ecological climes, from frigid polar fjords to idyllic tropical lagoons. The bunyip is not a deep-sea creature, and even avoids larger freshwater lakes, as it prefers to lurk near shorelines where its favorite food is more common.",
				"",
				"While bunyips vary in appearance, all possess similar basic physical structures. The bunyip's head exhibits strong seal-like features, save for its shark-like jaws. Its upper torso is thick and muscular, with long, fin-like limbs. Some species even have a single, shark-like dorsal fin. The remaining portion of the body extends into a long tail. Those with fur usually only grow a short coat on the upper body in shades of pale gray, brown, or black."

				"Burstigeits were created by the dwarves generations ago to serve as beasts of burden. Bred to withstand the hardships of the Darklands, these pack animals are an integral part of dwarven culture, especially in communities that rely heavily on trade with surface dwellers.",
				"",
				"Burstigeits are sturdy, quadrupedal mammals with broad shoulders. Like boars, burstigeits have thin tails that hang halfway to the ground; tough, bristly hair on their backs; and tusks jutting from their lower jaws. While vaguely similar to massive boars, their hind legs are longer and thicker than those of their porcine cousins. Burstigeits' hooves are also sharper and stronger than those of a boar, letting them climb nearly as well as mountain goats.",
				"",
				"A typical adult burstigeit stands 6 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 1,600 pounds.",
				"",
				"After the dwarves emerged from the Darklands, they set to work building the Sky Citadels, which served as symbols of their strength and power as well as staging points to conduct trade with and defend against surface dwellers. The increased trade brought the dwarves great wealth, but it also put stress on the supply lines that they had relied upon for generations. Hand carts and pack baskets quickly became insufficient for carrying the large quantities of ore, gems, and fine dwarven crafts demanded by their customers in the world above. Though some creatures in the Darklands could be used as pack animals, few of them were suited for travel aboveground, and transferring shipments from deeper communities onto surface-dwelling beasts cost time and money. Efficiency-minded dwarves began searching for beasts that could be bred to better meet their needs.",
				"",
				"The dwarves living within the Sky Citadels had discovered mountain goats and sheep almost immediately upon emerging from the Darklands. Trade with humans soon also brought them into contact with pigs and cows. They saw the benefit of raising these herd animals and cleared flat areas around their mountain homes where the creatures could be put out to pasture. Dwarves living near the surface learned to harvest valuable resources from these animals, and the cleverest among them realized that these beasts had certain characteristics that could prove useful in transporting goods from the deepest mines all the way to distant surface markets.",
				"",
				"Even so, it wasn't until the rulers of Tar Taargadth established a prize for the person who could breed a pack animal that met such a purpose that dwarven druids and wizards began working on the concept in earnest. This spurred quite a bitter competition, with dozens of failed experiments. The dwarves tried numerous approaches, believing that some kind of surface-dwelling animal must be the right foundation upon which to focus their efforts. Dwarves hold burrowing animals, especially badgers, sacred and avoided experimenting on them. Instead, they looked to animals that were capable of living underground for short periods of time, like wild boars, which sometimes move into small caves or dens to avoid predators, especially when mating.",
				"",
				"Eventually, one family's successes rose above all others, the members' work earning them both the prize money and the prestige that came with it. The beast they created through natural breeding and magical influence was the burstigeit, occasionally referred to as a \"bristled goat.\"",
				"",
				"The use of magic, and perhaps infusions of the strange energies that can influence life in the Darklands, imbued the burstigeit with useful traits, including the ability to carry even greater loads for long periods of time. Burstigeits also developed the ability to tolerate both the extreme heat of forges and deep tunnels and the harsh cold of the high mountains and frozen climes. With these hardy workers to help them, the dwarves could at last carry raw ore from the deepest regions of the Darklands and transport materials and crafted goods all over the world."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Burstigeits are similar to the herd animals from which they were bred. Because they are domesticated, their organization is heavily controlled by their breeders, but they generally follow the social structures common to wild boars. Burstigeit herds are dominated by a single, older female and consist primarily of other females and their young. Adult males are separated from the females, except during breeding season, which is in late fall through early winter (Lamashan through Kuthona).",
				"",
				"Burstigeit young are called piglets-though mostly out of convenience, since they aren't pigs. Unlike their parents, whose fur tends to be a uniform gray-brown, the piglets bear light-and-dark horizontal striping. Piglets reach maturity after about a year, at which point most burstigeits are sold.",
				"",
				"Some underground dwarven settlements do keep normal pigs and goats, but must rely on natural or artificial ventilation to keep the livestock's waste from creating unpleasant and dangerous problems. Fortunately, in the case of burstigeits, dwarven ingenuity overcame this challenge. The dwarves feed the creatures a diet of fungus combined with specially grown algae that reduces the smell and toxicity of their waste.",
				"",
				"Being bred in the Darklands, burstigeits do suffer from sensitivity to bright lights. When they travel on the surface, their dwarven keepers fit them with blinders or special headgear with darkened lenses. This measure keeps them calmer and makes it easier for handlers to manage them, but unfortunately makes it harder for the beasts to see predators or other dangers approaching.",
				"",
				"Burstigeits are slightly more stubborn than a typical donkey, and those prone to stereotyping might say that the burstigeits' personality is a reflection of the dwarves who bred them. However, the creatures are slow to anger and don't startle easily; if something does manage to rile them up, they can be quite dangerous. When disturbed, burstigeits unleash a wailing shriek-halfway between a squeal and a scream-that can be unsettling to those who aren't used to being around them.",
				"",
				"While burstigeits are rarely encountered outside of dwarven settlements, the creatures have existed for thousands of years, and occasionally a beast escapes. If the creature manages to survive long enough, it can go wild, and sometimes small groups of surviving beasts gather together. A herd of feral burstigeits can wreak havoc on a Darklands farming community, devastating fungus crops and causing other damage.",
				"",
				"**Variant Burstigeit**",
				"",
				"Burstigeits are mainly used as pack animals, but some breeders have attempted to create versions to use as mounts. A burstigeit's temperament usually dooms such attempts to failure, but there are occasional successes.",
				"",
				"Burstigeit Warbeast (CR 5): Warbeasts are advanced burstigeits bred and trained as combat mounts. In addition to its gore attack, a burstigeit warbeast can use its front hooves to make two secondary natural weapon attacks that each deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage."

				"**Bloodlust (Ex)** When a byakhee successfully bites a living creature, it is swiftly driven to a frenzied bloodlust. For 1 minute after it bites a target, it gains a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against that target. A byakhee has no limit as to how many simultaneous bloodlust targets it can have at any one time, but it generally focuses on the same target once its bloodlust is engaged. It also gains these bonuses on attack and damage rolls against creatures taking bleed damage from any source.",
				"",
				"**Low Metabolism (Ex)** While a byakhee craves blood if it hasn't fed within the last 24 hours, it doesn't suffer any negative effects from starvation, and it can, in theory, survive forever without drinking or feeding. It is immune to effects that induce magical starvation or thirst, yet it still seeks to drink blood whenever it can to sate its desire. Its strange metabolism and body also render it immune to critical hits, sneak attacks, and other forms of precision damage.",
				"",
				"**Starflight (Su)** A byakhee can survive in the void of outer space, and it flies through space at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes it 3d20 months, while a trip beyond normally takes it 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)-provided the byakhee knows the way to its destination.",
				"",
				"**Yellow Sign Affinity (Ex)** A byakhee is immune to the effects of the Yellow Sign, and by concentrating, it can locate the nearest active Yellow Sign as per discern location (CL 20th). When an active Yellow Sign is visible, a byakhee gains fast healing 2 and a +4 enhancement bonus to its Dexterity. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the Yellow Sign spell (see page 72). Inactive Yellow Signs, such as the unholy symbols carried by cultists of Hastur, do not bolster a byakhee, but these creatures generally treat those who openly wear such symbols as allies. A character who displays a Yellow Sign in this manner gains a +5 circumstance bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks against a byakhee."

			"description": [
				"Byakhees are a race of interstellar aberrations that hail from the distant and alien city of Carcosa, where they serve Hastur. Vaguely humanoid in shape, their bodies combine elements of the forms of carrion birds, insects, and mammals, giving an outward appearance that, while horrific, might at first glance seem possible in the natural world. Yet, those who have studied dead byakhees know this to be a lie, for the creatures' bodies hold bizarre organs and masses of unknown tissue that seem to serve no purpose; the further into a byakhee's body one explores, the stranger its entrails become. The fact that portions of its body appear to be decaying or rotting away even as it lives only adds to the mystery of the creature's peculiar anatomy.",
				"",
				"A byakhee is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.",
				"",
				"Scholars have long argued that byakhees' somewhat humanoid shape suggests a relationship to a less aberrant form of life, and that these creatures may once have even been humans. Indeed, byakhees were created from the original human denizens of the ancient city of Alar. When that city declared war upon its neighbor Carcosa, Alar vanished without a trace on the next rising of its planet's red sun. In truth, the city and its citizens did not disappear-they were absorbed and transformed by Carcosa. Alar's inhabitants became the first byakhees, and ever since, their kind has unwaveringly served the lord of Carcosa, the King in Yellow.",
				"",
				"Although a byakhee longs to consume the blood of the living, it doesn't actually ever suffer the effects of thirst or starvation and can live its entire life without ever tasting a drop of blood. Nonetheless, these creatures still feel something akin to hunger-albeit a sensation driven by a mental impulse other than a biological imperative. Some scholars theorize that this hunger is nothing more than a remnant from the race's past, a sort of ancestral memory of starvation, perhaps, that drives them to drink blood out of a psychological need rather than a physical one. Certainly, byakhees' bloodlust is a powerful driving force; once a byakhee has bitten a foe, it has difficulty thinking of anything other than latching on and drinking its victim dry.",
				"",
				"Byakhees' ability to fly between worlds through the depths of space is shared by several other types of creatures, many of which are tied in similar ways to the Elder Mythos. They are often called upon by spellcasters who use rare or forbidden magic to take advantage of such transport, yet unlike shantaks, who can impart some of their defenses against the depths of space to those they carry through the gulfs between worlds, byakhees can offer no such protection. The creatures delight in carrying ignorant spellcasters into the cold, airless void when foolishly commanded, as they feel no need to warn their wouldbe passengers of the dangers of interstellar travel.",
				"",
				"A byakhee can live for centuries, although most perish from violence before attaining such an age."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Byakhees serve Hastur, his cult, and the city of Carcosa, driven by an ancient compulsion that is still as much a part of what they are as their claws and wings. The rare byakhees that manage to ignore this urge in order to serve another master-or even more remarkably, to obey no master at all-are particularly hated by other byakhees, and no efforts are spared in the pursuit of such enemies of Carcosa when their existence is exposed.",
				"",
				"Priests of Hastur can conjure byakhees with the proper magic, as can spellcasters who use rare and eldritch spells (such as contact entity I, found on page 113 of Pathfinder RPG Horror Adventures, which uses a silver whistle as the material component). Once called to a new world to serve the cult of the King in Yellow, byakhees are quick to establish a colony. Young are hatched from noxious, leathery eggs and grow to maturity over the course of only a few weeks. Yet, once a local byakhee population reaches a few dozen, they lose the drive to procreate entirely. Only in rare cases, such as within the streets of the alien city of Carcosa or on worlds that have fallen fully under Hastur's control, are byakhees encountered in significantly larger numbers.",
				"",
				"Despite their bestial appearance, byakhees are as smart as the typical human and much wiser and charismatic than most. As such, it isn't uncommon for leaders among their kind to grow in power by gaining class levels. Byakhees can excel in most classes, although they tend to avoid taking levels in classes that grant companions, mounts, or familiars' they find the presence of creatures from the natural world unpleasant at best. Most byakhees that take class levels do so as barbarians, clerics of Hastur, psychics, or sorcerers with the aberrant or starsoul bloodlines.",
				"",
				"**Origins**",
				"",
				"The byakhee has been a staple of Lovecraftian RPGs in large part due to their inclusion in Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu Roleplaying Game, and it is Sandy Petersen's take on byakhees that largely inspired their Pathfinder incarnation. The creatures first appeared in print in August Derleth's short story, \"The House on Curwen Street.\" They never actually appeared in any of Lovecraft's writings, although Chaosium has taken the description of the nameless creatures from Lovecraft's short story \"The Festival\" as the basis for the monster's strange appearance."

If it is killed in a space already occupied by brown mold, that mold patch doubles in size just as though fire had been brought near.

Yet, what few beside the wariest hunters and most knowledgeable denizens of the forests realize is that hail lilies are more than mere flowers-their fully grown varieties possess not only a deadly way of spreading their frozen seeds but also an even more dangerous trait: thought. Known among their own kind as calathgars, these ice-tinged plants move slowly and possess little in the way of society, yet they perceive their surroundings, know when their frigid gardens are threatened, feel pain, and-most tenaciously- seek a chilling revenge when their young are despoiled.",

If the vine tendril is severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new grapple is established.",

If one of these vines is destroyed, the canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to bring it to bear in combat."
			],
			"description": [
				"A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semisentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed.",
				"",
				"The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available.",
				"",
				"Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper.",
				"",
				"While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils.",
				"",
				"A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures-such as small monkeys-can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size.",
				"",
				"Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouflage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape.",
				"",
				"A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures."

Alone, an undead crow or vulture is little more than a hideous mockery, but in rare cases where ghoulish activity is thick, entire colonies of carrion birds can succumb to undeath, retaining their flock mentality yet no longer seeking the flesh of the freshly dead to sate their hunger. Carrionstorms, as these flocks of undead birds are called, find brief respite from their morbid hunger only when their meals are warm and screaming.",

				"",
				"Although the individual undead birds that make up a carrionstorm are little more intelligent than they were in life, as a whole, a carrionstorm forms a rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a slight bit more intellect than the typical bird. This not only allows the undead birds to utilize basic tactics, but allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and superstitious communities."

Each caryatid column is programmed to guard an object or area when created, and once set, this command cannot be changed.

Arming a caryatid column with magical weapons is expensive but feasible-even the most powerful of magic weapons appear as nothing more than stone when held by a caryatid column. Since a weapon held in this manner does not radiate magic, many use this trait as a method to hide potent or powerful weapons from both casual observation and study via detect magic. True seeing reveals such disguised weapons for what they really are. Often, only particularly powerful caryatid columns (typically those with advanced Hit Dice, but rarely those made much larger than Medium size) are entrusted with the care and protection of such weapons. Of course, the constructs themselves make full use of any magic weapons they are given to guard."

With their advanced psychic powers and combat abilities, these elite individuals range farthest from the hive in their search for esoteric knowledge, or directly guard and care for their hive's chrestomath. Yet while this might seem like a case of the most important jobs going to the most powerful individuals, the truth is in fact the opposite: subsisting on the best psychic energy or remaining in closest proximity to the intense volume of thoughts that constantly passes through a chrestomath empowers individual caulborn, allowing them to grow into full thoughtkeeper status. Physically, thoughtkeepers resemble other caulborn-they bear no special markings or badges of office, and in fact are treated no differently by their peers outside of their utilization, as within the hive mind they're simply seen as stronger appendages of the same greater being.",

				"The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races. While the most common caulborn are the humanoid versions, there exists a second kind as well: the bloated and blind intelligences called chrestomaths, sometimes referred to as living libraries, or simply \"brain-sacks.\"",
				"",
				"Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder-and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive's massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they've stolen from others. Indeed, it's possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race's mysterious origins.",
				"",
				"A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk. These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as mage hand to affect their surroundings.",
				"",
				"Every caulborn colony has at least one chrestomath, but these creatures are made, not born. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn select several of their own members via criteria unique to each colony. These chosen individuals are promptly disassembled and rendered down in a solemn ritual, their living organs melded together into a single blob of curdled flesh. The resulting protoplasmic sack has no outside sensory organs or useful manipulating appendages, only a massive intelligence whose psychic abilities increase even as the world around it loses relevance, the isolation honing its intellect.",
				"",
				"Once the brain sack is complete, the caulborn seed it with every fact and record at the colony's disposal, usually copying knowledge over from other chrestomaths. Though their psychic abilities give chrestomaths the ability to float sluggishly through the air, most caulborn consider this a waste of the organic thinking machines' time, and instead assign teams of humanoid caulborn to carry the living data centers around in palanquins or set them up in vast chapels.",
				"",
				"Chrestomaths are completely dependent on their kin for survival. Just as normal caulborn consume the psychic energy of other races through stolen ideas and concepts, chrestomaths are unable to feed directly from the source creatures, instead requiring their less intelligent brethren to regurgitate the predigested knowledge for them, sometimes also injecting them with additional nutrients and magical concoctions.",
				"",
				"While any caulborn within range may access a chrestomath's memory, this information can be devastating to other creatures. In addition to its normal telepathy and mind-reading, a chrestomath confronted with dangerous creatures can establish a psychic link through which it pushes huge amounts of information. The recipients of this attack find their brains overloaded by the tidal wave of knowledge, rendering them catatonic or violently insane."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"While most chrestomaths have very little personality, any traces of identity being consumed by oceans of information, some eventually grow to control the data stored inside them and reestablish some semblance of self. One of the best such examples is Anamnesis, the One That Watches. As the heart of Xavorax, the city of caulborn and vampires deep below Kaer Maga, Anamnesis may well be one of the most learned entities on the face of Golarion, its thoughts and motives far beyond human comprehension. To outsiders, the thousands of pounds of flesh might seem barely sentient, capable only of shifting its colors to reflect emotions. Yet whether it's slave or master-or perhaps both-the lord of the Quivering Palace influences all the residents of Xavorax, watching over them as the central relay of their hive mind and the repository of all their race holds dear.",
				"",
				"While parasitic by nature, caulborn are not necessarily predatory, and aren't above trading for the sustenance they need. When they do so, it's often as prophets, a role in which chrestomaths are singularly important. Left with nothing but godlike memories and an ability to analyze information, chrestomaths are often able to extrapolate from trends and make logical connections that result in uncannily accurate predictions about future events."

A creature that fails the save is teleported 60 feet toward the cauldron bloom; if this would bring a creature or object within 30 feet of the cauldron bloom, it is instead teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Projecting targeted strands is a standard action and forces one creature within 360 feet to attempt a DC 23 Fortitude save. If the creature fails, it is teleported into the cauldron bloom's stomach. Targets must be at least one size category smaller than the cauldron bloom, and this ability attempts to teleport the closest creature first.

				"Cauldron blooms are immense, slow-moving subterranean plants that maintain their arcane metabolisms by consuming massive quantities of blood. They dwell in cold environs, typically along the migration routes of herd animals, and slowly teleport to new locations in search of food. Feeding cauldron blooms generally erupt from the ground in the midst of such herds. The animals- panicked cries are cut short when the terrified individuals wink out of existence, reappearing a moment later inside the cauldron bloom's otherworldly guts. Arcane winds within the cauldron bloom's stomach rapidly draw the blood from ingested prey, shred their bodies, and leave nothing behind. A particularly hungry cauldron bloom can systematically consume entire herds of animals, or sequester one individual-such as an unlucky giant or megafauna-inside its stomach. The prey's blood fuels the plant's magical physiology, casting flickering arcane light as it distributes throughout the cauldron bloom's body.",
				"",
				"Typically, cauldron blooms live for hundreds of years. Their bodies are around 15 feet in diameter and weigh upward of 80 tons.",
				"",
				"Cauldron blooms do not feed in a traditional sense. Instead, they wrap potential prey in invisible threads of magical energy. Snared creatures are teleported directly into the blooms' stomachs, where interior winds swirl in a roaring arcane centrifuge that forcibly extracts prey's blood and quickly renders any mundane organic material to a fine powder. Equipment and magical oddities are left behind, however, meaning clouds of manufactured shrapnel circulate within most older cauldron blooms.",
				"",
				"Cauldron blooms most often dwell in cold regions. A consistent diet of blood is necessary for them to maintain a healthy and elevated internal temperature. They use their innate teleportation abilities to jump between subterranean points in pursuit of herding prey. Cauldron blooms give little sign of their presence while beneath the ground, and their senses are highly attuned to surface vibrations."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Curiously, despite their warm-blooded nature and massive size, cauldron blooms don't exude heat. This allows them to go largely undetected between feedings. Their petals are also dexterous and quiet enough that their slow burrowing doesn't alert surface-dwellers. Intelligent, meticulous planners, most of these giant plants use their stealth to actively cultivate herds of prey animals. Cauldron blooms may divert water, manage predator populations, and engage in similar protective activities to ensure a long-term food supply.",
				"",
				"The plants' unique method of locomotion means their habitats are pocked with incongruous subsurface materials. A marsh, for instance, may have a stand-alone deposit of dense stone, and a few settlements are even founded on such locations. A dead cauldron bloom, however, may be a hazard to the local environment, as its decay slowly turns the area into a giant sinkhole; a hole above a particularly ancient cauldron bloom eventually reveals a treasure trove of collected objects within the dead creature's gut.",
				"",
				"Their heightened intellects mean that cauldron blooms are generally quite knowledgeable about local terrain, fauna, and even historical events, though such information is presented through the unique filter of a subterranean carnivorous plant. One historical record even describes a cauldron bloom with heightened telekinetic abilities working alongside smaller beings to build and protect an entire city; the report's veracity is the subject of ongoing and lively academic debate."

				"The cave fisher is a highly specialized predator that dwells in caves. The creature's mode of hunting is unique-it clambers up a cave wall to settle on a ledge or in a crack, typically at a height of at least 30 feet. Ledges overlooking bridges and lower ledges overlooking chasms are favored hunting grounds for the cave fisher. The creature lies in wait until prey approaches within 60 feet, at which point it extrudes a thin cord of silk at blinding speed, lashing at the target as with a whip. The filament is incredibly sticky, and once the fisher strikes food with it, it reels in its meal to feed, trusting its position on a higher ledge to prevent any allies the meal may have from molesting it as it eats. Collections of bones and lengths of discarded filaments are sure signs of cave fisher habitation.",
				"",
				"A cave fisher produces its filament from glands in its body; when it reels in a victim, it generally eats the filament along with its meal. It's impossible to harvest new filaments from a dead cave fisher, but filaments harvested from living ones are incredibly light and strong, functioning as silk rope once the sticky adhesive on a length decomposes (which generally takes 3d6 minutes). A cave fisher's filament glands are useful in constructing sovereign glue and similar sticky magical items. A single cave fisher's glands count as 100 gp worth of raw materials, offsetting the total cost of the item's final creation.",
				"",
				"Although cave fishers have many superficial similarities to crabs, they do not fare well in water and aren't very good swimmers. Nevertheless, many cave fishers lair upon ledges overlooking swift-flowing subterranean rivers, giving them a relatively steady stream of food, especially in cases where such rivers are used as trade routes. Those who ply these rivers frequently travel with a few spare slaves or some unwanted livestock, and when they approach a known cave fisher haunt, they send down the unfortunate animal or slave on a raft to distract the monster's hunger.",

Centaurs typically live to be about 60 years old.",

While the majority of centaurs still live in tribes roaming vast plains or the fringes of eldritch forests, many have abandoned the isolationist ways of their ancestors to walk among the more cosmopolitan cities of the world. Often such free-spirited centaurs are considered outcasts and are shunned by their own tribes, making the decision to leave a heavy one. In some rare cases, however, whole tribes under progressive leaders have come to trade or make alliances with other humanoid communities-typically elves, but sometimes gnomes, and rarely humans or dwarves. Many races remain wary of centaurs, though, largely due to legends of territorial beastmen and the regular, violent encounters the centaurs have with stubborn settlers and expansionist countries."

				"At the forefront of any centaur army, these idolized warriors epitomize centaur efficacy and glory on the battlefield. When centaurs demand that a conflict be settled by a trial of champions, they select a charger as their champion more often than not. Galloping on ironclad hooves, these shock troops blast into their enemies and trample foes in a spray of crimson gore-a gruesome display that's enough to slake almost anyone's thirst for violence. Even young colts and fillies play at being these heroes and leaders during their childhood games. Their prowess is legendary, clans sing of their deeds, and their funeral pyres burn the brightest.",

				"The relative rarity of steel tools among centaurs-with most tribes reluctant to settle down long enough to mine, smelt, or forge metal goods-speaks to the prestige afforded to chargers. Theirs is a lifestyle almost entirely dependant on the settled races they so often clash against. Many chargers depend on elven communities to outfit them, in exchange for using their martial skills to protect a settlement, hunt a menacing beast, or serve short terms as escorts or-most humiliatingly-mounts. Rarer but more terrifying are chargers outfitted by dwarves, who hone their combat skills in dwarven surface wars against orcs and giants.",

				"Inside the hallowed reaches of centaur realms, foragers watch for signs of intruders and prowl their domains looking for game to feed their kin. These centaurs patrol their borders, keeping constant vigil to drive away unwelcome beasts and travelers alike with displays of force, grim warnings, and eventually violence.",
				"",
				"Foragers bring down dangerous beasts and deliver their carcasses to the tribe, providing furs and leather for clothing, bones and sinew for tools, rendered fat for lard and tallow, and a feast if their prey pleases the palate. Keenly aware of their peoples' dependance on the world around them, foragers aim for quick, clean kills and take only enough to satisfy their people's immediate needs. Their preferred prey are creatures disrupting the order they depend on, whether rampaging monsters or human poachers-any creature that takes more than it needs to live calls down the wrath of these silent hunters.",
				"",
				"When responding to sentient intruders, a forager's approach varies widely based on her past experiences with the intruder's kind and the trespassers' attitude and actions. They rarely offer aggressive races, such as goblins and orcs, a chance to parley and instead shoot them down from afar. More approachable races, especially elves and gnomes, are sometimes welcomed into centaur territory. Races that have mixed reputations, such as humans, are met on a cautious case-by-case basis. All too often, the honeyed promises that drip from the mouths of humans fall short of their final treatment of centaurs, and this tarnished relationship has left many tribes bitter toward all of humanity. Those enemies who cannot be warned off or killed are instead avoided, and a forager's secondary role is to scout out lush new pastures for her people to relocate to should enemies endanger their home.",
				"",
				"When travelers respectfully petition centaurs for safe passage through their territory and convince them that no alternative route is available, a tribe may reluctantly grant the strangers' request. However, in exchange for permission, centaurs often demand a toll in the form of a task or favor performed on the tribe's behalf. They most often ask for metal tools and magic that their divine-leaning society can't produce reliably, but may instead request that adventurers destroy a local threat. Even with tribal approval to enter centaur lands, outsiders can expect their every step to be watched by the tribe's foragers' whether the interlopers can see their centaur observers or not."

Centaur greenspeakers hold sway in these spaces, delivering sermons in open fields under both the midday sun and the twilight sky. Here tribes celebrate weddings, harvests, and births under the sun's warm glow, and perform rites of adulthood, rituals to bring luck before a battle, and homages to the tribe's ancestors under the sparse light of the moon and stars. Of these celebrations, centaurs revere none more than the death rites their greenspeakers provide for fallen clan members. When the sun sets, the greenspeakers light a great pyre to release the deceased's spirit from her mortal flesh. After the pyre burns through the night and the sun's first rays crest the horizon, the fallen centaur's kin collect the ashes and fertilize the fields with them so that the dead may serve the world anew.",

				"Horrifying amalgams driven by an insatiable desire to kill living things and collect their bones, centianimas exemplify the ravenous, ugly evil of the undead. These animalistic collections of bones typically form from the remains of numerous animals that died in terrible agony. The dark forces and suffering that animates these remains typically cause these horrors to form in ominous, multilimbed shapes vaguely reminiscent of macabre centipedes. Although they look merely like heaps of bones when at rest, they can hardly be mistaken as such when on the move. Centianimas are possessed of a dark, predatory cunning that makes them particularly efficient hunters.",
				"",
				"A centianima measures 12 feet long and weighs approximately 400 pounds.",
				"",
				"The flexible body of a centianima consists of 15 or more leg-bearing segments made from fused-together bones. Centianimas require no sustenance, but they sometimes carry their dead or unconscious victims back to their lairs in their hollow interiors. Their pointy-tipped legs are exceptionally flexible, allowing them to rapidly change the direction of their movement or even skitter sideways in an undulating motion. Each of a centianima's two heads consists of one or more animal skulls fused together and sports a pair of long, jointed antennae. Their eye sockets each bear a dark violet necromantic membrane that functions much like the eyes of a spider.",
				"",
				"Centianimas sometimes form spontaneously in places where animals have died in great numbers and no one has buried, burned, or eaten the bones, such as abandoned slaughterhouses and the charnel pits of greater monsters. When a centianima's body starts forming, it first develops a skeletal segment and grows a pair of twitching legs. This process repeats until the body has at least 15 segments. The final stage of this horrible genesis involves forming a head segment on each end. The heads do not form simultaneously, however, and for a brief period, the centianima has only one head.",
				"",
				"As undead creatures, centianimas do not need rest and thus remain active day and night. However, their behavior changes markedly with the time of the day. At night, they hunt vertebrates of all sizes, from mice to horses. During the day, they skitter over the bodies they have captured, skinning them and stripping them of flesh. A centianimas's daytime activities also include patrolling its lair and environs, organizing its bone collection, and moving loose rocks to places where they might hinder intruders but not the centianima itself. Centianimas that live underground exhibit similar behaviors, though they adapt their daily cycles to hunt when prey is most vulnerable, regardless of the time of the day."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Centianimas usually inhabit ruined buildings where there are many places to hide. They are excellent climbers and, thanks to their flexible exoskeletons, they can crawl through very narrow spaces. They use these abilities to great effect against invaders, ambushing unwelcome visitors in places where less agile beings are at a disadvantage.",
				"",
				"The lair of a centianima usually contains one or more piles of bones collected from its victims. The bones may be meticulously organized according to animal or bone type, or they may be a disorganized mess. Somewhere in the lair, usually a good distance from the bone piles, there is also a rotting mound of discarded flesh, skin, tendon, and other soft tissue.",
				"",
				"Centianimas are solitary and territorial, and when one encounters boneless creatures, other undead monsters, or anything that looks too dangerous to attack, it emits an unpleasant chitter that sounds like grinding teeth. If the sound is not enough to warn the intruders away, the centianima attacks or retreats depending on the size and number of the intruders.",
				"",
				"The rotting mounds of flesh usually present in a centianima's lair attract all kinds of vermin, and it is not uncommon for swarms of cockroaches, spiders, centipedes, or flesh-eating worms to share a centianima's lair. The undead creature largely ignores these vermin because they neither have bones nor pose a threat."
			],
			"creating": [
				"Centianimas are often created by wicked spellcasters who either seek a free-roaming guardian to defend an area or have a grudge against nature. A centianima can be produced through the use of the spell create undead by any caster of 13th-level or higher. However, rather than casting the spell on one corpse, the creator must cast it on a heap of bones comprising the skeletons of no fewer than three Medium or Large animals. Smaller skeletons can be used, but at least double the number is required.",
				"",
				"Upon being created, an uncontrolled centianima searches the surrounding area for a lair. After finding a suitable dark, preferably claustrophobic space, the creature begins hunting in a territory within a 1 mile radius of its lair. In a region with an average amount of wildlife, it takes little more than 2 weeks for a centianima to fill its lair with a dense carpet of bones.",
				"",
				"**Centianima Variants**",
				"",
				"The circumstances under which a centianima forms greatly affect its abilities. The following are the most common variants.",
				"",
				"**Aquatic (CR +0):** These centianimas arise from the bones of aquatic animals. They usually inhabit sunken ships and ruins claimed by the sea. Aquatic centianimas gain the aquatic subtype and a swim speed of 40 feet. Burrowing (CR +0): This underground variant usually arises from the dry bones of many burrowing creatures. Burrowing centianimas gain a burrow speed of 20 feet. Chittering (CR +1): This variant centianima can emit a bone-rattling chitter as a standard action. Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1d4+1 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against the effect is immune to that centianima's chitter for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Jumping (CR +0): This desert-dwelling variant gains a +12 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump and it treats any Acrobatics skill check to jump, as if it had a running start. It doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity while jumping. A jumping centianima uses this ability to position itself amid its enemies so it can better attack with both of its heads. One-Headed (CR -1): This rare variant occurs when the formation of a centianima is interrupted before the second head has formed. One-headed centianimas have only 3 Hit Dice, and they don't gain all-around vision or the dual threat special ability. Paralytic (CR +1): These centianimas arise from the bones of venomous animals. Any creature that takes damage from the centianima's bite attack must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. Symbiotic (CR +1): These centianimas have formed a close symbiotic relationship with the vermin that feed on the rotting flesh in their lairs. Three times per day, the centianima can vomit up a spider swarm as a standard action. This swarm attacks the nearest living creature, but is otherwise not controlled by the centianima."

				"**Chain Spirit (Su)** As a standard action once per day, a chained spirit can attempt to chain any evil-aligned corporeal creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that it can detect via spiritsense; it need not have line of sight or line of effect to such a creature. The targeted evil creature to must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or take 1d8 points of Charisma drain. On each successful attack, the chained spirit gains 5 temporary hit points. Any creature targeted by this ability is immediately aware of some malevolence attempting to take control of it. If a creature's Charisma score is drained to 0 by this attack, its fate depends on its Hit Dice. If the victim has half the Hit Dice or fewer of the chained spirit (8 Hit Dice for most chained spirits), it is slain by the attack. If the victim has more than 8 Hit Dice, it becomes a spirit anchor linked to the chained spirit (see below). Even though a chained spirit can use this ability once per day, it can create only one spirit anchor per week. In addition, a chained spirit can use this ability only if it currently has three or fewer spirit anchors, and it can never have more than four spirit anchors. A creature with more than half the chained spirit's Hit Dice whose Charisma score is drained to 0 by this attack and who doesn't become a spirit anchor is merely driven unconscious, as per normal for catastrophic Charisma drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. Numerous chains extend from a chained spirit. A number of these (one for every spirit anchor currently tethered to the chained spirit) are corporeal and can make melee attacks. These corporeal chains are treated as evil, magical, [ghost touch](unknown:ghost_touch) weapons and deal bludgeoning damage in addition to Charisma drain. Each chain is treated as if wielded one-handed by a creature with a Strength score of 25. A sundered chain automatically reforms 1 round later.",
				"",
				"**Charisma Drain (Su)** Any creature hit by a chained spirit's chains or incorporeal touch attack must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or take Charisma drain (1 point if struck by a chain, or 1d6 points if struck by a touch attack). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Create Spawn (Su)** Any humanoid slain by a chained spirit becomes a [spectre](unknown:spectre) in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are under the command of the chained spirit that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They don't have any of the abilities they had in life.",
				"",
				"**Spectral Bindings (Su)** A chained spirit is extremely mobile, with only one major hindrance: no matter how far it moves on its turn, as long as it has at least one spirit anchor, it automatically returns to its starting place when its turn ends. This immediate return does not count as an action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, as the spirit simply reappears back in its original position. In essence, the chained spirit is eternally confined to a single square throughout its existence except the distance it can travel in a single round before returning to its starting position. If another creature occupies the space it has left, that creature is shunted to the closest available square. If a solid object occupies its starting square, the spirit's incorporeal nature allows it to return regardless. Even a force effect cannot thwart it as it simply reappears within the square, though if that square is surrounded by a force effect with no exit, the chained spirit is effectively trapped. Spectral Sight (Su) A chained spirit can see and hear through the senses of any of its spirit anchors whenever it wishes, just as if it were using both effects of clairaudience/clairvoyance.",
				"",
				"**Spiritsense (Su)** A chained spirit can detect both the living and the undead. It can detect living creatures within 100 feet, just as if it had [blindsight](unknown:blindsight). It can also sense the dead, as per [detect undead](unknown:detect_undead), to a range of 500 feet."

Such a dishonored spirit returns as a misty approximation of its living form, except now burdened by loops of constricting chains and inescapable locks, all representing its bonds of duty. Reaching out with these chains, these tormented undead claim allies, binding other unwilling sentinels to the same charge with which they are eternally cursed.",
				"",
				"Among the rarest known manifestations of undead, the chained spirit can exist only in an area of extreme misery combined with a potent source of necromantic energy. In the case of Scarwall, the castle's history of violence, combined with the vengeful attention of Zon-Kuthon, made the castle the perfect cradle for the generation of a chained spirit. Others may well exist on Golarion, or could yet come to manifest, but at this point, the chained spirit of Scarwall may be the only one of its kind.",

				"Each time a chained spirit creates a spirit anchor using its chain spirit ability, it gains the following benefits: a +2 profane bonus to Armor Class, fast healing 5, a chain attack, immunity to positive energy, and the spectral sight ability. These benefits stack as appropriate, so a chained spirit with four spirit anchors (the maximum) gains a +8 profane bonus to AC, fast healing 20, four chain attacks, immunity to positive energy, and spectral sight. As long as at least one of its spirit anchors exists, the chained spirit itself cannot be destroyed. If reduced to 0 hit points, the chained spirit reappears with full hit points 1 minute later. A chained spirit can have up to four spirit anchors at any one time. The stats presented above represent a chain spirit with four spirit anchors and include all the associated benefits.",
				"",
				"Losing a Spirit Anchor: If a spirit anchor is destroyed or released, a chained spirit's benefits are reduced as appropriate: its AC is reduced by 2, its fast healing is reduced by 5, and it loses one of its chain attacks. If all of a chained spirit's spirit anchors are destroyed, it gains no profane bonus to AC, has no fast healing, has no chain attacks, can be harmed by positive energy, and loses its spectral sight. It does gain one benefit-when it has no spirit anchors, it is no longer restricted as much by its spectral bindings, and can move throughout the area in which it is bound (up to a radius of 1 mile) without being returned to its starting point at the end of a round. Each time a spirit anchor is destroyed or killed, the chained spirit loses its chain spirit ability for 24 hours.",
				"",
				"Spirit Anchor Effects: A creature that becomes a spirit anchor instantly regains any Charisma drained by the chained spirit to which it is tethered. It is also bound to the location it was at when it was reduced to 0 Charisma by the chained spirit. Spirit anchors typically cannot move farther than 100 feet from this spot, but in the cases of creatures that require wider mobility to fulfill their physical needs, a chained spirit can relax its grip, allowing them to range farther afield. However, the chained spirit can employ a compulsion similar to [geas/quest](unknown:geas/quest) at will, forcing such a spirit anchor to return to its anchor spot. A spirit anchor that ignores the compulsion takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage per day until it returns. The death of the spirit anchor, or the spells [dispel evil](unknown:dispel_evil), [dispel law](unknown:dispel_law), [freedom](unknown:freedom), [miracle](unknown:miracle), or [wish](unknown:wish), can release a spirit anchor. Beyond this restraint, a chained spirit holds no special control over its spirit anchors."

They may encourage growth in the wilderness, blight the croplands around Mwangi villages, and carefully husband wild monsters, forcing the wild world into bloody competition with human settlements. Such wild hermits exchange a cleric of Angazhan's normal spells for ones to help them contain, augment, and direct the natural world, using stone shape and glyph of warding to fashion animal traps, sanctuary to move unharmed among wild beasts, and bear's endurance and bull's strength to augment their vile creations before launching them into combat.",

Angazhan is said to occasionally look upon the realm and reward the most productive creators of these chaotic totems of decay with his fiendish blessing. The charau-ka's already fiercely territorial nature rises to unbridled levels when tribes compete to gain their god's favor."

They suffered severe casualties but absconded with scores of guns. Ruthazek then handpicked several dozen promising ape-men to master the weapons, creating an elite caste of assassins, monster wranglers, and bounty hunters. Many warriors managed to survive this unorthodox training and now wander the jungle at Ruthazek's command, eliminating Usaro's enemies, retrieving fugitive slaves, and stocking the beast pits. The Gorilla King takes a special joy in sending his technological marvels to eliminate mages and healers.",

Priests of Angazhan instilled a strong sense of survival in these sharpshooters, who show surprising restraint for charau-ka. The telltale frenzy of their kin surfaces only when enemies draw close to these gunslingers, and several have broken their muskets bludgeoning foes to death, only to suffer horrible reprimands for their carelessness. Those who keep their rage tempered travel far beyond the borders of the Gorilla King's realm, searching Golarion for anything their sovereign requires. Loyal to the very core, these charau-ka never reveal what they seek until it lies within their sights."

Though they are able to work in concert as a cohesive whole, they are also able to separate their actions at will so as to not be impeded by the limitations of a single consciousness, effectively allowing them to focus on two things at once. As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two spell-like abilities in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other fullfound actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy). While part of the creature's sentience may be affected by a turn attempt, there are enough unaffected intellects within to override the effect.",

A victim of a mind feed attempt must succeed at a DC 38 Will save each round that the ability is used. On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage per round. If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature's mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim's memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a wish or miracle. If the charnel colossus has grappled multiple victims, it can attempt multiple mind feeds in a single round. The save DC is Wisdom-based.",
				"",
				"**Voice of the Ancients (Su)** A charnel colossus can, as a full-round action, cause its collective knowledge to be whispered into the minds of any sentient creature within 100 feet. These whispers riffle through the brain of any such creatures within range in a maddening susurrus. These individuals must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed and frozen in place as if by the hold monster spell. The victim may attempt a new save each round to try and break the effect. ",
				"",
				"Regardless of whether or not the save is successful, the effect leaves an insidious seed implanted in the victim's mind. The day after the save is made, the victim must succeed at a new save or the seed takes root and creates the subconscious compulsion for the victim to return to the charnel colossus at some point in the future. When and how this occurs is up the GM. This compulsion can be removed with a remove curse spell or by destroying the charnel colossus that implanted the compulsion. ",
				"",
				"This is a mind-affecting compulsion and cannot be negated by a silence spell because it is heard directly in the mind of the victim. Each time a creature is subjected to this attack, there is a 1% chance that some of the lost lore transmitted into her mind causes her to gain a permanent +2 bonus to Intelligence. This beneficial side effect can only occur to a creature once. When a charnel colossus uses this ability, it cannot use its spell-like abilities or take other actions in that round.

Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus.",

This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library-if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred-often over a period spanning hundreds of years-creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of any such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror.",
				"",
				"The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable-the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim's own life experience. The colossus can also form two thin tendrils of this charnel stuff in order to lash out and draw prey into its embrace.",

				"**Divine Antithesis (Ex)** A charnel god is immune to any divine spell that allows spell resistance. Additionally, creatures within 60 feet of a charnel god gain spell resistance against divine spells equal to 11 + the charnel god's CR (34 for most charnel gods). Creatures cannot voluntarily lower this spell resistance.",
				"",
				"**Divine Sense (Su)** A charnel god can identify servants of the gods on sight, can immediately determine whether a creature it sees is capable of casting divine spells, and knows the highest level of spell that creature is capable of casting. It gains a +8 insight bonus on all Perception and Sense Motive checks attempted against such targets.",
				"",
				"**Divinity Lost (Su)** A charnel god gains, as spell-like abilities, the domain spells of two domains granted by the deity from which it formed. It can use domain spells of 5th level or lower as at-will spell-like abilities, spells of 6th to 8th level three times per day as spell-like abilities, and 9th level spells once per day as spell-like abilities. The caster level for these abilities equals the charnel god's CR (23 for most charnel gods), and the save DCs are Charisma-based. The charnel god does not gain any of these domains' granted powers. The charnel god presented above has the Death and Chaos domains, and these spell-like abilities are included in its stat block.",
				"",
				"**Favored Weapon (Su)** As a free action, a charnel god can conjure a weapon from the fragments of its former divine power. This weapon is always a +5 unholy weapon of the type favored by the deceased deity. The weapon functions only for the charnel god and vanishes if it leaves the charnel god's possession. Melee weapons created in this way are treated as if they were made of adamantine for the purposes of determining their resistance to damage and their ability to bypass hardness. Ranged weapons created in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity when the charnel god uses them.",
				"",
				"**Hideous Will (Ex)** A charnel god is suffused with profane divine energy. It gains a profane bonus to its AC and Fortitude saving throws equal to its Charisma modifier. Additionally, it uses its Charisma modifier in place of its Constitution modifier when calculating its hit points.",
				"",
				"**Severance (Su)** As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a charnel god can attempt to sever the connection between a creature and its divine patron. The target must be within 60 feet of the charnel god, and it must attempt a DC 35 Will save to avoid being cut off from the divine. If successful, the target cannot be targeted by this ability again for 24 hours. If the target fails, it becomes stunned for 1 round and then permanently staggered thereafter. This ability has no effect on characters who don't have levels in any class that grants divine spellcasting, but it does affect characters who have minimal divine spellcasting abilities, such as paladins or rangers. This is a curse effect. Atonement can remove this effect, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check. The save DC is Charisma-based."

			"description": [
				"The gods are no less strange and terrifying in death than in life. Though the death of any god is staggeringly rare, some do meet violent ends, often at the hands of other deities. When this happens, the deity's death casts fragments of the god's power out among the planes. These fragments are sometimes drawn to places where the god was worshiped in its life, where they can produce miraculous effects, such as striking the god's devout followers deaf or blind, or granting visions of the god's demise. Sometimes these shards of power go unnoticed and boil away into nothing over time. But sometimes, something far more terrible occurs-such fragments can find a new home within a graven image of the former deity, forming a new creature: a charnel god.",
				"",
				"Regardless of the deceased god's alignment or nature, all charnel gods are beings of sublime wickedness fueled by bitter anger. The memory of being killed and cast into the void leaves charnel gods utterly and cruelly insane. Further, they feel the pain of being incomplete, of being only a small portion of what they once were, and this torments them. Charnel gods have some memories of their time as gods, but any recollections are fragmented and muddled. A charnel god might be able to share a hidden secret it knew in its former life, but it could just as easily confuse the details or call forth a false memory, making it an unreliable source of wisdom. Charnel gods resent such questions anyway, as remembering their former lives only reminds them of their pitiful current state.",
				"",
				"Those who believe encountering a charnel god will be a chance to reconnect with a deceased divine patron are in for a rude awakening. Without exception, charnel gods detest any who once worshiped them. Unable to come to terms with the fact that they were defeated, they blame the incompetence or faithlessness of their former worshipers for their deaths. Charnel gods also hate the servants of other deities, though with less fervor than they feel toward their own former followers. To a charnel god, all worshipers are false and deserve to be punished for their lack of loyalty and devotion.",
				"",
				"At the same time, charnel gods long for mortals' worship. Truly, that is a charnel god's greatest wish-to once again be venerated, offered sacrifices, and loved and feared above all else in the world. Charnel gods cannot grant spells like a true deity, and so must rely on their own terrible powers and fearsome demeanor to cow and bully others into worshiping them. Their cults rarely last long, for the charnel god is an easily angered and fickle deity.",
				"",
				"The example charnel god presented here was once a demon lord of the hunt who was slain by a vengeful goddess. When creating a charnel god of a different deity, GMs should replace some or all of the charnel god's feats and skills to better support that deity's favored weapon and fighting style. Likewise, the charnel god's melee attacks should be altered as needed, but the end result should approximate the average damage a CR 23 creature might deal in a round. Note that charnel gods like the one detailed above can attack with their natural attacks as secondary attacks when attacking with ranged weapons.",

The charybdis uses this vortex ability not only to capture prey like sharks or small whales, but also to entrap ships on the ocean surface above. The monster's claws are particularly well suited to puncturing the hulls of ships, and most charybdises have learned that a single large merchant vessel contains enough sailors to make a perfectly sized meal. Often, a charybdis settles in along a well-known shipping route near the shoreline or amid an archipelago of islands where ships are forced along relatively narrow lanes between rocky isles-such locations allow the charybdis to lie in wait and increases the chance of its prey being unable to circumvent its vortex.",

Few who have witnessed the gruesome work of the chemosit survive. Bearing terrible scars, both physical and mental, they recall the creature's utter savagery and inhuman strength. Tribes living in close proximity to chemosits believe them to be the living embodiment of wrathful gods or nature spirits, and pay them grisly sacrifices. In such places, those who suffer the beast's attacks are often blamed for the violence and exiled. In other regions, evil shamans capable of summoning or commanding these beasts gain great power and infamy. It is a common practice for warring tribes to pay such shamans to summon a chemosit to plague the villages of their enemies.",

When a curious or valorous creature investigates, the chitikin erupts in ambush, amplifying its shriek to terrify its meal. Villagers near the Verduran Forest and World's Edge Mountains have countless stories revolving around a lonely traveler who hears someone screaming in pain, either in a cave or otherwise off the beaten path, only to investigate and find this horror waiting for him.",
				"",
				"At a glance, a chitikin might be mistaken for a giant black centipede, with its 15-foot body resting on 18 spindly legs. But unlike its smaller, simpler cousins, a chitikin also has a stinger dripping with venom and two large scythe-like claws. Above its hinged jaw are two glowing bulbs on constantly flicking antennae.",
				"",
				"A full-grown adult chitikin is 15 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds.",
				"",
				"A larval chitikin at first appears to be nothing but a large centipede. It grows quickly, and within a few weeks it wraps itself in a cocoon-like casing, soon emerging several times larger. This process repeats periodically during a chitikin's life cycle, and at later stages, its cocoon might be mistaken for that of the rare giant blue moth; a potent alchemical ingredient. An alchemist who attempts to harvest such a chrysalis often finds he has made a fatal mistake when the chitikins emerges from its cocoon in a ravenous frenzy. The typical adult chitikin molts four times in its life, but there are rumors of a gargantuan specimen that underwent a fifth molting to grow to a fearsome size.",
				"",
				"Chitikins lure their prey by rubbing their antennae together, producing a sound not unlike the incoherent wailing of an innocent in desperate pain. When their prey gets closer, chitikins rise up and emit terrifying screams intended to unnerve their victims. Sages debate whether this behavior evolved naturally, but many layfolk who have survived encounters with the monsters claim they recognized their loved ones' voices and therefore suspect something more sinister at work. Some scholars hypothesize that some of the folktales in small towns warning travelers not to stop to help an injured stranger are cautionary stories based on chitikin attacks.",
				"",
				"Chitikins are careful hunters, preferring to ambush prey they have lured to their lairs. The creatures' multitude of legs and large claws grants them the ability to climb with ease, and they use this mobility to their advantage, clinging to cavern ceilings with most of their legs and reaching down to slash at prey below. In forests, chitikins scramble rapidly between tree trunks and sting targets with their tails, paralyzing the victims long enough to efficiently dismember them.",
				"",
				"Despite their brutal hunting methods, chitikins seem to have a compulsion with cleanliness. They suck away every trace of blood and entrails from their kills, leaving bones that they then crush with their mandibles until even the bones disintegrate. When not hunting or lying in ambush, chitikins repeatedly groom their antennae, claws, and mandibles, and polish their carapaces until they are a bright, gleaming black.",
				"",
				"This grooming behavior becomes more pronounced when a chitikin is ready to lay its eggs. First, it lays them on a wall, dangling off a tree, or in some other elevated location where they remain in stasis. At this stage the egg sac looks almost like a bag of marbles or gems, and the eggs emit a faint blue luminescence. The chitikin cleans the sac constantly, protecting it from scavengers and hunters. If the egg sac touches the ground, the chitikin flies into a rage, attacking any creatures nearby and sometimes chasing them for several miles, her brood forgotten. After this lengthy aerial incubation, the chitikin brings freshly killed prey to its nesting site and carefully implants its eggs in the corpse. After about a month, the eggs hatch and the chitikin larvae feast on the liquefied remains."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Chitikins lead mostly solitary lives at the fringes of civilization, close enough to lure prey but not so close that they attract undue attention. Their nests are often in thick forest canopies, mountain crags, and shallow caves. It's not uncommon for towns near swaths of wild territory to be terrorized by a chitikin for months as it skitters around the periphery, luring unsuspecting townspeople to their doom.",
				"",
				"While its appearance can be unsettling, the most terrifying aspect of this predator is its ability to emulate humanoid screams. The particular scream a chitikin produces is influenced by what it hunts; a chitikin that preys on human villagers sounds much different from one that scours caves for goblin victims. On rare occasions, chitikins living near larger cities learn to mimic the cries of domesticated pets or livestock rather than people, as imitating the latter has the undesirable consequence of summoning city guards, who often prove too troublesome as prey.",
				"",
				"While chitikins are rarely found with others of their own kind, except for brief encounters to mate, they do appear to have an odd fondness for the giant spiders that frequently share their environs. Accounts exist of chitikins grooming such spiders, and the arachnids seem to tolerate the attention. Ettercaps have also been known to share larger lairs with a chitikin, though they do not appear to get the same attention-and when a chitikin is ready to lay eggs, it drives away or eats any ettercaps in the vicinity. Likely thanks to these uneasy truces, adventurers have found webs so often in chitikin lairs that it's widely believed the creatures are capable of spinning the webs themselves, but the closest a chitikin comes to making a web is vomiting up the sticky brown goo it uses to make its cocoon just before molting.",
				"",
				"Chitikins prefer damp, dark places for their lairs. Caves are preferable, but they also live in forests and jungles under the darkest parts of the canopy. The creatures' restless pacing eventually reduces any soil or dirt to very fine powder, and their fastidious nature means there is no blood or gore to betray their presence. A chitikin lair in a forest is often marked by a copse of trees whose trunks are marred by rings gouged into the wood at a variety of heights-a result of the creature's constant movement and a telltale sign of a chitikin's presence to the knowledgeable or wary.",
				"",
				"Chitikin hunting methods inevitably cause the vermin's territory to become less and less fruitful as locals learn to avoid the paths and places from which few lone travelers return. As a result, chitikins move their lairs every few years, migrating by night until they find a suitable new location. Creatures sharing a chitikin's lair sometimes come along on these nocturnal migrations, forming a nightmarish convoy with spiders large and small that ride on the monster's back or scrabble alongside. It is often during these migrations that chitikins encounter another of their kind. If the two are not a mating pair, they fight to the death in a vicious, screaming battle."

				"Underground predators that often dwell on the outskirts of subterranean ruins or in the deep shadows of nameless cavern outposts, chokers lurk in the darkness and lash out with their long, rubbery arms to grasp prey as it passes by. They seldom attack multiple enemies at once, stalking their quarry until they can isolate a weaker victim from its pack.",
				"",
				"Chokers walk with a disturbing, almost comical gait due to their extremely limber legs. Weighing only 35 pounds and standing no taller than a halfling, chokers have no problem skittering across walls and ceilings, often lodging themselves into shadowy corners, tunnel intersections, walls, or staircases. A choker will attempt to grasp creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or smaller.",
				"",
				"Chokers appear to have little culture of their own, gathering only briefly to mate before their wanderlust and hunger spurs them again to a solitary existence. Their just-better-than-animalistic intelligence grants them a fascination with the trappings of society even if they do not truly understand it. Accordingly, the grubby lair of a choker (often situated in a difficult-to-reach nook or cranny) usually contains valuable objects such as rings, brooches, cloak clasps, and loose coins gathered from devoured victims.",
				"",
				"This fascination occasionally compels a choker to abandon its subterranean home for a closer study of the sunlit world's many civilizations. These chokers feel most at home in the darkened narrow alleyways of human cities, squeezing themselves into sewers, forgotten alcoves, barrels, and similar cramped, overlooked spaces. Chokers prefer to keep hidden during the light of day, emerging from their hidey-holes under cover of darkness to hunt for food and cruel pleasure. Favorite tactics include using their long arms to scoop prey off the street from the safety of a nearby rooftop, attacking sleeping families by squeezing through an open chimney, or tapping on a window to bring their curious food within grasping distance."

A creature struck by the shade's incorporeal touch must also save against this effect. Once a creature is affected, it remains shaken as long as it remains within 30 feet of the choking shade.

Until that point, the victim is prevented from breathing or speaking while the undead occupies its lungs. A creature can attempt to cough the shade out of its lungs on its turn as a standard action, but it must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save to do so.

				"Upon rising from death, a choking shade has a tendency to remain near either its grave or the site of its demise. It is not uncommon for these hateful spirits to manifest in a lethal, predatory pack, especially if they died together in the same tragic event. Choking shades who drowned and whose bodies remained in the water most often seek out dry land, but they tend to remain near that body of water, haunting the shoreline in search of potential victims.",
				"",
				"The threat of choking shades has affected the safety of miners and builders for generations. When miners are killed in a cave-in or laborers crushed by a collapsing structure, wise city managers and foremen seek the aid of the clergy to ensure the bodies are excavated and given proper burials. Clerics are often posted to spend some nights at the place of such an unfortunate event as a precaution against an undead infestation at the work site. Laying to rest these desperate, hatefully aggressive spirits is in the service of all those who still draw breath. The most common ritual for this purpose ends by extinguishing a blessed candle, respectfully putting out a flame that feeds on the oxygen the dead were denied.",

				"Variant Choking Shades",
				"",
				"While these several variants of choking shades differ primarily by the nature of their suffocating deaths, the intensity of those deaths and the circumstances of their lives when the air was taken from their lungs make some shades even stronger and fiercer. At minimum, all variants have the advanced template as well as alterations to the gravedust special ability, modified by the circumstances of their deaths. Four are noted below.",
				"",
				"Crushed Shade: Suffocation following a cave-in or the collapse of a structure creates these shades. When a crushed shade is expelled from a host's lungs, the victim must succeed at a Will save against the gravedust's DC or be cursed by a permanent form of claustrophobia: whenever the victim is about to enter a cramped space, crowded venue, or other place from which escape may be difficult, she becomes shaken. The victim can attempt a DC 14 Will save to negate this condition, but failure makes the condition persistent. Even if the victim endures the claustrophobic circumstances with the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition and the threat passes (the crowded disperses or flees, the obstacle is surmounted or avoided), the condition persists until she succeeds at the appropriate saves. This is a curse effect.",
				"",
				"Drowned Shade: Those choking shades whose suffocating deaths occurred in water are even more dreadful. When they are driven from a victim, the muck of the grave remains within the lungs. Victims are nauseated for 1d4 rounds after a drowned shade exits their lungs.",
				"",
				"Smoking Shade: Smoke inhalation within a fire caused the deaths of these choking shades. Each round a smoking shade occupies the lungs of a host, that host also takes 1d4 points of fire damage. After the choking shade is expelled, the victim is staggered from the pain for 1 round.",
				"",
				"Strangled Shade: A strangled shade was asphyxiated by a murderer, and when it invades a victim's lungs, hand-shaped bruises arise on the victim's throat. Each round a strangled shade occupies a host, the victim takes 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, and after the strangled shade is expelled from the lungs, the victim can't speak until an hour passes or receiving any amount of magical healing (whichever comes first)."
			],
			"description": [
				"There is nothing quite like the desperation of a suffocating creature, frantic for one last, sweet breath of air to fill deprived, aching lungs; it is a terrible way to die. There are so many ways to die of suffocation: asphyxiation in a fire, being buried alive, crucifixion, disease, drowning, strangulation-the list seems endless. Sometimes, the terrible imminence filling a person as life ends in so cruel a manner is enough to cause the doomed soul to rise from death as a choking shade.",
				"",
				"Choking shades animate into a swirling swarm of ashes, bone shards, dirt, and dust, assuming a facsimile of a humanoid form. They have a brutish intelligence and are drawn with envy to the breath of living creatures, attacking them on sight. In addition to the dust of the grave, these hateful spirits carry with them the overwhelming fear that accompanied them in their suffocating deaths, and this aura infects those who are near them with this same terror. Choking shades can take advantage of those affected by their fearful auras (or those already under the influence of a fear effect): they enter the victim's lungs, carrying their dusty remains with them, threatening unwilling hosts with the same awful deaths that they endured. Anyone slain by the choking essence of these undead creatures rises as one of their number, seeking retribution for all who are still afforded the freedom to breathe, a luxury taken for granted by the living.",
				"",

They communicate primarily through hand gestures and their constantly changing markings, which can form text or images.

				"**Disrupt Time (Su)** A chronogeist's incorporeal body is warped by the ravages of unstable time. As a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity, a chronogeist can oscillate its essence rapidly between the current temporal landscape and an infinite number of others, passing through the bodies of all corporeal creatures within a 30-foot radius. Affected creatures take 6d6 points of damage (this damage occurs from rapid aging and cell death and doesn't have a damage type). A successful DC 26 Will save negates this damage. Any creature who fails the save is also nauseated for 1 round as a result of the disorienting attack.

Creatures within 30 feet that can hear the screech must attempt a DC 26 Will saving throw. Those that succeed are unaffected, but those that fail superficially age, their muscles and joints locking up and their movement slowing. For the next 3 rounds, affected creatures can move at only half speed, and take a -8 penalty on Strength- and Dexterity-based checks and abilities, including AC, ranged and melee attack and damage rolls, and skill checks. A creature affected by a chronogeist's temporal screech (whether or not its saving throw was successful) can't be affected by it again for the next 24 hours. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The spell still functions as normal, but the chronogeist gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 times the spell's level. These temporary hit points are lost first when the chronogeist takes damage and can stack with each other."

				"When chronogeists arise, they typically haunt the general area of their death, confused and distraught about why they persist. They lose most memories they held in life and become enraged, aggressive threats to any who happen upon their territory, screeching and flying through victims' bodies in an attempt to right the temporal snags and instability that led to their undeath. This doesn't mean that chronogeists are unintelligent, however. Rather, chronogeists exist in a pure state of emotion and denial; they don't understand that a snag in time has prevented their souls' journeys, but are enraged that they're stuck on the Material Plane or elsewhere, so they continue to unleash the temporal dangers within them in fruitless attempts to understand their own natures."

			"habitat": [
				"Chronogeists have no sense of companionship or interpersonal relations. They barely recognize that they're no longer their former mortal selves, and in death have become near-mindless evil creatures. Chronogeists whose progenitor creatures held particularly strong convictions, however, sometimes retain a sliver of an important memory-such as whether they once vowed to protect someone or something with their lives. These chronogeists still typically haunt the relevant areas, and might even still make efforts to fulfill an important vow they made in life, even if they don't recognize why or how they're doing so. These actions typically manifest in tragically ironic forms, such as a chronogeist forgetting entirely why it's protecting an area even while the subject of its previous concern, such as a precious artifact, lies forgotten in the dust.",
				"",
				"In most cases, it's rare for more than one chronogeist to haunt an area, since the creatures are territorial and are usually tightly tied to the place where they died. In places where temporal events are common or where the fabric of time is unstable, however, many chronogeists might arise spontaneously in a single location. When this happens, these chronogeists tend to move together, roving their territory for intruders or blindly trying to fulfill some mission they held dearly in life. Like when they operate alone, these chronogeists barely realize that they're working with others of their kind or to what end. They simply continue to rage against any living creatures that intrude upon their haunts, desperately seeking to understand their complex and tragic fate."

				"For thousands of years after it became trapped in Crystilan, Xin-Edasseril existed apart from planar space and time. While the city remained safe from intrusion, its residents were unaware that they were trapped within a temporal prison, replaying the same week-long period over and over. The city's inhabitants never aged, but the souls of those who died couldn't escape to the Boneyard. Instead, these trapped souls festered within the demiplane, and over the course of centuries transformed into terrifying, incorporeal undead creatures called chronogeists.",
				"",
				"With each week's reset, the citizens of Crystilan who had perished in the previous incarnation of the city simply vanished from the memories of those who survived, their passage from life to death wiped clean due to the nature of time within the demiplane being constantly reset. Yet sometimes, people would vaguely recall those who had perished in the form of half-remembered dreams, and as the presence of chronogeists slowly grew, theories as to their nature began to spread through the city's scholars. Some correctly suspected they were tied to a distortion in time, but most believed they were manifestations of dreams or forgotten memories that sought vengeance upon those who had misremembered them. Of course, at the end of every week, with the resetting of time, these theories would all be forgotten.",
				"",
				"Over the years, the number of citizens in Xin-Edasseril slowly decreased while chronogeists continued to manifest. Fortunately for the city's inhabitants, once a chronogeist was slain, it didn't return to life with the next week's reset-instead, this trapped spiritual energy simply got absorbed into the shell surrounding Crystilan.",
				"",
				"This growing spiritual pressure on the demiplane's borders is yet another factor that led to its recent destabilization when the Sihedron Heroes harvested energy from the demiplane's shell using the Timeglass.",
				"",
				"Now that time once again flows forward normally, newly dead souls in Crystilan don't become trapped and are free to enter the Boneyard normally. Yet for the hundreds of souls still trapped in a strange limbo as a chronogeist, only the destruction of Crystilan itself can allow their escape to the afterlife.",
				"",
				"Chronogeists are incorporeal, and their forms typically resemble far more wicked and angry versions of their appearance before undeath. Unhealthy, pale yellow, or orange lights typically permeate chronogeists, though they flash a gamut of bright colors when they harness the unstable time within them to attack those who disturb them. Chronogeists typically wear ghostly vestments of the clothes they wore when they died or clothing that was heavily associated with them in life, such as a priest's robes or a soldier's uniform."

The cloaca at the end of a chyzaedu's body is ringed by five flexible, ridged tentacles, which can wind together to form a clawlike appendage. A chyzaedu has significant control over this appendage and can use it to grasp items, manipulate devices, or cast spells with somatic components.",

Only the chyzaedu- home planet was spared this depredation, as the giant worms revered the life found there.

This void emitted a strange, singing noise as it did so, along with staccato exhalations reminiscent of cruel laughter.",

Most of these rites revolve around all-consuming voids, black holes, or gulfs of null space that utterly extinguish all matter. Most notably, chyzaedu orchestrate the biennial ceremony known as the Banquet, in which tens of thousands of sacrifices are hurled into black holes in the hope of evoking the same singing and chuckling exhalations that accompanied the consumption of the chyzaedu homeworld. Although focused on devouring, chyzaedu religion is not eschatological, but instead emphasizes the sanctity of the passage into the void: that is, the rapturous moment of devouring and of being devoured. All moments of swallowing are sacred to the chyzaedu. Creatures ingested by chyzaedu are unlikely to share the chyzaedu's religious appreciation for the event, which puzzles the aberrations.",

Chyzaedu are often found alongside other races of the Dominion as advisors, diplomats, and spiritual advisors. Despite their great bulk, chyzaedu make excellent spies: they are welcome throughout most of Dominion territory, and few members of the mostly secular Dominion understand the full capabilities of the creatures' divine magic. Chyzaedu rarely congregate with their own kind except during brief periods of mating or when communally presiding over religious services; idle chyzaedu inevitably quarrel with each other about religious minutiae, and such religious quarrels invariably end in violence.",
				"",
				"Chyzaedu drape themselves with vestments of a flexible metallic fiber akin to mithral. Each chyzaedu crafts its own garment using secret processes the worm-priests do not share with other races. As few races in the Dominion of the Black use metal, chyzaedu's vestments are both rare and distinctive in their cosmopolitan society. Although chyzaedu vestments don't function for other races, the 500 pounds of metallic fabric that constitute the garment are worth 7,500 gp.",
				"",
				"Unlike most races of the Dominion, chyzaedu have a keen interest in Golarion and make occasional expeditions to the planet. Chyzaedu share a myth similar to the Casmar legend of the Star-Worm-it tells of an interstellar monster that crashed on Golarion eons ago and gave birth to the first purple worms. Chyzaedu track and study purple worms and their variants (in particular, the colossal crimson worms of the Storval Plateau). Some chyzaedu view purple worms as enlightened brutes, devoid of intellect but wholly overwhelmed by the religious fervor of consumption. Other chyzaedu see purple worms as little more than breeding stock, but hope to use them to enhance future generations of their race. The worm-priests find the diverse panoply of deities worshipped on Golarion to be confusing and unnecessary, and are particularly offended by the worship of Rovagug-the Rough Beast's theology of destruction wholly devoid of purpose smacks of apostasy.",

While the destroyer clockwork dragon lacks a breath weapon, as a full-round action taken while on solid ground, it can move its gears to pull its wings apart and to rise up as a heavy bombard. The body of the clockwork is used as the platform for the bombard, and the internal workings of the clockwork can load the bombard without a crew, though it still takes five full-round actions on the part of the clockwork to load the bombard. The clockwork dragon can also take the actions necessary to aim the bombard. A clockwork dragon carries enough ammunition to fire the bombard 10 times.",

Creatures in the area of effect take 14d6 points of fire damage and are entangled in a thick layer of flaming tar. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled effect. Creatures are entangled for 5 rounds as the tar burns. Entangled creatures take 3d6 points of fire damage each round on their turn. Spending a full-round action and succeeding at a DC 22 Reflex save removes the tar, freeing the trapped creature from the entanglement and further fire damage.",

				"Infiltrator (CR + 1): These clockwork dragons are more subtle and nimble than those of other clockwork dragons. An infiltrator clockwork dragon can rearrange its movable parts into very serpentine and compact shapes, which gives it the compression ability. Furthermore, its parts are coated with a black, noise-dampening resin, granting it a +8 racial bonus on Stealth checks (typically Stealth +0). Finally, it's infused with magic allowing it, as a standard action, to become invisible as the greater invisibility spell (CL 15th) three times per day. The infiltrator clockwork dragon's invisibility is a supernatural ability.",
				"",
				"Mithral (CR +0): This variant loses its adamantine weapons and its DR, which are replaced by greater flight capability thanks to its spell-infused mithral parts. Its land and swim speeds increase to 70 feet, and its fly speed increases to 200 feet with good maneuverability. In addition, once per day as a swift action, it can gain the benefits of the haste spell for 1d4 rounds.",
				"",
				"Rust Breath (CR +0): Rust-breath clockwork dragons do not breathe fire. Instead, the creatures breathe out a fine mist of an alchemical solvent that instantly rusts exposed metals. This so-called \"rust breath\" issues forth in a 60-foot line. Creatures can attempt a DC 22 Reflex save to avoid the effect for attended items; however, they need to make a separate attempt for each exposed item. Each alchemical dragon can hold enough of the alchemical solvent to make up to three breath weapon attacks before the solvent must be refilled manually, which takes 10 minutes. These clockwork dragons are made of ironwood, adamantine, and other resistant materials immune to rusting of any form.",
				"",
				"Sleep Gas Breath (CR +0): This clockwork dragon's breath weapon is replaced with tanks of sleep gas. When the clockwork breathes out this gas in a 30-foot cone, creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 22 Will save or fall asleep for 1d6+10 rounds. Clockwork dragons with this breath weapon tend to have either the infiltrator or mithral variants, and often they have both variants.

However, unscrupulous owners might opt to store iron in the clockwork excavator's headpiece and set it loose in a populated area, turning this industrial clockwork into an impromptu weapon as it attempts to feed steel armor and weapons into storage-with their owners still attached. The clockwork excavator is only as good as the instructions it is given, and disregarding safety in favor of acquiring more wealth is always a temptation. Such attempts come with their own risks, of course, as a complex metal placed in the clockwork can cause it to go berserk, rampaging without control through narrow, inescapable mining tunnels.",

Many clockwork inventors specializing in these excavators hope to eventually include within their creations a means to process the raw ore. As of yet, that goal has not been achieved, as the complexities of including a hot smelter among all the delicate gears has proven difficult, and the failures have been explosive and fiery."

Complex locks are often added to the headpiece to prevent any malicious altering of its target, as the clockwork excavator is fairly indiscriminate in pursuit of its goal. In 4702 ar, a Nirmathi inventor by the name of Kyrdu Bellhorn was hanged after the iron ore in his excavator was replaced with gold coins and the construct massacred several wealthy merchants. His excavator was dismantled and sold as scrap by followers of Brigh, who then distributed the proceeds to the victims' families.",

Brigh and her followers, on the other hand, have no such compunctions holding them back, and have yet to let tradition stymie innovation or engineering triumphs. Clockwork-focused engineers from across the Inner Sea have received invitations to Absalom for a conference in the summer of 4717 ar, where they can meet with like-minded peers and show off their work. More importantly, High Clockmother Llanalir of Alkenstar will be attending to judge a contest, with hopes of finding new ideas and clockwork innovators from beyond Alkenstar's borders by offering the winner a workshop in Alkenstar City.

While the creature cannot activate or use the item, it gains certain constant abilities from the resonant magic fields, and can drain the item's magic as a free action in order to gain additional magical effects. In addition, any clockwork construct can drain a single charge or spell level from its installed item to heal itself for 1d6 hit points as a standard action. Removing a spent item and installing a new one is a full-round action.",

In addition, a clockwork familiar can drain the magic from the potion in order to grant this ability to a creature sharing its space. This ability to include others in the protection effect lasts for 1 minute per spell level of the potion drained.",
				"- Scroll: The clockwork familiar gains a constant detect magic effect as a spell-like ability. Draining magic from a scroll allows the familiar to cast a single identify spell on behalf of its master for each spell level of the spell inscribed on the scroll-these castings may be stored and saved, though a scroll used in this manner becomes instantly useless, even if not all spell levels have been drained.",
				"- Wand: The clockwork familiar gains the ability to spit a glob of acid up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. Draining a charge increases the damage to 2d4 points for a single attack. This charge is spent before the attack is rolled."

Its sharp, octopus-like beak is surrounded by dozens of tentacles that appear organic but contain rotors and pistons allowing for a strong, prehensile grip. Most of its tentacles end in a subtly serrated gripping pad, but two of them end in specialized sensory equipment shielded with durable crystal. These clusters provide the clockwork nautiloid with superior senses, allowing it to see even in the oppressive blackness of the deep ocean.",

In addition to providing significant protection to the creature's delicate internal mechanisms, this shell is coated with a thin film of grease baked onto the metal at incredible temperatures to waterproof the creature's interior and prevent the shell from degrading in the harsh, salty water of the ocean. This thin film also reflects incoming rays, scattering these magical attacks without harm to the clockwork nautiloid.",
				"",
				"Unlike with living nautiluses, which inhabit only the largest portions of their shells as they grow, a clockwork nautiloid's entire spiraled shell is filled with gears, rods, and springs. The pleasing logarithmic spiral of a clockwork nautiloid's shell arises not from a pattern of natural growth but because the mathematically consistent shape allows for the most efficient packing of the creature's clockworks. A clockwork nautiloid's winding key fits into a small hole at the precise center of its spiraled shell, on either the left or right side.",

				"Although clockwork nautiloids have few natural predators, mysterious titanic creatures lurk in the deep oceans, and clockwork engineers often camouflage their clockwork nautiloids just to be safe. The upper side of a clockwork nautiloid is often constructed of dark metals in overlapping stripes, allowing the clockwork nautiloid to blend with the deeper ocean below when it is seen from above. Similarly, the creature's underside is usually constructed of bright, pale metals; when seen from below, the creature appears part of the brighter ocean above. Clockwork nautiloids cannot retract into their shells, although they can fold their tentacles over each other to form a rigid covering.",

Like most clockwork constructs, clockwork nautiloids lack an Intelligence score, but each is constructed with multiple internal turning scripts that turn simultaneously when wound. As a result, clockwork nautiloids can process multiple strategies to surmount obstacles. This parallel thinking also makes a clockwork nautiloid a surprisingly flexible combatant, able to efficiently fight large groups by grappling smaller foes, biting at others, and rotating its thick shell to intercept attacks.",

				"Few clockwork engineers have the resources necessary to build more than one clockwork nautiloid at a time, but those who do find that the creatures work very well when paired together. Although a clockwork nautiloid's tentacles cannot normally reach its own key (unless its tentacles are specifically designed to do so), clockwork nautiloids can wind each other to extend their operating time considerably.

				"What clockwork creatures boast in both strength and resilience, they often lack in nuance and strategy. Most machinists are content to command their constructs directly when seeking tactical precision, but only a few artificers have the technical expertise needed to create a mechanical lieutenant capable of reasoning and adapting in its master's absence. Known as clockwork overseers, these constructs boast extraordinarily complex programming that far exceeds the basic command vocabulary of other clockwork creatures. This allows clockwork overseers to store hundreds or even thousands of commands, which they can parse and sort quickly enough to simulate an intelligent creature's adaptive thinking-at least regarding combat strategy and moderately complex tasks of coordinating construct laborers. These functions fall short of true thought, and clockwork overseers are incapable of language, emotion, higher thinking, or symbolic reasoning beyond specific sounds and statements they might parrot on command."

Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording.",

				"Clockwork vivisectionists are vaguely humanoid in shape, but they diverge from this general form in disturbing ways. They typically stand 6 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds. They have four segmented mechanical legs that allow them to move quickly in any direction. Their chests are wrought metal cages that swing open to reveal an assortment of syringes loaded with paralyzing poisons, and their misshapen arms end in vicious surgical implements, often caked with dried blood and bits of gore. A clockwork vivisectionist's head has three visages, each facing a different direction, allowing the vivisectionist to see in every direction at once. A vivisectionist's forged metal faces are often locked in expressions of horror, terror, or agony, as if whoever (or whatever) created them was building a facsimile of a humanoid, but had only ever seen faces expressing these emotions. Every few minutes, the faces rotate positions with a ratcheting sound, but it's unclear why a clockwork vivisectionist does this.",
				"",
				"The clockwork mechanisms within a vivisectionist are noticeably more complex than those of clockwork constructs built by most sages and engineers in the Inner Sea region. Those few scholars who have examined a disassembled vivisectionist have noted the incredibly precise machining of the gears, the astonishing density of the gear trains, and the banks of levers that seem able to store information by locking into countless combinations of positions. It's possible that the information gleaned from their vivisections is stored within these mechanisms for later retrieval by their mysterious creators. Despite this complexity, clockwork vivisectionists have no true intelligence. The emotionless manner in which they carry out their experiments only amplifies the chilling horror of encountering one.",
				"",
				"The key used to wind a clockwork vivisectionist is often difficult to recognize as a key at all. It usually takes an arcane shape and using it may require solving a puzzle of some kind. Examples include a star map cast in bronze that aligns with a star pattern on the clockwork's back (often depicting constellations unrecognizable to denizens of Golarion), a set of independently rotating rings with unfamiliar runes on them that must be inserted into a socket on the clockwork and rotated into the correct alignment, and a complex set of lenses and mirrors that must be correctly focused to shine a beam of light on a particular spot on the clockwork's body.",
				"",
				"Because its singular purpose is to cut open and experiment on still-living creatures, a clockwork vivisectionist employs unusual tactics in combat. Once it has pierced a victim with its scalpel claws and injected him with anesthetic, it drops the paralyzed victim and moves on to another. Only once all enemies are paralyzed or have fled will the vivisectionist begin \"operating,\" keeping each victim paralyzed but alive as long as possible (rarely longer than 1 hour) with regular injections from the bank of fluid-filled syringes in its chest. A victim can continue to attempt DC 16 Fortitude saving throws once per minute to escape the paralysis effect. A victim who escapes or is rescued once this process has begun may suffer from severe mental trauma even after her physical wounds have been healed."

				"Explorers of the deepest dungeons in Golarion report finding clockwork vivisectionists in isolated chambers surrounded by mutilated corpses that were the result of the vivisectionist's past experiments. This can include entire corpses with the skin removed, organs affixed to walls in careful arrangements, and bizarre sculptures with eerie radial symmetry built from the body parts of multiple victims. Clockwork vivisectionists are often found in areas with connections to Azlant or Thassilon. However, they have also been found in the ruins of Shadun in Qadira, Tumen in Osirion, and in the catacombs of El-Fatar. It is rumored that the Pactmasters of Katapesh maintain a collection of clockwork vivisectionists, their mechanisms wound down and their keys carefully hidden away.",
				"",
				"Though they don't typically remain in one location, instead roaming tombs and dungeons in search of victims for as long as their windings will allow, clockwork vivisectionists often seek out traps, natural locations, or other creatures with daze or stun attacks that might help them to conduct their vivisections. Traps involving azure lily pollen, cytillipedes, Leng ghouls, or tenebrous worms are often found in the same area of a dungeon as a clockwork vivisectionist."

				"Assembled by unknown creators for inscrutable purposes, clockwork vivisectionists wait in the depths of ageless dungeons or within the tombs of forgotten kings. When wound, they pursue a single purpose: to examine the inner workings of living humanoids. They approach this task with a cold, insatiable curiosity that has somehow been programmed into their clicking levers and complex gear trains. Clockwork vivisectionists enter combat only to paralyze victims for later vivisection."

				"Creating these clockworks requires precisely crafted gears and other refined mechanisms, plus various anesthetizing fluids, worth 8,500 gp. However, the process isn't a matter of simply building the mechanisms in the correct shape-some aspect of a clockwork vivisectionist's function remains incomprehensible and alien to beings on the Material Plane, so aspiring clockwork makers must consult with extraplanar powers using contact other plane.

A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by a cockatrice's bites immediately turns completely to stone, as if petrified by a flesh to stone spell. Every day, a creature petrified by a cockatrice in this manner can attempt a new DC 12 Fortitude save to recover from the petrification, at which point the victim returns to flesh with 1 Dexterity (and thereafter can be restored to full Dexterity by natural healing or magic as normal)-but after a petrified creature fails three of these Fortitude saves in a row, the petrified state becomes permanent. A creature restored to flesh via magic has its Dexterity damage caused by cockatrice bites removed, but not any existing Dexterity damage from other sources.

In an ironic twist of fate, however, weasels and ferrets-the creatures most likely to slip into cockatrices' nests and consume their eggs-appear to be completely immune to the effect. For unknown reasons, cockatrices are both terrified of and enraged by conventional roosters, and are equally likely to flee or attack when confronted by one."

Although a colour is incorporeal, and thus able to move through solid objects, it can also exist as a free-floating, eerie radiance. Natural sunlight doesn't particularly harm colours out of space, but they prefer to dwell in darkened areas like deep caves or abandoned wells where their own radiance is the only light.",

When a colour has absorbed enough life to grow to full maturity (usually signif ied by reaching 25 to 30 Hit Dice), it gathers its strength and erupts from its den, coruscating into the sky as it launches the majority of itself back into space. Sometimes, enough remains of the parent colour to survive on its own, and in these cases the life cycle repeats again and again. Areas blighted by a colour out of space are singularly recognizable, not only for the eerie pallor of local plant life and large swaths of blasted, barren landscape, but also by the presence of those the colour has fed on.

In order to remove this simple template from a creature, one only has to restore all of its drained ability scores to normal. As long as a creature suffers the colour-blighted template, it becomes aggressive toward creatures that do not exude the colors of a colour out of space, and gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls against such targets.

But those with a deep understanding of the occult know it is indeed possible for a person to feel a sudden fever come on, only to find the heat within her body rising to incredible levels until she bursts into flames and perishes, leaving behind only a charred corpse. The sudden and violent deaths of such individuals make it easier for dark powers to reanimate their bodies, and sometimes for the victims to return from the dead on their own.",

Roiling clouds of smoke, thick with the stench of burning skin and hair, surround them at all times, and may reveal their presence from over a mile away. These shambling horrors can arise at any location that has a particular affinity for undead, but they have been known to wander into nearby bodies of water in an attempt to extinguish the flames that took their lives, though they never attempt such self destructive acts when affronted by the presence of the living.",

				"**Deific (Su)** Conqueror worms can grant divine spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on a conqueror worm's behalf. Conqueror worms grant access to the domains of Charm, Evil, Nobility, and Trickery, and their favored weapon varies but is always a simple weapon (daggers and sickles being the most common choices). Each conqueror worm has its own unique holy symbol, although typically it resembles a ring of eyes.",
				"",
				"**Mental Invader (Su)** A conqueror worm infects the minds of others from afar, allowing it to control its puppets without leaving the safety of the earth's depths. When a conqueror worm communicates with a creature mentally, such as by using telepathy or spells such as dream, it can attempt to form a lasting mental connection with that creature. The target can resist this connection with a successful DC 33 Will save. A target that succeeds at this save is immune to that conqueror worm's mental invader ability forever. Once a connection is formed, the worm can communicate with the bonded creature using telepathy over any distance, and can target the bonded creature with mind-affecting spells and effects regardless of range. A worm can form bonds with a number of creatures equal to its Intelligence modifier (10 for the typical conqueror worm). If a new bond would exceed this limit, the worm must choose to break one of its previous connections. The effects of a bond are suppressed while the worm and the bonded creature are on different planes. A bond can otherwise be broken only via a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell cast on the bonded creature, or by the worm's death. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
				"",
				"**Telepathic Escape (Su)** A conqueror worm can escape death by casting its mind out of its body at the moment of death. Up to once per day, when an attack, spell, or effect would reduce a conqueror worm to 0 or fewer hit points or otherwise kill it instantly, it can transfer its mind to one of the creatures it has formed a connection with using its mental invader ability. The target can attempt a DC 33 Will save to resist being overtaken. If the target succeeds, the conqueror worm can be killed normally. If the target fails, the conqueror worm transfers its soul into the bonded creature's body. This functions as the spell possession (CL 21st) except the possession is permanent. A host body possessed by a conqueror worm in this way undergoes terrible changes to its physiology. Every day, the host must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Charisma drain. Over time, the host slowly grows more wormlike in appearance, losing body hair, growing obese, and taking on a pale yellow-white coloration. When the host's Charisma score is drained to 0, an ectoplasmic cocoon forms around the creature. Over the course of the next 24 hours, the host grows to an enormous size, and at the end of this time emerges in a brand new body as a new conqueror worm that retains the memories of its previous incarnation, at which point the host creature is effectively dead (and can be resurrected normally). If the host is slain before this transformation completes, the conqueror worm dies as well. The effect can also be ended by any effect that successfully expels the conqueror worm's possessing spirit from the host. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based."

				"Though conqueror worms resemble immense vermin, those who mistake them for mindless creatures suffer terribly for their mistake. In truth, conqueror worms are creatures of vast intellect and equal depravity. These monstrous beings exist only to rule \"lesser civilizations\" from the shadows, and revel in the complete control of an unknowing society through the remote manipulation of its supposed leaders.",
				"",
				"A conqueror worm prefers to play with its toys before breaking them. To do so, it burrows its way below a target nation's capital. From there, the conqueror worm makes mental contact with the city's leaders, forming sinister psychic connections with those in power. The worm beguiles some of these leaders with promises of wealth or power. Others, the worm controls outright using the considerable psychic magic at its disposal. Regardless, the end result is the same; without intervention, all end up as puppets dancing to the conqueror worm's whims.",
				"",
				"Once a conqueror worm seizes control of a city or nation, that region's downfall can take years, if not decades-for conqueror worms are surprisingly theatrical. A conqueror worm may direct a kingdom's leader to enact cruel or tyrannical laws, only to then use a second puppet to inflame the populace into revolt. Once the fires of revolution die down, the worm might then expose the rebel leader as a traitor or depraved criminal, causing the rebellion to turn on itself and descend again into violence. All the while, the conqueror worm watches in delight at the madness, sin, and horror it inspires in others.",
				"",
				"Eventually a conqueror worm tires of its games, and plots to destroy its subjects. Often it does this by sending its puppets to war against a nearby nation. The horrors of war devastate not only the worm's own populace, but also those of its neighbors, bringing perverse joy to the worm's many hearts. However, a special fate awaits the worm's favorite servants, who are brought down into its subterranean realm so they can glimpse their master's true form before being impaled on the conqueror worm's goreslick jaws. Its work finally finished, the conqueror worm then seeks out a new realm to subjugate.",
				"",
				"Perhaps the most terrifying and peculiar aspect of the conqueror worm is its ability to form cults. Whether through accumulation of psychic power or some hidden divine spark, conqueror worms are capable of granting spells to creatures that worship them. A conqueror worm exploits this ability to attract cultists, which it uses to further its goals in the civilized world above. Although such cults are absolutely loyal to the conqueror worm, which they worship as an all-knowing and all-powerful god, the conqueror worm usually considers its mortal followers expendable.",

At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as telekinesis. Evolution- whether natural or forced by the contemplatives themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank.",

Though alien in appearance and demeanor, contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conflict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution.",

Cordulegasters are often found serving more powerful outsiders, particularly hydrodaemons and piscodaemons, and assist the daemons in harvesting souls."

				"Strangely reminiscent of dragonfly nymphs, cordulegasters are monstrous creations that inhabit the waterways of the River Styx. Like hydrodaemons, cordulegasters can survive prolonged exposure to the Styx's tainted waters, where they lurk near the river's edge and lie in wait for prey to wander close. A cordulegaster's mouth comprises a prehensile, extendable lower jaw and a secondary inner set of mandibles. Its lower jaw folds under its head as the cordulegaster rests, cupping over the mandibles like a mask of interlocking, irregular teeth. When a cordulegaster attacks, its jaws separate and shoot forward to grasp its prey, pulling it closer so the mandibles can begin to shred and devour its unlucky victim's flesh.",

Serrated edges line its protective chitin and run down the creature's back, making it dangerous to grab or hold (and sparing it from larger predators). These serrated edges allow its lashing tail to open deep, jagged wounds with every blow. A typical cordulegaster can grow up to 12 feet long and 7 feet tall at the head, and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds."

				"Auwaz couatls are the most commonly known couatls across Golarion, at least among those people who live near coasts. An auwaz couatl's scales are a light gray with subtle light blue and green markings. Their feathers are typically blue and green, with hints of light yellow reminiscent of the sun. The coloring resembles the waters of the oceans, and the exact coloring of an auwaz couatl tends to vary depending on which body of water the couatl frequents-each major sea and ocean seems to have its own distinct auwaz markings and colorations. The sound of an auwaz couatl's wings resembles that of a gentle ocean breeze. This makes it hard to detect their approach, and many sailors tend to utter short blessings whenever they encounter a calm, compliant breeze, just in case an auwaz couatl is nearby.",
				"",
				"Each auwaz couatl knows the location of every settlement on the edge of its waters and is happy to share this knowledge with those it views favorably. Those who draw an auwaz couatl's suspicion sometimes receive inaccurate knowledge, ending up at a settlement a few hundred miles away from their intended destination. An auwaz couatl usually gives this misinformation to allow it time to follow the travelers and determine whether they are dangerous, correcting its original directions only if the travelers appear to be good-hearted. When dealing with evil travelers, an auwaz couatl usually points them toward subtle dangers such as troubled waters, reefs, and other oceanic dangers. The creature won't follow these travelers and is content with letting the ocean determine their fates.",
				"",
				"Auwaz couatls have moderate control over the weather, calling forth winds and storms as they feel necessary. They use this power to aid the travel of those they are guiding home, summoning strong winds to make the journeys of sailing ships shorter. Similarly, if an auwaz couatl encounters a sinking ship, it uses its powers to grant survivors the ability to breathe water and personally guides these victims to safety. This power also allows an auwaz couatl to work against evil travelers, making their journeys difficult and even calling on lightning storms to strike ships when necessary.",
				"",
				"Auwaz couatls have the shortest lives of all couatls, living only about a century at most, and most have life spans equivalent to those of humans. Due to their flighty nature, they rarely take the time to meet with others of their kind, though they do gather once every few years to reproduce, laying several eggs each. Its uncertain how auwaz couatls know the exact time to gather, though many believe they read a message in the stars left behind by their cousins, the [mix couatls](unknown:mix_couatls)."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Auwaz couatls live roving, independent lives that allow them to travel all across Golarion. Although most auwaz couatls live near the seas and oceans of Golarion, some prefer to stay inland and help those lost in forests or mountains. An auwaz couatl typically sticks to its home in its younger years, but it eventually travels the world through its adult life before returning. Auwaz couatls tend to avoid each other and keep out of each other's affairs, except in times of peril. In these cases, an auwaz couatl uses a particular call, perceptible only to other couatls, to warn of danger. During these fraught times, auwaz couatls travel in packs, especially to protect the younger members of their kind.",
				"",
				"As they are generally good-natured and curious, many auwaz couatls take time to speak with any travelers they find, often flying above ships and conversing with those on board. These conversations usually involve current events, as auwaz couatls prefer to keep updated so as to not send travelers to dangerous locales, but they can also include artistic and philosophical discussions. Some auwaz couatls are quite fond of humorous stories and like to spend hours telling such tales, especially if there are children among the travelers. The sight of an auwaz couatl above a ship serves as a signal to others that the ship is protected, so many ships fly kites in the shape of auwaz couatls in hopes of giving marauders pause.",
				"",
				"Auwaz couatls are particularly fond of children, as they find kinship in their innocence. They are more than happy to comfort distressed children and guide them home. In particularly dire situations, or ones where a child may be too far from home to safely travel, an auwaz couatl will carry the child on its back and fly it to safety. An auwaz couatl typically has a different approach with children who have run away from home; the auwaz couatl takes time to speak with the child and learn her reasons for running away. In some cases, the child seeks to escape a troubled life and the auwaz couatl helps guide the child to a new home. In other cases, the auwaz couatl convinces the child to return home but encourages her to cultivate the wanderlust in her heart. Such children tend to grow into adventurers and travel the world years later."

				"Auwaz couatls are a variety of couatl known for helping those who are lost find their way back to safety. They are particularly known for traveling around the oceans of Golarion to help sailors and other travelers lost at sea. Many sailors claim that they owe their lives to an auwaz couatl, though these same sailors warn that living a particularly vile life will instead draw an auwaz couatl's ire. An auwaz couatl often prefers that evil beings remain lost, and it actively works to ensure such creatures remain lost for as long as possible. A typical auwaz couatl is 8 feet long with a wingspan of 12 feet, and weighs 800 pounds."

				"Chicomes typically show themselves only in the aftermath of an incredible act of devastation or widespread destruction, such as a massive battle or the razing of a large settlement, and even then only if the couatl deems the area in question worthy of being restored. Their exact criteria for worthy lands are unclear; what is known is that badlands chosen by one of these blessed sky serpents are enormously enriched by the outsider's presence. When a chicome restores the balance of nature to a ruined area, it cleanses the land of any residual toxins and contagions, such as contaminated earth or water, and plants the seeds of new life. If the restoration of healthy biomes is not enough to draw nearby wildlife back to the region- or if all the local fauna has been exhausted-the couatl uses its magic to coax animals from other corners of the world to the fledgling environment."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Chicomes are strictly solitary creatures who dwell in the lands that need their help. While they are purifying a particular region, chicomes periodically take flight to survey the area and determine whether their presence is still justified. The couatls also scout for worthy guardians in the vicinity to take over stewardship-typically a powerful awakened animal, but sometimes a nemophilist in a nearby settlement. These individuals typically become druids who learn their abilities from the chicome, though anyone the couatl deems worthy may serve as a steward of such lands, regardless of the individual's magical prowess. Those who have received a chicome's blessing are sometimes referred to as Children of the Chicome. If ever one such steward is slain while protecting her pocket of wilderness, her host chicome will return its child to life using its powers of reincarnation. The steward is typically reborn as the animal it most identified with in life.",
				"",
				"Though they may serve a range of lawful and good deities, chicomes are typically agents of those gods with an aspect of nature or life, such as [Erastil](unknown:Erastil) or Cihua Couatl, or empyreal lords like [Cernunnos](unknown:Cernunnos) or [Valani](unknown:Valani). Some chicomes may even serve neutral-aligned deities such as [Gozreh](unknown:Gozreh) or [Feronia](unknown:Feronia). Chicomes never serve deities, no matter how noble, whose portfolio includes the destruction of nature or the spread of civilization, such as [Torag](unknown:Torag). Many chicomes serve no deities at all and are dedicated only to the primordial forces of nature."

				"Chicomes are a powerful but gentle variety of couatl- winged serpentine outsiders who act as agents of lawful good deities-whose purpose is to reestablish nature in destroyed and ravaged lands, especially those that have been recently cleansed of evil. Chicomes accomplish this by way of powerful druidic magic and the cloud of restorative pollen and dew that constantly drifts from their wings. Like other couatls, chicomes have varicolored feathers and beautiful, glossy scales. The couatls' wing feathers are typically shades of green or brown, but their crests are always a brilliant crimson. Like for other couatls, the feathers of chicomes are incredibly powerful magic items when bestowed upon chosen mortals. Such a freely given feather can be used as the material component for a [planar ally](unknown:planar_ally) spell. In addition, if buried in at least 6 inches of soil and undisturbed for 24 hours, the feather can be used as the material component to cast a [hallow](unknown:hallow) spell; the spell effect tied to the hallowed site is always the enrichment version of [plant growth](unknown:plant_growth). By using a chicome feather in this way, the caster need not expend the typical payment of gold or other valuables required by the spell.",

He is aided in his efforts by his champion, Jua Mfuasi (LG male human paladin of Iomedae 10), who was once a necromancer known as the Corpse-King until he was killed and returned to life by Sun-Warrior, after which he renounced his evil ways and abandoned arcane magic to become a paladin."

The target of the spell automatically gains a number of ranks in that skill equal to its Hit Dice (maximum 5 ranks) and treats that skill as a class skill. The target creature retains the skill ranks for up to 1 month, after which the creature loses the skill ranks but still treats the chosen skill as a class skill.

Their feathers range in color from dark blues to deep violets to blacks darker than the night. This coloring resembles the colors of the twilight and helps a mix couatl hide among the stars at night. The flapping of their wings as they fly through the skies is said to resemble the sounds of distant thunder.

To some, they offer knowledge of new farming and hunting techniques, while others are taught more esoteric knowledge, like the arcane arts.

If there are genuine innocents within a group or settlement on which the tletli has set its sights, the couatl may send an emissary, such as a charmed person, to forewarn the pure of heart, but it otherwise does not hesitate to incinerate the entire locale. Their deific masters understand tletlis' unrivaled propensity for holy retribution all too well, and they typically send other couatls or celestials like angels to accompany the tletlis in case there are a number of individuals in a settlement that should be evacuated or protected during the razing."

If these visions are not enough, a xiuh couatl visits the creature and offers to share its knowledge of goodness and virtue.

Sarenrae, in particular, makes the most of use of all types of couatls, but xiuh couatls can be called upon by Desna, Shelyn, or, in Arcadia, Kazutal, goddess of community, liberty, and safety. As usual, xiuh couatls first attempt to redeem the creatures they are tasked with destroying, but follow with violent retribution if required. Gods may also assign xiuh couatls to aid individuals who require assistance in times of adversity.

This type of cruciarus can rise from the application of other forms of energy used to torture-a person frozen to death would result in a cruciarus that deals cold damage, while electrocution would bring about a cruciarus that deals electricity damage.",
				"- Crushing: A cruciarus created from crushing endured incredible pressure that caused the breaking of bones or the rupturing of organs-being compressed under a slowly increasing pile of stones is one grisly example of this torment. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as its bones creak and snap and its body bruises horrifically. A creature that fails to save against this gaze effect is also treated as if grappled for 1 round.",
				"- Dislocation: This cruciarus was subjected to tortures designed to dislocate victims' joints. These methods often involve mechanical devices such the rack and the strappado, but also include death via crucifixion and via hanging. The cruciarus's arms, legs, and sometimes even neck bend in unnatural directions. Its gaze causes the victim's limbs to stiffen, affecting the victim as if by a slow spell for 1 round on a failed saving throw. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Strength drain.",
				"- Dismemberment: One, some, or all of the cruciarus's limbs were amputated during a long, drawn-out death-execution via beheading can cause a dismembered cruciarus as well. The creature's ghostly body bears the terrible wounds, with its dismembered parts obviously still in proper relation to each other but separated from the body by an inch or 2. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of slashing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as hideous wounds manifest on body parts analogous to those the undead lost. A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also takes 1d6 points of bleed damage.",
				"- Drowning: This cruciarus experienced real or simulated drowning. Variations include dunking chairs, forced ingestion, and waterboarding. A cruciarus who died this way always appears soaking wet, constantly dripping water that fades moments after running off its ghostly frame. The target of a drowned cruciarus's gaze attack experiences the panic of suffocation or drowning (even if it is normally able to breathe underwater), and on a failed Fortitude save it cannot speak and becomes nauseated for 1 round. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain.",
				"- Impalement: One or more sharp objects perforated this cruciarus before death. The cruciarus's body still caries ghostly echoes of the spears, lances, or other weapons that impaled it. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of piercing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as ghostly blades pierce its flesh. A creature that fails to resist this effect is also staggered for 1 round from the pain.",
				"- Starvation: This cruciarus expired from a form of torture that involved starvation or dehydration. The wretched spirit seems emaciated and gaunt. A creature subjected to this cruciarus's gaze attack suffers wracking pangs of hunger or thirst and takes 6d6 points of nonlethal damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also becomes fatigued-or exhausted if already fatigued."

				"The exact triggers that cause torture victims to rise as cruciaruses are not entirely clear, although sheer magnitude certainly has an influence. A single or even small number of tortured victims never seems to be enough to result in a cruciarus; these mournful undead seem more apt to manifest when large numbers of victims are tortured, either at once or over an extended period of time. Curiously, deliberate attempts to trigger the formation of a cruciarus have failed to date, causing eager necromancers no small amount of frustration. The fact that cruciaruses do not resemble specific individuals who died of torture has caused many scholars to believe they comprise a sort of amalgamation of the torment suffered by many. No cruciarus remembers specific personal events from life, although they do recall regional events of public knowledge. And, of course, they always recall the cruel mechanics of their deaths. They seem to be driven not so much out of revenge as out of pure malice, and are as eager to inflict pain on the innocent as on those who continue to torture others in life."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Cruciaruses rarely travel far from where they form, although they don't seem to be bound specifically to sites of torment and death. They often haunt torture chambers hidden in basements and dungeons, though it is very uncommon for more than one cruciarus to spawn at such a site, regardless of the total number slain. In some cases, though, particularly when such tortures were performed in public, these undead form in larger groups, as if the mere fact of their deaths having been viewed by so many eyes gives rise to greater numbers of them. Cruciaruses are particularly common in regions like Cheliax and Nidal, where torture is raised to a high art. Necromancers in Geb employ controlled cruciaruses as interrogators and assassins, but must be careful lest the tortured dead turn against them."
			],
			"description": [
				"Cruciaruses are also known as the tortured dead. These anguished, frightening creatures are the disembodied spirits of those who died while being tortured. A painful death is not enough to produce these undead; only prolonged and intentional torment, whether punitive or sadistic, gives rise to one.",
				"",
				"A cruciarus bears the unmistakable wounds of a torture victim. Curiously, the features of cruciaruses never quite match those of the creatures whose deaths spawn them. While most cruciaruses spawn from the souls of mortal humanoids, others could well arise from creatures that suffer enough torture-statistics for such cruciaruses are identical to those listed above, although changes to size (as in the case of tortured giants or dragons) may be necessary."

				"As the cyclopes' civilization crumbled, the focus of cyclops life shifted from intellectual and spiritual pursuits to base survival, and those who excelled at hunting, gathering, and enduring the harsh world rose to positions of power and prestige over what remained of their people. Though rarely leaders-cyclopes still revere magical acumen over martial power, even in their humbled state-manhunters occupy a position of respect among cyclops tribes, feeding their peoples' massive appetites with the flesh of beasts and sentient beings alike. Though competent archers, these hunters are rarely content to draw blood from afar, and train for close combat. Taking advantage of their size, they learn to reap foes with the same strength that their ancestors reaped wheat. Most manhunters prefer to use their archery skills only to harry and anger targets into closing with them, or to stop fleeing opponents lest their tender flesh be wasted. Familiar as they are with their tribal lands and always on the move, these towering hunters are often the first cyclopes that outsiders encounter, and just as often the last.",
				"",
				"Manhunters also enforce the law in their communities, dispensing scars and capital punishment for crimes-real or imagined-with swift brutality. Without courts or prisons, modern cyclops justice has devolved into scarification, mutilation, and execution for any crimes. The manhunters impose these cyclopean standards of justice on all they encounter, even when well beyond the lands directly under their control, as they believe the wisdom of the cyclopes is absolute.",
				"",
				"While humanoids are their favored prey, manhunters delight in tracking all manner of creatures and wearing their skulls, skins, and shiny belongings as trophies. They rarely use stealth, instead openly pursuing their victims over great distances. In a proper hunt, exhaustion is as likely to fell a manhunter's prey as her axe."

Filled with rage and a total rejection of everything their people once achieved, these massive brutes experience incredible joy in destroying the works of civilization. They tear down homes and buildings, rip out orchards, slaughter livestock, and crush forges. The ruins of their own peoples' grandeur drive them into a frenzy, and smashers may spend weeks or months ripping down the remains of cyclopean temples or cities, crushing even the bricks themselves into gravel. Their disdain for manufactured goods doesn't stop them from using weapons, armor, or other useful items, however.",

			"description": [
				"The noisy, enigmatic cyphergulls are a common sight in the coastal city of Riddleport, where they often circle above the ancient rune-carved Cyphergate as if they own it. Their appearance and behavior greatly resembles those of their mundane cousins-seagulls-but they are far more intelligent, and their connection to Riddleport's ancient Thassilonian stone arch grants them many magical abilities.",
				"",
				"A cyphergull is a little over 2 feet long, has a wingspan of up to 5 feet, and weighs 3 pounds.",
				"",
				"The records of an esoteric order known as the Cyphermages indicate that a few times in the history of Riddleport, seagulls have suddenly gathered in large numbers near the Cyphergate, forming an immense spiral of feathers and flesh before crashing into the giant stone arch. Each time, the birds die by the hundreds, but the few that survive transform into something more than mere seagulls. While they retain many physical characteristics of seagulls, they are generally more robust and intelligent than their common cousins.",
				"",
				"Two cyphergull parents always produce cyphergull offspring, but interbreeding with ordinary gulls also occurs when suitable cyphergull mates are not available. The chicks of such mixed pairs are usually ordinary gulls, but mating occasionally results in a clutch of cyphergulls. Cyphergull eggs exude a soft blue glow and bear dark splotches that sometimes form patterns reminiscent of runes. After 3 or 4 weeks of incubation, loud, blue-eyed chicks hatch from the eggs. Over the first 4 years of a cyphergull's life, different runic patterns appear on its plumage until the creature reaches adulthood and the runes settle to a permanent pattern. Cyphergulls live up to 50 years in the wild and can live even longer in captivity.",
				"",
				"Cyphergulls are excellent fliers, but are also able swimmers and remarkably daring. With their mobility and intelligence, cyphergulls exhibit an exceptional variety of hunting strategies. Using their unhinging jaws, they can quickly gulp down many different kinds of prey, including crabs, fish, frogs, rodents, and even smaller birds. Cyphergulls are particularly inventive creatures, especially when it comes to finding food. For example, they sometimes use earthworms as bait to catch fish or set simple deadfall traps. When cyphergulls steal from humanoids, they often work in pairs; one of the birds creates a diversion while the other snatches the prize."
			],
			"habitat": [
				"Versatile feeders, cyphergulls prefer coastal areas and islands, where they can hunt on land, on water, and in the air. The largest cyphergull populations exist in and around Riddleport, particularly on the slopes of the rocky ridges that surround the city and on the rooftops of the Wharf District and the Windward District. Several smaller populations of cyphergulls exist along the shores of the Varisian Gulf, most frequently near human settlements. In Magnimar, a careful observer may notice that some of the birds circling above the Irespan are in fact blue-eyed cyphergulls. Cyphergulls winter in southwestern Cheliax and along Rahadoum's northern coast.",
				"",
				"In late spring, cyphergulls assemble into noisy, densely packed colonies, usually returning to the same spot as the previous year. The breeding season begins a few weeks later when warm summer breezes start coming in from the Varisian Gulf. The birds build their nests on the ground, using leaves, twigs, and other plant matter as building materials. Cyphergulls are almost irrationally fond of paper and parchment, and they sometimes go to great lengths to obtain scrolls and books to use as nest-building materials.",
				"",
				"Cyphergull colonies have rigid hierarchies, where mated pairs of lower standing build their nests to form a ring around the nests of higher-ranking cyphergulls, protecting them against attacks. Cyphergulls mate for life and are very protective of their nests and the colony; if a predator isn't deterred by the gulls' warning calls, the birds cooperatively attack and harass the intruder, using their numbers against bigger creatures. The birds employ surprisingly elaborate defensive tactics, such as feint attacks and false retreats to lead enemies into ambushes.",
				"",
				"While food finding and nest building are the birds' first priorities during the breeding season, cyphergulls exhibit a range of personalities comparable to that of humans whenever survival is not at stake. For example, some are tricksters or collectors who like to annoy others or steal items just to stave off boredom, and most have favorite foods that they seek out. A surprisingly large number of cyphergulls, and nearly always the highest-ranked gulls in a colony, are philosophers who study the world around them, perform simple experiments, and understand the rudiments of logic and the scientific method. Some cyphergulls practice something akin to religious rituals, placing food and other objects on the ground to form runes and remaining motionless above them for hours at a time. Scholars speculate that the birds have a unique ability to interpret the secrets of the Cyphergate, and that studying the birds' runic writing could reveal ancient knowledge. Cyphermages in particular study cyphergulls in the wild, but clinging to guano-spattered rocks and rooftops to look at birds doesn't improve their reputation as obsessive eccentrics.",
				"",
				"Cyphergulls are curious about humanoids, often observing how they speak, what they eat, and how they live. A common superstition among the peoples of the Varisian Gulf states that killing a cyphergull brings bad luck, so the birds get away with thefts or irritations that would doom other birds. Cyphergulls are intelligent enough to learn languages that humanoid creatures speak, but they lack any speech-producing organs. Their communication sounds like the harsh wailing calls of ordinary gulls, but their system of shrieks is far more complex, and they are capable of communicating even abstract ideas like \"ambush,\" \"deal,\" \"future,\" or \"payment\" with their calls. This allows them to devise elaborate defensive and offensive tactics, or to negotiate trade deals.",
