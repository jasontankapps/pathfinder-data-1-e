			"An alter ego arises when a sliver of a creature's personality breaks free and coalesces into an independent being. An alter ego is almost always formed by accident rather than by design, and usually comes into being during a moment of trauma, disorientation, or sudden incapacitation. In many cases, the progenitor isn't aware that the alter ego was created, particularly if the new creature hides or flees rather than confronting its progenitor immediately.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's body is made not of flesh and blood, but of solidified ectoplasm that looks, smells, and feels like its progenitor's body. Because ectoplasm is less dense than bone or carapace, an alter ego weighs less and is more nimble than its progenitor. Although an alter ego appears similar to its progenitor, it speaks in a flat monotone and its eyes stare blankly out of a numb, expressionless face. Observers find an alter ego's behavior and expressions doll-like and off-putting. A creature familiar with the progenitor can identify the alter ego as a duplicate with a successful Perception check (opposed by the alter ego's Disguise check) or with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. As an alter ego looks very similar to its progenitor, it can easily engender confusion or cause harm to its progenitor's reputation. If the alter ego of a famous paladin is spotted fleeing from danger, for example, witnesses might call the paladin's courage into question. Rumors of uncharacteristic actions might be the progenitor's first indication that an alter ego is at large.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's psyche is both more limited and more focused than the mind of its progenitor. Although the alter ego has all of the progenitor's memories and abilities at the time of its creation (including any prepared spells), its personality revolves around a single facet of its progenitor's psyche that drives the alter ego's actions. This facet is often a personality aspect that the progenitor prefers to keep hidden but that leapt to the fore during the event that caused the alter ego's creation. For example, a cleric who secretly grapples with doubt might spawn a staunchly atheist alter ego, or an alchemist who occasionally swindles an adventurer or traveler to keep up with the rent on her shop might engender an openly and unrepentantly greedy alter ego. Stories abound of murderous alter egos, but in truth only a rare few alter egos have facets that provoke extreme activities such as munificence or violence. Alter egos are generally dispassionate in their actions and neutral in alignment; the greatest danger most pose is to their progenitors' reputations and peace of mind.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's mind fixates on its sole purpose, and it is rarely idle. It actively and even obsessively pursues short-term goals based on its dominating facet. For example, an alter ego that came into being when its progenitor was disgraced might seek out and humiliate those who witnessed the event, while one with a murderous facet that formed during a botched getaway might engage in a string of massacres. Because these intentions spring from a limited aspect of the progenitor's personality, an alter ego's schemes often conflict with the progenitor's overall goals. For example, the progenitor of the vengeful alter ego might wish to forget the event that created it ever happened, while the alter ego's actions revive gossip about the unfortunate occurrence; if the murderous alter ego sprang from a progenitor who was a methodical, disciplined assassin, the alter ego's reckless killing spree is likely to interfere with the assassin's well-laid plans.",
			"",
			"Regardless of the alter ego's personality facet and how it was created, it loathes its progenitor. In some cases, the alter ego might merely find its progenitor to be abrasive. Most alter egos do not initially plan to kill their progenitors, but the idea may come to them while in their progenitors' presences, spurred by their instinctual hatred, and alter egos spawned from self-loathing or suicide attempts may actively plot to ruin or assassinate their progenitors. Despite this revulsion, an alter ego continually receives mental flashes of its progenitor's location and is debilitated when its progenitor is more than a mile away. When in its progenitor's immediate presence, an alter ego cannot help but recognize its progenitor and overhear snatches of the progenitor's surface thoughts. If the progenitor is dead, the alter ego gains considerable freedom to pursue its activities-a realization some alter egos come to over many days, weeks, or years' and that realization drives such alter egos to eventually murder their progenitors, or else plot to replace them and keep their wayward originals somewhere quiet and peaceful.",
			"",
			"Certain psychic or magic items (such as a [mirror of opposition](magic-wondrous/mirror_of_opposition)) can create a copy of a creature. The alter ego template works well for generating such a creature and is particularly appropriate for a copy of a psychic spellcaster or another psychically sensitive individual. Depending on the effect that created the copy, it may be either a duplicate or an opposite. Unlike standard alter egos, duplicates usually have the same alignment as their progenitors, while opposites have the diametrically opposite alignment.",

			"The typical intelligent mind exists as a war of aspects' primitive survival urges and base wants opposing intellectual reason and high-minded goals. Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature's personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects a creature would normally control and suppress. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects-the creature's animus-behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.",

They often appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches, and can sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, severed (but still present) body parts, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds.

			"Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life-whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades have greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments they achieved in life, taking pleasure in destroying those things they once loved or took pride in.",
			"",
			"Because they're created through psychic violence, animus shades usually appear among intelligent races and beings known for mastering occult forces. Among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess. they're easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead-often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value physical strength over mental prowess and in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which seldom give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never return as animus shades.",
			"",
			"Poisoned by the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves-they know it was their own weaknesses or distraction that resulted in their deaths.

Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a contained threat in some areas, the relatively flat floodplains of Belkzen offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee.

Brought together by the thousands into a swarm, however, the complex linking of simple systems creates an emergent consciousness of humanlike intelligence, although alien enough to make communication nearly impossible. Granule construct swarms exist solely to infest larger living organisms and reproduce in the relative safety and comfort provided by their bodies. Capable of repairing and replicating out of the raw elements around them, granule constructs within a host are almost unstoppable through physical means, burrowing their way into flesh and sending signals through the bloodstream. Once safely ensconced, granule construct swarms modify their hosts to maximize survival potential, a trait that leads certain people to intentionally cultivate granule construct swarms inside themselves, despite the resulting deformities. Energy damage to a host damages the granule construct swarm equally, but normal weapon damage does not.

The last stage in becoming a graveknight is to construct a pool, pit, or other large concavity, into which the graveknight must place 13 helpless, good-aligned creatures of his own race, who must be sacrificed by the graveknight or his patron using acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The graveknight must wear his armor during these sacrifices, and within a minute of the last sacrifice, the graveknight must take his own life using the same form of energy, after which his body and armor must be destroyed by that form of energy. The pit within which the entire ritual took place must then be filled with soil taken from graves that have spawned undead creatures.",

While demons themselves do not rely upon reproduction to keep up their numbers, most demons can impregnate mortal creatures or, in some cases, can become pregnant with half-mortal offspring themselves. (See the individual chapters for specific information on this topic.) Of course, other methods can generate half-fiends as well-exposure to fecund Abyssal magic and energy, powerful ancient curses, and certain vile and blasphemous rituals may create half-fiend creatures-but demons in particular among the fiendish races are particularly and horrifically compatible with mortal humanoids. When a demon breeds with a mortal humanoid, the resulting birth is often a specific sub-category of half-fiend-a half-demon. Certain rituals can ensure that the resulting child is a half-demon rather than a half-fiend: such rituals are common in certain demon-worshiping cults, and some demons seek to sire or birth such children for their own sinister purposes.",

If an element of the half-fiend template is not mentioned in a particular half-demon sidebar, that element is not adjusted.",

Most devils include clauses to prevent a signee from destroying its own construct. A hell engine that becomes inactive due to a breach of contract, exploitation of a termination clause, or destruction of the original contracts can be reused to generate a new hell engine or to create a normal version of the base creature.",

An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience.",

A hivemind nexus often acts in a slightly different manner than the other members of the swarm, and an observer can single out a hivemind swarm's nexus as a move action with a successful Perception check opposed by the hivemind's Bluff or Stealth check (whichever skill has a higher modifier for the hivemind). The hivemind gains a racial modifier of +10 on this Bluff or Stealth check, due to the hundreds of similar-looking creatures constantly moving around it. Once a nexus is spotted, it can be slain if the observer manages to deal at least 1 point of damage to the swarm, provided that damage is applied in the same round that the observer managed to identify the nexus. If a nexus is destroyed, the hivemind swarm is staggered and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell level) in order to cast a spell. A hivemind swarm is able to create a new nexus by spending 1d6 rounds concentrating, during which time it can take no other action (including making any swarm attacks)."

Some scholars believe that, were this underlying mind to seize control, a normally mild-mannered person would revert to a savage, bestial state; some even theorize that when a barbarian enters a rage, he is in fact tapping into the id to empower his wrath. But what would happen if powerful magic were to act upon the id and make it transform not only a person's mind, but his physical being as well? One such method by which this can occur is via the [curse of bestial dreams](curse/curse_of_bestial_dreams), an affliction that arises when the wishcraft of a vespergaunt interacts with powerful magical crystals infused with mortal dreams and memories-an affliction that, in time, transforms its victims into a deformed and bestial creature known as an id mutant.",

This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like fly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.  ",
