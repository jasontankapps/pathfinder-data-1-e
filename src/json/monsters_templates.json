			"An alter ego arises when a sliver of a creature's personality breaks free and coalesces into an independent being. An alter ego is almost always formed by accident rather than by design, and usually comes into being during a moment of trauma, disorientation, or sudden incapacitation. In many cases, the progenitor isn't aware that the alter ego was created, particularly if the new creature hides or flees rather than confronting its progenitor immediately.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's body is made not of flesh and blood, but of solidified ectoplasm that looks, smells, and feels like its progenitor's body. Because ectoplasm is less dense than bone or carapace, an alter ego weighs less and is more nimble than its progenitor. Although an alter ego appears similar to its progenitor, it speaks in a flat monotone and its eyes stare blankly out of a numb, expressionless face. Observers find an alter ego's behavior and expressions doll-like and off-putting. A creature familiar with the progenitor can identify the alter ego as a duplicate with a successful Perception check (opposed by the alter ego's Disguise check) or with a successful DC 20 Sense Motive check. As an alter ego looks very similar to its progenitor, it can easily engender confusion or cause harm to its progenitor's reputation. If the alter ego of a famous paladin is spotted fleeing from danger, for example, witnesses might call the paladin's courage into question. Rumors of uncharacteristic actions might be the progenitor's first indication that an alter ego is at large.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's psyche is both more limited and more focused than the mind of its progenitor. Although the alter ego has all of the progenitor's memories and abilities at the time of its creation (including any prepared spells), its personality revolves around a single facet of its progenitor's psyche that drives the alter ego's actions. This facet is often a personality aspect that the progenitor prefers to keep hidden but that leapt to the fore during the event that caused the alter ego's creation. For example, a cleric who secretly grapples with doubt might spawn a staunchly atheist alter ego, or an alchemist who occasionally swindles an adventurer or traveler to keep up with the rent on her shop might engender an openly and unrepentantly greedy alter ego. Stories abound of murderous alter egos, but in truth only a rare few alter egos have facets that provoke extreme activities such as munificence or violence. Alter egos are generally dispassionate in their actions and neutral in alignment; the greatest danger most pose is to their progenitors' reputations and peace of mind.",
			"",
			"An alter ego's mind fixates on its sole purpose, and it is rarely idle. It actively and even obsessively pursues short-term goals based on its dominating facet. For example, an alter ego that came into being when its progenitor was disgraced might seek out and humiliate those who witnessed the event, while one with a murderous facet that formed during a botched getaway might engage in a string of massacres. Because these intentions spring from a limited aspect of the progenitor's personality, an alter ego's schemes often conflict with the progenitor's overall goals. For example, the progenitor of the vengeful alter ego might wish to forget the event that created it ever happened, while the alter ego's actions revive gossip about the unfortunate occurrence; if the murderous alter ego sprang from a progenitor who was a methodical, disciplined assassin, the alter ego's reckless killing spree is likely to interfere with the assassin's well-laid plans.",
			"",
			"Regardless of the alter ego's personality facet and how it was created, it loathes its progenitor. In some cases, the alter ego might merely find its progenitor to be abrasive. Most alter egos do not initially plan to kill their progenitors, but the idea may come to them while in their progenitors' presences, spurred by their instinctual hatred, and alter egos spawned from self-loathing or suicide attempts may actively plot to ruin or assassinate their progenitors. Despite this revulsion, an alter ego continually receives mental flashes of its progenitor's location and is debilitated when its progenitor is more than a mile away. When in its progenitor's immediate presence, an alter ego cannot help but recognize its progenitor and overhear snatches of the progenitor's surface thoughts. If the progenitor is dead, the alter ego gains considerable freedom to pursue its activities-a realization some alter egos come to over many days, weeks, or years' and that realization drives such alter egos to eventually murder their progenitors, or else plot to replace them and keep their wayward originals somewhere quiet and peaceful.",
			"",
			"Certain psychic or magic items (such as a [mirror of opposition](magic/wondrous/mirror_of_opposition)) can create a copy of a creature. The alter ego template works well for generating such a creature and is particularly appropriate for a copy of a psychic spellcaster or another psychically sensitive individual. Depending on the effect that created the copy, it may be either a duplicate or an opposite. Unlike standard alter egos, duplicates usually have the same alignment as their progenitors, while opposites have the diametrically opposite alignment.",

			"The typical intelligent mind exists as a war of aspects' primitive survival urges and base wants opposing intellectual reason and high-minded goals. Some of these aspects dominate the mind, defining a creature's personality, while others are shackled away. Sometimes psychic injuries can loosen these shackles, revealing aspects a creature would normally control and suppress. When a creature dies from a psychic injury, its conscious mind may shear away, leaving only those subconscious aspects-the creature's animus-behind. Called animus shades, these spectral undead are gripped with feral rage and lash out at the living. Individuals who engage in psychic combat are particularly prone to succumbing to this form of undeath, and their shades sometimes seek out their former opponents, not content until their one-time adversaries are slain.",

They often appear hunched and contorted after a lifetime of being crushed beneath the weight of the dominant psyches, and can sport wicked claws, overlong limbs, cracked flesh, severed (but still present) body parts, and other nightmarish deformities reflecting the fears their living selves harbored about the dark corners of their own minds. Any gear or items the creature had appear rotted, cracked, and torn in spectral form, though it may carry ghostly versions of the weapons it used in life, deadly implements still capable of harming the living.",
			"",
			"Most often, animus shades linger near the sites of their deaths or wander without any specific purpose. As many psychic contests occur in mindscapes or on far-flung esoteric planes, animus shades are frequently found roaming such realms, endlessly raging over the sometimes centuries-old defeats that resulted in their demises. Even when not consumed by such losses, animus shades commonly target those they happen across who remind them of the dominant selves that repressed them in life-whether because of similarities in physical appearance, personality, or activity. However, some rare animus shades have greater clarity of focus and are gripped with the need to undo the accomplishments they achieved in life, taking pleasure in destroying those things they once loved or took pride in.",

Among such races, these undead prove far more common within cultures and groups that cultivate psychic prowess. they're easy to mistake for ghosts or other undead-often to tragic ends. Fortunately, in lands that value physical strength over mental prowess and in strictly martial cultures, animus shades are almost unknown. Members of races such as hobgoblins, kobolds, and orcs, which seldom give rise to psychically talented individuals, almost never return as animus shades.",

			"Poisoned by the psychic violence that spawned them, animus shades rarely, if ever, cooperate. In death, even animus shades created from former allies slain by the same foe viciously strike out at each other. The mental trauma that fills them and holds them to the world scars these undead deeply, but ultimately makes them most resentful of themselves-they know it was their own weaknesses or distraction that resulted in their deaths.

This mercurial state of being is too piecemeal for alignment-based effects to take hold. The animus shade is immune to all effects that are dependent on alignment.",

Dryads are often the most insidious of these corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat all infected trees as their own bonded trees.",

Traditionally, the process of creating a child of Yog-Sothoth involves a blasphemous ritual that uses a mortal creature (typically a human) as an incubator. For the purpose of this ritual, gender is irrelevant. Giving birth to a child of Yog-Sothoth is always fatal. In most cases, the ritual results in the birth of twins-one a child of Yog-Sothoth, which can pass for a time as a member of the race of the creature in which it incubated, and one that cannot. Those twins that inherit a monstrous appearance take more after the Outer God itself in form, and are known as the spawn of Yog-Sothoth.",

The Rovagug cultists themselves have built a strange mythology for themselves around this practice-they believe the Gem of Dreams to be a gift sent them by their god. According to their myths, once the Rough Beast emerges from the Dead Vault and destroys Golarion, the corpse world left behind would be populated only by those Rovagug has chosen for survival.

However, a fiend-infused golem's marginally improved intellect means it can be given more complex instructions, such as evaluating an intruder's intent, activating or deactivating traps, acting in disguise, or patrolling a convoluted territory.

Using evil outsiders as an animating force came with an inherent drawback that Rachikan's golem crafters could never fully overcome: the fiend's seething anger at serving within a golem increases the chance that the fiend-infused golem will break free of its command and run amok. Ultimately, the golem crafters of Rachikan succeeded only by increasing the size of their golems: Rachikan's enormous behemoth golems are the only fiendinfused golems that do not risk the bound fiend going berserk. Although the Jistka Imperium is long gone, fiend-infused golems still guard its ancient factories and treasure vaults, particularly in the ruins of Rachikan and in other hidden sites along the Chelish coast.",

Some of these crafters had already developed their own techniques for creating fiend-infused golems, and use the unearthed Jistkan lore to confirm or supplement their own designs. The artificers of House Thrune are particularly interested in harnessing and improving upon the Jistkan methods, both because the golems promise to be very powerful additions to the Thrune arsenal and because they are always looking for new ways to bind the spirits of Hell.",

Floodslain tend to drift toward lower ground, as if seeking the very water that transformed them. While this habitual migration makes them a contained threat in some areas, the relatively flat floodplains of Belkzen offer little resistance to the wandering undead. They can be found floating in major rivers, trapped in ravines and valleys, and staggering across flatlands, sometimes in large numbers. Floodslain that come close to living creatures try to drown them, and relentlessly follow those who flee. Targets who escape often draw the attention of yet more floodslain, eventually leading the undead to their homes. In great numbers, floodslain can slaughter small settlements.",

			"A fungal creature is an animate plant with the appearance of a living creature. It grows from spores implanted in the dead body of a host creature, and takes on the host creature's basic form and many of that creature's abilities. It retains none of the memories of the creature it grew from, yet it instinctively knows how to use the abilities it inherited from its host. How exactly this is possible is a question that continues to befuddle scholars. The leading theory is that the spores' precise modeling of their host succeeds in capturing some of the creature's physiology-essentially copying its mind-but that for some reason the departure of the creature's spirit or soul upon death prevents the spores from copying the memories as well.",

A ghost can lay this curse by making a touch attack, which forces the target to make a Will save or be stunned for 1 round. During this round, the target receives a flood of images suggesting a course of action-though such might remain vague or require research into the ghost's history to discern an exact meaning.

This illusion functions similarly to the spell [mirage arcana](spell/mirage_arcana) in combination with multiple [major images](unknown/major_images), allowing the ghost to recreate any scene, setting, or characters it wishes. The ghost can even incorporate itself into the effect, appearing as it wishes within the illusion as if it were under the effects of [alter self](spell/alter_self).

Alone, each individual is a barely sentient construct so tiny as to be practically invisible, a speck of dust that moves under its own power. Brought together by the thousands into a swarm, however, the complex linking of simple systems creates an emergent consciousness of humanlike intelligence, although alien enough to make communication nearly impossible. Granule construct swarms exist solely to infest larger living organisms and reproduce in the relative safety and comfort provided by their bodies. Capable of repairing and replicating out of the raw elements around them, granule constructs within a host are almost unstoppable through physical means, burrowing their way into flesh and sending signals through the bloodstream. Once safely ensconced, granule construct swarms modify their hosts to maximize survival potential, a trait that leads certain people to intentionally cultivate granule construct swarms inside themselves, despite the resulting deformities. Energy damage to a host damages the granule construct swarm equally, but normal weapon damage does not.

They bear the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight's essence is fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of its battle lust. This armor becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone locked within.",

			"**Aura:** A graveknight emanates the following aura.  ",
			"**Sacrilegious Aura (Su):** A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the spell desecrate and uses the graveknight's armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits of this effect (including the bonus hit points, as this aura is part of the graveknight's creation). In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing subtype-must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's Hit Dice + the graveknight's Charisma modifier.

The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the graveknight's control.

A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later.  ",
			"**Ruinous Revivification (Su):** At the time of its creation, the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type influences the effects of several of a graveknight's special abilities.",

A typical suit of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit points, though armor with enhancements or made of special materials proves more difficult to destroy. Merely breaking a graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it must be ruined, such as by being disintegrated, taken to the Positive Energy Plane, or thrown into the heart of a volcano.",

			"While most graveknights arise spontaneously from the armor of sadistic warlords and fallen champions, there are methods by which evil men and women can deliberately transform themselves into these powerful undead lords, in much the same way some spellcasters seek to become liches. The process by which a hopeful graveknight makes the deliberate transformation is neither simple nor cheap. The character must first live and lead a life of wanton cruelty, winning great glory and power over the course of several violent conflicts (and achieving a minimum of 9th level in any character class, with an evil alignment for all 9 levels). When he achieves this goal, he may craft the suit of armor that will serve him in his afterlife as his graveknight armor this must be heavy armor, although its exact type is irrelevant. The creator must also be proficient in the armor's use. The armor itself must be of exceptional quality and crafting, requiring the finest of materials and artisans. Even the forge upon which the armor is to be crafted must be of exceptional quality. The overall cost of these components is 25,000 gp-this amount is over and above any additional costs incurred in making the armor magical. An existing suit of armor (including magic armor) can serve as the base suit upon which these 25,000 gp of enhancements are built.",
			"",
			"Once the armor is complete, the hopeful graveknight must don the armor and then seek out a powerful evil patron to sponsor his cruelties-this patron can be a mortal tyrant, a hateful monster, a demonic god, or similar power. Once the graveknight-to-be secures a patron, he must engage upon a crusade in that patron's name. This crusade must last long enough for the graveknight to achieve two additional levels of experience, during which he must wear his armor whenever possible.",
			"",
			"Upon completing this final stage of his quest for undeath (and a minimum character level of 11th), the sadist has finally neared the end of his long path to eternal undeath. The last stage in becoming a graveknight is to construct a pool, pit, or other large concavity, into which the graveknight must place 13 helpless, good-aligned creatures of his own race, who must be sacrificed by the graveknight or his patron using acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The graveknight must wear his armor during these sacrifices, and within a minute of the last sacrifice, the graveknight must take his own life using the same form of energy, after which his body and armor must be destroyed by that form of energy. The pit within which the entire ritual took place must then be filled with soil taken from graves that have spawned undead creatures.",
			"",
			"Once this final step is taken, the graveknight-to-be has a 75% chance of rising as a graveknight. This chance rises by 1% per point of Charisma possessed by the graveknight-to-be at the time of his death. Additional factors can increase this chance as well, at the GM's discretion"

When a demon breeds with a mortal humanoid, the resulting birth is often a specific sub-category of half-fiend-a half-demon.

			"While all riders possess their own intelligence and have unique goals and motivations, they are similar enough to present them as related entities. Riders attempt to influence their hosts by disseminating cryptic ideas and motivations among the host's own thoughts and memories. A rider's methods of influencing its host are subtle yet effective, though ultimately it has no ability to override the host creature. It cannot take control of the host's body, and throughout the \"possession\" the host retains its free will. Instead, the rider can strong-arm its host, much like when casting [geas/quest](spell/geas_quest)\"a host who fails to act upon the rider's -requests\" suffers increasingly adverse physical and mental ailments. These effects can, at their most potent, cause the host permanent damage or even death. Typically, the rider departs after its host perishes, though it is unclear whether the adverse effects are produced to attempt to further sway the host, or as a result of the rider choosing to depart because the host continually disregards its suggestions.",
			"",
			"Still, being a haunted one is not without some benefits. Haunted ones possess the uncanny ability to recall fantastic amounts of knowledge in areas of study previously unknown to them, often including information beyond the scope of the greatest scholars. Typically, this knowledge concerns something ancient and occult, forbidden things that most would find horrifying and maddening, which the host feels compelled to seek out and explore. Similarly, riders inherently sense the presence of others like themselves, and often use the host to track their rivals down. While these urges are not inherently beneficial, hosts who appease them begin to develop stronger connections with their riders. As a result, the rider becomes more efficient at transferring greater amounts of lost knowledge to the host.",
			"",
			"The circumstances by which a creature can be exposed to an unbodied entity capable of transforming it into a haunted one are numerous, but if the targeted creature wishes to resist the attempt by the rider to invade its mind, the host-to-be can attempt a DC 15 Will save. If the save is successful, the unbodied entity fails to possess the host, and may not try again for 24 hours.",

A hell engine requires the same physical body as its base creature, but the creator need only sign a contract and surrender his immortal soul to animate the construct. Typically a devil drafts a contract that grants the mortal signee some service performed by the hell engine, with mastery of the construct transferring to the devil upon completion of the task or the mortal's demise. As with all infernal contracts, animating a hell engine is always a lawful and evil act.",
			"",
			"The hell engine generally serves as an intermediary in the contract's stipulations, allowing clever mortals or devils to exploit loopholes in the agreement via the construct itself. For example, destroying a hell engine before it completes its contractual task or the mortal signee dies may nullify the contract, releasing the soul from damnation. Most devils include clauses to prevent a signee from destroying its own construct. A hell engine that becomes inactive due to a breach of contract, exploitation of a termination clause, or destruction of the original contracts can be reused to generate a new hell engine or to create a normal version of the base creature.",
			"",
			"Powerful hell engines require more soul energy to activate; the devil and the mortal signing the contract must each have at least 1 Hit Die per 2 Hit Dice of the hell engine they wish to animate. A devil can use multiple souls to fuel the same hell engine as long as the total number of Hit Dice between the mortal signatories equals at least half the Hit Dice of the construct. However, convincing numerous mortals to sign away their souls for shared custody of a construct can be difficult, even for an accomplished dealmaker."

Hiveminds often occur in swarms that have existed for generations and that have dwelled in areas of potent magical influence, particularly areas of strong psychic magic. Over time, the swarm learns to work together in more intelligent ways to achieve its goals, and it eventually evolves a cohesive mind. Of course, this evolution can be hastened by direct intervention of potent magic (typically something on the level of a [miracle](spell/miracle) or [wish](spell/wish)), or as an unintended side effect of esoteric rituals, the use or destruction of artifacts, or the deaths of powerful minds.",

An urban swarm may pick up Common, Dwarven, Elven, or Halfling from snippets of conversations overheard through sewer grates, whereas an underground swarm may learn Dwarven or Undercommon. A hivemind may begin to exert its psychic abilities by compelling animals or people to bring it food or protect it from larger creatures, and it slowly graduates to defending itself and actively attacking as it gains experience.",

One such method by which this can occur is via the curse of bestial dreams, an affliction that arises when the wishcraft of a vespergaunt interacts with powerful magical crystals infused with mortal dreams and memories-an affliction that, in time, transforms its victims into a deformed and bestial creature known as an id mutant.",

As long as the implacable stalker is able to see or hear a creature currently experiencing any level of fear ranging from spooked to horrified (see page 10), it gains fast healing equal to its Hit Dice, its damage reduction increases to 10/-, and it gains spell resistance equal to 16 + its CR.",

Each week, such creatures are subject to a nightmare effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the implacable stalker's Hit Dice + the implacable stalker's Charisma modifier; the normal modifiers for nightmare based on knowledge and connection do not apply). In this nightmare, the creature is hunted and slain by the implacable stalker (for GMs using the nightmare dreamscape rules on page 162, these nightmares always have the \"being chased\" nightmare feature). A creature that succeeds at three consecutive saving throws to resist the effect is freed from it. If any creature fails at three consecutive saving throws to resist the nightmare, the implacable stalker returns to life, as per true resurrection.

Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style.

A creature may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner.  ",

Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi's prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver, which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work.",
			"",
			"**Weaknesses:** Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round. Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn.",

It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiang-shi vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire's damage reduction. Additionally, any successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature. Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the day without harm.",

This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like fly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction.  ",
			"**Melee:** A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's claws are even more dangerous than this, though-see the \"brutal claws\" special attack below. A jiang-shi's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.  ",

			"**Brutal Claws (Ex):** A jiang-shi's nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks.  ",
			"**Drain Chi (Su):** Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains \"chi,\" or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds.",

Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist, which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench zombies are created using the juju zombie template, but they lose the juju zombie's immunity to magic missile, which is replaced by immunity to acid.

If the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie.

All wereraptors are born with prominently colored eyes with irises that fill the majority of the eye. The bright yellows, reds, and blues of wereraptors' eyes are overlooked among elves or gnomes, but are more difficult to ignore in human cultures. In addition, wereraptor facial structures favor high cheekbones, sharp noses, and pointed chins. These attributes can draw unwanted attention, prompting most wereraptors to prefer a life of seclusion.",

Natural wereraptors easily adapt to these senses as they grow, but that feat proves far more difficult for afflicted wereraptors. Increased perception does not manifest until the first transformation under a full moon. After returning to humanoid form, wereraptors find their eyes involuntarily focusing on extremely distant objects, while their ears reverberate with the sound of thundering whispers and booming heartbeats. The sensory burden sometimes becomes too much to bear, causing an afflicted wereraptor to panic for the first days of this experience. Both afflicted and natural wereraptors eventually learn to use their senses to discern involuntary responses in a person's body, allowing them a greater degree of insight when interacting with others. To outsiders, this appears to be innate intuition concerning emotions.",

			"In their animal forms, wereraptors appear to be larger, more savage versions of their avian kind. The excruciating process of changing shape leads many wereraptors to remain in their hybrid forms at all times; plus, reverting to their humanoid form causes the almost instantaneous molting of feathers, which can be easily tracked.",

			"Like their avian kin, wereraptors are primarily carnivores. Ready access to food allows most wereraptors to keep their bestial natures in check, though some isolationists surrender to their instincts entirely. Once a wereraptor's primal urges have taken over, it sets out to find a fitting kill to sate its compulsions, even if this takes days to accomplish. Afflicted wereraptors frequently find their internal struggle overwhelming, bordering on maddening. The sight of carrion can be enticing to wereraptors and is particularly disruptive to those whose avian kin are scavengers.",
			"",
			"The transformative nature and territorial temperaments of wereraptors leads to the majority being self-imposed outcasts. They often take homes in remote locations favored by their avian kind, usually in forests or mountains, and eke out simple lifestyles. Wereraptors tend to clash with each other when their hunting grounds overlap. The conflict between the parties can escalate to the point that a duel is declared. These duels are always held within neutral territory and involve a hunt of some kind. A hunt may be for a specific creature, such as a notable predator of the region. Other times, the participants become the prey themselves, with each party attempting to capture or slay the other.",

			"Wereraptors also tend to find integration within established societies somewhat of a challenge. When interacting with others, wereraptors can come off as abrasive and reclusive. Their heightened sense of awareness causes many wereraptors to habitually watch others for uncomfortable lengths of time. This, in addition to their odd physical features, can quickly create a minor rift between the wereraptors and the rest of many civilized societies, which often leads to the wereraptors being ostracized.

They can be found leading pirate gangs or loitering at seaside taverns accompanied by crowds of toadies. Since they get into fights so often, they try to stick close to the sea so they can escape into the water if they bite off more than they can chew.

Of course, such telltale signs are not always accurate, for such physical traits exist in normal people as well, but in areas where werewolves are a common problem, the traits can be damning regardless.",

Stories of werewolves haunting lonely forest roads, prowling misty moors on the outskirts of rural societies, or dwelling in the shadows of the largest cities are widespread as well. In most societies, werewolves are feared and despised-and with good reason, as the typical werewolf personifies all that is savage and bestial in a lycanthrope. This isn't to say that good-aligned werewolves are unknown, but they're certainly a minority among their kind, and most werewolves are evil murderers who delight in the hunt and the succulent taste of raw meat.",

Any sort of animal can become a man-eater, from known predators to seemingly harmless herbivores. Though the creatures and locations may change, certain elements remain the same in tales of man-eating animals. Having tasted human flesh, these animals can't be sated by any other type of food. Man-eaters have terrible bites, and hunters' arrows bounce off their hides. Man-eaters are unusually bold, no longer frightened by human presence like their kin.

Though not wholly fiendish in nature, the beast gains limited sentience, increased resilience, and unnatural appetites. Despite popular belief, eating humanoid flesh isn't enough to turn an animal into a maneater. The creature must be exposed to chaotic and evil influences, whether from a planar gate, demonic altar, or transformative elixir (such as the blood of Baphomet).

Exposing any nosferatu to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water deals an amount of damage to a nosferatu equal to one-third of its full normal hit points-a nosferatu reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed.

If it pins the foe, it drains blood, draining 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom each round the pin is maintained. On each round it drains blood, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points).",

Anyone the nosferatu targets must succeed at a Will save or fall instantly under the nosferatu's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). This ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some nosferatu (such as a very old one or with an unusually strong bloodline) might be able to affect different creature types with this power.",

			"**Swarm Form (Su):** As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The nosferatu gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it has transformed into. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu can't use its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains the defensive abilities, weaknesses, and special qualities it gains from being a nosferatu, counts as an undead creature, and can use any of the swarm's abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise.",

			"Petitioners are the souls of mortals brought to the Outer Planes after death in order to experience their ultimate punishment, reward, or fate. A petitioner retains fragments of its memories from life, and its appearance depends not only upon the shape it held in life but also upon the nature of the Outer Plane to which it has come. The stat block detailed above presents a typical petitioner formed from the soul of an average human-it does not include any of the plane-specific abilities or features a petitioner gains, and should be modified as appropriate depending on the plane to which the petitioner is assigned.",
			"",
			"Creatures who die, become petitioners, and then return to life retain no memories of the time they spent as petitioners in the afterlife. A petitioner who dies is gone forever-its \"life force\" has either returned to the Positive Energy Plane or, in some cases, provided the energy to trigger the creation of another outsider. Petitioners who please a deity or another powerful outsider can be granted rewards-the most common such reward manifests as a transformation into a different outsider, such as an archon, azata, demon, or devil, depending upon the petitioner's alignment. In rare cases, a creature can retain its personality from life all the way through its existence as a petitioner and into its third \"life\" as an outsider, although such events are rare indeed.",
			"",
			"\"Petitioner\" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature whose soul migrates to one of the Outer Planes following its death (henceforth referred to as the base creature). The petitioner uses all of the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted below.",

In some cases, at the GM's discretion, particularly large or unusual petitioners with higher than normal ability scores may begin with a higher CR; compare the petitioner's statistics to the values on Table 1-1 on page 293 to help determine an unusual petitioner's starting CR.  ",
			"**Alignment:** A petitioner's alignment is identical to that of its home plane.  ",
			"**Size and Type:** The creature's type changes to outsider. It loses all subtypes. Its size does not change.  ",
			"**Senses:** Petitioners lose any unusual senses they had, but gain darkvision 60 feet.  ",
			"**Armor Class:** The petitioner loses all racial bonuses to its Armor Class.  ",
			"**Hit Dice:** Petitioners lose all racial and class-based Hit Dice and gain 2d10 racial Hit Dice as outsiders.  ",
			"**Saves:** Petitioners have good Fortitude and Reflex saves; a petitioner's base saves are Fort +3, Ref +3, Will +0.  ",
			"**Defensive Abilities:** Petitioners lose all the defensive abilities of the base creature. Petitioners are immune to mind-affecting effects.  ",
			"**Attacks:** The creature's BAB is +2, subject to modification for size and Strength. It loses all natural attacks and gains a slam attack as appropriate for a creature of its size.  ",
			"**Special Attacks:** Petitioners lose all special attacks.  ",
			"**Abilities:** Same as the base creature.  ",
			"**Feats:** Petitioners lose all feats. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner gains one feat-typically Toughness.  ",
			"**Skills:** Petitioners lose all skill ranks they possessed as mortals. As a 2 HD outsider, a petitioner has 12 skill ranks it can spend on skills (with a maximum of 2 ranks in any one skill), and gains bonus skill ranks as appropriate for its Intelligence. Unlike most outsiders, petitioners do not gain an additional 4 class skills beyond those available to all outsiders.  ",

A hunted that survives long enough eventually warps and twists into a daemon. The hunted gain DR 5/- and fast healing 1 so that they provide a slightly more robust hunt for their daemonic predators.  ",
			"**Abyss (Chaotic Evil):** \"Larvae\" are perhaps the most hideous of petitioners-they appear as pallid, maggot-like creatures with heads similar to those they possessed in life. Larvae that feed long enough on Abyssal filth eventually transform into demons. They have cold, electricity, and fire resistance 10, and instead of a slam attack gain a bite attack as appropriate for their size.  ",
			"**Elysium (Chaotic Good):** The \"chosen\" have idealized versions of their mortal bodies. In time, after experiencing the pleasures Elysium has to offer, the chosen become azatas. The chosen gain resistance to cold and fire 10 and a +2 bonus to Charisma.  ",
			"**Heaven (Lawful Good):** The \"elect\" appear similar to their mortal forms, save that they possess a golden halo and feathered wings. After spending enough time aiding heavenly tasks, the elect become archons. They gain a fly speed equal to their base speed (average mobility).  ",
			"**Hell (Lawful Evil):** The \"damned\" retain their mortal forms, but are heavily scarred by various tortures. Those who endure the torments of Hell long enough may eventually be approved for transformation into devils. The damned gain immunity to fire (but not immunity to the pain caused by fire-whenever one of the damned takes fire damage, it must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being stunned by the pain for 1d4 rounds).  ",
			"**Limbo (Chaotic Neutral):** The \"shapeless\" retain their basic forms, but these forms constantly waver and shimmer, as if they were ghosts in peril of dissolving away. After wallowing in the chaos of Limbo for long enough, they can transform into proteans. The shapeless have the incorporeal subtype, an incorporeal touch attack, and all advantages granted by that defensive ability.  ",
			"**Nirvana (Neutral Good):** The \"cleansed\" take on the forms of animals that closely approximate their personalities. Upon achieving true enlightenment, they transform into agathions. The cleansed gain cold and sonic resistance 10 and a +2 bonus to Wisdom.  ",
			"**Purgatory (Neutral):** The \"dead\" appear as animated skeletons but are not undead-in time, they can earn the right to become aeons. They gain DR 10/bludgeoning and immunity to cold.  ",
			"**Utopia (Lawful Neutral):** The \"remade\" retain the same body shape but have milky white skin covered in dense black script, as if some strange scribe had used them for parchment. Upon deciphering the riddles posed by these complex lines of script, one of the remade can enter an axiomite forge to be transformed into an inevitable. The remade are immune to hostile transmutation effects and gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence."

			"The typical ghost is a nightmarish creature of dark emotion, with an undying thirst for justice or vengeance. These ghosts are often warped by deep emotional turmoil, madness, or contact with the dark radiations of the Negative Energy Plane-sometimes all three. But such twisted, tormented creatures are not the only spirits that cling to traces of their former lives on the Material Plane. There is another kind of ghost, just as dedicated, but more rational and often more subtle.",
			"",
			"As a soul departs a body, it joins the great River of Souls winding its way through the Astral Plane and passes on to judgment in the Outer Planes. Sometimes such a soul, through force of will or an unquenchable desire to accomplish one last act, forces its way back to the Material Plane as a prana ghost. Formed entirely of vital life essence, or prana, this manifest spirit is not an undead creature, but rather something entirely different, though undead that gorge on life energy are drawn to the glut of prana that composes a prana ghost like scavengers to a fresh corpse. Though easily mistaken for the undead spirits they resemble, prana ghosts function very differently from normal ghosts, haunts, and other incorporeal undead.",
			"",
			"Unlike the raging etheric ghost, a prana ghost tends to avoid worldly affairs when it can. It acts as mentor and guide to the living rather than acting overtly. These ghosts exude a supernatural calm and exhibit great control over their emotions and desires, wishing only to accomplish the task at hand, and to do so as quickly and as safely as possible. Even so, when victory (or failure) looms, a reckless prana ghost may attempt to take matters into its own hands. Such an intervention can be a great surprise to those who had no idea a supernatural entity was pulling the strings of their agents and allies. Among virtuous creatures who were unaware of the aid they were receiving, the prana ghost's appearance might lead to violence if the prana ghost can't convince them it isn't undead.",
			"",
			"Once a prana ghost succeeds at its task, or its failure becomes clear, it dissipates from the world and reenters the Astral Plane. Many prana ghosts then resume their passage toward the Outer Planes, but a few dwell on the Astral Plane for centuries, if not millennia. Such prana ghosts often plot a reversal of personal fortunes, or the fortunes of their progeny or those of friends and allies. Others linger because they are not yet ready to reach their final fate.",
			"",
			"Usually, prana ghosts are more helpful and less malicious than their ethereal cousins, but not always. A creature doesn't need to have led a virtuous or enlightened life to achieve the state-it needs only the necessary force of will to slip the chains of death, and a willingness to accept whatever consequences its soul might have to endure for refusing to face judgment at the appointed time. The souls of evil creatures seeking final vengeance can be just as willful as those with righteous goals, for selfishness can drive a soul to cling to mortal existence as strongly as more noble motivations.",

			"**Rejuvenation (Su):** In most cases, it is difficult to dissipate a prana ghost through simple combat; the prana ghost restores itself in 2d4 days. Generally, the only way to permanently dissipate a prana ghost is to help it complete its mission or to make the mission impossible to complete, after which the prana ghost continues its path to the afterlife.",
			"",
			"**Weaknesses:** A prana ghost gains the following weakness. Living Prana (Ex): A prana ghost is made entirely of life essence, so it is vulnerable to effects that snufflife essence out. A prana ghost takes half again as much damage (+50%) from negative energy effects and death effects that deal damage, half again as many negative levels from negative energy effects that inflict negative levels, and half again as much Constitution damage and drain from negative energy effects (such as a wraith's touch). If a prana ghost dissipates from such an effect, it takes twice as long for it to restore itself via rejuvenation.",

			"",
			"**Defensive Abilities:** A psychic lich gains channel resistance +4, DR 15/bludgeoning and magic, and immunity to cold and electricity (in addition to those abilities granted by its undead traits). The lich also gains the following two defensive abilities.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Feast (Ex):** If a psychic lich succeeds at a Will saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, it instead avoids the effect entirely. If the effect was a spell with the mind-affecting descriptor, the psychic lich also heals an amount of damage equal to 1d8 plus the spell's caster level if it succeeds at its save. A psychic lich may automatically succeed on any Will save against a spell it casts that targets only itself.",
			"",
			"**Rejuvenation (Su):** When a psychic lich is destroyed, its body reforms near its astral memoir 10d10 days later. If a creature reads the psychic lich's memoir, the total time is reduced to one tenth the original result, which could result in the psychic lich's immediate restoration in a new body.

An astral legend can't be destroyed unless the psychic lich's physical body has also been destroyed and has not yet rejuvenated.",

The creature doesn't automatically attack the psychic lich if it is targeted by further attacks. Calm emotions or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description) with a DC equal to the bewildering touch's save DC.

			"Much like their more bestial cousins, psychic vampires are undead abominations driven by a terrible hunger. However, unlike vampires and nosferatu, who feed on blood, psychic vampires hunger for the occult energy that fuels the spells of psychic spellcasters. Some scholars confuse psychic vampires with the rare vetala breed of vampires or call them \"vetalaranas,\" as they steal a more refined form of spiritual energy. For their part, psychic vampires consider vetalas a dying bloodline, and as their own influence increases, they strike against their corpse-possessing kin with impunity.",
			"",
			"A psychic vampire is usually born when a creature with psychic potential dies in a state of denial, stubbornly clinging to the material world through sheer willpower. As it dies, the creature attempts to draw on its own psychic energy and that of any living beings around it in order to cling to its mortal existence. It inevitably fails, but if its will is strong enough, it rises again. No longer able to sustain itself using its own mental energy, it hungers for the energy of others. Psychic vampires can't create spawn, and thus their numbers remain relatively small.",
			"",
			"A hungry psychic vampire appears in shades of gray, but when it has gorged on psychic energy, it becomes flushed with natural colors once again, and if it's careful, it might pass for a living creature. Although sunlight doesn't harm psychic vampires, they avoid it because their unnatural grayness gives away their true nature. Religious mantras and superstitious antics have no effect on psychic vampires other than to amuse them greatly, although psychic vampires who were religious in life might expect those practices to hold power over them in their undead state and react with fear until they realize the mantras can't harm them. The only thing that can give a psychic vampire pause is lack of fear in its victims.",
			"",
			"The home of a psychic vampire looks deceptively normal, holding fresh food and other supplies that undead creatures don't need in abundant supply.

A psychic vampire also gains fast healing 5. If the psychic vampire is reduced to 0 hit points in combat, its fast healing ceases to function, and it must possess an object (see Weaknesses below) as an immediate action or be utterly destroyed. While possessing the object, it can't use any of its supernatural abilities or exit the object. If the possessed object is destroyed while the psychic vampire possesses it, the psychic vampire is permanently destroyed. After 1 hour, the psychic vampire can exit the possessed object, regain 1 hit point, and resume healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.",
			"",
			"**Weaknesses:** A psychic vampire has difficulty tolerating any vocal expressions that deny its power or authority. Any character can force a psychic vampire to recoil by dramatically defying it verbally as a standard action. This doesn't harm the psychic vampire-it merely keeps the psychic vampire at bay. A recoiling psychic vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from an openly defiant character and can't touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a psychic vampire can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save.",

These PE points are in addition to the psychic vampire's current PE total, and any PE expended is subtracted from these PE points first. These temporary PE points don't stack with any previously gained temporary PE points. The temporary PE points disappear 1 hour later. The psychic vampire's attack also drains the target's memories, as per mindwipe.

			"While nearly all spirits experience the Astral Plane at some point in their cosmic journeys, it is still one of the least understood planes in the multiverse. Some say it is merely a dream of the gods, while others contend it is the realm of thought itself. Though it is a seemingly endless realm of celestial desert, creatures still roam and hunt on its infinite expanse.",
			"",
			"Among the strangest are the psychoplasmic creatures that spontaneously form on the Astral Plane in no perceivable pattern. It could be that when a soul gets caught up in some form of astral eddy, its essence and the strange energies of the Astral Plane fuse to create this bizarre form of life. Some suggest that the passage of souls through the plane leaves impressions behind, the most powerful of which manifest as beings unto themselves. The most outlandish philosophies theorize that since the Astral Plane is a plane of thought, maybe a great thinker exists somewhere beyond the expanse, and these creatures are physical embodiments of its will.",
			"",
			"Whatever the nature of a psychoplasmic creature's genesis, it retains much of its knowledge of its former life, if any, but is extremely emotionally dulled. It cares nothing for its past, and instead takes on a mission or a task that it must complete, but usually without knowing why. Those who believe that the Astral Plane is both the incarnation of thought and also a thinker believe that these creatures always do the bidding of that astral mind. The evidence is scant, as there seems to be little rhyme or reason to individual psychoplasmic creatures' actions. Instead, they seem inexplicably fixated on random things; while a few eventually change the nature of their obsessions, such refocusing is rare. Some of the most common tasks that psychoplasmic creatures propel themselves toward include hunting down beasts or beings that they never could have bested in life, exploring or drawing other creatures toward areas of the Astral Planes where few have ever tread, and giving themselves over to the service of psychic masters to whom they are inexplicably attuned.",
			"",
			"The one common thread between all psychoplasmic creatures is their substance and appearance. Though they keep the forms they once held (or were molded to resemble), they seem to be composed of a large, constantly shifting clump of silvery dust. This dust continuously drifts from a psychoplasmic creature's form, dissipating into nothing. Yet as fast as it falls, it is replaced, leaving the creature's size unchanged even after decades or centuries of such evaporation. The strange dust of a psychoplasmic creature's form completely disappears only after the creature fulfills its inscrutable objective.",
			"",
			"Psychoplasmic creatures come in many forms. Many are large, hulking brutes that stalk those who invade or defile the Astral Plane, sometimes tracking trespassers to the Material Plane (though their mobility is diminished there). Others are more intelligent and serve as advisors and companions to shulsagas. These beings might be treated as anything from valued members of a shulsaga community to embodiments of heroes or entire shulsaga tribes lost and reborn. Others, however, wage war on shulsagas, and are widely perceived as the psychic vengeance of deadly foes or mighty beasts from their mythology. In any case, the known power of psychoplasmic creatures has impacted shulsagas' culture and art, and they dust many of their most sacred sites and most impressive pieces of statuary in silvery powder, to suggest suggesting the adaptability and might of psychoplasmic creatures.",
			"",
			"A select few psychoplasmic creatures serve the interests of the Boneyard-though it can be difficult to tell whether that is intentional or incidental. Psychopomps keep these astral denizens at arm's length, but nonetheless welcome their aid in their eternal vigil over the River of Souls. Many psychopomps remain skeptical of the strange creatures' agenda, though, suspecting that these psychoplasmic allies are spying on or undermining their comrades. Regardless, no accounts tell of psychoplasmic creatures serving predators of souls, such as daemons.",

			"**Breath Weapon (Su):** A ravener keeps the breath weapon of the base creature-the save DC for this breath weapon is now Charisma-based. In addition, a ravener's breath weapon bestows 2 negative levels on all creatures in the area. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and reduces the energy drain to 1 negative level. The save DC to remove these negative levels is equal to the ravener's breath weapon DC. The ravener adds 1 hit point to its soul ward ability for each negative level bestowed in this way.  ",

			"**Soul Consumption (Su):** When a living creature within 30 feet of a ravener dies, that creature's soul is torn from its body and pulled into the ravener's maw if the dying creature fails a Will save (DC equals the save DC of the ravener's breath weapon). This adds a number of hit points to the ravener's soul ward equal to the dead creature's Hit Dice. Creatures that have their souls consumed in this way can only be brought back to life through miracle, true resurrection, or wish.  ",
			"**Soul Magic (Sp):** A ravener retains the base creature's spellcasting capability, adding three levels to the base creature's caster level. This increases the number of spells known by the ravener, but the ravener loses all spell slots. Instead, whenever the ravener wishes to cast any one of its spells known, it consumes a number of hit points from its soul ward equal to the spell slot level necessary to cast the spell (including increased levels for metamagic feats and so on). If the soul ward has insufficient hit points, the ravener cannot cast that spell. Casting a spell that reduces its soul ward to exactly 0 hit points does not harm the ravener (though most are not comfortable without this buffer of soul-energy and try to replenish it quickly).  ",
			"**Abilities:** Str +4, Int +4, Wis +4, Cha +6. Being undead, a ravener has no Constitution score.  ",

Some of these rituals incorporate unusual stages that can alter the resulting ravener's powers. Two example alternative rituals are presented below-others might well exist in forbidden texts.",
			"",
			"**Nightmare Ravener (+0 CR):** Driven by fear of death in life, this ravener feeds upon the fear of others in death. The ritual to become a nightmare ravener requires bargaining with powerful entities from the nightmare dimension of Leng or with deities of nightmares like [Lamashtu](faith/lamashtu). Unlike normal raveners, nightmare raveners do not inflict negative levels on a critical hit, though they keep their increased threat range. Nightmare raveners instead gain the deadly terror special attack.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Terror (Su):** Whenever a nightmare ravener scores a hit with a natural weapon against a cowering, frightened, panicked, or shaken creature, she deals an additional 2d6 points of negative energy damage. For each such hit, she also adds 1 point to her soul ward ability even if the creature struck is immune to negative energy damage. This extra damage is not increased on a critical hit. Thassilonian Ravener (+0 CR): The runelords of Thassilon, particularly the necromancer Zutha, often traded their powerful magical secrets to dragons in return for a period of servitude while the dragons lived. When this period ended, the runelord would aid the dragons in making the transition from living to undead. The methods for these rituals still exist in certain Thassilonian ruins, and are invariably guarded by the raveners who used the rituals to transcend their own mortality.",
			"",
			"A Thassilonian ravener's bones are etched with numerous runes of power. These runes alter the link between the ravener's magic and her soul ward. A Thassilonian ravener lacks the soul magic ability of most raveners-she casts her spells as normal for a dragon, using spell slots. Each time a Thassilonian ravener casts a spell, she heals damage equal to twice the level of the spell cast. If her soul ward is damaged, any \"healing\" the ravener gains from casting spells applies first to restoring hit points to her soul ward. If a ravener casts a spell while both her soul ward and her body are at full hit points, she becomes hasted for 1 round."

Powerful swimmers without the need to breathe or eat, and nearly impossible to destroy in their natural element, these crack teams were the bane of Andoren ships, with just a handful of the fast-healing horrors capable of overrunning the mightiest frigates. Concerned that such effective troops might reach too far, the Chelish government ordered them anchored to their role with the \"curse of the sea-sworn,\" rendering them incapable of abandoning their ships or the sea.

When the host finally slips into a catatonic coma, these fibers quickly digest the organs and portions of the flesh before animating the corpse from within like a puppet.

			"Silverblood werewolves are a rare type of lycanthrope found almost exclusively in the Arthfell Forest. They are the survivors of an experimental process conceived by jeweler-turned-werewolf Garrick Argentum, and developed by his allies in the Shadow Pack, a group of werewolf druids in the forest. The Shadow Pack conducted an eldritch ritual involving successive exposures to pure silver under the light of the full moon in an attempt to desensitize the werewolves to the deadly touch of silver (in theory, this process could also produce other types of silverblood lycanthropes). The experiment was a success, and the werewolves lost their vulnerability. Swollen with pride at their new ability, the Shadow Pack joined forces with the hobgoblins of the wood and attacked the town of Olfden. Turned back after a savage battle known as the Night of Silver Blood, the werewolves sought to regroup and prepare a new assault, but on the night of the next new moon they discovered a fatal flaw in their blasphemous rite. Tied now more than ever to the lunar cycle, most of the silverblood werewolves wasted away and died when the moon darkened. Even those few that survived are greatly weakened when each new moon comes, though the surge of power when the moon waxes full still earns them great respect, and many have found positions of leadership among the werewolves of the wood.",

			"Though the Night of Silver Blood was a failure, many hobgoblins and werewolves within the Arthfell Forest believe it is proof that major towns and even small cities could be totally ravaged by a somewhat larger, betterprepared force spearheaded by silverblood werewolves. Some groups of silverblood werewolves continue to maintain close connections to the local hobgoblins, forming war parties with them that raid farther and farther from the woods during the nights of the full moon. If one such band were to have a noteworthy success, its leaders might be able to gather a much larger force that could once again threaten Olfden or similarly sized settlements.",

Even when killed, a tulpa is not truly banished as long as its original creator still lives. Most tulpas come back to their creator within a month of the tulpa's physical death.",

The unknown propagate more of their own kind by eroding humanoids' psyches until the victims transform into new unknown. Unknown typically choose to victimize those who are already relatively helpless, especially children, but when they transform an accomplished adventurer into one of their own, the result can be truly terrifying.",

A successful save negates the Charisma damage and also ends the unknown's victimize effect on that target.

If not, the creature immediately loses all sense of self, becoming an unknown thrall.

Otherwise, the unknown's features and mannerisms change to match the creature known to its victim, granting it a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate this creature. Unlike hallucinatory camouflage, this ability works against the target of victimize. This is a mind-affecting illusion (glamer) effect.",

An unknown gains an insight bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus. It can travel as if by dimension door as a move action at will, but only to enter or leave an area within line of sight of the target of its victimize ability.

			"While most of the Inner Sea's vampires lust for living blood, the mysterious vetalas hunger for a more intangible force: the energy that infuses mortal minds. Referred to as consciousness or psyche by some, the academics of Vudra-from where most vetalas hail-call this fundamental vital force prana. Regardless of their desire's name, vetalas prey upon those who show creative promise, possess potent force of will, or seem destined for greatness, draining the most brilliant sources of mortal light to fuel their own unnatural embers. Their dark mastery of life force allows vetalas to possess corpses or even overwhelm the minds of living creatures. With these stolen masks and the resources of abducted lives, they work their foul wills.",
			"",
			"Vetalas are said to be the spirits of children \"born evil,\" who never received burial rites upon their deaths. Sometimes one of these evil spirits takes hold of a corpse-not necessarily its own-which becomes its anchor to the mortal world. Such young souls seek out experiences and life energy, becoming as wicked as any other vampire as they endlessly indulge their profane, deathless desires.",
			"",
			"\"Vetala\" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vetalas were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vetala uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here.",
			"",
			"**CR:** Same as the base creature + 2.",
			"",
			"**AL:** Any evil.",
			"",
			"**Type:** The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves.",
			"",
			"**Senses:** A vetala gains darkvision 60 ft.",
			"",
			"**Armor Class:** Natural armor improves by +4.",
			"",
			"**Hit Dice:** Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vetalas use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution).",
			"",
			"**Defensive Abilities:** A vetala gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and good, and resistance to fire 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vetala also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vetala is helpless and its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour. Additional damage dealt to the vetala has no effect. Its body might be subjected to any method of dismemberment or desecration, but after 1 hour-regardless of the state of its remains-it regains 1 hit point, is no longer helpless, and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.",
			"",
			"**Weaknesses:** Vetalas cannot tolerate the sound of prayers or religious mantras recited by those truly faithful to a good deity. Any character with a good-aligned deity can force a vetala to recoil by dramatically praying as a standard action. Praying doesn't harm a vetala; it merely keeps the creature at bay. A recoiling vetala must stay at least 5 feet away from a praying character and cannot touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a vetala can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. The prayers of those who worship non-good deities or worship no deity have no effect on a vetala.",
			"",
			"Reducing a vetala's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, consecrating the vetala's remains and burying the body destroys it forever. A vetala's body is considered consecrated if it is doused with a vial of holy water and buried, if it is buried in earth affected by the spell consecrate, or if bless, prayer, or a similar divine spell is cast upon it as it is being buried. Digging up a vetala's corpse or profaning the area where it's buried does not restore a buried vetala.",
			"",
			"**Speed:** Same as the base creature. A vetala also gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed.",
			"",
			"**Melee:** A vetala gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. A vetala's claw attacks do damage as a creature once size category larger (for example, a Medium vetala's claw attack deals 1d6 points of damage). A vetala's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Special Attacks:** A vetala gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the vetala's Hit Dice + the vetala's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.",
			"",
			"**Drain Prana (Su):** A vetala can drain the mental vitality of a grappled opponent. If the vetala establishes or maintains a pin, it drains this energy, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Additionally, the victim is affected by the spell modify memory, as if the vetala had spent 5 minutes concentrating. The vetala gains perfect knowledge of any memory it chooses to eliminate using this ability. Vetalas often use this ability to prevent victims from remembering they've been attacked.",
			"",
			"**Malevolence (Su):** As a full-round action, a vetala can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature's body, as the spell magic jar (caster level 10th or the vetala's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vetala's possession for 24 hours. If a creature fails its save, its consciousness and control of its body are subsumed as the vetala takes command of its body. The vetala can remain in control for a number of hours equal to its Charisma modifier or until it decides to end the possession. Whenever the possession ends or the host body is killed, the vetala's consciousness instantly returns to its body, regardless of distance, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the vetala's body has been destroyed or moved to another plane, the vetala's consciousness is destroyed when the possession ends. While possessing another creature, the vetala's body is empty and vulnerable, though it is instantly aware if its body is disturbed or takes damage.",
			"",
			"**Paralysis (Ex):** Any creature struck by a vetala's claws must make a successful Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to this effect.",
			"",
			"**Possess Corpse (Su):** As a full-round action, a vetala can possess a Large or smaller corpse just as it can a living body. The vetala's consciousness leaves its body and takes control of the corpse, animating it as either a skeleton or zombie (depending on its state of decay). The vetala can remain in control of a corpse indefinitely, and can communicate through the body, but cannot use any of its other special abilities. This ability otherwise functions just as malevolence.",
			"",
			"**Ability Scores:** Str +4, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +2, Cha +6. As an undead creature, a vetala has no Constitution score.",
			"",
			"**Feats:** Vetalas gain Alertness, Blind-Fight, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, and Skill Focus (Disguise) as bonus feats.",
			"",
			"**Skills:** Vetalas gain a +8 racial bonus on Disguise, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks."
