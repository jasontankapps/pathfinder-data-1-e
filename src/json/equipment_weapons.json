When you use a barbed spear to attack a creature that is prone, flying above you, or at least one size category larger than you, you can make a melee attack with a -4 penalty to jam the barbed head into the target's foot. If you're successful, the target takes 1 point of damage and the barbed head breaks off in the target's foot. The barb then acts as a caltrop, wounding the creature's foot and halving its speed. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing. Like caltrops, barbed spears may not work against unusual opponents. A barbed spear that embeds its caltrop-like head into a target's foot gains the broken condition, and can't be used as a weapon until it's repaired.",

It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a -4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon.

				"**Dragon's Breath Cartridge:** (Source [Ultimate Equipment pg. 41](source:ultimate_equipment)) This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.",
