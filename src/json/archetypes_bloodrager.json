These spells can be used only to summon types of monsters with strong ties to the ancestral harbinger's family history, ranging from clan totems to monsters of the same type as those famously killed by her forebears. For each of these spells, the ancestral harbinger selects a number of monsters she can summon equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to represent these spirits. These monsters are selected from the options on the summon monster creature list or the expanded summoning list (see the [summoning project](unknown/summoning_project)) that are appropriate for the spell level.
