Like the user of a rod of rulership, the ring's wearer can command the fealty of creatures, but only if she is a member by blood of the family whose symbol is displayed on the ring and only if those creatures are citizens or vassals of the family's holdings (though it works on disaffected, disloyal, and even traitorous subjects). On command, the wearer can use the ring to target a single humanoid creature within 50 feet that meets those qualifications. This effect is automatically successful if the creature has an Intelligence of 9 or lower. A creature with a higher Intelligence must succeed a DC 14 Will save or obey the ring's wearer's commands as if she were its absolute sovereign; a successful save renders that creature immune to that ring's effects for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect and counts as 3rd-level spell for the purpose of break enchantment. If the ring's wielder gives a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature, that creature receives another saving throw to shake off the effect. Even if the ruled creature fails the saving throw and remains ruled, it can still refuse that particular command. The GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes a command that is contrary to the nature of a ruled creature, and for most creatures, if the ring's wearer coopts their every moment, the creature can attempt a save every day.",

However, once per day as an immediate action, the ring's wearer can negate the damage of an incoming acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy effect for himself (but not for other creatures affected by the spell or effect), transforming that damage into a shroud of energy that wreathes the wearer's body acting as if under the effects of the elemental aura spell. The elemental aura effect has the same energy type of the damage negated.",

The wearer of this cursed ring is rendered unable to tell a deliberate lie, in either speech or writing. The wearer may simply omit the truth or choose not to communicate, but even then must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw to avoid answering a direct question truthfully. The wearer cannot remove the ring unless the magic of the curse is negated.",
