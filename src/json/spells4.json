A creature that enters the spell's area or ends its turn there automatically takes 2d6 points of piercing damage."

			"This spell functions as interposing hand, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The forceful hand gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its CMB for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its Strength score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. Forceful hand prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the forceful hand and the target closer to you. The forceful hand can instead be directed to interpose itself, as interposing hand does."

The force of the blow may be enough to knock the target backward as well. To determine if the target is pushed back, make a combat maneuver check with a bonus equal to your caster level to resolve a bull rush attempt against the creature struck. You do not move as a result of this free bull rush, but it can push the target back if it defeats the target's CMD. A successful Fortitude save halves the force damage and negates the bull rush effect."

A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the falling damage, and the creature is moved to the closest square adjacent to the geyser (Large-sized or larger creatures are moved enough so that they are not on top of the geyser but still adjacent to it).

The intangible item merges with the target's flesh and is contained within the target's body, moving with the target wherever it goes.
