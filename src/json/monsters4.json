			"**Burble (Su)** A jabberwock can burble once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. This blast of strange noises and shouted nonsense in the various languages known to the jabberwock (and invariably some languages it doesn't know) affects all creatures within a 60-foot-radius spread-these creatures must make a DC 31 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. Alternatively, the jabberwock can focus its burble attack to create a 60-foot line of sonic energy that deals 20d6 points of sonic damage (DC 31 Reflex save for half). The confusion effect is mind-affecting; both are sonic effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Damage Reduction (Ex)** A jabberwock's damage reduction can be bypassed only by weapons that possess the vorpal weapon enhancement.",
			"",
			"**Eye Rays (Su)** The jabberwock can project beams of fire from its eyes as a ranged touch attack as a standard action, with a range increment of 60 feet. It projects two beams, and can target different creatures with these beams if it wishes as long as both targets are within 30 feet of each other. A creature that takes damage from an eye beam suffers burn.",
			"",
			"**Fear of Vorpal Weapons (Ex)** A jabberwock knows that a vorpal weapon can kill it swiftly. As soon as it takes damage from a vorpal weapon, a jabberwock becomes shaken for 1 round. If it is hit by a critical threat from a vorpal weapon, whether or not the critical hit is confirmed, the jabberwock is staggered for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Planar Acclimation (Ex)** A jabberwock is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.",
			"",
			"**Whiffling (Ex)** A jabberwock's wings and violent motions create a significant amount of wind whenever it makes a full attack action. These winds surround the monster to a radius of 30 feet, and are treated as severe winds-ranged attacks take a -4 penalty when targeting a jabberwock while it is whiffling, and Medium creatures must make a DC 10 Strength check to approach the creature. Small or smaller creatures in this area that fail a DC 15 Strength check are blown away. See page the wind effects table for further details on the effects of severe winds.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The jabberwock is a true creature of legend-a subject of poetry, song, and myth in many cultures. It is known to be a devastating creature in combat whose arrival presages times of ruin and violence; these stories also tell of the creature's fear of the tools some say were created in ancient times for the sole purpose of defeating them-vorpal weapons. A jabberwock is 35 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The jabberwock is not a creature of the Material Plane, but one from the primal world of the fey. It comes from a region of reality where life is more robust, where emotions are more potent, and where dreams and nightmares can come alive. Even in such incredible realms, though, the jabberwock is a creature to be feared. It belongs to a category of powerful creatures whose shapes and types run the gamut of possibility-a group known collectively as the \"Tane.\" Of the Tane, the jabberwock is said to be the most powerful, but the others in this grouping are far from helpless. Said to have been created as goliaths of war and madness, dreamt and stitched into being by the strange gods of this primeval reality, the Tane are as mysterious as they are powerful. Two other creatures of the Tane are presented in this book-the sard and the thrasfyr. None of the Tane are lower than CR 16 in power and all possess the planar acclimation special quality, but beyond that, they generally share no specific abilities or characteristics save for their common source in the primal world.",
			"",
			"When a jabberwock comes to the Material Plane, it does so to spread destruction and ruin. Typically, the monster seeks out a remote forest lair at least a day's flight from civilization, then emerges from this den once a week to seek out a new place to destroy. It has no true interest in amassing treasure, but often gathers objects of obvious value to bring back to its den in order to encourage heroes to seek it out-to a jabberwock, it makes no difference whether it seeks out things to destroy or lets those things come to it.",
			"",
			"Jabberwocks age, eat, drink, and sleep like any living creature, but they do not reproduce in the classic sense of the word. The creation of a new jabberwock-or of any of the Tane, in fact-is regulated by the strange and unknowable godlike entities that dwell in the primeval world. These fey lords create new jabberwocks as they are needed-sometimes varying the exact particulars (see Variant Jabberwocks, below), but always creating a fully formed adult creature. No young jabberwock has ever been encountered as a result.",
			"",
			"The strange vulnerability a jabberwock possesses against vorpal weapons has long been a matter of intrigue and speculation among scholars. Most believe that, once upon a time, only one jabberwock existed, a creature of such great power that nothing could hurt it. Nothing, that is, save for a legendary sword forged for a mortal hero by a now-forgotten artisan or god. So epic was this battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of the vorpal swords and jabberwocks known today, can be found on many worlds.",
			"",
			"### Variant Jabberwocks",
			"",
			"The notion of a \"lesser\" jabberwock is something of a misnomer, for even these creatures are powerful foes. A lesser jabberwock is generally a CR 20 version of the typical jabberwock-you can achieve a creature of this power by lowering the typical jabberwock's Hit Dice by 3 and by reducing its ability scores by 4 points each. Alternatively, you can apply the young creature simple template, but bear in mind that such a monster isn't technically any younger than a typical jabberwock.",
			"",
			"As creatures from the primal world of the fey, some jabberwocks are as varied as the strange terrains and realms in that primal world, as if these environs have more to do with their manifestation than most scholars suspect. Generally, these changes simply alter the type of damage a jabberwock's eye beams deal and the types of energy it is immune to. A jabberwock from a primeval glacial world would possess eye beams that deal cold damage, while a jabberwock from a storm-lashed world would deal electricity damage with its eye beams. If the nature of a jabberwock's eye beams change, its burn ability changes to match, and it replaces its immunity to fire with immunity to the new energy type (while gaining resist fire 30 in place of the lost immunity to fire)."

			"",
			"Jackals are usually encountered alone or as a mated pair, but sometimes they associate for a time with a small pack composed of two parents and their adult offspring, with the offspring serving a deferential support role to their parents. Although considered craven and foul by humans, jackals are relatively friendly and gentle with members of their own small packs.",
			"",
			"Attracted to the edges of human settlements in their territory, jackals often make opportunistic raids on fruit crops and vulnerable domesticated animals. They're also attracted to large deposits of garbage that they can sift through for leftover food. Jackals are remarkably adaptable, and readily forage for insects or fruit, feed on found carcasses, or hunt small or vulnerable game as the opportunity presents itself.",
			"",
			"Jackals are notorious for their craftiness in evading pursuit, and they've been known to feign death when caught in order to lull opponents into complacency and gain another chance to escape. A jackal can attempt a Bluff check opposed by its opponent's Sense Motive check to play dead. If successful, after combat ends, the jackal can begin a new encounter with surprise. During the surprise round, only the jackal and any opponents who succeeded on their Sense Motive checks can act."

While a bathysphere jellyfish is piloting a creature, any attack or effect that deals damage to the host also deals 1 point of damage to the jellyfish. A creature can attempt to attack only the jellyfish, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Removing the jellyfish is a full-round action that requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. Killing or removing the jellyfish frees the host from its control.",

These jellyfish can be dangerous to individuals who fall unconscious while using these creatures to breathe underwater. The jellyfish instinctively strive to protect their hosts, but horror stories of travelers trapped by the creatures can make an adventurer think twice before allowing the vermin on his head. A bathysphere jellyfish is 1 foot long and weighs 5 pounds."

When conditions are right, jellyfish shift from being a nuisance to being a menace, if accidentally so, for a jellyfish swarm, unlike more aggressive monstrous kin like the giant jellyfish, comprises not aggressive hunters but rather opportunistic strikers. They do not generally move to attack nearby prey, but their nearly translucent coloration makes it horrifically easy for a creature to swim into a swarm unawares. Once a jellyfish swarm deals damage to a creature, the swarm pursues it for several rounds before giving up the chase. Many aquatic races use jellyfish swarms as defensive guardians, trusting a swarm's lack of interest in moving to keep it stationary for long periods of time."

They have been known to hold dangerous artifacts in their vaults on behalf of desperate visitors, though in the case of holy or unholy artifacts, the jyoti are more likely to destroy the artifacts as soon as possible.",

They never discuss the sceaduinar, and even hearing that name inflames jyoti into immediate anger. Those who dare argue on the sceaduinar's behalf are immediately attacked."

			"**Hidden Feeding (Ex)** When a kaicharek hits with its bite attack against a target of its size or larger that is unaware of its presence, it latches onto its target and automatically grapples. The kaicharek loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (reducing its AC to 15), but it holds on with great tenacity and automatically inflicts its blood drain each round. A kaicharek has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached kaicharek can still be attacked. The grappled creature remains unaware of the kaicharek as if under the effects of the kaicharek's [hidden presence](spell/hidden_presence) spell-like ability, but it can attempt a DC 15 Will save to notice the signs of the kaicharek's feeding. The grappled creature gains a cumulative +1 bonus on its Will save for every round the kaicharek remains attached. Other creatures can notice the kaicharek by succeeding at a DC 15 Perception check. The DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Impaling Thrust (Ex)** A kaicharek can engage specific muscles in its body to violently thrust its bladed tentacles out at foes as a swift action. For the following round, the kaicharek increases the reach of its tentacle attacks to 10 feet. This act misaligns the musculature of its tentacles and the kaicharek thereafter loses the use of its tentacle attacks until it spends a move action to retract them.",
			"",
			"**Slashing Talons (Ex)** The tips of a kaicharek's tentacles are covered in serrated bone blades, causing them to deal slashing damage and bleed damage instead of bludgeoning damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"With slashing tentacles and a blood-hungry maw, kaichareks lie in wait for the foolish entering [Achaekek's](unknown/achaekek's) realm, ambushing and exsanguinating the weak and grabbing a quick meal from the strong. This latter feature has earned kaichareks the name \"parasites of Achaekek.\" Though hardly the strongest creatures associated with the Mantis God, kaichareks are vicious yet cowardly creatures that seem to live for the anguish and bloodshed they unleash on the world around them.",
			"",
			"A typical kaicharek is 5 feet long and weighs 270 pounds.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks seem to live only to hunt, digesting only some of the blood and gore they consume from prey and storing the rest in their thick bodies to be digested later during lean times. This seeming lack of reliance on consumption has led some planar scholars to theorize that kaichareks derive sustenance from some other source, possibly the psychic trauma their attacks cause.",
			"",
			"When hunting, the kaicharek uses two different methods depending on the size of its prey. Against prey the same size as the kaicharek or smaller, the creature strikes from hiding or by using its magical ability to hide its presence from others. It lashes out with its razor-tipped tentacles and bites, attempting to grapple its prey. When it gets ahold of a victim, it devours it as messily as possible, thrashing about violently and reveling in its bloody meal.",
			"",
			"The second method of hunting is reserved for much larger prey that a kaicharek believes is alone. The kaicharek still attacks from hiding, but instead of merely biting its prey, it activates a more focused version of its magical abilities, hiding itself from its prey's awareness and hanging on as a leech or other similar parasite. This feeding continues until its prey collapses, exsanguinated, or it discovers the kaicharek. The latter usually occurs when the parasite spills the excess blood onto the nearby ground, which not even the kaicharek's magical stealth can hide.",
			"",
			"If either of these methods fail, or their prey proves more formidable than anticipated, the kaicharek immediately flees, burrowing underground if possible. The cowardly creature rarely stays away for long, however, seeking to finish off weakened prey or exact bloody revenge for its humiliation.",
			"",
			"One of the more vicious abilities associated with these predators is their ability to overextend their tentacles to attack from a greater range-a feat accomplished by a combination of muscle spasms, fluidic action, and tearing of the internal ligaments holding the tentacle together. After overextending its tentacles, a kaicharek must spend a few seconds retracting the tentacles back and activating a focused, specialized healing ability to repair the internal damage. A kaicharek can even regrow a severed tentacle, although this process takes several hours.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks are an autogamous species and self-fertilize, laying their eggs in pools of blood left behind by their own attacks or in bloody remnants left by larger predators. When blood is plentiful, a single kaicharek can produce dozens of offspring in a few months.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The parasites of Achaekek can be found anywhere in the Blood Vale, Achaekek's realm in the tunnels beneath Pharasma's Boneyard, and their preferred hunting grounds always have plenty of soft soil and hiding places in which to stalk and ambush prey. Kaichareks sometimes wander into the Boneyard, though these expeditions rarely last long, as patrols of [vanth](monster/vanth) and [esobok](monster/esobok) psychopomps slay kaichareks on sight. Other kaichareks make their way to the Material Plane, either through thinned planar boundaries or by way of mortal conjurers.",
			"",
			"Normally solitary hunters, kaichareks only rarely associate with others of their own kind, often treating each other as prey. However, during lean times, the blood-hungry beasts band together, ambushing larger groups, overlapping their magical stealth to confuse prey, or even overwhelming a single massive target in hopes of bringing it down. Exactly how kaichareks communicate is difficult to determine, but they seem to use gestures and traced messages written in blood. Regardless, such alliances last only until food becomes more plentiful or the kaichareks become hungry enough to turn against one another.",
			"",
			"Kaichareks do not realize it, but they are at the core of a split among Achaekek's worshippers. As kaichareks are known to infest Achaekek's realm, some worshippers of the Mantis God summon them in a misguided attempt to gain favor with the indifferent Achaekek. The cult of the Red Mantis, on the other hand, holds a particular disdain for kaichareks. They view the parasites as utterly lacking in strategy or resourcefulness, despite their intelligence. Worse, most kaichareks' tendencies to indiscriminately parasitize stronger creatures violates the cult's philosophy of holding leaders or rulers in high regard. The fact that kaichareks don't recognize this hierarchy marks them as worse than beasts in the cult's eyes.",
			"",
			"The exact relationship between Achaekek and these parasites is unknown. It seems unlikely that the creatures are creations of the Mantis God, as creating entirely new races is uncharacteristic of the bloodthirsty deity. One theory holds that Achaekek discovered kaichareks on some Material Plane world, took a liking to them, and transported some of their race back to his domain. For their part, kaichareks look upon their deific patron with a mixture of fear and awe, viewing him as an apex predator that they know can snatch them up as morsels. Some kaichareks dare to feed upon Achaekek directly, and those that aren't immediately destroyed for this hubris gain quasi-divine powers, setting them above their brute kin."

			"**Flesh Mansion (Ex)** A kakuen-taka's bhoga swarm normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and war machine. When the swarm wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat block (unlike a normal swarm, the flesh mansion's slam attacks have reach and threaten squares within its reach). As a standard action, the swarm can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining cover against all opponents but still being able to use its swarm attack), or stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed, the swarm can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate creature, nor is it undead; it is merely a corpse the swarm manipulates. Without a flesh mansion, the bhoga swarm's statistics are CE Diminutive outsider (chaotic, evil, extraplanar, swarm); AC 22, touch 21, flat-footed 15; Defensive Abilities swarm traits; Melee swarm (5d6 plus dimensional snare and distraction); Reach 0 ft.; Str 1; CMB -; CMD - (can't be tripped); Stealth +32.",
			"",
			"**Fleshy Shield (Ex)** A newly created flesh mansion has 150 hit points. The swarm takes only half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a swarm of Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the swarm. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the swarm functions like a normal swarm (see Flesh Mansion above). A kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a full-round action grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 hit points for a Small corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In the far northern lands bordering on the Worldwound, a strange and terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairie-shambling fleshy abominations called kakuentaka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds, a living manifestation of the Worldwound's taint whose horrific onset is presaged by a sour-sweet wind and wheeling, screaming flocks of undead birds. The lucky victims of the birds' blinding poison are spared the sight of the rumbling juggernauts of putrefying meat driven like siege engines by a swarm of fiends called bhogas. Individually these fiends have little wit or skill, but together they have a malign intellect that allows them to construct mobile nests out of dead flesh like morbid termites building a mound.",
			"",
			"The bhogas find a giant, mammoth, or other creature of great size and devour its organs, usually while the creature is still alive and trying to resist. Once the creature is dying or dead, the fiends reconfigure the corpse's remaining flesh and bone into a hideous, multilegged pillar, which they then invade and inhabit like a hollow tree. Some of the bhogas use their collective strength to move the fleshy mansion's limbs while the rest clamber about its walls or skulk underneath it, searching for new prey to terrorize and consume. This monstrosity attracts birds the fiends animate as flesh-craving undead swarms. Together, the three components of this peculiar ecology stalk the demontainted lands. If a healthy swarm discovers another suitable corpse, the fiends engage in a frenzy of mating, build a second flesh mansion, split into two swarms, then rapidly give birth to fill all the available space in their new home.",
			"",
			"When a flesh mansion becomes so rotted that it cannot maintain its structure or the swarm cannot easily move it, the bhogas abandon their creation and seek out another, leaving behind a monstrous, decaying shell, unrecognizable as the living creature it once was. Necromancers can use the husk for parts or animate the entire thing as a new abomination. Desperate ghouls, zombies, or animals might feed on it and become tainted by its latent Abyssal energies.",
			"",
			"As much a plague upon demons as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from any that might interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful demon might enslave one with magic and use the swarm's dimensional snare ability to capture and kill its rivals. Driven out of the central part of the Worldwound by more intelligent and organized demons, kakuen-taka have become a recurring plague in the southern fringes of the territory, below Storasta and abutting the borders with Numeria and Ustalav. In these lonely moors and hills, kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements. None of the adjacent countries values the empty lands highly enough to risk major resources to stamp them out.",
			"",
			"Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food, several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but over time they usually wander apart, following their separate carrionstorms, and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades."

Instead, at any time in the next 2 weeks, the kamaitachi can cause the damage, bleed, and pain effects to instantly manifest as a free action. It can activate as many delayed doom effects on a single target as it wishes with the same free action, potentially cutting a victim who seemed unharmed into ribbons. The victim must remain within 1 mile of the kamaitachi between the time it incurs the damage and its manifestation-a victim who moves beyond this limit causes the delayed doom effect to immediately end without harm. Most kamaitachi try to keep track of their delayed doom victims via status.",
			"",
			"**Dust Devil (Su)** A kamaitachi's trusty dust devil deflects arrows, bolts, bullets, and other small projectiles automatically and thrown weapons 30% of the time (like a personal wind wall effect). The dust devil also grants the kamaitachi a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus (+6 for the typical kamaitachi). Whenever a kamaitachi is caught within the area of effect of a spell or supernatural effect that alters or controls winds (including control weather and control winds), it must succeed at a Fortitude save to avoid losing control of its dust devil. The save DC is equal to the spell's save DC, or DC 20 if the effect isn't a spell or spell-like ability. If the kamaitachi loses control of its dust devil, it immediately loses its fly speed. It also loses the benefits of its dust devil ability and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + double the spell level) in order to use any of its spell-like abilities. A kamaitachi can reactivate its dust devil by casting control winds (but not wind wall); as such, a kamaitachi is hesitant to use its last control winds spell in a day in case it needs it to regain its dust devil.",
			"",
			"**Pain (Ex)** A creature damaged by a kamaitachi's claw attack becomes sickened for 1 round (Fortitude DC 23 negates). This is a pain effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Kamaitachis revel in causing pain. A kamaitachi might, for example, hold someone hostage with its delayed doom ability and force that person (or one of the victim's loved ones) to commit horrible or demeaning acts in exchange for the hostage's life. Of course, depending on its fickle mood, the kamaitachi is just as likely to kill a hostage who meets its demands."

Helping travelers in this way makes a dosojin's ward sturdier and more straightforward, allowing creatures to reach their destination in half the time they would normally take (though this does not grant a bonus to creatures' movement speeds in combat). If a dosojin instead chooses to hinder travelers, it creates unexpected twists and turns within its ward, turning the path into difficult terrain and so causing travelers to take twice as long as they normally would to reach their destination. These effects last as long as the targets stay within the boundaries of the dosojin's ward.",

			"Dosojins are kami that take the form of stone icons and watch over roads and trails. They are often found in statue form at the edges of villages, along mountain passes, at the beginnings of tunnels and other major works of roadway construction, or at simple country crossroads. In urban areas, dosojins can sometimes be found on street corners and near bridges. They serve as the guardians of travelers, keeping the malicious and malevolent off the paths they diligently watch over. Wise travelers know to seek a dosojin's blessing before traveling upon its ward, for falling out of favor with the kami of travel is a sure way to become lost or hampered. Pious mortal couples also seek out dosojin for their own reasons, as the kami are often regarded as patrons of fertility, and are known for their habit of choosing mates and standing beside one another for their entire lives. In many regions, the blessing of a dosojin is believed to ensure a long and happy marriage, as well as many healthy children.",
			"",
			"The average dosojin stands about 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"As creatures that symbolize travel and connections, dosojins straddle the line between the lands of the civilized and the wild, often with one foot literally in each. Dosojins spend most of their time guarding their chosen sites in the form of nondescript statues and way markers, meditating motionlessly for seasons at a time. While semi-social dosojins within cities and other settlements are not uncommon, the majority of these kami stand along remote and secluded roads, going to great lengths to ensure that their true identity is not known. It is not uncommon for dosojins to create false duplicates of themselves using their stone shape ability, and these misleading markers inspire a certain amount of faith among those who look out for the kami of roads, as one can rarely tell if a sculpture is a dosojin by looks alone. A dosojin requires no sustenance, but it is not uncommon for travelers to leave offerings for a silent watcher, usually tributes of fruits, nuts, and potables, gifts that the kami gladly shares with hungry travelers, happy to inspire such good faith among passersby and to foster a system of give-and-take between strangers.",
			"",
			"Dosojins are fond of the creatures that traverse their roads and trails, and maintain the roadways they guard to ensure both the ward's survival and the safe travel of the voyagers that traverse it. Though they have an affinity for the creatures that constructed their roadways, dosojins still protect their wards with the aggressive righteousness typical of all kami, and scarcely hesitate when faced with an oni or other evildoer seeking to disrupt the balance. Dosojin have little patience for those who litter on their roadways or unnecessarily obstruct the paths, and they take it upon themselves to discipline those they deem worthy of punishment. Rarely violent in an overt sense, dosojins prefer to use their magic in order to trick travelers into becoming lost, letting the wilds they travel through become the primary instruments of their demise. Dosojins prove quite deadly to those who fail to show kami proper respect, as they use their powers of illusion to lead troublesome caravans into impassible ravines and destructive oni onto unsound, derelict bridges.",

			"Dosojins are odd among kami in that they are known to select mates from among their own kind, and it is not uncommon to see two seemingly redundant statues standing next to one another near a trailhead or fork in the road. While they do not reproduce in any typical sense of the word, dosojins are nonetheless sought out by mortal couples hoping to conceive, as many people see the kami as symbols of fertility. However, most scholars agree that dosojins do not collaborate in this way to foster fecundity, but rather act as symbols of camaraderie and companionship for travelers on their roads, encouraging teamwork and cooperation among groups of diverse individuals with a shared goal.",
			"",
			"While most dosojins are content to watch over particular highways or roads for their entire existences and act as helpful guardians for most passersby, some choose instead to act as appraisers of travelers' skills and bravery. Cunning individuals that indulge in acts of trickery more often than their tamer brethren, these rogue dosojins craft obstacles and trials for travelers they deem worthy of the challenge. The tests are not meant to substantially impede voyagers, and are simply forms of innocent fun that a dosojin uses to gauge the strength and resolve of various wayfarers. Those who surpass a dosojin's challenges (which usually take the form of puzzles or illusions) earn the kami's respect and the assurance of safe travel throughout the rest of its domain, while those who avoid the obstacle or overcome it through brutish and witless means garner only scorn. Careful travelers know to watch out for the statuelike kami when making their way along potentially protected roads, as the guardians expect voyagers to act honorably and respectfully while travelling upon their paths. Some of the most important mandates to keep in mind when interacting with dosojin and walking through their territories are as follows.",

			"Spiritual guardians of ornamental shrubs and miniature trees, fukujin are highly regarded among Tians as bringers of good fortune and sound wisdom. Fukujins are thought to only come to goodhearted and devoted bonsai gardeners, and since bonsai plants are often only cultivated by astute and aesthetically minded humanoids, the kami are usually of a similar nature, speaking to mortals rarely and always cryptically. Regardless of how much of their coveted knowledge they impart upon favored mortals, however, fukujins always bring with them a sense of hope and good luck, and almost all within close proximity of the kami feel an instant sense of relief.",
			"",
			"Fukujins resemble humanoids with tree branches protruding from their bodies, most often their heads, and some fukujins possess leafy hair or treelike limbs. A fukujin in its physical form is only as tall as its bonsai ward-usually only a foot or two-and weighs less than 30 pounds.",
			"",
			"While many see the art of bonsai gardening as humanoids' attempts at controlling or forming nature, fukujins reflect the practice's virtues of patience and nurturing. Fukujins maintain that a moment of patience and study can reveal multitudes more than years of trial and error, and the diminutive beings spread this knowledge wherever they go. While kami do not reproduce in any typical sense, fukujins are known to sow seeds of bonsai plants in the wake of their footsteps, further delighting communities that appreciate such flora. Though assignment of kami remains up to the mysterious will of the gods, fukujins do their part in creating numerous hosts for these spirits.",
			"",
			"The health and strength of the tree branch protruding from a fukujin's head is often said to be a good indicator of the skill of the warded bonsai tree's caretaker. While the aesthetic values of bonsai trees are often completely subjective, the kami spirits are evidence that there is perhaps a series of core doctrines bonsai farmers should adhere to when taking care of their plants-ideals that a gardener can strive toward to ensure he achieves success in his maintenance of the small tree. A poorly trimmed bonsai plant may sicken the spirit for a time, for instance, while expert grafting can result in a strong or knowledgeable kami. In most cases, however, a kami will almost always leave its ward if a bonsai gardener neglects the plant long enough or effectively ruins the effort, for though fukujins are patient, they have little tolerance for the virtues of negligence and wastefulness.",
			"",
			"While nearly all fukujins are calm, collected, and patient spirits, the beings are by no means all the same, as their physical appearances, predispositions, and demeanors are just as often reflections of the particular bonsai plant that they watch over. Fukujins who reside within the hearts of deciduous trees, for example, tend to be of lighter color as well as more airy and spirited than the hardy and resilient fukujins of coniferous shrubs, who take on a red, earthy hue. Plant type can also hint at particular magical qualities the spirit might have-white-trunked trees tend to attract gaunter, more fatalistic individuals, while plants with brown or ebon bark inspire kami that are more attuned to the energies and mysteries of magic. The tree branch that sticks out of a fukujin's head while the spirit is in its physical form is often of the same variety as the bonsai tree that the kami protects, though exceptions have been known to exist among particularly dual-natured spirits.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Kami(monster/family:kami)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Since their wards are by nature the direct result of humanoid intervention, fukujins are naturally social creatures, and most seek to assist their humanoid partners in not only cultivating beautiful plants, but in all spheres of life. Many bonsai gardeners are often content to live in a permanent home, establish a family, and live a life of tranquility, and fukujins happily provide all manner of advice regarding these domestic issues. In other instances, however, fukujins have been known to travel alongside particularly adventurous cultivators, humanoids who keep the shrubbery and kami spirit in safe and comfortable packs or pouches and consult them for wisdom in circumstances both dire and unusual. The miniature kami's insights and good luck prove as useful in the heat of battle as in the hearthstone, and so humanoids from nearly all walks of life seek the favor of these beings.",
			"",
			"Bonsai trees are delicate plants and their kami reflect this fragility. What they lack in physical defenses, however, fukujins make up for in grace and keen insight, using their natural acumen to avoid and deter hazards before they're even encountered. Some might mistakenly see this expert passiveness as a manifestation of fukujins' philanthropic ideals and good intentions, but more often than not their flightiness is simply what they deem to be the wisest course of action. In situations where violence is inevitable, fukujins seek the aid of stronger individuals to help protect them, true to the tradition of their wards' reliance on humanoid intervention and maintenance. Rather than view this reliance on humanoids as a weakness, however, most fukujins accept it as part of a long-lasting transaction between the two forces, each providing unique benefits to the other throughout the relationship. To bolster this partnership, fukujins harness healing powers as well as the strength of their insight, ensuring that their caretakers remain healthy and able to protect the kami and their wards.",
			"",
			"While they almost always possess pertinent and useful advice, fukujins are known for being reserved under most circumstances, sharing what knowledge they have only when it is absolutely necessary, and they never share wisdom superfluously. Fukujins are normally individualistic and solitary like the plants they watch over, and when they interact with one another they usually do so telepathically. What people often perceive as the luck of fukujins is often merely the result of wise advice garnered from the spirits, though when asked if the kami really are bringers of fortune, fukujins are known to remain even more tight-lipped than usual.",
			"",
			"Occasionally one might encounter a fukujin in the wild, in lands far from the societies and plants where they commonly make their homes. In such cases, these miniature kami often claim shrubs, young plants, and even whimiscal-looking mushrooms as their wards, grooming nearby groves and glades into quiet meditation gardens or into artistic shapes, inviting visitors to rest and reflect."

			"**Infused Quarterstaff (Su)** Any quarterstaff a jinushigami wields functions as a +5 quarterstaff (unless the quarterstaff already has a greater enhancement bonus). If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan quarterstaff out of the surrounding terrain as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Manipulate Terrain (Su)** A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward.",
			"",
			"**Ward (Su)** A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great influence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature.",
			"",
			"Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers.",
			"",
			"Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely.",
			"",
			"A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid affectations like hats or jewelry.",
			"",
			"### Elder Jinushigami",
			"",
			"Of all the kami, land kami are the most ancient and powerful, yet even among these immense outsiders there are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range's tallest mountain is even more so.",
			"",
			"When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit Dice-most are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami's ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional spell-like abilities to more closely reflect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples.",
			"",
			"Glacier Kami: An elder jinushigami associated with a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs along a polar coastline, appears as a humanoid made of blocks of ice. These kami have the cold subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gain immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire), and can use cone of cold and wall of ice as spell-like abilities three times per day each.",
			"",
			"Great Reef Kami: An elder jinushigami whose domain contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears as a humanoid constructed of living coral draped with seaweed. Great reef kami have the water subtype instead of the earth subtype, gain the aquatic subtype (and the amphibious special quality), gain a swim speed of 60 ft., and gain the ability to use tsunami once per day as a spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"Mountain Kami: When an elder jinushigami's ward includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the use of flesh to stone and wall of stone three times per day each.",
			"",
			"Volcano Kami: An elder jinushigami that includes in its ward an active volcano appears as a humanoid made of equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold), can use fireball three times per day as a spell-like ability, and can use wall of lava once per day as a spell-like ability.",

			"**Cacophonous Blow (Su)** Whenever a kaminari deals damage with a slam or trample attack, it also deals 11d6 points of sonic damage. In addition, a creature struck with this ability is rendered permanently deaf. A creature that makes a successful DC 27 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids the deafening effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Storm Ward (Su)** A kaminari treats a specific mass of transient storm clouds as its ward. This storm is about 1 mile in diameter, and a kaminari can observe the world from any point within its storm ward, whether merged with it or in its physical form. A kaminari can only control the movement of its ward to a minimal extent, willing it to remain in one place or move in a cardinal direction for up to 2d4 hours every day. After this time, the ward continues on its natural course for 24 hours, after which the kaminari may will it to remain stationary again. When a kaminari is in its physical form and within its ward or within 120 feet of its ward's boundaries, it gains the power to call down bolts of lightning. The kaminari can call up to a total of 15 bolts of lightning each day, each of which deals 5d10 points of electricity damage. This ability is otherwise identical to call lightning storm.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerable to Silence (Su)** A kaminari constantly surrounds itself with sound and music, and can't stand any form of silence. Whenever a kaminari is affected by a silence spell or effect or is rendered deaf by any means, it loses its cacophonous blow ability and its fast healing for the duration of the effect. But because a kaminari possesses incredible resilience to such effects, any silence or deafening effect lasts only 2d4 rounds or as long as the effect's duration states, whichever is shorter.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Kaminaris are robust spirits of enormous size that watch over the balance of weather, taking the form of violent storms wherever they go. More monstrous-looking and boisterous than most kami, kaminaris are often mistaken for oni upon first glance, their unpredictable natures furthering the confusion. Kaminaris care little for most mortals, primarily concerning themselves with the maintenance and protection of their wards' enormous storm clouds that represent the awesome power of thunder and lightning. In addition to their duties guarding their storm wards and the balance of weather, kaminaris are endlessly fascinated with musical instruments, particularly drums.",
			"",
			"Kaminaris have vibrant skin and equally colorful features; the specific hues vary from kaminari to kaminari. A kaminari stands roughly 25 feet tall and weighs about 10 tons.",
			"",
			"Though a kaminari commands the awe-inspiring powers of lightning and thunder as though they were simply extensions of itself, the kami of storms have limited power over their wards. As dictated by the obscure and convoluted Laws of Golden Perfection, a kaminari has only limited ability to will its ward to travel in any particular direction or halt its movement for a modest amount of time per day. Thus it is often merely a passenger upon the clouds of a storm. Though most storms collect and dissipate with some frequency, a kami-inhabited storm is more permanent than most weather patterns, and as long as both the kami and its ward are neither destroyed nor corrupted, the storm could exist for a potentially infinite amount of time.",
			"",
			"Kaminaris despise the use of magic to alter weather patterns, and attempts to disrupt their storm clouds often result in the enormous kami's unabashed and wrathful ire. A kaminari is as volatile as the storm it protects, and the powerful spirit is quick to exterminate any creature-mortal or otherwise-it deems a threat to the natural balance of weather. Whether an evil sorcerer is trying to bring devastation to a seaside town by calling forth powerful hurricanes or a benevolent wizard is summoning rain to save a desert city in the midst of a natural drought, if such manipulation comes to the attention of the watchful and wandering kaminaris, they find little forgiveness. This is not to suggest that the kami of storms are evil-their threshold for nuisances is simply lower than most kami, and their punishments more destructive.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Kami(monster/family:kami)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Floating thousands of feet above most civilizations, kaminaris are usually isolated from other creatures, and this suits the reclusive kami just fine. A kaminari does not interfere with the matters of mortals beyond the natural destruction caused by its storm clouds, and only aides such diminutive creatures when the task would be required of it because of some stricture of the Laws of Golden Perfection. Once a kaminari has fulfilled its required duty, it is only too happy to continue on its way, where it can remain uninterrupted as it creates its music and fills the air around it with thunder and lightning.",
			"",
			"A kaminari is as devoted to its ward as it is to the practice of music, and the intensity of the storm it sits upon usually corresponds to the amount of aggression with which it plays its instrument. While it rarely cares to interact with mortals, tending first and foremost to its ward, a kaminari may entertain the idea of interacting with a fellow virtuoso. Kaminaris thus have a great affection for bards who practice an instrument, and will occasionally interrupt their diligent guardianship of their storm if doing so allows them the opportunity to play with a skillful accompanist. Amateurs need not apply, as the immortal kaminaris are often among the best players of their instruments, commanding powers of music so stirring that even the most talented bard might have trouble keeping up.",
			"",
			"A kaminari goes to great lengths to surround itself with booming noise, and is rarely seen without its instrument of choice. While most kaminaris prefer to use drums and other percussion instruments to fill the air around them with sound, rare individuals also adhere to the use of keyboard, string, and wind instruments. The powers of these kaminaris do not greatly differ, but their choice of instrument is usually a fair indicator of their temperament as well as the kind of storm they travel upon-those who play keyboards are usually found amid desert-quenching storms that wander arid environments, bringing with them the power of tornadoes and dust storms; players of string instruments tend toward oceanic environs, residing within the hearts of devastating hurricanes of incredible magnitude far out at sea; and kaminaris who use wind instruments occupy blizzards, commanding the powers of the ice and snow that constantly whip about them."

			"Revered by druids and rangers for their attunement with the wilds, kodama, known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the forest-they do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas. (Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area.",
			"",
			"A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the singular \"presence\" any single tree might have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their race-take the path of the monk.",
			"",
			"Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel (ashamed, frightened, curious, amused, and nervous being the most common reactions), yet the end result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama, few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat distracted by the kami's attention.",
			"",
			"When a kodama must fight (typically in order to defend its tree or other kami), it moves quickly-kodama work best in groups, and when confronted alone generally use tree stride to travel to another part of the forest to raise a small host of allies to aid it in defending its home.",

In combat, a shikigami fights with whatever objects it finds at hand. Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than they should.",
			"",
			"Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other kami, but they are quick to leave an area they see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt the virtues of nature. When they do, they generally take their wards with them. They do not engage humanoids who desecrate the environment, but their absence leaves a profound mark on the morale of perceptive villagers. Should the shikigami leave, town officials who know the function of the miniature kami are quick to change policies in their community to reflect a more naturalistic approach, hoping to rekindle the relationship between shikigami and people, lest the community fall into the disfavor of more powerful and less passive kami.",

A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, an alignment of lawful neutral, and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a shikigami familiar. Whenever a shikigami becomes a familiar, it treats its master as its ward.",

For every 5 by which a creature fails its saving throw, it is pushed back an additional 5 feet. This effect also extinguishes any normal fires within the line of effect, as well as magical fires, which are dispelled as though by greater dispel magic. A suijin can choose to have its breath weapon deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage before using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Whitewater Barrier (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, a suijin can create a wall of turbulent water. A suijin can make this barrier however long it wishes, up to a maximum length of 180 feet, and the wall is 20 feet tall. A whitewater barrier acts as a sheet of stormy water, and any Large or smaller creature that attempts to pass through the barrier must succeed at a DC 26 Swim check or be rushed to the top of the wave and pushed back to the side it started on, taking fall damage as appropriate. It is possible to create cylindrical or square whitewater barriers to enclose specific points. This effect acts like wind wall in regard to how ranged missiles, breath weapons, gases, and creatures in gaseous form interact with it. The Swim DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as benevolent and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the flow of its waters' currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are fluid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the vicious oni.",
			"",
			"In its true form, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of water that are proportionate to the kami's size and power.",
			"",
			"A suijin's particular ward is usually a good indicator of its temperament. A suijin residing in a secluded and placid mountain lake is often more calm and forgiving of trespasses than one dwelling in the heart of a turbulent river, and though all suijins typically mean well, those with more tumultuous wards are generally less tolerant of intruders within their domains. For instance, a suijin protecting a natural whirlpool within a larger body of water may not help a passing boat of traders that happens to start sinking into its depths, viewing the ship as a disturbance to the forces of nature. Those suijins who are used to seeing their waterways casually abused by the forces of civilization-as almost all cities in some way impose upon or corrupt the rivers and streams that flow near them, and even farming communities may pollute with manure and runoff- can be much more hard-hearted.",
			"",
			"Suijins in isolated areas care far less about the mortal world than those who interact with it on a daily basis, so the attitude of a suijin dwelling within a mountain stream is often far different than that of one residing in a regularly visited pond. Travelers can earn the approval of a suijin by placing minerals or gemstones within its ward, and those who pollute the waters or use it for evil (such as by executing innocents via drowning) are quick to encounter a normally calm suijin's fearsome wrath. Unusual floods and droughts are both signs of a suijin's displeasure with a nearby development's effects on the surrounding waters, and wary villagers are careful to appease a suijin and change their destructive ways, lest they feel the full brunt of the powerful water kami's righteous wrath.",
			"",
			"Those suijins who continually fail to protect their waters from troublesome residents or visitors are often quick to fall out of favor with their kindred, and the wards of these kami often become treacherous during the time in which a corrupted suijin makes its gradual transition toward becoming an oni.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Kami(monster/family:kami)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A suijin can occupy virtually any body of water, whether it be a stream up to several dozen miles long or a lake no more than a single mile in diameter. A particularly social suijin might choose to occupy the aqueduct of an urban development if the inhabitants are especially conscious of their impact on the surrounding environs, and such settlements recognize and appreciate the blessing of the benevolent resident, as a suijin cleans and purifies the waters it inhabits.",
			"",
			"Suijins are solitary kami, and rarely go out of their way to band with others of their kind, preferring instead to protect isolated bodies of water. This form of aloofness isn't out of fear of or apathy for other kami; instead, suijins merely adhere to a loosely established territorial pact, knowing that their powers are more valuable when spread throughout regions, rather than concentrated on particular bodies of water. When suijins do interact with one another, they do so at points where two bodies of water meet, such as estuaries and deltas. If two connecting bodies of water are especially healthy and the suijins residing in them are entirely undisturbed by forces of corruption, it is said that the water kami celebrate nature in a sort of bonding ritual. The rare event can be seen as motes of blue and green light whirling in the shallows of the adjoining water, and scholars speculate that this event may symbolize the creation of a new suijin."

When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind.

The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at its first opportunity.",

			"A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid turtle. It dwells in fresh water, preferring a stream or river to a lake or pond. It has a small shell on its back, a blunt face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short claws. A typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can vary toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow basin in the top of its head, in which the creature carries water from its home at all times.",
			"",
			"Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those who pass near or swim in their home. Kappa pranks are usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking under robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an aquatic predator. A kappa might also challenge others to grappling matches, hoping potential foes underestimate its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be dangerous, attempting to drown mounts, animal companions, or even people who enter its home waters. The most degenerate kappas have been known to drown bathers and eat them.",
			"",
			"Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures have a few weaknesses. First of all, kappas love cucumbers and horseflesh. If plied with such treats, a kappa is likely to not bother intruders, and might even be convinced to offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks, it is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa confronted with a verbal rebuke rather than combat quickly and almost shamefully apologizes for its pranks, begging for forgiveness.",
			"",
			"If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains stationary and pleads for help, continuing to fight only if forced to. An opponent who refills the kappa's head bowl after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude. Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry flasks of water with them when they are forced to travel far from their home-most kappa don't think this far ahead."

The tools they use in their more humanoid appendages are always scavenged, usually from victims, and are discarded when broken or of no more immediate use. Pursuits such as crafting, learning, and diplomacy are a waste to them; they see these as the activities of food-creatures not strong enough to see the world as it is-a stage for domination, feeding, and spawning. Even when these brutes band together, it is usually to spawn or to face sources of food that are too strong for only one or two karkinoi alone.",

While karkinoi can walk on land, they do not enjoy long periods away from the sea, as they dry out, crack, and eventually suffocate. Coastal raids are part of the karkinoi breeding cycle. The corpses that they drag off into the ocean are tethered to masses of eggs, and serve as food for karkinoi spawn. The spawn develop a taste for land-meat and crave it, ensuring the next generation of hungry raiders.",

In return, the aboleths gain expendable, fastbreeding shock troops and guardians. Some scholars believe this race was actually created by aboleths in ancient times, but were later turned loose in the ocean because skum made more reliable slaves than karkinoi brutes."

They use their miniature spider form to watch their enemies or spy on their rivals' labs. They also keep to their inconspicuous spider forms to scout ahead when working with groups of cultists, though they quickly revert to their true forms if threatened. Karumzeks enjoy the opportunity to sample concoctions crafted by mortals, slurping and regurgitating drugs and poisons as if noisily sampling a flight of fine wines. Karumzeks have a crude and alien sense of humor, and enjoy making mortals feel uncomfortable or disgusted. They tell foul jokes while in the company of human cultists and put on unnerving performances, such as using vomit swarm and claiming the swarms of spiders are its own pre-sentient young.",

The kasthezvi's caster level for these effects is equal to its racial Hit Dice (CL 16th for most kasthezvis). If the kasthezvi is killed, stunned, or otherwise prevented from vocalizing while uttering its word of sundering, the word ends with no effect.

This suppressive magic has slowly deteriorated with each passing century, and as it has, kasthezvis have drawn strength from the ancient words contained within. They are now capable of issuing powerful, silent utterances that can level entire buildings. Given time, there is no telling the extent of their power.",

Most caulborn agree that the kasthezvis' bone crowns act as magical dampeners and allow the kasthezvis to speak powerful words without imploding, but no one has ever managed to acquire an intact crown for study.",
			"",
			"As the creations of ancient beings, kasthezvis cannot procreate. They frequently band together in small cabals and rarely feud with one another. Learning the process to create more kasthezvis may be their greatest desire, beyond harnessing the primordial power they contain.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",

			"Kasthezvis have complete contempt for all living things and show only the barest respect for those more powerful than themselves. Yet theirs is a patient, meticulous evil. Kasthezvis are extremely cautious when speaking words of sundering or making their clandestine trips to spy on the surface world, knowing that their power is greater if no one knows they exist. When kasthezvi visit the city above, they disguise themselves as mute beggars or pious, quiet Sweettalkers. Few notice that they make no sound, and those who discover these spies' unnatural silence typically vanish in fatal \"accidents\" beneath the city. The purpose of kasthezvis' espionage is unknown. Some caulborn speculate that the kasthezvis are preparing to collapse the entire city in a single, silent cataclysm; others believe they seek to refine the ancient words that give them power or to discover a process by which they can procreate among the fecund surface dwellers.",
			"",
			"Kaladurnae, Thassilon's first Runelord of Greed, had a tenuous arrangement with the kasthezvis. In exchange for knowledge of the ancient city and snippets of powerful words and phrases, Runelord Kaladurnae trained a select few kasthezvis in wizardry. These powerful runespeakers still live, but are cursed with greed. They hoard their arcane knowledge and venture from their lairs only when enticed by the prospect of learning new secrets. Kaladurnae also taught the kasthezvis to write. Kasthezvis cover their austere lairs with runes, scratches, and ancient Thassilonian letters, occasionally mixed with silent [explosive runes](spell/explosive_runes) inscribed by their runespeakers. These writings would be the greatest source of knowledge about the kasthezvis' history, culture, and motivations-if anyone could locate and decipher them. Aside from these writings, Kasthezvis communicate using a unique sign language known only to their kind, in which they use their entire bodies in an inhuman display of contortions and jerking limbs.",

In turn, they expect to be treated with the respect such a position deserves. To those unfamiliar with a katroome's ways, the creature might come across as overbearing or imperious. Even to those who might compliment its beauty, a katroome might condescendingly issue a correction: \"I'm not beautiful,\" one might say, \"I am *regal*.\"",
			"",
			"Travelers typically encounter katroomes because the creatures are curious about any visitors in their realm. If the travelers seem innocuous and prove that they understand a katroome's internalized hierarchy of the area, the katroome might aid them with information. If the travelers are wicked or have disrespected the katroome or its home, the creature might stalk them, using its compulsion abilities and its natural webbing to play malicious pranks on the party.",
			"",
			"In addition to katroomes' self-assigned roles as protectors and emissaries of the forest, they are also rather avaricious, although they'll never admit it. Katroomes love savory culinary items that might appeal to a typical human. They are also enamored of magic, particularly wondrous items. A katroome might descend from its verdant perch to approach a traveler on the pretense of asking her intentions, when in reality, the katroome is merely curious about the shiny brooch on her cloak.",
			"",

They resemble lily pads with a mouthlike opening guarded by fibrous strands like those of a flytrap plant. A kawa akago's gourdlike skin ranges from maroon to crimson when it is well fed, but more often, creatures encounter a kawa akago when it is hungry. In this case, it instead takes on the same hue as other lilypads in the area, usually an innocuous green.",

Kawa akagos' thorn-tipped fangs excrete a paininducing sap that mimics the feeling of intense, burning heat. Though they prefer to fight in water, kawa akagos usually ambush from land, using their dangerous sap to drive would-be prey toward the nearby rivers or streams that will soothe the painful effects of their fangs. Once the victim immerses itself, the plant creatures swarm their target if attacking in numbers, or a single plant strikes from the depths to wear down the victim. Although a kawa akago has no respiratory system, it's body is rife with pockets it can fill with air and expel as necessary. This network of hollow chambers allows the creature to speak on the rare occasions it wishes to communicate, and is the source of the creature's terrible wail, which is capable of breaking bones and shattering glass. The sound is often described as similar to the simultaneous mournful cries of a dozen children in serious distress.",

Blood lilies are much larger and are red at all times. They crave the blood of sentient creatures above all other food, and their alignment changes to neutral evil. They gain the advanced and giant simple templates as well as the psychic magic ability, with spells that vary but generally include magic that can lure their desired prey into their waiting maws.",
			"",
			"Particularly tenacious blood lilies that continue to feed on sentient creatures may evolve further, gaining greater powers and even class levels. Fortunately, most blood lilies overstep themselves before that point and are destroyed by prey that proves too much for the plants to handle."

			"Not quite man nor ape, the kech is a hairless primate that dwells in the deepest jungles. There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a kech's flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.",
			"",
			"These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined jungle buildings, and when presented with an opportunity to seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in, the typical kech tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as cruel as they are stealthy, and most jungle villages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed.",
			"",
			"A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4 levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained guard apes among them.",
			"",
			"Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids."

			"**Disquieting Aura (Su)** A keeper of the Yellow Sign is surrounded by an aura of gloom and repulsiveness. A creature that fails its saving throw against this aura takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and on saving throws against fear effects while within the aura and for 7 minutes after leaving the affected area. Any creature that successfully saves against this power cannot be affected again by it for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based. A creature within range of a keeper's disquieting aura can be affected by its bestow curse spell-like ability from a distance (not only by touch). If a target of the aura has seen the Yellow Sign, it takes a -2 penalty on its saving throws against the aura and the keeper's bestow curse spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Entropic Drain (Ex)** A keeper's use of its energy draining ability can result in a surge of entropy that consumes its body and disrupts life all around it. Every time the keeper's entropic drain attack results in a creature's death, the keeper must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw or be destroyed. If the keeper is destroyed, all sentient beings in a 15-foot radius around the keeper gain a negative level (Fortitude DC 17 negates). If any negative level bestowed by a keeper becomes permanent, the victim must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or die after 1 hour of delirium. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)** A keeper of the Yellow Sign is powerless in natural sunlight (though not in an area of daylight or similar spells), and it cannot attack and is staggered. It can use its supernatural and spell-like abilities, but with a 50% failure chance.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Sign Affinity (Su)** When the keeper of the Yellow Sign stays within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours, it gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the Yellow Sign spell (see page 72). If the keeper leaves this range, it loses the bonuses immediately and can regain them only after once more staying within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign is the undead form of a cultist of Hastur who willingly sacrificed his soul to rise as his god's servant after death. A quiet but relentless champion of the Unspeakable One, a keeper brings anxiety and woe to the lives of any infidel who comes too close to the secrets of its master. Like a vampire, a keeper can easily pass for a living human, if it so wishes, although it tends to have a pale, unhealthy look and a swollen face that can give away its true nature to those who know what to look for. Feeble and sluggish in the sunlight, a keeper can easily be mistaken for a sickly vagrant or even a leper if seen in the open during the day. In the darkness, however, a keeper grows supernaturally strong and attentive, and its eyes glow with a malignant, yellow luminescence.",
			"",
			"A keeper's primary purpose is to haunt and persecute unbelievers who witness the Yellow Sign or, worse, have a document or item that bears the dreaded symbol, such as a copy of The King in Yellow or another artifact of Hastur's cult. Against these favored victims, the keeper uses dream to create a sense of anticipation and awareness of its victim's forthcoming doom. Although a keeper's actions are mainly motivated by a sadistic eagerness to spread pain and misery, the creature can also perform special duties on behalf of a cleric of Hastur, such as slaying her personal enemies or harassing cultists she considers unworthy. These monsters also have an odd, morbid attraction for art in all its forms, favoring bizarre and decadent creations. Since a keeper's energy drain ability can cause its own destruction, one interested in prolonging its own existence uses its touch attack sparingly. Typically, a keeper switches to touch attacks when it faces heavily armored adversaries otherwise difficult to hit, when it is reduced to half hit points (and therefore already facing destruction), or when it simply feels the urge to \"taste\" the energy of a victim, usually one with artistic talent (such as anyone who demonstrates particular skill in the areas of Craft or Perform).",
			"",
			"As undead creatures, keepers of the Yellow Sign do not reproduce, though their existence in a given area can signify the presence of a cult of Hastur. Interacting with such creatures can sometimes influence other followers of the King in Yellow to undergo the transformation ritual and become keepers themselves. Keepers do little to proselytize and do not seek out potential converts to their faith or possible additions to their ranks. Rather, they are singularly focused on preventing evidence or knowledge of Hastur's cult from spreading to unbelievers, pursuing anyone who has seen the Yellow Sign, has an artifact bearing the powerful symbol, or has intimate knowledge of a cult's activities or plans.",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but it nevertheless has an urge to consume the energy of those who show particular talent in the arts. When using its energy draining abilities to sate such a hunger, the keeper typically drops its normally dour demeanor in favor of one of ecstasy and satisfaction, a small hint at Hastur's predilection for decadence and depravity. The keeper generally regains its composure immediately after it is done draining its victim's energy, though in rare cases a keeper might become so enraptured by the experience that it does not stop before its victim dies, thus putting itself in danger of selfdestructing as the essence of life drained from its victim overwhelms it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign can be found anywhere there are active cults of Hastur or in ruins where a cult once existed, especially those locations marked by a Yellow Sign. Keepers rarely travel far from the site of their creation, preferring to live reclusive, solitary existences in nearby communities. They seldom congregate with others of their kind, except when multiple keepers serve the same priest of Hastur. The undead retain their memories of life, and those rare independent keepers that share the company of other keepers often knew one another in life-likely they came from the same cult of the Unspeakable One and took part in the same transformation ritual. Despite this connection, however, even paired keepers yearn to be alone with their despair and insanity-wracked thoughts, coming together only for protection from outside threats or to overpower potential targets that are more powerful than a lone keeper could handle.",
			"",
			"In the communities where they reside, keepers are often mistaken for vagrants, mendicants, and diseased beggars. They often sit on unoccupied stoops, on public benches, or in gutters, muttering to themselves for hours on end, all the while watching passersby for indications that their neighbors may have witnessed the Yellow Sign. When offered charitable help by kind souls who encounter them, keepers of the Yellow Sign typically flee rather than risk giving away their true nature, which leads to the common belief that they are simply mad and either unwilling to receive aid or incapable of accepting it. Other times, they take on jobs that the general populace deems unsavory or macabre, such as gravedigger or hearse driver. They can observe potential targets from afar in these roles, lurking in cemeteries or churchyards and turning their unnerving gazes on the targets of their ire.",
			"",
			"By remaining on the fringes of society, however, a keeper of the Yellow Sign can exist unheeded in a single settlement or region for generations, as most residents pay so little attention to it that they fail to notice that the creature never ages or dies. As such, some keepers are old enough to remember past millennia-yet, they are rarely sane enough or willing enough to recount their knowledge to anyone but the most devout and powerful members of Hastur's faith."

A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie.

			"Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dreamrealms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.",
			"",
			"The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.",
			"",
			"The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful.",
			"",
			"Kelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can \"swim\" in any direction, including underwater, it may be found on the surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the ocean. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to retreat deep underwater (assuming its foe cannot easily follow) or use teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Many loot caches on the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory for later counting.",
			"",
			"When called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services, preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous, voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets, though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious shipwreck in a cove.",
			"",
			"The ship is fully mobile in waterlike environments on other planes, including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the \"waters\" of the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watery parts of the Abyss, though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in the terrain that would trap it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject fear of punishment for any perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her.",
			"",
			"Though the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to Pharasma's Boneyard."

			"**Discharge (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds, a kerakinsi can discharge electricity stored within its flesh, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage to all adjacent creatures and activating its thunderclap ability. Alternatively, a kerakinsi can use this discharge to arc lightning between itself and another willing kerakinsi within 60 feet.

			"",

The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Wind Dependence (Ex)** A kerakinsi flies by manipulating winds and electrical currents with the sail-like skin stretched between its limbs. Natural winds of any strength don't impair a kerakinsi's flight, but magically created winds affect a kerakinsi as though it were a Tiny flying creature. In calm winds, a kerakinsi takes a -12 penalty on Fly checks.",
			"",

			"Native to the windswept coasts and boggy isles of the Sodden Lands, kerakinsis are perfectly adapted to living with storms. Kerakinsis ride the gales that batter their territory, pillaging settlements and plundering ships wherever the wind takes them. The creatures revel in these raids and hunt as much for sport as for supplies, eager to show dominance over \"lesser\" humanoids who seek shelter from the storms in which kerakinsis thrive.",
			"",
			"While kerakinsis can maneuver gracefully in powerful storms, they lack the ability to fly without wind to carry them. As a result, most kerakinsis obsess over any force that allows them to control the weather, often serving creatures capable of manipulating wind currents. Many display a natural affinity for druidic or shamanic magic, earning high status among their kind when they learn how to bend the winds to their will. Some scholars believe this aptitude indicates that kerakinsis descend from a people who turned to cruel druidic rituals to survive in the stormwracked wilds."

			"**Bigger Inside (Su)** A ketesthius's stomach is an extradimensional space, much larger on the inside than its physical size would allow. A ketesthius can swallow any Gargantuan or smaller creature, and its cavernous stomach is an entirely new location, its size varying wildly from ketesthius to ketesthius. Creatures swallowed by the ketesthius are not considered grappled, nor do they take damage each round, and damage to the walls of the stomach do not harm the ketesthius or allow the creatures to escape. Creatures trapped inside can generally escape only via teleportation magic that crosses planes or if the ketesthius is defeated or nauseated from outside. As a result of its unusual anatomy and huge appetite, a ketesthius often has other monsters living inside its stomach, which in turn feed on things the ketesthius swallows. A ketesthius usually has from one to four monsters of CR 8-9 in its gullet. Sea creatures like dire sharks, dire crocodiles, giant octopus, or giant squid are most common, but less frequently giants or other land-dwelling creatures live in its gut as well. Ketesthiuses are even known to swallow each other, though only on rare occasions.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ketesthiuses are large sea monsters with wolf like heads and foreclaws, eel-like bodies, and powerful fish tails. They are voracious eaters with great jaws that can gulp down prey that can be as large as themselves. Creatures a ketesthius swallows are not digested immediately, because ketesthiuses' vast stomachs and unique anatomy allow them to sustain living creatures inside their gullets indefinitely. Entire ecologies can form within a single ketesthius's extradimensional digestive tract. Though the stomach's ecosystem is capable of supporting life, it's far from a welcome environment: no sunlight comes in, the air is thin and dank, and most creatures trapped within become feral in short order. Larger creatures that end up inside a ketesthius have a difficult time surviving long term, and must resort to quickly snapping up prey that their host later swallows.",
			"",
			"Though it makes no attempt to hoard treasure, within a ketesthius's vast gut lies all the treasure of the creatures-and even ships-that the ketesthius has swallowed. More than once, tales of lost treasure within have led foolish adventurers to risk being intentionally swallowed by a ketesthius.",
			"",
			"An adult ketesthius typically measures over 50 feet long. Its weight varies based on the size of its extradimensional gullet, but usually ranges from 5-60 tons."

Keulias today are prestige pets that Kalistocrats groom with all the care one would pay a bonsai tree, delicately coaxing the lizards to absorb gems and precious metals into their hides. They naturally shed their camouflage, and so intermittently shed a few jewels every month. Drumans have developed several superstitions and sayings about these events, considering it good luck for such a gem to fall at one's feet.",

A khaei in fear for her life can grab an attacker and forcefully age him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe's body. This exertion does damage to the khaei as well, and thus is rarely used, but a would-be tyrant who considers the khaei easy pickings may find himself surrounded by a weeping mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude-then forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the khaei's existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a great event.",
			"",
			"Khaei live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their situation. The only known enclave of khaei in the Inner Sea region is in the Dark Forest, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve as both subjects and prey for the mysterious dullahan called the Dark Rider. One of the most cherished stories of these khaei concerns a time and place-somewhere in either the past or the future- when there were many more of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones."

Manifested gems are otherwise treated as ongoing spell effects, counting as 6th-level spells. The khardajeen is considered caster level 14th for the purposes of its gem abilities.",
			"",
			"- Blue-While manifested, this gem grants the ability to shoot a ray as a ranged touch attack against a creature within 120 feet. A creature struck by the ray takes 6d6 points of cold damage.",

Ranged ray attacks from manifested gems do not provoke attacks of opportunity. A tentacle making a ray attack in a round cannot be used to make a melee attack.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The true name of these creatures is one of Golarion's many forgotten mysteries. The name \"khardajeen\" is rough and ancient Dwarven for something akin to \"scourge of the deep.\" These aberrant creatures silently float throughout the tunnels of the Darklands. They are attracted to sites of great antiquity, particularly the treasure troves of dwarven Darklands kingdoms and the deeper Orvian depths. A khardajeen is a shifting mass of gray flesh and thick, multicolored blood that stretches roughly 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Khardajeens appear as little more than rock and metal orbiting an exposed liquid core. Some mental force ensures their liquid interiors do not spill out, while tentacles of blood allow them basic manipulation. They're renowned for their innate ability to form crystalline gems atop their tentacles. These gems are believed to imitate the properties of the magical ioun stones, leading some to believe that these creatures are related to the ancient Azlanti or even aboleths.",
			"",
			"The ability to obfuscate darkvision is one of the khardajeens' unique adaptations. This natural effect causes visual distortions when viewing khardajeens with darkvision, granting the aberrations an incredible advantage when facing other Darklands foes. As a result, surface-dwelling species with magical or natural light sources have an easier time hunting khardajeens than the natural inhabitants of the Darklands. Whether khardajeens evolved this adaptation over their millennia of wandering in the dark or as an augmentation selected by their mysterious creators is entirely unknown.",
			"",
			"Most scholars who've studied khardajeens believe that their survival is connected to their pearly white manifested gems. These gems reinvigorate the creatures, replenishing any life-sustaining fluids lost in the rigors of combat and healing other damage taken. Khardajeens don't breathe or sleep, allowing them to be constantly active. Those not under any immediate compulsion might enter a state of torpor; such khardajeens harden their blood into a fleshlike compound, making them resemble a roughly human-sized ball of mottled, purple skin.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The history of khardajeens is an enigma, and none make any claim on their creation. There is one imperative that seems to drive khardajeens: seeking out ancient artifacts. Khardajeens are innately attracted to the presence and use of magical devices associated with primordial Darklands empires, particularly the aboleths, the dwarves, and the Vault Builders.",
			"",
			"Khardajeens rarely work in tandem, though they occasionally cross paths and awkwardly travel together, attracted by similar, inscrutable goals-but without any true allegiance or ability to communicate. A conglomeration of khardajeens is known as a disassembly, for they gather in such numbers only to tear down great works or destroy historically significant objects. A disassembly of khardajeens currently stalks the lowest levels of the Sky Citadel of Kravenkus, their goals a mystery to the dwarves guarding the upper levels of the fortress-city.",
			"",
			"Khardajeens have an odd relationship with the Darklands species known as delvers. Khardajeens can't create their own tunnels' save for very slowly, using their manifested rays-so they rely on delvers to facilitate their travels. How such a union occurs is inexplicable, but many khardajeens silently float behind the ravenous, cavern-digging delvers, waiting until they reach some forgotten Darklands chamber. After the delver completes a tunnel, the khardajeen abandons it and continues its own journey without incident.",
			"",
			"Munavris wage an ongoing conflict against khardajeens. The aberrations glide up from beneath the Sightless Sea to assail the munavris' island cities. The munavri-held region of Beryl Island sees the greatest frequency of these attacks, and dozens of gallant munavris have sacrificed themselves to stymie the khardajeens' advance. The khardajeens concentrate their erratic efforts on pushing into the most secure area of the munavris' holdings: the central city of Valcergos. Attackers have yet to enter the mythical city, but it's only a matter of time before one of the aberrations closes in on whatever draws their attention."

Doing so causes the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing lights spell, under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex, half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle, torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any means for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The childlike kijimunas bear physical similarities to their Inner Sea cousins, the goblins, sharing their small size, leathery skin, and large, pointed ears. However, kijimunas' hair stands out as their most prominent features-long, wild manes of blazing red. These tricky creatures nearly always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them for trouble-making urchins.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their \"play\" frustrates, harms, or otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more elaborate pranks.",
			"",
			"A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds. Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and climbing tall banyan trees.",
			"",
			"Consummate fishermen, kijimunas while away the hours fishing on the shores of oceans or large lakes. Although they delight in the taste of fish-especially the eyes' they easily grow bored and become distracted, sometimes leaving their fishing spears and a pile of fish to rot onshore. The creatures alleviate their boredom by playing tricks on fishermen and villagers living near their cavern or treetop homes. A kijimuna makes every effort to hide its involvement in the tricks it pulls, more out of a sense of pride about a well-executed joke than fear of reprisal.",
			"",
			"A young kijimuna grows to adulthood in a matter of 5 months, but retains its childish appearance for the entirety of its life. In the unlikely event that its activities don't cause its premature demise, the creature lives for about 15 years. An elderly kijimuna, having reached the ripe old age of 12, settles down and does little else beyond fish in solitude, except perhaps to bargain with children from nearby villages for its catch. It extracts a promise from a child in return for the fish, as well instructions for a devious prank or practical joke to pull on an elder.",
			"",
			"Although their societies and world view differ wildly from those of the goblins of the Inner Sea Region and elsewhere in Golarion, physiologically kijimuna are little different. As true goblinoids, any sort of device, concoction, or magical effect that only affects goblins affects these erratic tricksters as well.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tribes of kijimunas maintain small lairs in seaside caves, amid groves of banyan trees, or in other secluded, enclosed areas near the shore. Their homes typically stink of rotten fish from catches brought home and promptly forgotten, while the walls often bear halfcompleted diagrams of pranks members intend to pull on neighboring creatures. Kijimunas rarely pull pranks on each other, mostly because they hold their peoples' cleverness in high regard, and believe that it's impossible to trick their own kind. Occasionally, however, some event leaves a kijimuna the victim of some accidental hilarity- well-placed meal scraps left on its face, tripping into a tide pool, falling down-such occurrences are the height of kijimuna comedy.",
			"",
			"Much like their Inner Sea cousins, kijimunas have a strong, bizarre hatred for a particular creature-in this case, the octopus. When faced with octopuses, kijimunas either flee in terror or desperately attack, their whoops and howls vastly exaggerating the threat the cephalopods pose. Kijimunas often share frightening stories about octopuses at night, scaring one another with fearful tales of squirming tentacles and clutching suckers. Occasionally these stories incite groups to action, leading them to go on raids of local tide pools and rocky beaches where the sea creatures regularly lurk. The resulting battles prove loud but brief, with skewered octopuses and the occasional \"hostage\" taken as supplies for the goblinoids' most startling jokes.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas have few strong feelings about other animals, especially as predators more dangerous than large lizards and the occasional hunting cat rarely occupy the same lands that they do. They delight in sharing their homes with large tropical birds, however, a sentiment that is hardly reciprocated, as they frequently employ the creatures (and the creatures' eggs) in their pranks and take endless delight in mimicking the birds' squawking. Spiders, with their numerous legs, are generally avoided by kijimuna, many of which suspect the insects might be just miniature octopuses in disguise.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas share goblins' affinity for fire, but this attraction manifests in a less overtly destructive way. These creatures have developed secret techniques allowing them to befriend small fires, calling such flames to them to light their paths, lead travelers into their pranks, or steal a lantern's ability to hold a light. No kijimunas remember how their people managed to make friends with small fires, just that they did a long time ago. Large fires remain dangerous to kijimunas, however, and not only do they have no power over such blazes, but they generally have nothing pleasant to say about any flame larger than a campfire.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas often form relationships with other humanoids who fish along the same shore. Some befriend such creatures, eagerly sharing all manner of trivial secrets-where the best fishing spots are, what trees grow the stinkiest fruit, and which rocks octopuses hardly ever visit. As a show of friendship, kijimunas make their companions favored targets for particularly embarrassing practical jokes.",
			"",
			"Those of a superstitious bent view kijimunas as evil spirits, pointing to the ghostly flames that often follow the creatures and their mischievous behavior as proof. Once in a while, someone discovers kijimunas' hatred for octopuses and carries one around as a ward. This typically backfires spectacularly, as the kijimunas then focus their ire on the person-who is obviously some sort of octopus spy or ally. Kijimunas reserve their most elaborate tricks for cephalopod sympathizers.",
			"",
			"The only counter to most humanoids' distrust and wariness regarding kijimunas manifests in times of famine or poor fishing seasons. In numerous such cases, a town on the brink of starvation has found its food stores replenished on a daily basis by an energized tribe of kijimunas, as these creatures apply their considerable fishing talents to feed their neighbors. After all, kijimunas realize that corpses are considerably less entertaining than living creatures, especially when serving as the butts of jokes. Thus, most communities accept that if their benefactors happen to play a trick or two on them, matters could be far worse."

			"**Hidey-Hole (Su)** When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she can create an extradimensional space by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or other permanent object (such as a stove). This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the nearest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole.",

			"Kikimoras are enemies of brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras often invite pain and frustration on their chosen housemates instead of helping chores along. Some brownies actively seek out kikimorainfested homes with the intention of driving out the disruptive fey creatures. When homeowners refuse to appease a resident kikimora (or can't rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora visits upon them a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Because of the subtle tricks these fey employ, inhabitants in homes plagued by kikimoras often believe they have been beset by ghosts.",
			"",
			"Kikimoras love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They proceed to trick the people in the house into leaving gifts in return for making repairs at night, much to the indignation of brownies, who view such gifts as payments for services rendered and resent the kikimoras' transformation of such agreements into coercion."

It can do this a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier. Alternatively, a kirrix can expend two uses of this ability to spray a disease in a 15-foot cone, exposing all creatures in the cone to the disease even if it can't normally be contracted by contact. Doing so depletes the kirrix's reserve of that disease.",
			"",
			"**Harbor Pathogens (Ex)** A kirrix's body has innate features that let it clean up and contain diseases within ratfolk warrens. A kirrix collects diseases by consuming them off of objects or from the air (typically contact, ingested, or inhaled diseases), by ministering to a diseased creature (typically ingested or injury diseases), or by fighting a creature that imparts diseases and being subjected to one. The kirrix can store up to two types of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others. Treat this as though the kirrix were using the Heal skill to treat disease with a +12 bonus.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ratfolk have just as much enthusiasm for alchemy as they do for rodents, and they combined these two interests to create the kirrix-the result of generations of riding rat husbandry combined with regular infusions. These alchemical modifications have given kirrixes six legs and the ability to consume and transmit diseases without ill effect to the creatures themselves.",
			"",
			"Many ratfolk settlements raise these gregarious creatures, with whom the ratfolk share their warrens in a symbiotic relationship. The kirrixes prowl the ratfolk tunnels and act as scavengers-searching for unfamiliar scents, consuming detritus, and removing harmful diseases from the ratfolk settlement. If the warren comes under attack, the kirrixes act as guards, and squeeze through or block tunnels as necessary to buy time for their ratfolk allies to escape.",

Though some priests serve the dragon gods, many pay homage to Asmodeus, seeing in Hell the perfect embodiment of a lawful evil society. These devilspeakers believe a tribe should work like a well-oiled machine, and while kobolds' natural cowardice sometimes gets in the way, devilspeakers keep their warriors fighting bravely-whether the troops like it or not. Devilspeakers keep spells like animate dead handy, turning fallen kobold warriors into zombies. These kobold zombies effectively soften up invading adventurers, and dig tirelessly in the mines."

			"**Blizzard Breath (Su)** A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Forlorn Gaze (Su)** As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Ice Walker (Ex)** A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Sight (Ex)** A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing.",
			"",
			"**Sound Imitation (Ex)** A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of the kokogiak's dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids, and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique- they lie in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe, snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast. Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire nests in a single flick of the tongue.",
			"",
			"While they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks, kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water's edge serve them well in the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches. Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then, calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid dens.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer climes' abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a kokogiak's mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community, chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the kokogiak's hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community.",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power. More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the kokogiak's waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or more grisly trophies torn from its victims' remains, artfully displayed for the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind them of the price of defiance.",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals. Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival, struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving parent as its own mate."

			"Korir-kokembe live in the deep, watery jungles of central Garund, plaguing the major rivers and lake systems. While young korir-kokembe may swim near populated waterways to claim their prey, their elder kin prefer more remote backwaters, sloughs, and heavily wooded swamps where they can hunt undisturbed. These degenerate dragons live in a violent symbiosis with the tiny vermin that infest the jungle, hosting colonies of such creatures within their own bodies. Such tiny vermin constantly swarm in and out of the korir-kokembe's gullet, bringing contagion to creatures bitten and allowing the wyrm to expel swarms of pests, or to summon yet more vermin to its aid. While korir-kokembe are capable of flight, they generally prefer to crawl or climb on their eight legs, hunching their bodies like inchworms or twining their coils around their prey while savaging creatures with a barrage of slashing claws."

			"Qwoshokk is an ancient elder kraken who dwells northwest of Cheliax, 2 miles beneath the surface of the water in the Arcadian Ocean's Gartanica Trench. He has laired there for over 3,000 years, excavating the remains of an aboleth palace buried beneath a thin layer of sediment. In addition to uncovering the relics of his enemies, Qwoshokk devotes much of his time to restoring an aboleth machine called the Cholcorite Mechanism, using a rare kind of agate found off the Chelish coast to repair the engine. Once he has completed his work on the device, he believes it will grant him immortality and the power to dominate all the denizens of the sea, at which point he will take his ambitions to the surface world.",
			"",
			"While Qwoshokk's work on the Cholcorite Mechanism is almost finished, he fears he needs one more item to complete the device-an artifact of great power that will jump-start the Mechanism's arcane energies. Qwoshokk knows that to the north of the Gartanica Trench once stood the empire of Thassilon, and he has constructed a plan to excavate great chunks of the Fenwall Mountains of southern Varisia, seeking whatever unknowable treasures may lurk beneath the stone. Already, he has procured the aid of several influential land-dwellers who have promised to help him find the artifact, frightened into submission when the immense kraken appeared at the shore of their seaside towns promising destruction to all those who did not obey him.",
			"",
			"Having worked on the Cholcorite Mechanism for millennia, Qwoshokk was able to extract several unnecessary parts out of the device for his personal use. Among them are his crown and armlets, items which he's bonded to his flesh to give him power over lightning as well as to enhance his ability to summon and control creatures with weak minds."

			"**Capture (Su)** If Krampus begins its turn grappling a Medium or smaller creature, it can stuff the target into its bag as a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature stuffed into this bag is subjected to Krampus's regression ability (see below). A creature in the bag can try to cut its way free with any light slashing weapon. The bag has AC 25, hardness 20, and 30 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the bag, Krampus can repair the bag as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Until then, any creature stuffed into the bag is still subjected to the regression ability but can escape with a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity from Krampus. The bag has other special qualities while in Krampus's possession. The weight of creatures in the bag doesn't count against Krampus's carrying capacity. Up to four Small creatures or two Medium creatures can fit in the bag at a time. If used by any creature other than Krampus, the container functions as a mundane sack. If Krampus's bag is lost or destroyed, it can create a new bag with 1 hour of work.",
			"",
			"**Limited Immortality (Su)** Though Krampus still needs to eat, drink, and sleep, it doesn't age and can't die of old age. If Krampus is killed, a new Krampus forms elsewhere in the world after a year's time-this new Krampus retains the memories of the previous Krampus and likely holds a grudge against the person who killed it the year before. If a method to disrupt this cycle exists, it has yet to be discovered by mortals.",
			"",
			"**Mystical Chains (Su)** Krampus's chains function as a +3 spiked chain and also count as an evil weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. These chains become non-magical if Krampus does not carry or wield them, and if a chain is disarmed or destroyed, Krampus can create a new set of chains as a standard action. The chains react almost as a living extension of Krampus's will and have the grab ability.",
			"",
			"**Punish the Naughty (Su)** As a swift action, Krampus can designate a single target it can see as being \"naughty.\" The target must be a child, a creature with the young template, or a victim of Krampus's regression ability. Against that target, Krampus gains a +5 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks. These bonuses remain in effect until the target is dead or Krampus designates another target as naughty.",
			"",
			"**Regression (Su)** Each round a creature begins its turn stuffed into Krampus's bag, it must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw or be regressed back to its childhood. The creature is affected in size as if via reduce person, but none of the target's gear changes size. This effect persists for 24 hours, after which the target regains its original size. A creature currently under the effects of regression cannot be further affected by this ability. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",

Many of these holidays involve lighting cheery fires, forgiving grudges, decorating trees, and exchanging gifts. Unfortunately, in some areas, these times of merriment are tarnished by the looming specter of Krampus, a terrifying creature that hunts those it considers to be acting against the spirit of the times. However, thanks to Krampus's twisted morality, it sees selfishness and incivility everywhere it goes.",
			"",
			"Krampus is a tall, goatlike humanoid with large horns and a long tongue that constantly lolls out of one side of its mouth or the other. Though its natural attacks are powerful enough to break bones, Krampus also carries a set of iron chains that it uses to thrash and grapple its foes. The oversized bag it carries is often stained with the blood of its captured victims. Krampus stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The origins of Krampus are shrouded in mystery, with stories of the creature seeming to stretch back hundreds or even thousands of years, if not more. To the beleaguered regions under Krampus's tyranny, the creature has simply always been around.",
			"",
			"The most popular legend regarding Krampus's beginnings starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After several harsh winters that the townsfolk almost didn't survive, they came to doubt the rituals that the druids believed appeased the local nature spirits. As the villagers grew more and more resentful, the druids took drastic action. They attempted to create a central figure for the important winter rituals that would make people want to celebrate them. Under the light of a blue moon, one of the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and brought forth the essence of a spirit of revenge, and a new creature was born-Krampus.",
			"",
			"For a while, Krampus was everything the druids wanted. It brought together the villagers in revelry during the day and left small gifts of fruit for them in the night. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' hateful emotions and bitter resentment, which began to stain the creature's soul. Krampus began punishing those who behaved selfishly during these lean times, first simply striking them with bundles of birch, but then escalating to using magic to transform them into the petulant children it saw them as. Eventually, it came to see everyone as wicked and terrorized the villages for weeks.",
			"",
			"The remainder of the druidic circle managed to locate the creature as it slept and shackled it in cold iron chains, believing it still retained a part of its fey nature. They were wrong. When Krampus awoke, the creature tore free from its restraints and used those same chains to beat the druids to death. It then retreated into the snow-blanketed forest for the remainder of the season.",
			"",
			"Krampus returned year after year, growing stronger and more hideous with each winter solstice and gaining a taste for humanoid flesh. Even its periodic \"death\" at the hands of heroes did nothing to stop this cycle. Fortunately, while it could ravage the countryside all year long, for some reason it chooses to limit its predations to the winter months. Where it goes the rest of the year, no one has been able to discover."

As part of the howl, the kravyad attempts a combat maneuver check. If the kravyad succeeds at the check, its target is pulled 5 feet closer to the kravyad in a straight line. For every 5 by which the kravyad's combat maneuver exceeds a creature's CMD, the target moves an additional 5 feet toward the krayvad.

			"",
			"Though intelligent and capable of brutish speech in Aquan, a kravyad is driven mainly by its excessive gluttony. Those seeking to coerce a kravyad into service must rely on either mental enslavement or shows of strength-combined with a steady supply of electrocuted corpses."

			"",
			"Krenshar's retractable skin allows it to dine on carrion with a lower risk of picking up disease-carrying vermin, much like a vulture's bare head and neck. When the creature finishes eating, restoring the facial skin to its normal position scrapes off gore and clinging bugs. The ability to retract their skin is demonstrated in other contexts as well-male krenshars bare their skulls at rivals as a challenge over mates, females use this ability to ward off undesired suitors, and hunting adults use it to scare prey into ambushes.",
			"",
			"Though krenshars generally prefer to stalk herd animals like deer or cattle, they have no qualms about taking on humanoids when food is scarce. They average 4 to 5 feet in length and weigh approximately 175 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars have long debated the confusing nature of krenshar intelligence. While clearly more intelligent than mere animals, the creatures seem to lack all but the most rudimentary language of snarls and yowls, and aside from the scare tactics that make them notorious, tend to behave much like mundane cats or wolves, even going so far as to occasionally be befriended by rangers or druids. Those who deny krenshars' intelligence, however, need only look into their strange violet eyes or observe the ease with which they manipulate and outmaneuver their prey to realize their folly-an error few make twice."

			"**Bloodfruit (Su)** Fruit-bearing plants in a kudimmu's field produce sickly, misshapen, blood-red versions of normal fruits of the same variety. An undead creature can consume a kudimmu's bloodfruit in place of whatever bodily material it normally hungers for, whether blood, flesh, or something else. Doing so temporarily sates the undead creature's hunger, but does not provide any other benefits normally gained from consumption. Upon consuming bloodfruit, an undead creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or fall under the kudimmu's control, as per control undead. A living creature treats bloodfruit as a drug with the following statistics (see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide for full rules on drugs and addiction): type ingested; addiction severe, Fortitude DC 25; effects 1 hour; +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against necromancy spells and effects, fester as per the spell (caster level 24th); damage 1d4 Con. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Bombardment (Su)** A kudimmu can produce bloodfruit from its body, which are charged with negative energy and can be thrown as splash weapons. These bloodfruit deal 8d6 points of negative energy damage on a direct hit, and 8 points of damage to creatures adjacent to the targeted square. A successful DC 25 Will saving throw halves this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** A creature killed by the kudimmu's blood drain ability or by Constitution damage accrued through consuming bloodfruit rises as a vampire spawn under the kudimmu's control 1d4 days later. A kudimmu can have a number of enslaved spawn totaling at most double its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.",
			"",
			"**Fieldbound (Ex, Sp, Su)** A kudimmu can designate an area of natural vegetation up to 100 feet by 100 feet per side as its field, fusing the root systems of the area's plants into an interconnected mass. While in physical contact with the ground of its field, a kudimmu gains fast healing 15, tremorsense, and a 15-foot burrow speed. Additionally, the kudimmu can teleport to any location in its field as per dimension door. Spells and effects that attempt to alter the field's earth or vegetation must overcome the kudimmu's spell resistance to succeed. The kudimmu is physically dependent on its field, as the root system beneath it is in many ways an extension of the kudimmu's body. A kudimmu separated from its field for more than 24 hours instantly decays into a lump of inanimate matter. A kudimmu that is slain or destroyed reforms in the ground beneath its field in a process that takes 1d10 days to complete. To prevent a kudimmu from reviving, its field must be sown with salt or destroyed by magic (merely destroying the surface plants is not sufficient-the roots must also be entirely destroyed). A kudimmu must maintain its field with the blood of the living. The field must soak up the blood of a Medium or larger creature once per week. For each week the kudimmu fails to feed its field, it takes 2 points of Constitution damage. This damage cannot be healed until the kudimmu feeds its field. A kudimmu can designate a new field once per month in a process that takes 1 hour to complete. It can have only one active field at a time.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When a city is destroyed, it is customary for the conquering army to sow salt or thorns to render the ground forever infertile and curse those who would dare to rebuild. In most cases, this is simply a symbolic gesture. However, this ritual has eminently practical roots. Death and devastation are potent seeds, and the blood of conquered peoples can mingle with the roots of burned fields to produce terrible creatures. These are called kudimmus, twisted weeds that corrupt the ground of vanquished cities and exact a terrible price upon invaders.",
			"",
			"A kudimmu's body is diffused throughout its field, and it can weigh tens of thousands of pounds. Its primary fruiting body is vaguely humanoid in shape, standing 10 feet tall and weighing 4,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Most of the fruit a kudimmu produces is tainted by sinister magic. While this does not affect the taste or nutritional value of the fruit, it does leave them misshapen and renders any seeds inside dead. Kudimmus can, however, produce viable fruit should they choose to do so. These fruit are identical to their normal bloodfruit in every way, except that the seeds of these fruit sprout into new kudimmus if planted into unconsecrated ground. Kudimmus rarely use this ability, as more kudimmus in the world means more competition for food. However, if a kudimmu feels its life is threatened or it knows it will soon be attacked, it can send one of its undead minions to plant its seeds in a distant field to ensure the continuation of its line.",
			"",
			"These monstrous plants require fresh sources of blood for their fields and thus prey on humanoid settlements to survive. Some kudimmus can make do with the blood of animals for a short time, but they do not find this subsistence living agreeable and almost always seek out farms or other civilized places to make their homes. Some kudimmus consume communities without care and live nomadic lives, always searching for fresh hunting grounds. Other kudimmus are more cautious and cunning, cultivating humanoid populations much as farmers tend to their crops.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once a kudimmu establishes itself in a field, it uses its addictive bloodfruit to conquer nearby settlements. If the local populace seems unwilling to eat the misshapen fruit, the kudimmu may leave its field at night to poison other fields and bring about a famine. Once one or two individuals fall under the kudimmu's control, it sends its new vampiric minions to strong-arm or convert the town's leadership.",
			"",
			"Competition for feeding grounds keeps kudimmus from cooperating with each other. In fact, kudimmus often squabble over territory. As kudimmus are usually unwilling to leave their fields and fight powerful rivals on their own, these wars are fought through proxies, often the kudimmus' vampiric minions.",
			"",
			"As kudimmus prey on humans, so too do the undead prey on kudimmus. Usually this is to the plants' benefit, as any undead that feed on their fruit eventually fall under their spell and strengthen their influence over the countryside. However, particularly strong-willed undead can resist the effects of kudimmus' bloodfruit and exploit the plants as an alternative to hunting humanoids."

While this feeding doesn't immediately kill the victim, it leaves a horrific rotting scent on the victim's breath that can spread the kurobozu's contagious apoxia to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion, and death.",

They still possess a shred of their former discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans for their acts of revenge. Generally, kurobozus' interactions with other creatures are limited to feeding and killing, but they have an affinity for malcontent ex-monks and may actually go out of their way to secretly offer protection or succor to such a person, without ever revealing their true identities. Evil ex-monks seeking to destroy their former masters and fellow disciples may even see the actual face of their benefactors and be able to forge lasting alliances."

			"Kyranas are large, iguana-like relatives of true dragons, with low intelligence and an affinity for fire. Though quite weak as dragons go, kyranas are still dangerous enough to command the fear and respect of kobolds, who often encounter the fire-breathing dragons while digging deep tunnels.",
			"",
			"Kyranas are primarily subterranean creatures, though they can occasionally be found on the surface in extremely hot or volcanic areas. Healed supernaturally by contact with fire, they often spend their time swimming in volcanic calderas or underground lava lakes, taking in geothermic energy and storing it in order to release it on their prey as lines of fiery breath.",
			"",
			"If kyranas stayed confined to their magma homes, they would present little problem to other races. Unfortunately, they're extremely territorial, even toward their own offspring. Kyranas are born in clutches of six to 12 eggs, and raised by both parents. As soon as the creatures reach adulthood at the age of 18 months, however, the parents turn on their offspring and drive them from the nest. The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of heat. That means they often come waddling into inhabited areas, snorting and ready to burn anyone standing between them and the hearth. Adventurers may find their campfires claimed by a greedy kyrana, or end up being followed for their torchlight. Kobolds often use these barely intelligent dragons as heavy artillery, employing fire arrows and flaming traps to lure them into conflict with enemies.",

These kytons are invariably more powerful than the one presented here, often having spell-like abilities or hideous and unsettling special attacks along the themes of torture and pain.

			"The term \"sadistic\" is synonymous with kytons, who are known for their innate cruelty and capacity to gain pleasure from the suffering of others. However, an apocrisiarius kyton considers inflicting pain and suffering nothing more than a tool to reach what truly intrigues it-the purest form of a single truth. An apocrisiarius typically appears as a human whose eyes are blank, white orbs. Tears of blood weep from its eyes-physical evidence of the sorrow it has tasted over the ages from dreadful truths torn from the flesh and mind of its countless victims. The dozens of surgical lancets that pierce an apocrisiarius's body do the creature no harm, and the holes these instruments leave are as bloodless as they are deep. The kyton operates on those it captures with these lancets; these fiends prefer to use torture and vivisection to carve away both physically and metaphorically at their victims until all that remains is the one nugget of information they desire-a pure truth, unadulterated by extraneous life.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Kyton(monster/family:kyton)",

			"So obsessed with truths are these single-minded fiends that they exude a supernatural aura that causes others nearby to be unable to lie as well. For apocrisiariuses, speaking a truth is the greatest pleasure they can achieve, particularly if those to whom it is spoken suffer from the revelation. Laying bare the most damning of secrets, particularly those that have existed only in a cloak of lies, is to apocrisiariuses like the completion of a masterpiece. A truth, once spoken, is but wind and sound and ends once the breath used to fuel it expires, yet the effects upon those who hear such words can outlast even the finest work of art. To the apocrisiarius kyton, the wounds caused by such cutting truths are the finest vintage of suffering one can inflict. As outsiders, these fiends don't need to eat to survive, yet an apocrisiarius kyton denied the opportunity to extract a hidden truth for too long grows emotionally starved. Such kytons suffer no physical effects from this metaphorical starvation, but might well agree to things they otherwise would not (such as releasing a prisoner or revealing information they have been entrusted with) in return for someone admitting before them and allies a truth that shames and hurts those who hear it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because apocrisiariuses see themselves as seekers of truth, they tend to hold themselves apart from other kytons out of a haughty sense of superiority. This arrogance is sometimes answered with extravagant punishments meted out by more powerful kytons of other types, but apocrisiariuses take these brutal reprisals with equanimity, seeing such persecution as acts of jealousy, and further justification of their pursuit of truth.",
			"",
			"Though apocrisiariuses are native to the Plane of Shadow, they frequent the Material Plane with distressing regularity. On occasion they hire themselves out to those who require the services of a skilled torturers and interrogators, but they are used most often as messengers and diplomats, particularly in the political mazes of Nidal. Those aware of apocrisiariuses know that they are incapable of uttering falsehoods, and so messages delivered by them are beyond corruption or confusion. If a noble's conjured apocrisiarius reports to another an offer of alliance, the recipient can rest assured that the source has no duplicity in mind, at least for the moment. Others use these kytons as lie detectors, by either simply capitalizing on their truth auras when interrogating nearby subjects, or asking an allied apocrisiarius to repeat a phrase. If that phrase contains a lie, the kyton cannot repeat it. Of course, these kytons have no additional insights as to why such phrases are lies, and indeed, they have even been known to willfully ignore requests to repeat things they know to be true if doing so can further their own complex plans. To an apocrisiarius, strategically withholding a truth can be far more potent than a lie ever could be.",
			"",
			"Because of their inherent ability to recognize lies, apocrisiariuses are often used as emissaries between the governments of Nidal and Cheliax. If Nidalese diplomats wish to assure Cheliax that their darkened nation poses no threat, they send one of these fiends. The Chelish government accepts whatever the kyton says as truth, knowing that it can't utter falsehoods even if the Nidalese diplomat somehow tricked the kyton.",
			"",
			"An apocrisiarius' victims are particularly unfortunate souls, for these kytons have no interest in their prisoners' well-being after truths have been extracted. Indeed, apocrisiariuses have been known to deliberately avoid acquiring the desired information in a timely manner in order to maximize the amount of time they can spend tormenting their victims, under the theory that only when a being has nothing else to cling to does the truth it conceals become pure. This does mean that in cases where a creature might hold multiple secrets, an apocrisiarius may not be the best choice for the job. These kytons excel at extracting the truth, but often their subjects do not survive beyond uttering their first revelations."

Many augurs cannot help but indulge themselves when exposed to gore-rolling within and dipping their blades into freshly spilled pools-an unfortunate trait which has led many careless augurs to their capture or doom.",
			"",

If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time (typically 1d4+3 days), or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charismarelated interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty.",

			"Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated of kytons, having inflicted such massive damage to themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments are all that holds the creature's mutilated flesh together, yet they do so with a strength far greater than that granted by mortal flesh and bone.",
			"",
			"Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire only the most powerful beings to augment themselves with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane in search of the most promising additions to their bodily collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that possess a so-called \"perfect part,\" the powerful kyton seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite, these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they merely enhance the horror that the creature represents.",
			"",
			"While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection of their targets as well as introspection regarding their own powers and identity, their primary occupation is the understanding of pain and suffering, which they pursue by inflicting the most heinous cruelties upon their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own flesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to experience the pain alongside it.",
			"",
			"While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist in harvesting an even more interesting catch, an eremite can sometimes be convinced to let the helpful victim escape. It's worth remembering, though, that kytons as a whole have little patience for the petty pursuits of honor and pride, seeing such feelings as traits that ultimately spell the end for baser creatures. The only thing that matters to an eremite is the testing of its boundaries as well as the boundaries of existence itself. Just because an eremite might be convinced to let someone go in trade for an opportunity for a greater catch doesn't mean that once that other target is secured the eremite will cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original target. One who manages to distract and subsequently escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his life on the run.",
			"",
			"A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft particularly unusual pieces of flesh to their bodies from increasingly exotic victims.",
			"",
			"### Eremite Overlords",
			"",
			"Eremites who surpass the limits of individuality and achieve dominion over a certain realm of the Plane of Shadow are referred to as eremite overlords. An overlord has focused on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure. Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues.",
			"",
			"Each overlord is a unique Large (or larger) eremite with several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act of skinning itself and wrapping its flesh in thorny black vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns, and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.",

			"Interlocutors are the self-proclaimed surgeon-sculptors among kytons, viewing their practice as more art than medical process. Each victim is a new chance to study the art of pain and sensation through horror-stricken eyes. Their ability to heal the damage they inflict, even to the extent of restoring life to a subject that has only just expired, is perhaps more feared than their eagerness to cut flesh. To an interlocutor's victim, death is a mercy that is rarely offered.",
			"",
			"Nowhere is the interlocutor's mastery of flesh more apparent than in their bodies, for their apotheosis from mortal into kyton involves the shedding of useless parts down to a tangle of nerves, veins, and various organs. These are then incorporated into bodies made of semi-living metal fashioned from raw shadowstuff harvested in strange reaches of the Plane of Shadow, giving the kyton a terrifying body. Periodically, an arm or other \"leftover\" limb is retained by the kyton, but only in the same way someone might retain ownership of a treasured piece of jewelry as a keepsake or memento. Some interlocutors retain nothing of their old bodies of flesh save the brain, nerves, and portions of their circulatory system.",

It can retrieve up to four of these icicles per round as a free action. These icicles deal piercing damage equal to 1d8 plus the libitinarii's Strength modifier (usually +6) plus 2d6 points of cold damage; they deal triple damage on a critical hit (although the cold damage is not increased). The icicles aren't considered magic weapons, but they are supernaturally hardened and count as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once the libitinarii has retrieved icicles from its flesh, new icicles immediately form as a free action. If the libitinarii's regeneration is suppressed, it also can't form new icicles. A libitinarii typically has 24 icicles embedded in its flesh at any time.",

			"**Icy Fiend (Ex)** A libitinarii's body is made from an unholy union of soulstuff and the icy essence of the coldest reaches of the Shadow Plane. As such, the libitinarii is immune to cold, and it can treat any difficult terrain that results from magical or mundane ice as normal terrain, such as the icy terrain of the Frozen Tears, realm of the kyton demagogue [Inkariax](faith/inkariax).",

			"**Perfect Freeze (Su)** A libitinarii can harness the power of absolute zero and impose it upon the body of a living creature with a touch. The libitinarii can use this ability three times per day as a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the libitinarii's touch attack is successful, the target takes 2d6 points of cold damage and 2d6 points of evil-aligned magic damage. A successful DC 23 Fortitude saving throw halves each type of damage. Additionally, creatures that fail this saving throw must immediately attempt a DC 23 Will saving throw. Failing this second saving throw means that a creature has been frozen solid and has become a supernaturally frozen, mindless, inert statue and is considered petrified, per [flesh to stone](spell/flesh_to_stone) (if the creature is not made of flesh, this secondary ability has no effect). The creature can't be turned back to flesh by casting [stone to flesh](spell/stone_to_flesh) spell, but it can be restored via casting [break enchantment](spell/break_enchantment). If the creature isn't returned to flesh after a number of hours equal to the creature's Hit Dice, the creature dies and remains a frozen statue. It can be returned to life normally by casting [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) or similar spells. This is a cold effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

They roam the Shadow Planes' frozen reaches seeking to further their craft. Most serve [Inkariax](faith/inkariax), the kyton demagogue known as the White Death, who seeks to preserve the fleetingness of perfection with his icy-fingered grasp. Indeed, the demagogue's favored servants almost entirely consist of libitinariis.",

In some cases, libitinariis pay homage to both unholy deities, for the two churches share more in common than not. Certainly Inkariax and his worshippers pay homage to the fell queen, and so many libitinariis consider deference to her a matter of course.",
			"",
			"Libitinariis' bodies seem humanoid, though their skin ranges in color from powder to navy blue. Their lips, ears, fingers, and toes are deep black, as if horribly frostbitten. Libitinariis often wear robes of draping chains, though most prominent on their persons are the horrific icicles that pierce their flesh. Although they are as adept at wielding traditional weapons as any humanoid, they typically favor using these icicles as thrown weapons.",
			"",
			"Libitinariis are roughly 5 feet tall and typically weight from 90 to 140 pounds.",
			"",
			"According to infernal lore, libitinariis sprang fully formed from the frozen reaches of the Shadow Plane the moment that Doloras freed the rest of their kind from Hell. Not all kytons or scholars agree on the impetus of this creation story-some believe that a frozen tear fell from Doloras's crown upon her shattering of the kytons' prison, reverberating throughout the planes to create these new servants to enact an aspect of her will. Regardless, libitinariis have since spread throughout the Shadow Plane, Hell, the Material Plane, the Dark Tapestry, and other locales to enact their vision of perfection through painful, frozen preservation.",
			"",
			"Libitinariis are farsighted, dispassionate, and coldly rational. Many live in the realm of Frozen Tears, where they may spend centuries simply formulating a plan to please the White Death and advance their standing in his unholy court by a mere inch. Other libitinariis attempt to carve out small niches in the frozen wastes of Cocytus in Hell. Those libitinarii who call the Material Plane home typically do so as leaders of cults of Doloras or Inkariax. Some, however, hide in plain sight among society, masquerading as normal-if unsavory- scholars and artisans while secretly working to torment, freeze, and preserve their enemies as fantastic trophies to their own wicked ingenuity.",

Most enjoy tormenting victims to the brink of death with their razor-sharp icicles several times before finally using their supernatural abilities to freeze the creatures permanently. Some work profane religious aspects into these rituals of torment, and others seek specifically to secure frozen prizes for the glory of their patrons. If the libitinariis have a weak point, it might be considered their predictability in pursuing habits cultivated over decades or centuries.",
			"",
			"An infamous libitinarii ritual is the Rite of Piercing, which is common practice in the realm of Frozen Tears. In this ritual, libitinariis drive foot-long nails of ice through the flesh of victims they have determined to be morally pure. When the victims reach the point of death, the kytons then freeze them into icy statues and arrange them into unholy menageries."

A target tripped by the phylacator's manacles is also entangled until it slips free of the manacles or breaks them. Manacles thrown by a phylacator automatically expand or contract to fit creatures of any size. As a move action, a phylacator can move a single set of manacles within 180 feet up to 30 feet in any direction, but if a creature is locked in the manacles, the phylacator must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against the creature to move it.

			"Phylacator kytons serve as jailers, torturers, and executioners in the most terrible prisons across the planes. Although a phylacator normally relies on its intimidating presence and booming voice to quell its charges, phylacators also enjoy violence and relish opportunities to quash riots. In combat, a phylacator knocks foes to the ground with its flail and pummels them into submission, relishing the painful feedback it receives when using its weapon. Against fleeing foes, a phylacator hurls manacles it magically animates, incapacitating its foes until it can recover them at it leisure. Since a phylacator is often responsible for keeping prisoners alive, it frequently uses nonlethal tactics-but that doesn't mean it is any less brutal or efficient in its methods.",
			"",
			"Although a phylacator normally wears armor and draped chains to cover its flesh, its skin is midnight blue in color and has the texture of rough-hewn stone.

As a reward for their service and intimate knowledge of prisons, phylacators were chosen to serve as wardens in Xovaikain, the prison realm where their revered deity, Zon-Kuthon, resides. For ages, the phylacators' vigilance in maintaining security has been absolute. Wherever phylacators serve, they maintain a thorough knowledge of all chambers and passages, every lock and bar, and the habits of each other warden and guard.",
			"",
			"Phylacators are deeply familiar with the sufferings mortal minds experience while imprisoned and are experts at provoking maddening desperation in even the most resigned prisoners. As a form of entertainment, a phylacator sometimes allows the most intelligent of its prisoners to think he has found a way to escape, such as by creating predictable patterns of guard shifts, instructing officials to seem to be susceptible to bribes, or appearing to overlook access points near supply routes. After letting a prisoner plan for weeks, months, or even years, those avenues are closed at the last minute to catch the prisoner in the act of escape, after which he is publicly tortured to serve as an example to others.",
			"",
			"As powerful as they are, phylacators have a significant vulnerability. Every night, a phylacator must remove its armor and sit in a torture device known as an iron chair to shed its blood in tribute to Zon-Kuthon. This device is a dull metal throne covered with hundreds of spikes all over the back, seat, and leg-rests. A phylacator usually keeps its iron throne in a secluded location, such as behind a trapped secret door, but some phylacators keep their iron thrones hidden in plain sight among other implements of torture.",

Phylacators are an exception; they bristle at being called kytons and insist that their kind be called velstracs instead. Failing to do so after a single instance of correction is sufficient to earn a phylacator's ire.",
			"",
			"A select few phylacators are bound to the Material Plane to serve as jailers for military prisons or other high-security detention facilities. A spellcaster can bound a phylacator only with powerful spells such as [planar ally, greater](spell/planar_ally,_greater) or [greater planar binding](spell/greater_planar_binding). A conjurer that knows a phylacator's proper name can promise the phylacator sanction over not less than 100 good or chaotic creatures and ownership of the corpses of prisoners executed under the phylacator's jurisdiction. If these criteria are met, a phylacator serves willingly and obediently for 1 year. A phylacator might serve longer for a larger prison population, or increasingly sadistic authority over the prisoners.",
			"",
			"Most phylacators on Golarion serve evil dictators or wicked cults, although a few secretly serve less despicable benefactors who use the outsiders to keep dangerous criminals securely locked away. For instance, many Nidalese know of phylacators serving in Pangolais, but rumors that taxmasters of Abadar employ a phylacator in a secret correctional installation beneath Oppara are stridently denied by the church."

When suffragans deign to take on humanoid forms, they seem to have forgotten how to move in that form, walking with painfully twisted torsos or in a disturbing crouch. Other kytons often find suffragans' zealous dedication to Zon-Kuthon off-putting and prefer to assign them to minor tasks or other busywork to keep them occupied and out of the way. Suffragans tend to take great pride in these tasks, no matter how menial, believing they are loyally serving more powerful or devout kytons.",
			"",
			"Suffragans often serve as torturers or jailors and take a particular, sadistic glee in the pain they inflict upon mortal victims. Generally, kytons utilize torture now as an end to itself, but rather as a gateway to a perverse form of enlightenment or as a debasing method of dominance. Suffragans blur this line, however. They are among the cruelest pain inflictors and the most zealous Kuthite servants among their kind. They believe that their own bodily transformations-as well as the excruciating pain they have endured and continue to suffer-are the purest and most powerful method of worshiping the Midnight Lord. Thus, they seek to perpetuate this evil obeisance through inflicting what they refer to as the blessings of Zon-Kuthon upon any who fall into their grasp.",

			"As suffragans switch easily and naturally between their configurations, they are often quite comfortable with other creatures that have malleable forms. Suffragans particularly like oozes, keeping them as pampered pets when possible and feeding them cast-off bits of flesh or the remains of their victims. Suffragans find doppelgangers and faceless stalkers intriguing, and such captives might earn an opportunity to escape by promising an entertaining display of shape-shifting."

			"Lamhigyns are simple pests that emerged from the chaotic fabric of the Abyss. They poison their prey until it falls into a coma, and then they slowly tear it apart, piece by piece, with their rasping mouths. Lamhigyns view intruders on their territory with disdain, and their stings have left many adventurers insane and debilitated, opportune victims for the Abyss's insatiable predators. Though lamhigyns might not appear frightening on their own, greater terrors sometimes follow in their wakes, hoping for easy meals.",
			"",
			"Lamhigyns are strange-looking creatures often characterized by mortals visiting the Abyss as overgrown, flying tadpoles with bat wings and stinger-tipped tails. They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near rifts to their home plane. Their bulbous, unblinking eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the last things unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are fond of wrapping their wings around their victims' heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick tongues that flick about in the presence of prey.",
			"",
			"Lamhigyns have thick, scaly skin ranging in color from red to green. Though lamhigyns are typically encountered flying, on the ground they stand on four insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high, 8-pound bodies are impressive sights when hurtling through the air at their victims.",
			"",
			"When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be quite volatile. In general, they tend to get along with other lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off. When this happens, lamhigyns unleash the full force of their chaotic fury on each other, stinging and grappling until only one-or sometimes none-of the bizarre creatures remain.",
			"",
			"When they're not fighting among themselves, lamhigyns live together in noisy, flapping hives, waiting for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. When it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously terrified reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love more than injecting their mind-numbing toxin into terrified victims while they ineffectually scream and flail. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown bored. Sometimes, however, a particularly large hive of lamhigyns will attempt to bring down large, imposing creatures simply for the challenge of it."

			"",
			"These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors. Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts, but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect.",
			"",
			"Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate prey both small and large. In the extreme mountainous areas they inhabit, such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountain aurochs, and even the occasional mountaineer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals dead and rotting.",
			"",
			"Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of desolate mountain ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or \"gluttonies.\" They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to many mountainous regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters strive to remain well out of sight of landbound races, which they mistrust and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again."

Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome any differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings, they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping to defeat evil.",

A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and weigh approximately 900 pounds."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Twisted in mind and form, lamp blighters have been corrupted by their own hatred for civilization and its encroachment upon lands that were once wild. Named for their practice of darkening lamps to draw victims close and also their love of ripping out eyes with their vicious claws, they take out this hatred upon inhabitants of border villages and towns, amplifying fear of the dark in the places they bedevil.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters stand 2 feet tall fully when upright, though they are usually hunched over and flying at eye level of their victims, and they weigh about 20 pounds.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters were once pixies who chose to remain in their ancestral lands in the face of civilization's relentless expansion. Embittered and resentful of what they saw as an attack upon their way of life, these fey developed malice and anger that transformed their bodies: their bright colors faded, their teeth and claws elongated and sharpened, and their minds turned to vengeance. To those who study these creatures, such as scholars of the Sincomakti School of Sciences in Rozenport, lamp blighters are evidence of the pliant nature of the fey and how they can be shaped by both their environment and their personalities. Some such researchers go so far as to theorize that lamp blighters have internalized the corruption and change of certain declining civilized societies, a transformation that mirrors the physical and mental shift from pixie to lamp blighter.",
			"",
			"Tales of lamp blighters are rare near well-established communities with a strong military presence, though should a once-prosperous settlement start to allow its defenses to weaken and nature to reclaim disused districts, lamp blighters have been known to become bolder and bolder as they work to remove the longstanding source of their anger. In particular, lamp blighters frequently haunt the southern edges of the Verduran Forest, where entire towns have been abandoned thanks to their efforts.",
			"",
			"In a lamp blighter's mind, nothing symbolizes the crushing pressure of civilization like fixed points of light. The stars glittering in the heavens, the glowing pulse of a firefly, and even forest fires brought about by lightning strikes-these are all in motion in accordance with some natural order. Torches fitted to walls, posts with continual flame cast upon them, and hanging lanterns, however, represent to lamp blighters the contrived attempts of civilization to control nature and to bring the assumed safety of light to all places at all times. By their own twisted logic, lamp blighters believe that by terrifying their enemies by extinguishing their lights and plucking out their eyes, they give their victims just what they think they desire: a world of perfect, orderly nothingness.",
			"",
			"While they prefer to spend much of their time invisible, a favorite tactic of a lamp blighter is to become visible, use [disguise self](spell/disguise_self) to take the form of a pixie, and then shyly introduce itself to a town's residents. After it manages to build trust with these residents over the course of days or even weeks, the lamp blighter viciously turns on them, attacking when they least expect it, like a friendly dog suddenly turned feral. Brutal attacks like these are often preceded by what appears at first to be simple accidents. Those near one of these subtle infestations notice streetlights snuffed and entire streets thrown into darkness at inopportune times, often leading to accidents such as cart crashes and falls down steps.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters prefer to live in wild areas just outside of frontier villages and towns, but they spend much of their time within those same villages and towns, working to spread fear. They build nests in hollow trees, decorating them with the eyes of the creatures they have attacked.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters are usually solitary, driven as they are by immediate desires to harm and terrify rather than establishing any long-term communities of their own. Occasionally a lamp blighter with a particularly strong will takes command of a group of gremlins, but those arrangements usually result in general mayhem rather than focused effort. Bogeymen sometimes partner for short periods with lamp blighters, though the more brazen and direct approach of the lamp blighter means a bogeyman often uses the corrupted creature as cover and distraction for its own activities.",
			"",
			"For their part, pixies look upon lamp blighters with a mixture of nervousness and pity: they worry that what has happened to their former kin could happen to them, but they also have deep compassion for their lost cousins. Although individually less powerful and dangerous than lamp blighters, pixies are rumored to sometimes organize raiding parties and set out to capture lamp blighters, restraining them as they attempt to turn them away from evil. Whether any lamp blighter has ever been redeemed in this way-or any other-is unknown."

For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.",
			"",
			"**Suggestion (Sp)** A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Sometimes referred to as \"watchsouls,\" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.",
			"",
			"Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.",
			"",
			"### Summoning a Lar",
			"",
			"A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create. Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method.",
			"",
			"Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal.",
			"",
			"When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do."

			"Larabays are capricious fey creatures that gravitate toward coastal regions with warm and temperate islands. They are especially fond of toying with sailors and fishermen, playing pranks aboard ships or in seaside towns by assuming various shapes and using their otherworldly powers of mischief. A larabay's idea of fun can quickly become quite serious, however, when its love of trickery begins to outweigh its sympathy for humanity, and a larabay's well-executed joke may result in a potentially fatal situation for those involved. In their never-ending pursuit of a good laugh, larabays have been known to employ their supernatural illusions to draw ships and their crews into precarious situations such as hazardous waters or hidden shoals, and the depredations of a larabay are often only realized after it's too late. On land, larabays entice their unknowing dupes off cliffs' edges, through monster lairs, or into hidden ravines or pools of quicksand.",
			"",
			"Larabays use their shapechanging abilities to craft intricate webs of social intrigue, though such schemes are always concocted in an effort simply to conduct a masterful hoax, usually resulting in the devastation or heartbreak of one or more of the parties involved rather than any concrete gains on the fey's part. While larabays have been known to inadvertently perform acts of good in the process of gulling cruel-hearted individuals, their unpredictable and precarious natures make them difficult allies, and one can never be sure just how long a larabay will remain faithful to a particular cause before getting bored or whether its companions are simply its latest victims."

			"At the heart of the Dark Tapestry lies Azathoth, a shapeless entity the size of a star, imbued with immense chaotic and destructive power. The members of Azathoth's court orbit it like planets, exalting in the babbling nonsense the blind idiot god issues into the void and singing songs of exquisite madness to their lord. The least of this celestial choir are the larvae of the Outer Gods, shed from Azathoth as a body sheds skin cells. They conjure instruments from the ether, such as pipes and flutes, with which to serenade their progenitor as they mature into gods of the void.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods are constantly shifting in form, but average 10 feet in diameter and weigh 1,600 pounds.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods are born as minuscule specks of matter sloughed off by the ever-changing bulk of Azathoth. These motes of flesh drift through space, caught in the gravitational gyrations of the idiot god, soaking up cosmic radiation and the songs of their kin. Eventually, the motes grow and coalesce into beings of chaos: larvae of the Outer Gods. Once they are large enough to move of their own volition, the larvae begin to whirl and dance in their orbits around the Primal Chaos, compelled by incomprehensible forces to join the cosmic song and dance.",
			"",
			"It is not known where the larvae of the Outer Gods create or steal their instruments. Though strange in appearance, these pipes and flutes are utterly mundane in both function and composition. However, in the hands of the larvae, they become terrible tools of chaos.",
			"",
			"When a larva plays an instrument, it does not merely create sounds. Instead, it warps the fabric of space, creating waves in reality. This allows the larvae to serenade their god even in the midst of an absolute vacuum. This dominion over space enables the larvae to conjure creatures from the planes, block dimensional travel, and transport themselves unfathomable distances in an instant.",
			"",
			"Though some do eat, most larvae of the Outer Gods subsist on cosmic radiation, allowing them to travel for weeks or months across interstellar voids without dying of hunger or thirst. Over time, exposure to the cosmic winds causes them to swell and mutate, growing even more powerful. The oldest of these larvae eventually mature into colossal beings as powerful as demigods. These beings return to orbit Azathoth and refine their songs. Rumor has it that some eventually reach the next stage of their life cycle, absorbing countless other larvae to become planet-sized gods unto themselves.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once a larva of the Outer Gods has reached maturity, it is not compelled to stay in the court of Azathoth. Indeed, all have the ability and many have the inclination to explore the Dark Tapestry and the worlds beyond. Larvae of the Outer Gods drift among the stars on unseen currents, or fly through space following songs only they can hear. This often brings them into contact-and conflict-with mortal beings.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods bear no ill will toward such creatures, but their presence is often ruinous to mortal forms. Larvae do not understand the concept of mortality, nor can they imagine that a being would not want to be freed from the confinement of a static, unchanging body. Worlds visited by larvae of the Outer Gods thus come to see them as monsters-horrifying emissaries of destruction that spread chaos and fear wherever they roam.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods are particularly fascinated by any talented mortal bards and musicians that they encounter, particularly those who are touched by chaos or the Dark Tapestry. They pursue such players across time and space, much to the musicians' chagrin. These infatuations almost always end with either the larva's destruction, or with the musician succumbing to the larva's song. Some believe that larvae can even transform mortal musicians into fellow larvae of the Outer Gods, and that larvae scour distant worlds seeking to recruit new voices for Azathoth's court.",
			"",
			"Foolish mortals sometimes call upon the larvae of the Outer Gods for aid, summoning them to the realms of men in order to strike down some mortal enemy or share the forbidden secrets of Azathoth. While larvae are not opposed to serving such mortals, they also care little for what effect their songs have on mortal flesh. Those who conjure a larva of the Outer Gods are just as likely to fall victim to its maddening song as those they hoped to smite, and those who seek the secrets of the cosmos often learn them at the cost of their corporeal forms. Even when summoners take steps to protect themselves from unwelcome transformations, they find that the larvae of the Outer Gods approach tasks with an unfocused dreaminess that makes them terrible servants."

			"Because of their strange means of reproduction, lava children have branched out over the generations into a number of distinct variations. Below are some of the most common.",
			"",
			"Chieftains (+1 CR): The most important of all lava children variants are the chieftains, those exceptional lava children who employ magic and rhetoric to inspire or browbeat their cystmates into obedience. Lava children chieftains are visually indistinguishable from ordinary lava children, but often bear several innate magical abilities passed down from parent to offspring in what the chieftains (sometimes referred to as priests, though not necessarily affiliated with a deity) claim are a physical manifestation of their right to lead. Divine right or otherwise, lava children chieftains are most likely to lead from the rear, using their lava channel ability to heal lava children and other elemental creatures commanded into their service, while simultaneously unleashing their spell-like abilities to defend their cysts or make war upon those who fail to show proper deference. For reasons not entirely understood, lava children chieftains are much longer-lived than ordinary lava children, with a lifespan similar to that of dwarves. Lava children chieftains have the advanced creature template and the following abilities:",
			"",
			"Spell-Like Abilities (CL 5th; concentration +7): At will-faerie fire 3/day-pyrotechnics (DC 15), stone shape 1/day-contact other plane (earth or fire elemental plane only), summon nature's ally III (creatures with earth or fire subtype only)",
			"",
			"Lava Channel (Su): Three times per day, a lava child chieftain can channel volcanic energy to produce an explosion of molten rock, which functions like the channel positive energy ability of a cleric, except that it heals 3d6 points of damage for creatures with the earth or fire subtypes and does 3d6 points of fire damage to all others.",
			"",
			"Lava Form (Su): A lava child chieftain can shift between its solid body and one made of molten rock as a standard action. In lava form, the chieftain gains the elemental subtype, and its claw attacks add +1d6 fire damage. Any creature grappling or striking the lava form with natural weapons or natural attacks takes 1d6 points of fire damage. It can remain in this form for up to 5 minutes per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"Behemoth (+1 CR): This rare caste of warrior lava children was designed by its creators for espionage missions into especially dangerous regions. Though most behemoths succumbed to the high mortality rate that came with following their creators' orders, a few managed to survive and breed. Lava children behemoths have the giant creature template and Improved Bull Rush as a bonus feat. They gain the following special attack.",
			"",
			"Tremor (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a lava child behemoth can slam its fists to the ground to create an earth tremor. The behemoth makes a trip attempt against all adjacent creatures. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the behemoth is not at risk of being knocked prone. Multiple behemoths can cooperate to affect a larger area; as long as each behemoth uses this ability at the same time and is adjacent to at least one other behemoth using this ability, the affected area increases by 5 feet in all directions.",
			"",
			"Youths and Ancients (-1 CR): While mature lava children are Medium-sized, they are smaller at both the beginning and the end oflife. Newborn lava children are already the size of halflings, and grow quickly to full size within 6 years. At the opposite end oflife, the venerable lava children past 70 years of age lose their strength and mass as their bodies slowly wither. Both youths and ancients use the young creature simple template; the latter also apply venerable age modifiers."

			"Territorial swimmers through the molten veins that crisscross the hottest depths of mortal worlds and the Elemental Plane of Earth, lava lurkers claim active magma flows and the fiery lakes within smoldering volcanoes as their homes. Most are content to stay within such burning depths, threatening only those foolish enough to wander close to such obviously deadly natural hazards. But occasionally, during volcanic eruptions or other explosive geological events, lava lurkers are forced from their comfortable homes, becoming unwilling riders on blazing rapids. While these disasters rarely threaten lava lurkers' elemental forms, they do often force the creatures into-or worse, strand them in-areas they find uncomfortably cool.",
			"",
			"Dull-witted lava lurkers eagerly sow fires and throw magma as they wander semi-aimlessly, doing what they can to create more comfortable surroundings or seeking other nearby warm places-like furnaces or bonfires-as they try to find their way back to active volcanic flows. They care little for non-elemental creatures, being baffled and annoyed by the shrill noises such creatures make when they're exposed to even the slightest fleck of molten rock.",
			"",
			"Though lava lurkers live in earth and flame, they die with a chilling inward gasp. If slain, the final surge of a lava lurker's animating fires consumes the nearby air, creating a momentary vacuum that extinguishes surrounding flames. This instantly transforms a lava lurker's body into a perfectly cool hunk of rock and often quells lesser flames nearby, if only temporarily."

Removing an implanted seed requires a successful DC 20 Heal check (a full-round action); each attempt deals 1 hit point of damage.

			"",
			"Leaf rays begin their lives as buds in the tops of deciduous trees, and form a symbiotic relationship with these trees, often leaving the husks of their victims under their host trees to decay and fertilize the soil. During its budding stage, a leaf ray spends its time flexing its body in reaction to blowing winds in order to prepare itself for flight. Once a leaf ray has matured, it can separate its stingerlike stem from the parent tree and soar through the air. A leaf ray measures 3 feet across and weighs only 2 pounds.",

			"",
			"Winter: A leaf ray in the winter turns a dull range of browns and grays, and its poison deals Constitution damage instead of Dexterity damage. Because of this, few leaf rays are successful in implanting their seeds during this season."

They often steal something of worth from adventurers just to provoke a chase. Using their ability to disappear at will to its full potential, they wait until their victims appear to be about to give up the chase before reappearing once more to let the chase resume. They are not greedy creatures, and eventually drop what they've stolen, slipping away while their angry pursuers claim the lost property. The exception is gold-leprechauns love gold and often hoard it in secret, hidden places. It is rumored that a person who finds a gold coin in the forest and returns it to the leprechaun that dropped it will be granted a wish as a reward. Unfortunately, these rumors are false-likely perpetuated by the leprechauns themselves in order to trick others into bringing them gold.",

Credulous to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets.",

If consumed as a standard action, this air cyst grants water breathing (as the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed leshys can have a maximum of four usable air cysts at any one time, and air cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours.",

			"Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwater plant life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy.",
			"",
			"Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair of large clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any other creature.",
			"",
			"Patient and thoughtful by inclination (save for matters associated with those silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the river. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring.",
			"",
			"### Growing a Seaweed Leshy",

Leucrottas consume their prey gear and all; they vomit up what they cannot digest and pick through the debris in search of valuable items that might help them lure in prey.",

They refuse to let themselves be used as beasts of burden, but sometimes allow favored gnoll companions to ride them into battle as steeds. The leucrotta in a gnoll pack generally thinks of itself as the leader of that group, and treats any established gnoll chieftain poorly in an attempt to goad that gnoll into attacking it.

Leucrottas view crocottas with disdain and even shame, but it's not unusual to find these large hyena-like beasts in close proximity to a leucrotta pack. Crocottas are popular attractions in traveling carnivals, where unscrupulous con artists bill them as cursed humanoids or animals."

			"**Dimensional Vortex (Su)** When Leviathan strikes a creature with its tail slap, the overwhelming blow tears at the underlying structure of reality. Leviathan can use its plane shift spell-like ability on creatures so struck as a free action; these uses of plane shift do not count against the daily limit of the spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Disjoining Bite (Su)** When Leviathan bites a creature, its jaws attempt to destroy magical effects in place on the target. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or all spell effects in place on it are immediately destroyed (as per dispel magic). Leviathan can disjoin an existing spell effect by biting it, although doing so exposes Leviathan to the spell's effect as it bites. Likewise, Leviathan can attempt to disjoin a magic item by biting it. On a hit, the item must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or be permanently destroyed-note that even if the disjunction doesn't destroy the item, the damage dealt by Leviathan's bite might be sufficient to destroy the item. Leviathan's disjoining bite cannot destroy artifacts. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Eye Beams (Su)** As a standard action, Leviathan can fire prismatic beams of rippling light from its hundred eyes out to a range of 1,000 feet. While Leviathan cannot target a single creature with more than one eye beam at a time, it can split its 100 beams any way it wants against visible targets in range. When Leviathan attacks with its eye beams, it must make a ranged touch attack with a +37 bonus to hit a target. On a hit, a creature must succeed at a DC 37 Will save or its mind is emptied, becoming affected as if by feeblemind, and its thoughts are drawn into Leviathan's own mind. As long as Leviathan is active, this effect can be removed only via miracle or wish; if Leviathan is defeated and forced into its comatose state (see Recovery below), the feeblemind effect can be cured as normal. Once a creature succeeds at a save against Leviathan's eye beams, it is immune to the eye beams for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Flight (Su)** Leviathan's ability to \"swim\" through the air is treated as a supernatural form of flight.",
			"",
			"**Hurl Foe (Ex)** When Leviathan damages a Huge or smaller foe with one of its natural attacks, it can attempt a combat maneuver check to hurl the foe as part of that attack. On a successful check, the foe is knocked back 10 feet in a direction of Leviathan's choice and falls prone. The distance the foe is hurled increases by 10 feet for every 5 points by which Leviathan's check result exceeds the foe's CMD. If an obstacle stops the hurled creature before it travels the whole distance, the hurled foe and the obstacle struck each take 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of distance remaining, and the foe is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.",
			"",
			"**Inhalation (Ex)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Leviathan can inhale a massive amount of water, affecting an 80-foot-long cone. Huge or smaller creatures within this area of effect must each succeed at a DC 44 Reflex save to avoid being drawn into Leviathan's maw and automatically swallowed whole. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Labyrinthine Innards (Su)** Creatures swallowed by Leviathan find themselves separated from all other swallowed creatures in a twisting maze of passages within the Tane's digestive system. A swallowed creature can move freely through this fleshy maze and takes no damage from being swallowed, but it can't damage Leviathan from within if it attempts to escape. Instead, swallowed creatures must find an exit via one of the monster's hundred tear ducts by succeeding at a DC 20 Intelligence check as a full-round action, similar to maze. Teleportation effects do not function inside of Leviathan.",
			"",
			"**Massive (Ex)** Because Leviathan is so massive, it treats terrain features that form difficult terrain as normal terrain, though immense features like cities or forests still function as difficult terrain for the monster. A Huge or smaller creature can move through squares occupied by Leviathan and vice versa. Leviathan can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Leviathan gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It is possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Leviathan-this requires a successful DC 30 Climb check, and unlike the normal rules regarding Leviathan and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs Leviathan's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.",
			"",
			"**Pierce Immunities (Ex)** Leviathan ignores all forms of damage reduction when it attacks a foe with its natural weapons, including DR/epic and DR/-.",
			"",
			"**Planar Acclimation (Ex)** Leviathan is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype.",
			"",
			"**Recovery (Ex)** At the end of its turn, Leviathan can automatically shake off any one adverse condition other than dead. If it is affected by multiple adverse conditions, it chooses which one to end that round. Should Leviathan be slain, it is instead transported across time and space to a hidden spot in the First World's oceans at a point 1d100 years in the future, fully recovered but immobile. Leviathan awakens a century after the date of its \"death,\" but if its immobile body is discovered before it wakes from this deathlike state, it can be killed forever.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The mighty Leviathan is the most powerful of the Tane, a group of destructive servitors of the Eldest. Left to its own devices, Leviathan remains in a slumber lasting for millennia or spends its waking time singing in the vast deeps of the First World's oceans. But the Eldest's planar upheavals, whims, or the ill-advised aggression of fools can arouse Leviathan as a weapon of devastation. Once awakened, Leviathan leaves cities and even entire nations destroyed in its planar wake, though it preserves the thoughts and memories of many of the fallen within its own mind, composing elegies to the lost. Some lucky few are spared Leviathan's wrath by gaining refuge within Zanziveil, the City of the Spared, a resplendent city of refugees ruled by a mysterious masked woman named Zizipal. Zanziveil itself exists in a strange demiplane accessible only via Leviathan's labyrinthine entrails, and many believe that Zizipal is a manifestation of Leviathan's remorse and curiosity.",
			"",
			"Over the eons, Leviathan has visited countless Material Plane worlds. Although often little remains physically of those Leviathan destroys, tales of the gargantuan creature's visits have a way of enduring in a society's oral history. As a result, many otherwise unconnected worlds share curiously similar mythologies of ancient cities or civilizations being destroyed by the legendary creature.",

None of them ever returned or sent word of their success, and when a second flotilla of Brethedans set out to learn what had become of their kin, they found only the colonists' feral descendants. These \"dreamers\" had become intimately attuned to Liavara's dense network of ley lines, which lulled them into a persistent meditative trance. The few taken back to Bretheda, however, have proven that the dreamers can attune to any planet's ley lines. Anyone who attempts to make mental contact with them may find himself lulled into the same trance the dreamers experience. For the most part, the dreamers seem content merely to drift along the ley lines, but awakening them from the lines' peaceful melodies spurs most dreamers into violent furies. Brethedans as a whole have treated their cousins respectfully-almost reverently-granting them ample space in which to meander and feed."

As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life.

Absent the vitality of the soul, such a lich's physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the lich's skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the lich's remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the lich's intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the lich's will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than any steel. The lich's greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the lich's eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from any defiling its final rest.",

Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich's possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich's slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its wail of the banshee before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough flee.",
			"",
			"### Becoming a Demilich",
			"",
			"Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a demilich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the lich's body decays, the lich's intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the lich's consciousness, keeping the lich trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the lich's remains are destroyed or scattered (for example, by wandering adventurers), the lich's phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the lich to life. But if the lich's remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery's magic fails catastrophically, releasing the lich's soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the lich, allowing the last remnants of the lich's soul to transform it into a demilich. The lich's soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever.",
			"",
			"For wandering liches, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the lich spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the lich's body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the lich tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the lich's phylactery fail before the wandering lich returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the lich's mind is doomed to wander until the end of days.",

Such creatures are awakened demiliches, and combine the powers and near-invulnerability of a demilich with the mind and spellcasting prowess of a lich. An awakened demilich has the full spellcasting abilities of the lich it was before, and gains Eschew Materials and Still Spell as bonus feats. Awakened liches keep their original lich Hit Dice, and any mental attributes that are higher than the demilich's minimums. They otherwise have all the special abilities and defenses of a demilich except torpor, and no abilities of the original lich beyond spellcasting and mental attributes. An awakened demilich has a CR of 16, or the CR of the original lich + 3, whichever is higher."

			"The means of attaining lichdom are extremely personal for mortal spellcasters, fraught with misinformation and peril. The smallest miscalculation in the potion of lichdom's formula or most minute flaw in one's phylactery can interrupt the process that infuses one's mortal soul with overwhelming arcane and negative energies. Other times, an inexperienced wizard attempts the transformation, or erroneously consumes a formula produced for another spellcaster, instantly dying from the backlash of potent forces or condemning himself to a terminal but far more terrible end.",
			"",
			"In these sorrowful cases, the process traps the soul of the would-be lich outside a phylactery that will not accept it and a body that has rejected it. The potent arcane forces tampered with by the lich's failed creation also find themselves unleashed but uncontrolled, surrounding the newly formed abomination, empowering it but also slowly consuming its essence.",
			"",
			"This creature, known as a forsaken lich, is granted the undeath it sought in life, but in a terrifyingly temporary fashion. For the miscalculations of its ambitions, the creature's once-vibrant body shrivels and decays like that of a lich, but becomes a lifeless shell manipulated by the malicious soul and unchecked magical storm that envelop it, forces that control the corpse's actions almost like a marionette. Yet this doom is temporary for nearly all who attempt this foul transition. With the soul unbound from the body and both spirit and corpse exposed to destructive arcane tides, both are slowly eroded. After 1d10 days, the forsaken lich's body and soul are both consumed like a lit candle, eventually reduced physically to ashes, and spiritually to nothing-its essence utterly annihilated, scoured from existence for all time."

An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so. These limitations are purely psychological, and if pressed (such as by an enemy seeking to use a tomb entrance as a defense), a cairn linnorm can break such restrictions.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"So named for a northern word for \"river,\" a gare linnorm's body resembles that of a gigantic serpent, save for two muscular forelimbs. The creature's head is long and angular, with crests that it uses to break through ice in its never-ending search for food. A gare linnorm's hide is a dull gray color akin to tarnished silver, with a slightly paler underbelly. Unlike many linnorms, a gare linnorm has a smooth hide, allowing it to slip easily through water and ice holes.",
			"",
			"A gare linnorm can grow as long as 60 feet, typically weighs 11,000 pounds, and can live for over 1,000 years.",
			"",
			"Little can compare to the power and efficiency of a gare linnorm in the regions where these beasts dwell. Like all linnorms, gare linnorms are relatively unintelligent compared with their chromatic and metallic cousins, but what these beasts lack in intelligence and spellcasting ability they make up for in brute strength, savage fury, and dangerous cunning. Despite dwelling in water, gare linnorms have an innate ability to raise their body temperature so dramatically that the creatures are immune to even the hottest flames. Gare linnorms use this ability to keep warm when hunting through rivers and waterways buried beneath feet of ice, which the creature can come bursting through with surprising speed and force when it detects prey above. A gare linnorm's breath weapon is similarly linked to this internal fire. Small gill-like vents along the creature's serpentine body pass water through the dragon, which is heated to extreme temperatures en route to the linnorm's mouth. The gare linnorm then expels the water through a series of muscular chambers that turn the water into a gout of steam hot enough to scald flesh and warp armor. The difference in temperature between the inside of the linnorm's mouth and the cold air of its homelands causes the steam to condense into a massive cloud of vapor that persists afterward and, because of the linnorm's magical nature, achieves an almost solid state, hampering movement throughout its area.",
			"",
			"In addition to its deadly breath weapon, a gare linnorm's fangs are infused with potent venom. A creature bitten by the dragon is bathed in an eerie blue-white aura that burns like the hottest alchemist's fire. Meanwhile the poison attacks the nervous system with debilitating pain, gradually slowing the target's reflexes and motor functions until total paralysis sets in.",
			"",
			"Gare linnorms prefer to hunt large prey, as fish and other small underwater creatures don't provide enough food to sate their enormous appetites. As a result, gare linnorms hunt not just larger, land-bound creatures like elk or moose, but even large predatory animals like brown bears and dire wolves when such creatures come to the water's edge to drink or cross. When hunting, a gare linnorm attempt to attack with surprise as it breaks through ice or emerges from the water. It bites first to poison its prey, then strikes with its tail, using its massive coils to crush its prey or drag it into the water, where any creature affected by the linnorm's poison soon drowns as the venom takes hold. Hunters and sages who have witnessed gare linnorms feeding recount stories of these monsters taking on entire herds of mammoths or woolly rhinos, often crushing one animal in its coils and goring another while others burn within the dragon's steaming breath. After feeding, gare linnorms retreat to their riverbed dens to sleep, often for days at a time.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Linnorm(monster/family:linnorm)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Gare linnorms are always solitary. Their immense appetites and brutal tempers make most habitats strain to support even one, and a gare linnorm's territory can encompass a labyrinth of rivers and inlets exceeding 1,000 square miles. Males and females do not even join for reproduction. Instead, after a short period of voracious hunting and gorging, a female gare linnorm travels to the fringes of her territory to find a deeply frozen lake or section of river. The female then uses her breath weapon to melt a portion of the ice before laying a single egg and letting it float to the underside of the ice, still far beneath the surface. Next, the female stands guard until the water refreezes, encasing and protecting her egg, before returning to the heart of her territory. Any passing male can sense the egg, even within its icy shell, and uses his breath to free and fertilize it, after which he carries the fertilized egg beyond his own territory and deposits it deep in the mud and silt of a riverbed. The egg gestates for 6 months before hatching. A hatchling gare linnorm is the size of an adult crocodile and survives on fish and birds for the first few months. Growth is rapid, with the linnorm reaching half its adult length within 2 years, when it begins to hunt larger land creatures, its breath weapon and venom now at full potency. Reproductive maturity is achieved after the first century, with females producing an egg just once every century.",
			"",
			"Despite their fearsome reputations, gare linnorms are sometimes hunted by the brave or the foolhardy. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, would-be kings who kill a gare linnorm are afforded extra prestige, as such combat often requires fighting the beast both on land and on or beneath the surface of the water. Frost giants are also known to hunt gare linnorms, but invariably target hatchlings or the very young, raising the captive dragons as powerful sentries and loyal companions that are often more dangerous than the giant's entire clan."

The innate bioelectrical energy of creatures struck by the breath weapon further empower the attack, creating additional discharges that arc off the breath weapon's naturally straight trajectory toward the nearest living creature. When the linnorm uses this attack to hunt larger underwater creatures, the subsequent discharges quickly overwhelm entire schools of fish for the sea linnorm to devour.",

This primordial wildlife is of such size that a waking sea linnorm rarely concerns itself with having to roam far for a fulfilling meal. After eating, a sea linnorm hibernates for years, or even centuries, at a time. In some instances, entire aquatic settlements spring to life near the hidden lair of a sea linnorm, only to incur the beast's excessive wrath when it awakens from its slumber. Some of these unfortunately placed settlements even adjust their entire societies to provide for \"their\" linnorms, shepherding schools of fish toward the beasts' lairs and, in harder times, encouraging visitors to visit the linnorms' dens.",

Those few settlements permitted to exist within a sea linnorm's domain are used as early warning systems; each settlement is seeded with traditions of alerting the great linnorm to the presence of potentially threatening outsiders or of certain types of aquatic alphapredator life-forms, such as krakens, luscas, or sea serpents. A sea linnorm immediately seeks out intruders, recognizing that it will either triumph or die-better to be slain fighting in the open water than cornered in its lair.",

As the king crossed the Arcadian Ocean on his way to the mystical paradise of Valenhall, Fahrstad is said to have leapt without uttering a word from the side of his longship into the depths of the ocean. For 3 days and 3 nights, his entourage waited. On daybreak of the fourth day, Elgar Fahrstad emerged from the sea, accompanied by a ride of eight valkyries and the severed head of a sea linnorm. A half-dozen skalds departed the expedition, forsaking the paradise of Valenhall so they could return to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and retell the final journey of King Fahrstad."

When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs.

			"",
			"Because litanus are created from merfolk subjected to horrifying tortures and necromantic infusions, they generally arise in underwater torture chambers or corpse pits. Although they have no need to hunt for sustenance, they derive a perverse joy from ambushing, paralyzing, and killing prey. Most litanus prefer to hunt intelligent prey, as complex feelings of isolation and desperation resonate with the undead creatures. Angry at their fate and resentful that their kin were spared it, litanus prefer merfolk as prey over all others. A hunting litanu might even allow non-merfolk to pass by unharmed if it believes that a little more patience might allow it an opportunity for merfolk prey instead.",
			"",
			"Litanus are immensely strong for their size, and their long, toothed tentacles are exceedingly nimble. These tentacles are grafted to a litanu's body in the final part of the reanimation ritual, rather than spontaneously grown. Litanus are protective of their tentacles, taking care to keep them clean and prevent them from becoming tangled together as the undead swim or fight.",
			"",
			"Despite their strength, litanus are reluctant to attack humanoids that are traveling in packs, preferring to use traps or trickery to scatter groups so they can attack the isolated individuals one by one. If given time to prepare, a litanu might set a harmless trap that triggers a large spray of mud, sand, or another material that temporarily obscures visibility in the water. When the trap is triggered and the members of the group are disoriented and blinded, the litanu sneaks forward, paralyzes the nearest target, and swims away while its victim is incapacitated. To draw a single target away from a group or community, a litanu might stake down a small sea creature into the seabed and wound it sufficiently so that it cries out in pain. The litanu hides nearby, ready to ambush an individual that comes to aid the suffering creature. Not all litanu tricks are so complex; some litanus simply lurk out of sight and make quiet rhythmic tapping sounds to draw the more curious members of a group to investigate, slipping away if too many come to investigate together.",
			"",
			"Although any isolated creature suffering from fear or loneliness is a delicacy for a litanu, most litanus attempt to exacerbate feelings of dread and isolation as much as possible before feeding. A litanu might drag a victim into the deep, dark ocean waters-not so deep as to kill their prey outright from cold or water pressure, but deep enough to amplify the victim's fear and suffering. When the victim's feelings of terror and isolation are at their peak, the litanu finally kills its prey with slow, deliberate bites from its tentacles.",
			"",
			"Once a litanu slays its victim, it usually loses interest in the corpse. The litanu might steal any valuables or trinkets from the body but otherwise leaves it to drift away on the ocean currents. A litanu does not value this plunder for its own sake, but it collects items, such as shiny necklaces or colorful baubles, that might be useful in luring away future victims.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Litanus live underwater and prefer the seclusion of dark ocean waters. Unaffected by cold or water pressure, they can be found in deep ocean trenches. From there, they range into brighter, shallower waters to hunt for prey. If a litanu's prey escapes onto land, the litanu is unlikely to pursue; although litanus can propel themselves on land by using their tails and tentacles if necessary, they prefer to remain in the water.",
			"",
			"To merfolk, litanus are terrifying bogeymen that lurk in the deep, set traps to catch the unwary, and drag their victims away. Fortunately, litanus are rare, so most merfolk have never seen one; some merfolk believe that they don't even exist, and were invented to explain away strange disappearances or half-glimpsed natural predators such as octopuses. Those merfolk who have met a litanu (or worse, have been terrorized by a litanu that arose from the corpse of a friend or relative) know firsthand the fear and carnage even a single litanu can create.",
			"",
			"Litanus are sufficiently rare as to normally be solitary; a litanu might hunt for decades without meeting another of its kind. On the rare occasions when litanus do find each other-or when they are created alongside each other- they gather into small gangs called schools. Litanus are selfish by nature, so this tendency to congregate is unusual and perhaps due to some dimly instinctual sociability from their merfolk heritage. Even so, litanus don't work well together. They might initially discuss building complicated traps or agree to divide up spoils in an equitable fashion, but each litanu considers itself more worthy than the others. They therefore subtly sabotage each other's traps, secretly steal one another's victims, and even interfere with attacks, purely out of malice. Litanu schools inevitably come to blows after a few weeks or even days, leaving only the strongest litanu as a survivor. Only a powerful master, such as a necromancer or mighty aquatic undead creature, can compel them to cooperate with each other on a long-term basis."

Hostile actions by the living cave painting that don't target or affect the fascinated creature do not end the fascinated effect.

The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Manifestation (Sp)** A living cave painting manifests itself in the three-dimensional world by shaping quasi-real illusions. Three times per day, a living cave painting can use shadow conjuration as a spell-like ability, but the shadow conjuration can mimic only summon nature's ally III spells. Additionally, whenever a conjured creature takes enough damage to destroy it, the living cave painting can instead, as a free action, sacrifice any number of hit points.

			"**Two-Dimensional (Ex)** A living cave painting exists in only two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living cave painting has no Strength score. Additionally, it gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can navigate only along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can attack creatures only by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living cave painting can crawl onto solid objects that can then themselves be moved through other means. It cannot fall or take falling damage, and it cannot use or be affected by combat maneuvers such as bull rush, grapple, or trip. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment. It has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living cave painting takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and takes only half the normal amount of damage from magical weapons.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Little is known of the primitive tribes that preceded the great mortal civilizations of the Age of Legends. They possessed no written language and built few lasting structures, so little of their culture exists to this day. Yet some evidence of these ancient peoples can be found, hidden away in deep, remote caves protected from the ravages of time. The simple paintings and sculptures found in these caves speak to the primal roots of the human experience, and they're treasured in the modern world as pieces of art nearly as much as they are considered historical artifacts. Yet those who wish to explore these caverns or retrieve such relics must be cautious. Ancient guardians haunt the dark places in the earth, hiding among the paintings, waiting to strike down those foolish enough to disturb their millennia-long rest.",
			"",
			"These guardians are the living cave paintings, ancient works of art animated by strange magic at the dawn of human civilization. They lack true bodies, and instead exist as two-dimensional beings painted across cave walls in ocher and charcoal. Living cave paintings most often depict herd animals such as aurochs, bison, horses, or rhinoceroses, or megafauna such as megaloceros that forms herds. Some others depict predatory creatures, human figures, or even animal-human hybrids.",
			"",
			"A living cave painting's temperament and behavior seem to depend on the type of creature (or creatures) it is painted to resemble. While all living cave paintings are aggressive to some extent, those that portray bison or horses tend to be less violent and less predatory in nature than those that depict lions or bears. Likewise, living cave paintings illustrated to represent herd animals often group together, while those showing solitary creatures generally eschew the company of their own kind. It is a mistake, however, to assume that a living cave painting is merely a two-dimensional version of some common animal. Even those that represent prey animals have sharp predatory instincts, and many an explorer has met a grisly end after disregarding a living cave painting of a peaceful herd animal.",
			"",
			"Though they require no food or drink to survive, living cave paintings can consume small amounts of material-usually blood, ash, or stone pigments such as ocher. They seem to absorb these materials directly into their two-dimensional bodies, growing darker or more vivid as they do so. Living cave paintings sometimes accept such materials as offerings, allowing creatures who present them with such gifts to pass unharmed into the caverns they protect, though their tolerance is tenuous and short-lived even in the best of situations.",
			"",
			"Scholars aren't sure whether living cave paintings age. Some living cave paintings seem to have existed for thousands of years without losing any potency or vitality, while others have grown faint and restive with age. It is even possible that apparently mundane cave paintings were once living cave paintings that either died or now simply lack the will or ability to move.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living cave paintings reside deep in the earth, in places of sacred significance to the primitive cultures that created cave art during Golarion's primordial times. Living cave paintings in these caverns attack intruders out of some bestial territorial instinct rather than cruel spite or random violence. No matter how extensive the cave system it occupies might be, a living cave painting typically treats only the areas of its cave decorated with cave art as its territory. It generally ignores raw, unadorned areas, though it may pursue intruders into these areas if it feels they are still a threat.",
			"",
			"In addition to the cave itself, living cave paintings are extremely protective of the mundane paintings and sculptures that cover the walls of their cavernous homes. Explorers who damage or deface such ancient works of art, whether accidentally or intentionally, are sure to draw the ire of any nearby living cave paintings. Such behavior suggests that living cave paintings were first created to be guardians for these sacred places, and continue to act out this role long after the cultures that created them have died out.",
			"",
			"While many living cave paintings are ancient, specimens can sometimes be found in more recent sites. Some living cave paintings can be found in caverns near the surface that were occupied by orcs during the Age of Darkness, and even more recently in caves inhabited by modern Kellid or Shoanti tribes not that far back in Avistan's past. It's not clear whether the living cave paintings found in these places migrated to younger sites from older caves, or newer cave art also has the potential to transform into living cave paintings. Some believe (albeit without evidence) that shamans among some remote tribes still preserve the ageold secret to creating new living cave paintings."

This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the living doldrums' space and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.

Against foes that are unable to see invisible creatures, it gains an additional +20 bonus on Stealth checks when moving, or +40 when stationary; these bonuses are not included in the statistics above.

			"",
			"**Stagnant Aura (Su)** The air within 240 feet of a living doldrums is always still. Naturally occurring winds flow around this radius without disturbing anything inside (though precipitation falls as normal). Mundane attempts to create airflow within the aura (such as with a fan) are only half as strong as normal. Air elementals, gaseous creatures, and winged creatures (other than living doldrums) have their maneuverability reduced by one category within the aura.

			"When people imagine elementals that thrive on the Plane of Air, they are most likely to think of the spirits of rushing wind and thundering storm, but not all air elementals are so dynamic. Living doldrums are elementals that embody stagnant air. Those who can see invisible creatures describe the living doldrums as a cloud roughly 20 feet in diameter that resembles a knotted snake with a head at both ends. The scent of stale air lingers around a living doldrums, even if one only recently arrived to the area.",
			"",

			"Living doldrums project an aura of unmoving air that lures those seeking shelter from the wind or becalms those who rely on wind to travel. Once it has them trapped, the living doldrums torments its victims until they eventually kill themselves or one other. Though they do not need to eat in the traditional sense, scholars believe that living doldrums derive from their victims some sort of psychic sustenance that enables them to become more powerful.",
			"",
			"The most dangerous aspect of these predators is their natural invisibility. They avoid direct conflict with their victims, many of which die unaware that either the dead calm of the air or the desperate actions of their allies were anything other than natural. Only when victims become aware of the living doldrums's influence-whether through magical means or mundane deduction-and take action against it does the elemental resort to physical attacks. It may be that it is the madness and not the death of its victims that feeds the living doldrums, or perhaps it merely serves them as cruel entertainment. Creatures immune to mind control are of little interest to the living doldrums, though it might use its powers to turn others against those that it can't affect directly.",
			"",
			"Though living doldrums are resistant to many physical attacks, magic that creates wind or loud noises is especially harmful to the elementals. Spellcasters are thus often the first target of the living doldrums' mind-controlled victims. Even mundane noises are an annoyance to a living doldrums (especially percussion and wind instruments), though they cause it no damage, leading some who know of living doldrums to believe that loud or discordant music drives them off. In practice, though, this tactic is more likely to cause the elemental to physically attack the musicians, making it a dangerous but effective way to draw the creature into revealing itself.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living doldrums are native to the Plane of Air, where hey haunt trade routes, feeding on unwary or ignorant travelers until put to flight by more powerful creatures (such as a combined force of djinn). On occasion, they slip into the Material Plane, often through temporary portals located in the eyes of hurricanes and tornadoes. Living doldrums are most often found at sea and consider sailing ships a favorite target-once trapped within the elementals' aura, sailors can do little to escape their fate. Away from the water, living doldrums make their lairs in desolate locations, such as desert oases and mountain valleys, preying on those who seek refuge there.",
			"",
			"Though most living doldrums are concerned only with their own desires, some revere [Hshurha](faith/hshurha), the elemental lord of air. These pious elementals see their actions as an extension of their god's mission to rid the multiverse of solid and visible creatures. It is rumored that a number of living doldrums serve Hshurha directly. These loyal spies gather intelligence for the Duchess of All Winds, and when necessary they use their powers to kill her enemies while making it look like death from natural causes or the work of others. These assassins would certainly have additional Hit Dice and mental powers unknown to other living doldrums."

Twin gems are embedded in the eyes of each living effigy; they glow a vibrant color whenever the statue uses one of its many magical abilities.",

The longer an effigy exists, though, the more detached it becomes from material concerns, eventually adopting an impartial stance on most subjects.",

In situations where approval or rejection is necessary, the effigy uses its stone shape spell-like ability to alter its facial expression to an appropriate emotion.",

It takes a living effigy a full week to learn its various abilities, and even after this initial adjustment, the spirit still needs to cope with the solitary nature of its new existence. Cut off from the sensations it once had, a living effigy learns to rely on the surface thoughts of those nearby and minor interaction through dreams. Its eye gems can attract unwanted attention when it uses its charming gaze, but can't be removed until the construct is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Settlements guided by living effigies are typically found in remote locations, away from the administration of governments or the intervention of outside agencies. Because of their nature as silent watchers, such effigies are most commonly found in far-flung communities in the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, where they are treated as honored ancestors, and in the wilds of the Mwangi Expanse, where they are sometimes seen as ancestral spirit gods. Worshipers of most deities find the idea of a living effigy worrying, especially if the effigy's settlement has raised a pseudo-religion around the idol. While living effigies aren't technically undead, Pharasmin priests in particular have problems with them and often oppose them once their true nature is discovered, heedless of the protection and aid the living effigies offer to their communities.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"The construction of the stone effigy requires an appropriate amount of stone (at least 40 tons' worth) and a successful DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. If the crafter fails the check, the stone is rendered useless for this purpose and a new block must be obtained. The creation of the effigy also requires two gems that are worth at least 500 gp each. A completed effigy acts as a soul receptacle, sucking in the intended target's soul as long as it dies within a mile of the inert statue. It takes the soul a full week to adjust to its new home, at which point the effigy animates and can use all of its abilities normally. During this transition period, the effigy remains a stone statue; it can be destroyed as normal or by removing or destroying the eye gems. Other forms of living effigies can be made of bone, bronze, wood, or similar materials.",

This is a nonmagical mind-affecting glamer effect that is otherwise identical to hallucinatory terrain and that the living mirage can dismiss as a swift action. The save DC to disbelieve the illusion is Charisma-based, and the DC includes a +4 racial bonus.",

Although those who have lost loved ones to living mirages revile them as cruel deceivers, living mirages are in fact mindless, without any motive beyond feeding on the water and minerals found in living bodies. They manage to show hallucinations of what a victim desires not because of any intelligence on the living mirage's part, but because the victim's own mind generates the illusions."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens. Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called \"lesser races\" they feel are corrupted forms of the universe's first words of creation. Appearing as magical glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Living runes are ambush hunters, lying in wait amid ancient graffiti and faded pictographs, or even on the pages of ancient texts and tomes. They use their mutable forms to camouflage themselves-often changing texts with illusory script to lead adventurers into nearby traps or hazards, or lacing important sources of information with explosive runes and then striking at trespassers when they have triggered the dangerous glyphs. Immortal unless destroyed, the creatures do not need sustenance in a traditional sense, though, like their will-o--wisp cousins, they seem to feed on the terror and pain they induce in their victims. In addition to fear and pain, living runes feed on the written word (which they can erase through this consumption or leave unharmed). Living runes reproduce by a strange sort of mitosis, where two creatures merge to create complex sentence structures and concepts before splitting a portion off each of their malleable bodies to create a new unique rune that contains the knowledge of both parent runes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most commonly found in deserted ruins-in particular old alchemical labs, forgotten temples, and musty libraries' living runes prefer to live isolated existences, feeding on lost knowledge, consuming it slowly over the years before erasing or altering it, then hoarding the truth within themselves to tease races seeking to recover it. For this reason, they prefer to haunt the fringes of civilization, where they may terrorize lesser creatures in this manner- particularly arcane spellcasters. They derive a sick pleasure from the mental and physical torture of humanoids; in particular, they enjoy cornering humanoids in debates and wrapping them in riddles with the promise of shared knowledge or information, before ultimately growing bored and attacking the intruders with their myriad abilities. Such communications always begin-in the living rune's unique form of communication-with scribbled inquiries trespassing creatures will understand, and this somewhat playful and innocuous introduction often draws explorers to their deaths when they assume they are conversing with some benign artificial intelligence. In instances becoming horrifically frequent, archivists have discovered previously unheard of colonies of living runes deep in the bowels of urban libraries and archives, hiding out for years in an attempt to learn more of modern civilization, with unknown motivations that may hold terrible consequences for civilized races.",
			"",
			"### Origins",
			"",
			"In the annals of recorded history, ancient texts mentioning living runes always seem to do so in relation to the forgotten goddess Lissala, leading scholars to believe that either the creatures served worshipers of the deity in some way, or were rewarded as gifts to particularly devout supplicants. Some even speculate that Lissala herself is responsible for the creation of living runes. Others conjecture that living runes have always been, and are among the universe's eldest creatures, having escaped from the lips of some primordial god when the first words of creation were uttered. Evidence seems to dispute both these claims-the creatures are known to spring up from the scribbled text and graffiti of magic-soured ruins or untriggered symbol spells long left to rot. Whatever the truth, these haughty creatures do not discuss their origins."

When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.",

			"Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of other planes.

They use their ability to create sand liberally, attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes, as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.",
			"",
			"Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification. When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home, they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a new one."

A change in form can't be dispelled, nor does the living sandstorm revert to any particular form when killed (both shapes are its true form). A true seeing spell reveals both forms simultaneously.",
			"",
			"**Create Sand (Su)** While in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can, as a standard action, create 500 cubic feet of fine red sand, filling a 10-foot radius beneath it to a depth of 5 feet. All creatures in the area and adjacent squares must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Medium and smaller creatures in the area are buried and must begin holding their breath to avoid drowning in the sand. By attempting a Reflex save against the same DC, a creature can avoid being buried if there is an adjacent space outside the area to which it can move; if the save is successful, the creature is moved into an available adjacent space. As a standard action, each buried creature can dig itself out or be dug out by another with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Invisible creatures in or adjacent to the area when the sand is created are outlined until the dust is removed. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Sand Blast (Ex)** When in sandstorm form, a living sandstorm can attack with a blast of scouring sand in a 20-foot line. The sand deals 6d6 points of slashing damage and blinds creatures in the area for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blinding. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Sandsight (Ex)** The living sandstorm can see through sand, dust, and other particles in the air as if the air were clear, ignoring the miss chance for these obstructions, up to its normal range of vision.",
			"",
			"**Slashing Sand (Ex)** A living sandstorm's swarm attack deals slashing damage. Its slam attacks deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Notorious for appearing suddenly out of the roiling tempests of the deep desert, living sandstorms are capable of turning oases and dry farmlands into areas of featureless desert in a shockingly short span of time. When angered, they can scour a whole army down to bits of shining metal and bone buried under feet of shifting sand over the course of one terrible night. Some Osiriani scholars claim that living sandstorms are related to the deadly khamsin storms that scour the desert, and while these creatures are related to elementals, they have nothing to do with the formation of those iconic storms. Living sandstorms are most comfortable when sand is free to flow across the earth. They become agitated whenever creatures make an effort to remove or limit sand in an area, shelter an area from the drifting dust, or alter the weather to reduce or prevent sandstorms. However, they are curious creatures and enjoy experiencing new interactions with beings of other shapes, and are willing to parley when they believe doing so may open the door to a novel diversion-or if a creature simply appears easy to intimidate.",
			"",
			"A living sandstorm in its humanoid shape is about 6 feet tall and weighs 900 pounds. In sandstorm form, it expands its form into a pulsing cloud of streaming, loose sand, which gathers into small clumps before being reabsorbed into the storm.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Living sandstorms are formed from and fed by the unpredictable interaction of raw elemental earth and planar storms or vortices carrying the essence of other planes. These ageless elemental creatures tend to be curious and outgoing when they first discover new places, but are easily frustrated by any kind of restraint. They use their ability to create sand liberally, attempting to pack caves, voids in the Plane of Earth, and other open areas at least half-full of their reddish sand. Because of their origin, they are usually found near gates, portals, and vortices between planes both on the Plane of Earth and on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Living sandstorms dwell in the rare open caverns on the Plane of Earth. On that plane, they are misfits, feared for their affinities for open spaces and howling winds. When conflicts erupt between the powers of the Elemental Planes, they are sometimes recruited to lead strike teams into other planes, as they are adventurous and enjoy discovering open spaces they can fill with their fine, red sand. They are especially valuable when establishing beachheads on planes that have little in the way of earth, because of their ability to create large amounts of sand in relatively short periods of time.",
			"",
			"Due to their intrepidness, they readily answer callings to serve summoners so they can visit new places and spread their sand far and wide. If they see an opportunity to do so, they may break free of their calling and explore the wider Material Plane, where they favor desert climes and their nearby regions, and where they are known to contribute to rapid desertification. When marooned on the Material Plane, they are generally restless until they find a way back to the Plane of Earth, but if they know of a route home, they instead explore the nearby area, wandering farther and farther until they lose interest in filling that world with sand and long to move on to a new one."

In such situations, an individual deprived of nutrients quickly dries out and shrivels over the course of several days.",

Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright.",
			"",
			"Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires.",
			"",
			"Though generally neutral, lizardfolks' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization's \"gifts,\" and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don't defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste.",
			"",
			"The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet."

			"Every few generations, a lizard scion is born to a lizardfolk tribe. With twice the life span of a typical lizardfolk and a large and muscular stature, a scion typically rises to become the leader of her tribe. Lizardfolk show great-often unquestioning-devotion to scions, believing they are blessings from the spirits and divine in nature. In many ways, tribes see them as living monuments to the lost greatness of their people, singing songs of an era when every lizardfolk was as large and impressive as the scion.",
			"",
			"A lizard scion is not officially recognized until her 100th birthday, though many might suspect that she is one. At that point, the tribe holds a ceremony in which they present the newly titled lizard scion with a special war trident as a mark of status. These ancient tridents are never used by ordinary lizardfolk, and most have been handed down through their tribe for generations, sometimes sitting untouched for hundreds of years until the naming of a new lizard scion.",
			"",
			"Some lizard scions become great protectors and voices of wisdom among their people, leading a tribe to previously unknown accomplishments and stability within its hidden enclave. Others attempt to build alliances with other lizardfolk tribes or even unite two tribes into one. A tribe of lizardfolk being systematically pushed out of its ancestral territory, however, might see the coming of a lizard scion as a sign that war is imminent, and could be spurred to take up arms once and for all against the socalled \"civilized\" encroachers.",
			"",
			"There are rumors that deep in some jungles or swamps there live entire tribes of dinosaur-herding lizard scions that have bred true as a race, but such stories may be little more than the overactive imaginations of explorers and treasure hunters.",
			"",
			"Lizard scions average 10 feet in height and 500 pounds, though this can vary by tribe and age. Unlike boggard priest-kings, lizard scions are never fat, but rather hugely muscled specimens with excellent reflexes."

Though a rattler might or might not be the leader of a tribe, she is often asked to sit in judgment over internal conflicts, to act as an ambassador to other tribes, or to advise a tribe's chieftains and elders so that their decisions reflect the wisdom of the past.",

			"Lizardfolk rattlers are often tribal elders, but when youths show a propensity for bardic magic or a particular passion for the old stories and shamanistic rituals, a tribe's existing rattlers might choose to take them in and train them as the rattlers of the next generation. This practice is crucial, as it can take most of a lifetime to learn all the stories, and a tribe never wants to risk losing ties to their history because of the sudden death of the tribe's rattler to old age or in battle."

With the blood of dragons coursing through her veins, the sorcerer is respected and feared by members of her tribe. They could see her as an omen-of good or ill-and might send her away to live on the outskirts of tribal land if she can't quickly learn to control her powers. Nevertheless, though the sorcerer might stand apart from the rest of her tribe, she almost always comes to her kin's defense in their times of need."

Most encounters with a llorona begin as the victim hears mournful sobbing cries in the distance. Some victims she simply fills with sorrow, hoping that the experience will scar their minds or cause them to correct their ways, but others she marks for death. If a victim isn't compelled to drown himself upon hearing the llorona's wails, she snatches him up and drags him into the water so she can plunge him beneath the surface until death brings them both sweet silence."

Ridged, rust-colored skin covers their chests and stomachs, and a mottled wash of green, brown, and orange colors their fins like aging kelp. Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above water that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most land-dwellers. Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy.",

Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts.",
			"",
			"Locathah matriarchs serve their undersea tribes not only as chieftains, but also as the primary egg layers of the community. Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own. Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful aquatic races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers.",
			"",

When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks.

			"Also known as a \"murmur stone\" for its rocklike natural camouflage, a lorelei is a solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and ocean trenches, emerging only to torment the living. When not pursuing complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond of wrecking ships on rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown.",

			"Lukwatas slip through dark tropical waters, preying upon all who dare enter their deep jungle rivers and pools, including beasts typically considered apex predators. While scholars say the beasts favor the dark, light doesn't deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long, flat bodies are reminiscent of those of dolphins or large fish, but lukwatas' heads are distinctively eel-like. A lukwata's unusual ability to disrupt magical effects rises from the strange crystalline growths that line its throat and stomach-crystals that allow the lukwata to gain nutrients from magical items as efficiently as from flesh and blood. These same growths give the lukwata an unusually strong resistance to all manner of magic attacks.",
			"",
			"Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals, and attack them on sight, even if the lukwata has recently fed. Most crocodilians are not large enough to pose a significant threat; however, some accounts exist of lukwatas and dire crocodiles crossing paths. These fights are renowned for inflicting great destruction, with the embattled creatures smashing to bits piers, flotillas, and even dams in their fury.",

			"",
			"A newly spawned lunarma forms a cocoon in which it metamorphoses into a preadult, emerging when it senses food. It can remain dormant in its cocoon for centuries, and clusters of eggs have been found in sealed caverns beneath icy surfaces, as well as on cold moons and drifting asteroids-as if placed there by an intelligent creature.",
			"",
			"Though lunarmas are able to communicate among themselves telepathically, they're only barely intelligent, and their thoughts are primitive. They have no known culture, and their desires are limited to feeding and procreation. The only instinct they seem to have beyond that is a violent aversion to flumphs, which they attack on sight.",

Creating a gate to bring allies to the Material Plane requires one sacrifice for every HD of the creature intended to pass through the gate (so five sacrifices can bring a lurker or a Medium air elemental, eight can bring a Large earth elemental, and so on). The sacrifices do not need to be simultaneous; as long all sacrifices occur at some point during the hour-long ritual, the magic continues to build until it reaches the required total.",

Gnomes in particular seem to incur these unexplained attacks, leading some to believe that lurkers may be agents of ancient and vengeful forces. Creatures of the light, lurkers are visible only in dim illumination, with anything brighter than a flickering torch making them completely invisible, even as they savage their enemies-a prospect terrifying to those civilized races that equate light with safety.",
			"",
			"A lurker in light turns conventional wisdom on its head, for they detest darkness and the creatures that dwell in it, yet they themselves are sadistic and evil. They particularly hate darkmantles, dwarves, and creatures from the Plane of Shadow, and given the time, they enjoy torturing such creatures to death if they can capture them alive.",

			"Luscas are among the most feared predators in the open ocean-their snapping shark heads and writhing tentacles spell the end for many crews. A lusca's presence can first be felt in the air, as its body naturally conducts electricity. Sailors who have encountered the being and survived claim that thunderclouds seem to roll in alongside the creature and strange electrical fires dance in the air before it attacks, lending an eerie aura of foreboding to the oncoming assault. Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon; luscas brook no other large predators in their claimed territory, and battle even mighty krakens for control. They are equally territorial with their own kind, and an encounter between two luscas, except to mate, almost always ends with one dead or driven off. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about any aquatic creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to steer clear of a hungry lusca's vicinity.",
			"",
			"The average lusca is 90 feet from tentacle to snout and weighs 3,800 pounds. Legends tell of even larger luscas that can sink Colossal ships."

			"",
			"**Verdant Glide (Ex)** A lythirium can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. It ignores any magically manipulated overgrowth with thorns, briars, or other natural growth that would normally impede its motion.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Savage hunters of those who would harm their habitats, lythiriums prowl Golarion's densest forests, seeking to protect the wild, untouched natural growth they hold sacred. While they have lived on the Material Plane for millennia, lythiriums are actually descended from primordial beasts native to the First World-creatures that fused plant and animal so seamlessly they seemed both and neither simultaneously. Peering out of seedpod eyes that radiate a soft green glow, lythiriums have exceptionally keen senses; they are not shy about preserving their forests, and they deliver their warnings in rasping voices reminiscent of leaves blowing across the earth.",
			"",
			"At its haunches, a lythirium measures 6 feet in height, with thorns, vines, and flowering blossoms inching ever higher. Its massive body is a matrix of vines, roots, and fine, furry moss and lichens. Immense branches shape its powerful chest and limbs. From thorny head to tail, a lythirium measures 9 feet in length; it can weigh as much as 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars believe the first lythiriums wandered onto Golarion through a breach to the First World in the nation now known as Kyonin or through a long-healed breach in the Barrowood or Whisperwood in what is now Cheliax (though the latter is considered less likely). Lythiriums' First World progenitors are believed to have been even more massive than the beasts that exist today. Most posit that they had even stranger physical qualities than do Golarion's lythiriums, such as the ability to infuse victims of their gore attacks with various poisons or diseases. The folktales that tell of such creatures in the First World are ancient and contradictory indeed, but one detail never wavers: these creatures were always said to take the forms of antler-bearing wolves, and to have senses appropriate to such pack hunters, despite having features of both elks and plants. These tales have died out among modern peoples, though, leading scholars to believe that-for whatever reason-lythiriums native to the First World no longer exist. However, the creatures' descendants live on in the densest forests of Golarion, patrolling their territories and acting as friends and allies to those who share their goals of keeping forests safe.",
			"",
			"Perhaps owing to their odd origins on the First World, lythiriums have a strange physiology. Foliage and reedy roots intertwine to form the creatures' shape and size, and their central roots pump greenish, saplike fluid throughout their bodies. The small seedpods that constitute a lythirium's eyes are opaque, fluid-filled sacs that emit a greenish glow. These give the creatures sharp vision, even in the dimmest light. In extreme darkness, the pod-eyes extend outward from the sockets like antennae, and sense subtle vibrations in the air. This allows lythiriums to see even in total darkness.",
			"",
			"Lythiriums survive by absorbing sunlight through their leaves and by scavenging the meat of animals that died naturally. However, despite their canine appearances, lythiriums don't hunt creatures for food, and kill only if they are attacked first.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Considering their immense size, lythiriums are able to move swiftly through the underbrush and foliage of the forested regions they inhabit. Though their native habitats are full of thick, dense forest that would impede the movement of any other beast of a similarly bulky size, lythiriums' unique ability to pass through plants unhindered enables them to continue their unyielding hunts against those who would harm their homes. It also ensures that they can use their own nature-manipulating abilities without being negatively affected themselves.",
			"",
			"When the season changes and temperatures drop, lythiriums' colors deepen to fiery red, burnt orange, and plum. Their leaves begin to fall as winter approaches, and lone lythiriums seek out caves or other sheltered places in which to hibernate during the winter, when they go dormant.",
			"",
			"Perhaps driven by instincts their kind developed on the First World, lythiriums often seek out wolf companions and sometimes even attempt to supplant an entire pack's hierarchy. Despite their peaceful nature, though, lythiriums are shunned by most wolf packs because of their disturbing appearance and pungent scent of earth and vegetation, which wolves tend to find both strange and unappealing.",
			"",
			"Lythiriums are rare and seldom encounter others of their kind. When chance meetings occur, lythiriums bond quickly. Although they seek to dominate the few wolf packs that accept them, lythiriums are remarkably egalitarian when living among their own. They have a complex communication system ranging from barks and whines to growls and howls, all tinged with the sound of rustling leaves.",
			"",
			"While in its territory, a lythirium assists good-aligned adventurers and creatures against evil foes when it sees such fights break out. If adventurers approach a lythirium respectfully with news of threats against its territory, the creature does whatever is necessary to help end the menace. Lythiriums' intelligence and protective nature make them useful confederates for good fey creatures, though they also usually consider elves and gnomes to be natural allies.",
			"",
			"Though the dense terrain in which lythiriums live is enough to keep most intruders away, they constantly patrol their surroundings. A lythirium's vigilance grows if virtuous folk make their homes within its territory. Many communities of forestdwelling elves refer to lythiriums as vinewolves and usually welcome their presence when settling a new region, going as far as to hollow out dead, massive trees in the hope that lythiriums might hibernate nearby and protect them."

They love silver-which reminds them of rainfall-and can be easily bribed into abandoning their mischief for a handful of coins.",

Mamiwas can also obtain the energy they need to survive from mortal mages, and a neutral-aligned 7th-level spellcaster who has the Improved Familiar feat can gain a mamiwa as a familiar."

			"While clerics and oracles spin their own myths of creation, manasaputras tout an occult truth behind these stories - the current multiverse is not the first to exist and it won't be the last. Like the cycle of seasons and the moon, existence itself waxes and wanes.",
			"",
			"Similar to the highest caste of pitris, twilight pitris are manasaputras whose existence predates the current multiverse. Unlike the solar pitris, these creatures started their path to enlightenment in the preceding multiverse, not some more ancient one. During that indescribable existence, twilight pitris were mortals who ascended to the ranks of manus. Surviving the natural end of their native reality, they endured and were incarnated into the current multiverse as this higher caste of manasaputras. Though they are in a higher form, it is one filled with tribulation and challenge, as becoming a twilight pitri is among the greatest trials in the path to absolute enlightenment.",
			"",
			"This transition between multiverses has the effect of cutting off the former manus' souls from the Cosmic Fire of creation. This \"twilight\" forces the new pitris to pursue enlightenment without the fire's guidance.",
			"",
			"While these creatures can hover around the Cosmic Fire on the Positive Energy Plane, they are barred from entering it. Some occult scholars believe this is merely a taboo, but the prohibition is more than a metaphysical barrier. These pitris are incapable of the spiritual incorporeality found among other types of manasaputras, which enables communion with the flame.",
			"",
			"While some occult scholars teach that this exile is some form of punishment for actions in past incarnations, both twilight and even solar pitris deny this explanation. Instead, exile from the cosmic source is a test in spiritual suffering and self-sufficiency. Without the benefit of the Cosmic Fire, each twilight pitri must look within itself or to others to achieve full enlightenment, which is both challenging and spiritually taxing. Failure of this test leads to either the destruction of a twilight pitri or its continuance within lesser incarnations until the death of this multiverse and the creation of the next. Those who gain true enlightenment from this test become solar pitris when the next multiverse ignites, though most achieve status as a twilight pitri, fail the test, and are reincarnated as lesser manasaputras many times before succeeding and becoming solar pitris.",
			"",
			"Because these pitris are disconnected from the cosmic source, their wisdom can sometimes seem imperfect, at least compared to that of the solar pitris. While all twilight pitris seek to expand enlightenment in the multiverse, their actions can accidently work against enlightened truth.",
			"",
			"During the earliest epochs of this multiverse, the first twilight pitris sought not only to shepherd the fledgling races, but also to impart knowledge and reason to those with whom they formed the closest bonds. The results of this effort still haunt them, as the pitris' imperfect mastery of cosmic enlightenment turned these races into beings driven only by reason, logic, and systematic philosophies. As these beliefs opposed the spiritual ascension touted by other manasaputras, these early races ascended to become other types of outsiders, swelling the ranks of such beings. In the end, the kumaras had to intercede and right the wrongs inadvertently spurred by the twilight pitris' actions. Because of this, many twilight pitris have chosen to be more contemplative and intuitive in deciding on their courses of action than other manasaputras, while others become more active hoping to make up for this early misstep.",
			"",
			"In spite of their alien origins, twilight pitris seek to aid and inspire mortals of the Material Plane. They take great care to search for and study the individual mortals, societies, and worlds that hold the greatest promise. Mortals who show the best chance of becoming some form of manu in their next incarnations are chosen and taught the methods of contemplation, mindfully executed action, and focused meditation necessary to achieve their next stage of enlightenment. At the same time, such visitations-either to mortals or others of their kind- can be both a boon and a curse, for the twilight pitris often act in unexpected ways-their minds inscrutable to the denizens of the Material Plane-and their lack of connection with the Cosmic Fire often makes them seem disconnected from other manasaputras. A handful of kumaras seek out the aid of twilight pitris when they do leave the Positive Energy Plane, enjoying and finding wisdom in their sometimes alien and unexpected modes of thought.",
			"",
			"Relationships between twilight pitris and manus are complicated. Many manus have at least one twilight pitri to thank for their first steps of enlightenment and acceptance into the manasaputra castes, but upon ascension, the new manus intuit how disconnected their former teachers are from the cosmic source of all things. They immediately find the words and guidance of the twilight pitris to be filled with half-truths and blind paths, even though the twilight pitri's intentions are true and honorable. These manus still give members of this caste the respect and reverence they deserve, and understand the importance of this test-especially since they may face it themselves one day- but often go to great pains to avoid asking a twilight pitri for counsel. Relationships between twilight pitris and samsarans are even more strained, as knowledgeable members of that race blame the twilight pitris for nearly damning the entire samsaran race to a path outside of reincarnation and enlightenment. While they would never outwardly disrespect these higher forms of being, they are often suspicious of the twilight pitris' guidance and disregard twilight pitris' advice. Some samsarans outright refuse all aid coming from one of these manasaputras.",

A creature that wants to create a mandragora can do so with alchemy; the process requires a day of work, a mandrake root, several pints of ichor or the body of a demon of CR 6 or above, and a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. The newly created mandragora is hostile, even to its creator."

			"",
			"Cunning and brutal, maraxes are far-ranging predators from Castrovel's mist-shrouded landscape. Gifted with vicious weapons, dense armor, and a paralytic venom, a single marax is a match for even the greatest hunter. A pack can easily bring down Castrovel's largest creatures and defend their territory against the planet's most fearsome competitors.",
			"",
			"Variations of maraxes dot Castrovel's different regions just as big cats stalk Golarion's. Different subspecies can be identified by their varying fur colors and patterns and the arrangement of ridges on their dorsal plates. Maraxes typically stand 9 to 10 feet tall and weigh up to 900 pounds.",
			"",
			"While they are far from the most dangerous predators on their homeworld, maraxes stand among the planet's more successful hunters thanks to their inherent adaptability. Perfectly suited to the forests and plains of Castrovel, they roam enormous territories as lone hunters or in small packs. Their seasonal migrations create famine in their wakes as they drain a region of fauna, and entire lashunta villages may relocate seasonally to avoid starvation. Maraxes possess only a single lung, and those introduced to alien environments often become extremely irritable due to shortness of breath.",
			"",
			"Maraxes are overwhelmingly carnivorous. The larger, more aggressive females dominate their packs, bringing down prey and eating first. Maraxes have voracious appetites, and will make a meal of almost anything-in lean times the animals turn to carrion, fruit, and in rare cases even soil and stones to sate their voracious appetites.",
			"",
			"Straddling the line between mammal and reptile, maraxes are warm-blooded creatures with resilient bodies. Soft fur covers tough scales across much of a marax's body, while bony knobs protect the head, back, thighs, and tail. A marax's most identifiable feature is its tough dorsal osteoderms that offer protection. They lack forelimbs, and balance instead on a single pair of legs tipped with vicious, scythe-like claws. Their oversized jaws can crush both bone and stone, and larger specimens can even tear through metal armor. A cluster of venomous barbs sprout from the end of a marax's tail, which can inject enough paralytic venom to bring down prey twice the creature's size.",
			"",
			"These statistics represent a typical marax. Various subspecies may be larger or smaller (use the giant creature or young creature simple templates accordingly) and possess a variety of different special abilities. The arctic-dwelling tundrax is smaller, but can hibernate for months beneath the snow and reawaken in moments to pounce upon unsuspecting prey, while females of the bioluminescent ghostback marax possess a resin-producing gland that grants them an ability similar to the web special ability.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Maraxes are found all across Castrovel, but exist primarily in its primeval forests and vast savannas. Dozens of subspecies fill the planet's various ecological niches, and maraxes range from the polar tundra to steaming tropical jungles. Thanks to Castrovel's dramatic tides and powerful weather systems, regular migration is a way of life, and packs can cover hundreds of miles between seasonal hunting grounds. Some subspecies follow staple herds, while others alternate between a variety of environments and diets throughout the year. Most maraxes spend dry seasons stalking small prey in wooded areas or deep in Castrovel's countless hidden valleys, then during wet seasons move onto open savanna to take down larger prey. Wherever they settle for a time, packs use their powerful claws to dig out shallow nests, which shelter a complex ecology of scavengers and opportunistic mammals once the beasts move on.",
			"",
			"Most breeds of maraxes are social animals that form complex hierarchies. They vocalize a variety of chirps, growls, and rasping grunts, and establish relative status with bellowing exchanges that lashunta call \"debates.\" The largest female typically leads the pack, and surrounds herself with the other breeding-age females for hunting and territorial defense. Males and females not of breeding age rely on this matriarch's circle for food, and are expected to groom the hunters and one another for parasites. All members of a pack contribute to marking and defending territory and to scavenging during lean times. The social bonds are knit tight, and packs are more likely to move on to new hunting grounds than drive out members in hard times. An alpha female remains fertile so long as she is well fed, and especially successful matriarchs can grow to enormous sizes and dominate packs of fifty or more, cultivating legends and nicknames among lashunta hunters.",
			"",
			"Non-alpha females breed only two or three litters in a lifetime. Females attract the attention of males using their tail barbs, and engage other females in mock combat to claim the healthiest mates. If a male shows interest, the female bonds her clutch of two to four eggs to his underbelly with a sticky resin. The father becomes incubator and guardian for the next 16 months. Hatchlings are born with soft, flexible back plates, and adults claw and nip at a pup's back to transform the soft cartilage into thick, sturdy osteoderms. The venom both males and females produce in their tails is a complex array of proteins and enzymes that the hatchlings suckle for nourishment during their vulnerable first few days. As one would expect, maraxes are very protective parents; packs will chase kidnappers for miles and tear them apart with an almost gleeful cruelty.",
			"",
			"Thanks to Castrovel's numerous planetary portals, maraxes occasionally migrate to other worlds. A smaller, wheezing variety prowls Akiton's equator, riding the planet's massive dust storms from hunting ground to hunting ground. On Golarion, a few small packs roam Numeria and southern Garund, preying on the megafauna in these locations.",
			"",
			"Among Castrovel's civilizations, capturing or slaying a marax is an impressive achievement. As maraxes' natural weapons can be used to craft vicious daggers, spears, and terbutje, those capable of reliably trapping or hunting the creatures earn impressive fortunes and high prestige.",
			"",
			"Near rural settlements, maraxes stalk domesticated herds for easy meals, and even pick off careless hunters and shepherds without fear. Their hunting tactics are so effective that some lashunta have bred a loyal domesticated subspecies to guard their wilderness settlements from predation. Though ravenous and ill tempered, these tame maraxes are unflaggingly loyal. Druidic sects see the creature as a powerful totem, crafting fetishes from the animal's bones and plates and divining prophecies from packs' seasonal migrations."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Natives of Elysium, mederachs are the kind and good counterparts to the bebiliths that lurk in the Abyss and prey upon demonic flesh. Mederachs once spent all of their time on their home plane, serving as healers and teachers to the azatas, angels, titans, and others creatures alongside which they lived; among themselves, mederachs delighted in discussing the nuances of the honest virtues they held in such high esteem, including kindness, charity, and mercy.",
			"",
			"As societies formed on the Material Plane, mederachs heard tales of mortals' changeable morality with interest and concern. Mortals, they came to believe, have souls that are inherently good, but that are also easily corrupted when exposed to prolonged suffering or extraplanar evil forces. During the Age of Darkness, mederachs heard of the various misfortunes and evils that had descended upon the lands of Golarion, including the falling of the Starstone, the collapse of major empires, and the rampages of the nascent demon lord Treerazer. Believing that these events would imperil the souls of all the world's mortals, mederachs began experimenting with plane-shifting; once they honed this ability, they began making regular forays to Golarion to aid good creatures in the fight against overwhelming evil. Now, in addition to embarking on these missions, mederachs also sometimes travel to the source of such evil plots-often the Abyss-and work on mortals' behalf there. However, no matter where their journeys take them, mederachs always keep in mind their belief that most evil can be redeemed, and so they seek to subdue their enemies and turn them toward good whenever possible instead of destroying them outright.",
			"",
			"Mederachs are typically 10 feet tall and weigh about 2,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"On Elysium, mederachs still occasionally serve as teachers and mentors for their native neighbors. In recent millennia, however, they've spent their time at home honing their hunting skills, for their experiences working with virtuous partners on the Material Plane has taught them they must be skilled hunters and combatants if they wish to effectively fight evil. They find plenty of creatures on Elysium willing to participate as the prey in mock hunts. Mederachs rarely remain in Elysium for extended periods, preferring to put their skills to use on the Material Plane or even in the Abyss once they feel comfortable doing so.",
			"",
			"To their credit, mederachs use peaceful methods to subdue their targets whenever they can. However, they have an instinctive, burning hatred for evil arachnid creatures, reserving the greatest enmity for bebiliths, whose malevolence mederachs believe is a mockery of the good they themselves try so ardently to accomplish. They also have no qualms about destroying unintelligent evil creatures, especially mindless undead, reasoning that these monsters serve as mere shells for the forces of evil and deserve no quarter.",
			"",
			"Mederachs hunt like typical web-spinning spiders, leaving a nigh-invisible web in the path of potential targets. They often elect to deal nonlethal damage to foes they think they can reach through dialog. During combat with such foes, they relate grand tales of supposedly irredeemable tyrants who saw the error of their ways and became benign rulers.",
			"",
			"Mederachs acquired the ability to change their appearance, which they use when they travel among those who might fear their true forms, or who might mistake them for evil bebiliths. Although they can change shape into many types of animals, they tend to choose familiar forms, such as horses with golden manes or riding dogs with golden coats. Their arachnid nature subtly manifests while they're in alternate forms, usually represented by eight toes on each paw, or scarlet dots on their heads representing extra eyes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Around others of their kind, mederachs are especially conversational and friendly; a convening of mederachs is often a talkative and somewhat disorderly, if polite, affair. They enjoy relating tales of their journeys to other planes and of creatures they have turned from evil or, regrettably, destroyed. Mederachs also enjoy discussing intricate web patterns based on designs they have witnessed in the stars or on other planes. They establish no formal hierarchy among themselves and regard each other as equals.",
			"",
			"Mederachs' egalitarianism extends to their fellow good-aligned outsiders. Of course, they have their own biases and preferences regarding such creatures. They view many lawful good outsiders, especially archons, as too rigid in their pursuit of righteousness. Archons, on the other hand, view mederachs as powerful but overly idealistic and optimistic fighters. The lawful good celestials still seek alliances with mederachs, however, when doing so would benefit their plans. Mederachs are usually open to such offers, but these collaborations tend to dissolve quickly once the creatures achieve their mutual goal.",
			"",
			"Mederachs find many neutral good outsiders to be eminently helpful when the need arises; in their own pursuit of good, agathions in particular are open to assisting mederachs with nonviolent plans. When agathions embark on ambassadorial missions to other planes, mederachs often accompany them, both to further their own schemes and to cement the friendships they often have with their allies. Mederachs also frequently work with angels, although when they do, it usually involves the angels intimidating the powerful evil creatures mederachs hope to turn to good. Of course, their angel allies tend to have their own inscrutable aims in mind when they go along with mederachs' plans, which can sometimes lead to minor discord between the celestials.",
			"",
			"Of all the other good outsiders, mederachs have the most in common with azatas, who are also natives of Elysium. While azatas can be aimless in their pursuit of championing good wherever they tread, mederachs are more focused architects of such plans, and so the two make excellent partners in many situations. In such relationships, the strong-willed azatas may insist on taking the lead when carrying out plans or suddenly change their minds about the best ways to achieve the partnership's collective goals. Yet they are surprisingly willing to admit their errors in judgment or personality flaws, leading to friendships and partnerships that rarely truly sour despite minor setbacks. Beyond threatening one of their own, the best way to truly rile mederachs is to harm their azata companions."

At distances of 30 feet or more, a medusa can easily pass for a beautiful woman if she wears something to cover her serpentine locks-when wearing clothing that conceals her head and face, she can be mistaken for a human at even closer distances. Medusas use lies and disguises that conceal their faces to get close enough to opponents to use their petrifying gaze, though they like playing with their prey and may fire arrows from a distance to lead enemies into traps. Some enjoy creating intricate decorations out of their victims, using their petrified remains as accents to their swampy lairs, but most medusas take care to hide the evidence of their previous conflicts so that new foes won't have advance warning of their presence.",
			"",
			"Used to concealing themselves, medusas in cities are usually rogues, while those in the wilderness often pass themselves off as rangers or trackers. The most notorious and legendary medusas, though, are those who take levels as bards or clerics. Charismatic and intelligent, urban medusas are often involved with thieves' guilds or other aspects of the criminal underworld. Medusas may form alliances with blind creatures or intelligent undead, both of which are immune to their stony gaze. Spellcasting medusas often serve as oracles or prophets, usually dwelling in remote locations of legendary power or infamous history. Such oracle medusas take great delight in their roles, and if presented with the proper gifts and flattery, the secrets they offer can be quite helpful. Of course, the lairs of such potent creatures are liberally decorated with statues of those who have offended them, so the seeker of knowledge is well advised to tred carefully during such meetings.",
			"",
			"All known medusas are female. Rarely, a medusa may decide to keep a male humanoid as a mate, usually with the help of elixirs of love or similar magic, and is always careful to not petrify her prisoner-at least until she grows tired of his company."

			"At a young age, Eygreas learned from her mother-a strong-willed medusa by the name of Litiasha-that she was the daughter of a powerful boggard priestking. When the tribe of boggards ambushed Litiasha several years after Eygreas's birth, demanding that the medusa release her brazen daughter to them to be sacrificed on an altar to Gogunta, Litiasha barely had time to petrify more than half of the boggard warriors before she was overwhelmed and abducted by them, and sacrificed in her daughter's place. Eygreas barely escaped the onslaught; the traumatic event spurred within her a burning hatred for the froglike denizens of the swamp, and so she honed her skill with her bow and devoted her life to hunting the tribe that had killed her kin. After stealthily slaughtering all of the boggards with her arrows and gaze-and thus removing her only driving motivation-she fell into a realm of madness and bitter isolation.",
			"",
			"Now, the brazen medusa stalks the Thassilonian ruins that dot the southern Mushfens, seeking some sort of artifact or piece of history that will once again give meaning to her life, all the while butchering any she comes across with little regard to their motives or means. Though her memory is mostly shattered, her skill at hunting remains sharp, and she seeks solace from the chaos of her mind by stalking her prey and feasting on their corpses. Still, though she does not remember why, the sight of the toady people of the swamp enrages her to no end, and the only thing that will stop Eygreas from pursuing her current target is the opportunity to hunt a boggard instead."

An elasmotherium's options while grappling a foe in this way are limited-it can either move while grappling the foe, or it can whip its head and attempt to fling the foe as if using the Awesome Blow feat (the damage dealt by this is equal to its gore damage).

			"",
			"**Life-Draining Aura (Su)** At the start of a melacage's turn, each creature within 30 feet that is affected by the melacage's despair ability takes 1d4 points of negative energy damage, and the melacage becomes corporeal for 1 round. It loses the incorporeal subtype and gains a Strength score of 20. Its deflection bonus to AC becomes a natural armor bonus, and its incorporeal touch attack is replaced with two bite attacks. It loses its fly speed and gains a base speed of 30 feet. A creature within the melacage's aura at the start of the melacage's turn can allow itself to be affected by the melacage's despair ability (as if it had failed the Will save) in order to trigger this ability.",
			"",
			"**Rejuvenation (Su)** A melacage exists because it is not aware of how it died. Explaining to a melacage how it died destroys it permanently. If the melacage is destroyed but it still does not know the circumstances of its death, it rejuvenates fully in 1d10 days.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In a world with powerful spells, silent monsters, and a long history that can often affect the present in unexpected ways, death-even mass death-can sometimes come as a surprise. While souls may move on, the sudden feelings of loss and confusion can be left in the world as psychic imprints, and if enough of those feelings exist in one place, they can combine into a melacage. A melacage stays near the place where it formed, trying to transfer its crippling depression to a living creature so that it can become corporeal and investigate the cause of its death.",
			"",
			"An average melacage is around 2 feet in diameter, with four to five humanoid faces on the outside of its body.",
			"",
			"Melacages are usually created in the aftermath of a great, tragic event. This could be anything from the collateral damage of a wizard's duel to a group of subterranean monsters causing lethal tremors and a sudden sinkhole. Whatever that event, it often has these two qualities: it affected a large group of people at once, and that group of people had little to no warning that it was coming.",
			"",
			"Because a melacage is created by lingering emotions and not souls, the number of deaths that it takes to create one of these creatures can vary from one melacage to another. Sometimes the psychic imprint of an entire village will come together to form one melacage, while other times it takes only two or three sudden deaths. A major factor in the creation of melacages comes from the victims' outlook on life while they were alive; a group of happy-go-lucky, optimistic people might be devastated by their sudden deaths and form many melacages, whereas a group of down-on-their-luck folk who were barely scraping by might barely form one. [Gnomes](race/gnome) in particular are vulnerable to forming melacages, as their whimsical nature and vivacious lifestyles can make their unexpected deaths all the more traumatic, though gnomes who have survived the Bleaching almost never form part of a melacage.",
			"",
			"The fact that melacages are formed from lingering emotions and not souls also causes trouble for necromancers who try to create them. Since most spells focus on a corpse or a soul, it is hard to find a spell that targets the essences required to create a melacage; while it can be hard to covertly find the appropriate corpses necessary for casting [animate dead](spell/animate_dead), it can be even harder to quietly kill a large number of people in an unexpected and sudden way. These circumstances mean that academic work on creating melacages is severely lacking and advanced only by unscrupulous professors' side projects.",
			"",
			"The faces of a melacage reflect those who provided the emotions that formed it, although in the case of a melacage created by the confusion and sorrow of a large number of people, the faces are often amalgams of the originals. Bits and pieces of the original creatures' memories remain, mostly having to do with what the creatures were doing when they died. When accessing an individual person's memories, the melacage rotates so this particular face is showing, which can lead to a dizzying discussion if the melacage tries to access multiple different memories at once.",
			"",
			"A melacage that becomes corporeal falls onto the ground with a sickening splat as it simultaneously loses the ability to fly and gains real skin. Such a melacage is reduced to rolling around on the ground to move, and it must attack with its mouths instead of using its incorporeal essence to drain the vitality from other creatures. Despite being brought to the ground, melacages maintain much of the speed they had in their incorporeal forms, and they are able to quickly roll after any victims who try to escape.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Melacages are only as common as the events that create them, which means they tend to be fairly rare. Melacages can show up anywhere, but they form mostly in urban environments. Due to their connections with great tragedies, often the places where they reside are ruined and abandoned.",
			"",
			"Melacages cannot recall the events that lead to their creation, and they cannot rest until they know the reason for their being, yet they are often prevented from investigating their deaths by their own melancholy and despair. This means that their first priority is to find something or someone else to host their overpowering emotions. This has the dual benefits of allowing them to mentally focus on their investigations and allowing them to become corporeal and therefore able to move physical objects in their quests. However, the necessary proximity to the new host of their depression and the damage their emotions inflict upon that creature can lead to misunderstandings of the melacage's intentions, so such attempts often end in violence.",
			"",
			"While a melacage doesn't mind working with people who are investigating its death, its tumultuous and misery-stricken mind can often cause it to become confused as to who is actually helping and who is causing it harm. If a melacage is able to transfer its misery to someone else, the melacage usually becomes easier to reason with. Removing a melacage's anguish can also help people who have figured out the cause of its deaths and are trying to convince it they have discovered the truth, as the emotional shock of discovery makes it difficult for the melacage to make sense of what anyone tells it, and it often denies that such stories could possibly be true.",
			"",
			"Due to their tendency to live in isolated areas, melacages are only rarely reported, usually after adventurers have already removed them. There have been some strange rumors coming out of Nirmathas, however, of a village where melacages seem to be forming for no reason. Given the villagers' preparations for Molthuni aggression, they've so far been able to take care of the melacages with minimal harm to themselves, but they remain flummoxed as to why the undead creatures are being created in the first place. The village is offering a sizable reward for anyone who can figure out the cause and deal with the situation permanently. Current theories point to an underground city that befell tragedy, but no one has been able to locate it."

Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly.",
			"",

			"Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, feystricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories.",
			"",
			"The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror.",
			"",
			"Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby Hellknights) to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns.",
			"",
			"To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identified ( just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inflated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster.",
			"",
			"Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past."

Mercanes are capable of defending themselves, and often carry masterwork Large falchions.

If a situation turns ugly, mercanes typically use their magical abilities to flee, abandoning their hirelings if necessary.",

Each has a secret chest filled with wares stashed away, ready to be pulled out when it's time to haggle and close a deal (or to bribe a potential obstacle). Mercanes are therefore not easily robbed, and they only surrender the contents of a secret chest when they have no other choice. Mercanes have no interest in mundane goods, no matter how fine or rare. Only magical objects earn their attention and their coin. They're known for driving hard, but fair, bargains, and for hiring adventurers from time to time to recover certain goods of interest for a fair price. Although they are not particularly brave, they hold contracts sacrosanct and keep their agreements.",
			"",
			"Rumors and legends abound as to the origins of the mercanes and their reasons for seeking out and buying magical items. Their home plane is unknown, and they have wandered between the worlds for as long as any can recall. Stories claim the mercanes feed on the magic items they acquire, or even need them in order to reproduce. There are also tales of a war in a far corner of the planes, with the mercanes serving the roles of arms merchants, aggressors, or defenders, depending on who tells the story.",

A merfolk's lower body consists of the fins and tail of a great fish. Depending on the region, the scales of merfolk vary in hue, including gleaming silver, pale green, or even blue with stripes of yellow and crimson. Merfolk typically measure 6 to 8 feet in length and weigh over 200 pounds, with females being slightly smaller than males. Although amphibious, merfolk move only with difficulty on land and rarely wander more than a mile from sea.",
			"",

			"",
			"While merfolk outwardly appear to be a beautiful and powerful race, some sages and seafarers whisper that degenerate and mutated merfolk roam the deepest, most isolated regions of the seas and oceans. Some evidence states that this offshoot fell to the worship of twisted and sinister powers lurking in the darkness below, while other theories include all merfolk in this sinister agenda, holding that even those merfolk who believe they control their own destinies are, in fact, merely unknowing puppets of a sinister and unknown master race deep under the sea.",

Adventuring merfolk are most often bards, kineticists, rangers, skalds, sorcerers, and swashbucklers. They explore coastlines and sunken ruins, and they occasionally ally with surface dwellers who use magic to venture beneath the waves. Though adventuring merfolk are more outgoing than settled ones, they always maintain a slight reservation toward non-merfolk. Gaining the unhesitating trust and friendship of a merfolk is a rare accomplishment.",
			"",
			"In shoals, merfolk usually advance as bards, druids, fighters, oracles, rangers, shamans, and skalds. Shoal leaders are often druids, oracles, or shamans with unmatched knowledge of the ocean's denizens and complexion. Leaders are usually referred to by name and hold no title, as they are considered servants, rather than masters, of their communities. Leaders are expected to protect and guide the shoal, keeping its people safe and prosperous. A leader who fails may be exiled or even killed for failing to live up to these expectations.",
			"",
			"Merfolk witches are rare and powerful beings. Merfolk treat witches with respect but fear them for their link with unknown entities. Scholars who are concerned with the potential link between merfolk and an evil race consider merfolk witches to be the foremost agents of their hidden overlords. Merfolk witches are thought to commune with the supernatural beings they serve, carrying out their wishes with unquestioning loyalty.",

They have the same statistics as merfolk, except they have cold resistance 5 and a +2 natural armor bonus. Arctic merfolk tend to be paler than their temperate and tropical kin. Their skin tones are waxen brown, gray, or snow white, and their tails can be gray blue, gray green, ice blue, pearly white, periwinkle, or silver.",
			"",
			"Deep Merfolk (CR 3): [Deep merfolk](monster/deep_merfolk) live near the ocean floor in the cold and lightless depths. While they have humanoid torsos and fish tails akin to other merfolk, their skin is murky and translucent, giving them a ghoulish look, and their long, silvery tails have red fins. Their eerie appearance leads to rumors that deep merfolk are evil creatures and that they worship demons and slaughter innocents. These rumors are unfounded, though; deep merfolk have the same reserved nature as their kin and generally keep to themselves. While individual deep merfolk may lead evil lives, the race as a whole is peaceful and neutral."

Three times per day as a standard action, a merlucent can replicate the effects of a single arcane spell cast within 20 feet of it, directing the spell's effect and choosing a target as if it were the caster. This echo uses the merlucent's caster level rather than that of the original spellcaster, and a merlucent can't echo any effect with a spell level greater than half the merlucent's own Hit Dice (generally limiting it to second-level spells).

			"",
			"**Vitrify (Su)** A merlucent can produce a polyp and implant it in the ear of a willing or helpless creature over the course of 1 minute, during which the merlucent is flat-footed. The polyp begins slowly consuming its host's brain, transforming the creature's flesh into a transparent jelly and replacing its bone with delicate crystal. A creature that takes any amount of Intelligence damage from a merlucent polyp can breathe while underwater, but loses the ability to breathe air. If a humanoid creature takes ability damage in excess of its Intelligence score, it transforms into a new merlucent, losing all abilities or class levels it previously possessed. The polyp can be destroyed by any effect that removes disease, but the inability to breathe air persists until a creature's Intelligence damage is healed.",

			"Merlucents are strange creatures formed from the fusion of human and jellyfish. As a species, they are simple-minded ascetics. Individual clans claim small stretches of coastline where they hunt fish and shellfish, and scratch strange glyphs into coral, coaxing it to grow in unnatural though beautiful formations. Naturally sensitive to arcane energy, they settle in locations rife with ambient magic, such as along ley lines or near schools of magic built on islands or coasts. Local communities generally consider merlucents to be pests for stripping fishing grounds bare, but the aberrations also keep more aggressive aquatic threats away. This small blessing turns bane every 2 to 5 years when merlucents enter their mating phase and become extremely aggressive.",
			"",
			"To reproduce, each merlucent spawns dozens of antsized polyps, each of which must mature inside the skull of a humanoid host. Depending on the host, it can take anywhere from days to weeks for the tiny parasite to take over its host's mind and convert the bony, flesh-covered body into its own adult form. To support their children, merlucents conduct fanatical crusades, kidnapping surface dwellers to act as incubators. Relying on its members' stealth and paralytic poison, a single clan may snatch dozens of unwary sailors or coastal residents in a single season.",
			"",
			"Merlucents range from 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh around 180 pounds, though smaller or larger specimens may be spawned depending on the size of the host.",
			"",
			"A merlucent's natural ability to sniff out and reproduce arcane magic-as well as its dependence on humanoids to reproduce-is suggestive of unnatural origins, though none of Golarion's usual culprits known for creating grotesque hybrids have ever been associated with the jellyfish-folk. Merlucents prefer kidnapping arcane spellcasters to host their young, even though they can spawn in any humanoid and their young rarely inherit a host's spellcasting ability. They also show little interest in the flavor of magic their targets wield. Merlucents were likely an accidental creation, spawned at some unknown point in the past-a grim reminder that magic remains a powerful force beyond any creature's complete control, and its use may produce unexpected consequences.",
			"",
			"Merlucents are carnivores, eating fish, shellfish, and the occasional seabird-with their translucent skin exposing the digestive process for any to see. They have no need for sleep; instead, they tend to drift with the currents, waiting for small fish to swim into their tentacles. They can wait weeks between meals, and ride the tides for hundreds of miles in a state of torpor. However, they can also become ravenous and deplete entire coves in a matter of days.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Merlucents have little in the way of religion or philosophy, and focus primarily on eating and creating art until the mating frenzy consumes them. Long-established colonies may shape coral reefs into elaborate cave systems over generations, complete with air pockets where they keep captives until the colony is ready to implant them with polyps. While merlucents understand other humanoids to be intelligent, they see them as alien and needlessly complex- more akin to termites than neighbors. On rare occasions, merlucents trade with surface dwellers, offering fish, reconnaissance, and scavenged goods in exchange for magic baubles. They rarely use these acquired treasures, instead working them into their ever-expanding coral formations. Merlucents can eventually come to see long-time surface neighbors as beloved pets or a private herd, and show affection by nurturing barnacles to grow on docks and boats to keep the waters clean, or dragging the bloated carcasses of large sea animals to shore for their pets to eat.",
			"",
			"To merlucents' alien senses, magical auras twinkle like soft music or pleasant lights. They treasure potions or wands as humans might treasure music boxes or other delicate trinkets, and they see arcane spellcasters as itinerant performers. Thanks to merlucents' fascination with magic, several clans may follow or worship particularly powerful aquatic wizards and sorcerers, but such aggregations rarely outlast the group's leader.",
			"",
			"After a merlucent rears an indeterminate number of young, a strange new instinct takes over its mind, calling it down into the deepest ocean trenches. These elders form large colonies-sometimes a hundred strong-around thermal vents on the ocean floor. Here, they rear massive schools of jellyfish and cultivate farms of tube worms in vast, swirling formations. Elder merlucents show little interest in eating their livestock, but aggressively defend their colonies against intruders. They become especially aggressive toward deep merfolk, with whom they fight constantly for control of the richest vents. Rather than implanting their young into captive merfolk, merlucents instead hurl their unfortunate enemies into the sea floor's boiling fissures, cooking them alive."

			"",
			"**Morphic Body (Su)** As a standard action, a mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtype- the body assumed must be solid). This ability affects only the mezlan's outward image. Its creature type doesn't change in this new form; it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities, and it retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. This is a polymorph effect.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Weapons (Su)** A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage. Morphic weapons deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its morphic weapons. A mezlan can also attack with a morphic weapon by hurling a portion of its body as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 60 feet (the mezlan swiftly regrows thrown portions of its body after using this attack, while the hurled portion melts away into slime after dealing damage to a target).",
			"",
			"**Skill Pool (Ex)** A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus to any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in and skills that can only be used trained. A mezlan can use any skill, even those that would normally require it to be trained.",
			"",
			"**Store Spells (Sp)** A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the same casting time as the original spell, and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use arcane, divine, and psychic spells, and can carry spells from any number of casters at a given time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan as if storing a spell in an item like a ring of spell storing. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell, choose to lower its spell resistance, and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells can't be absorbed. If a mezlan already holds 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more spells, and any spell of a level exceeding a mezlan's available spell level is not absorbed and affects the mezlan normally. Once a spell is absorbed in this manner, the mezlan can use the spell as its own.",
			"",
			"**Versatile Speech (Ex)** A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Built by ancient arcanists and engineers to serve as spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of those ancient civilizations, close to 1,500 mezlans were created. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day.",
			"",
			"Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even more strange by the fact that they have unique, previously human personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract agreeing to serve as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didn't take, resulting in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Indications of these flaws didn't always reveal themselves before the creatures were deployed, and many such mezlans abandoned their missions to pursue their own mysterious agendas.",
			"",
			"Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them had martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an amorphous form and near immortality.",
			"",
			"Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 negative levels. These negative levels are removed at a rate of 1 per month.",
			"",
			"Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from their previous incorporation, and others never fully recall their previous selves. A mezlan that retains its living memories typically has several class levels, although it should be noted that not all skills and abilities humanoids have in life translate directly to life as a shapeshifting ooze. One notable exception is a mezlan's morphic weapons. While these attacks are natural weapons and a mezlan thus cannot gain iterative attacks, a mezlan who has feats or class abilities that bolster specific weapons can apply the effects of those feats or abilities to its morphic weapons, provided the weapons are of the right shape. For example, a mezlan with Weapon Focus (longsword) would gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with its morphic weapon attacks when they are in the shape of a longsword. This limits the damage type dealt by the morphic weapon to a damage type appropriate to the weapon being duplicated.",
			"",
			"From all appearances, mezlans seem to get along well with each other; however, to normal, living creatures, they often appear strange and unnatural in both form and behavior. They are very observant creatures that study everything they encounter, especially animals and humanoids-a frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use it as a default. Others keep dozens of regular guises and take on the ones most appropriate for particular duties they need to complete, using appearances and personalities as tools throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different shapes.",
			"",
			"### Becoming a Mezlan",
			"",
			"Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings-each is a marriage of transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, rather than any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands more of them. The sheer volume of rare metals needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth. The complex and expensive method for creating a mezlan has long been lost, but rumors hold that one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its kind. Other tales suggest that the ritual of creation survives to this day in a long-lost repository of ancient knowledge hidden deep under the ocean."

A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
			"",
			"**Item Creation (Ex)** A mi-go possesses the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. This ability allows a mi-go to ignore all of the Item Creation feat requirements and spellcasting requirements for creating a magic item; the resulting item is always mi-go technology. A mi-go can use the Heal skill to craft mi-go technology.

			"The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor-the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty.",
			"",
			"Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs."

An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first. A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 17 Reflex save. A successful DC 17 Strength check is needed to pry off a stuck weapon.

A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies. The save DC is Strength-based.",

If a mimic ooze comes into contact with a creature physically, it envelops and consumes that victim, leaving behind nothing but a clean skeleton and any durable gear that the creature was carrying. As a mimic ooze absorbs a victim, it takes on some echoes of its mannerisms and thoughts as well as the target's outward features, which contribute to the ooze's primitive, chaotic mind. These jumbled shadows of thought fall second to the impulse that mimic oozes have to devour sentient humanoids.",

It's rumored that more advanced mimic oozes have been able to form more coherent minds, though these are still alien in their function and purpose."

As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a -4 penalty on Will saves against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached.

Many cultures have legends of how the first minotaurs were created by vengeful or slighted gods who punished humans by twisting their forms, robbing them of their intellects and beauty, and giving them the heads of bulls. Yet most modern minotaurs hold these legends in contempt and believe that they are not divine mockeries but divine paragons created by a potent and cruel demon lord named Baphomet.",

Employing their innate cunning, minotaurs use their maze lairs to vex unwary foes who seek them out or who simply stumble into the lairs and become lost, slowly hunting the intruders as they try in vain to find a way out. Only when despair has truly set in does the minotaur move in to strike at its lost victims. When dealing with a group, minotaurs often let one creature escape, to spread the tale of horror and lure others to their mazes in hope of slaying the beasts. Of course, to minotaurs, these would-be heroes make for delicious meals.",

Relentless, ruthless, and almost unstoppable, these undead monstrosities have an unquenchable thirst for destruction. Dedicated servants of Baphomet or Lamashtu, labyrinth guardians rule their tiny, maze-like kingdoms with fearless power. Depraved minotaurs flock to their banner, hoping for protection and to appease whatever material or divine power the guardian serves.",

			"In life, guardians stood vigil over catacombs, dungeons, or lost cities, and were unique not for their combat prowess, but rather for their endless devotion to their duty and foul gods. This loyalty, coupled with vile rituals whispered by their patrons, bound the guardians' souls to the iron of their armor and resurrected them as twisted, ageless defenders. The same sense of commitment that enabled the guardians' transformation also shackles them to their labyrinthine territories.

			"**Bronze Mask (Su)** A labyrinth minotaur draws agility and ferocity from its bronze mask. When it makes a full-attack action, a labyrinth minotaur wearing its bronze mask can give up its regular attacks and instead make one gore attack or bull rush against each opponent within reach. It must make a separate attack roll against each opponent, and it can't choose to move with targets that are pushed back. A labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a break DC of 40. If a labyrinth minotaur's bronze mask is stolen or destroyed, it can create a replacement with 1 week of work.",
			"",
			"**Natural Cunning (Ex)** Like a normal minotaur, a labyrinth minotaur possesses innate cunning and logical ability, granting it immunity to maze spells and preventing it from ever becoming lost. Further, a labyrinth minotaur is never caught flat-footed.",
			"",
			"**Steel-Shod Hooves (Ex)** A labyrinth minotaur's steel-shod hooves are particularly devastating when used to trample an opponent. A creature that takes full damage from a labyrinth minotaur's trample ability (because the creature either failed its Reflex save or chose to take an attack of opportunity instead of attempting a Reflex save) is knocked prone and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC equal to that of the labyrinth minotaur's trample ability) reduces the duration of the staggered condition to 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are the elite guards and favored servitors of Baphomet. They are thicker and taller than mortal minotaurs, and possess skill in metalcraft that they use to forge armor, weapons, and their personalized and iconic bronze masks. Labyrinth minotaurs eagerly charge intruders, trampling smaller opponents and knocking back larger foes. As they are perceptive, tireless, and incapable of becoming lost, labyrinth minotaurs make excellent guardians of Baphomet's bewildering maze of a domain, the Ivory Labyrinth. Labyrinth minotaurs stand about 11 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs resemble their mortal counterparts, as each has the form of a massive, burly humanoid with thick fur on the chest and legs and a horned, bovine head. The hairless skin of a labyrinth minotaur's head is thin and stretched so tightly over the bone that the beast appears to have just a skull atop its neck. This tight skin makes the creature's sharp eyes bulge from their sockets.",
			"",
			"Unlike mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs have no need to eat or sleep and consider the need for either activity a weakness. Labyrinth minotaurs don't age as mortal creatures do; over the centuries of their existence as guardians and enforcers, they instead accumulate masses of battle scars, which they wear with arrogant pride.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs speak little, but make a lot of noise. They breathe in great snorts, bang their weapons against their armor, and stomp their steel-shod hooves on the ground as they walk. Labyrinth minotaurs seethe with anger and energy, constantly moving about and shifting from hoof to hoof when required to stand in place for more than a few minutes. A labyrinth minotaur prefers to range throughout the narrow, turning corridors of its maze-like hunting grounds, even into dead ends and back, searching for hints of intruders upon which it can vent its bestial fury.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The first minotaurs were created by Lamashtu, and the first and greatest of these creations was none other than Baphomet. These minotaurs came into existence on Golarion in the vast mazes beneath Iblydos. After becoming a demon lord, Baphomet collected the souls of these primal minotaurs and forged them into the labyrinth minotaurs, paragons of their kind and Baphomet's favored servants. The labyrinth minotaurs constantly patrol the twisting pathways of the Ivory Labyrinth to enforce Baphomet's will on lesser denizens of the domain (such as mortal minotaurs and cultists) and to challenge intruders.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are as bestial as their mortal kin and prone to outbursts of violent rage, but their high status in Baphomet's service makes them haughty and given to boasting. They feel contemptuous disdain for all mortal creatures but are particularly derisive of mortal creatures lost or confounded by mazes. Like mortal minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs are perfectly at home in mazes of any kind and are incapable of becoming lost. This affinity for mazes applies to their thinking as well-despite their brutish demeanors, labyrinth minotaurs are good with puzzles and are keen tactical thinkers. When labyrinth minotaurs meet in peace, they sometimes exchange inscrutable riddles or short descriptive puzzles (such as, \"How would you drink a drop of blood inside a severed eyeball while it's in an iron coffer sunk to the bottom of a well without getting wet or being seen by the eye\"?).",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer gear and armor made of bronze and steel, as few other materials are sufficiently sturdy for them to use over a long period of time. In addition to their steel shoes, heavy armor, and massive greataxes, all labyrinth minotaurs wear heavy bronze masks. Each labyrinth minotaur makes its own mask, and some spend weeks or even months obsessively shaping and reshaping the bronze over hot forges. At first glance, each of these bronze masks might seem superficially similar, but upon closer inspection a viewer can clearly see the subtle embellishments built in by the individual labyrinth minotaur. These flourishes communicate the minotaur's status and history to other servants of Baphomet. A labyrinth minotaur often adds an embellishment to its mask when it accomplishes an important task on Baphomet's behalf or kills a particularly powerful intruder. A labyrinth minotaur's obsession makes its mask more than mere ornamentation- each is mystically connected to its mask.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs prefer to patrol alone or in small gangs. They maintain a central communal headquarters that's usually crewed by about six members, with the fiercest labyrinth minotaur commanding the others through bullying and intimidation. This headquarters is concealed deep within a maze and serves as a safe storage area, a locus for discussing strategy, and the site of the gang's forge and metalworking tools.",
			"",
			"When labyrinth minotaurs meet others of their kind while out patrolling a maze, they usually share a short exchange of riddles or boasts. Occasionally, labyrinth minotaurs recognize each other as being on opposite sides of sprawling, ancient rivalries. In such cases, the first labyrinth minotaur to recognize the other as an enemy surges forward with murderous fury, hoping to catch its rival off guard. Large congregations of labyrinth minotaurs are rare-even when large groups don't engage in these feuds, labyrinth minotaurs fall into divisive boasting that frequently erupts into bloodshed anyway.",
			"",
			"Labyrinth minotaurs are rarely encountered outside of the Ivory Labyrinth, and therefore have little interaction with other races beyond visitors to their master's realm. Labyrinth minotaurs display grudging respect for glabrezu and vilsteth demons and undisguised contempt for mortal minotaurs and cultists of Baphomet. Their arrogance precludes true camaraderie with anyone other than those of their own kind."

Marauders also skirmish with other monstrous inhabitants of their rocky badlands-especially harpies and centaurs, for whom they hold a legendary hatred-to claim the best land, lairs, and water sources.",
			"",

These childhood games eventually evolve into contests of arms, speed, and marksmanship that often result in painful-but not debilitating-permanent injuries that contribute to the marauders' legendarily short tempers.",
			"",
			"Marauders show a keener mind for tactics than do many of their kin. While they still prefer to finish enemies off with a gorespattering axe blow, they see nothing wrong with first softening up opponents from a distance with a bow or a few well-placed traps. They can control their aggression well enough to benefit from hit-and-run tactics, charging an overwhelming force before falling back to lure their enemy into an ambush, a rockslide, or-in the case of flying pests like harpies-nets. Thanks to their varied responsibilities and opponents, marauders train until they achieve incredible skill with both axes and bows. They make the most of the labyrinthine caverns and twisting canyons of their domains to confuse and separate foolish enemies who press into their lands.",

			"These minotaurs show an uncharacteristic kindness to beasts of the field, sometimes training goats, dogs, or bulls to serve them as pets and guardians."

			"Weaker than many of their brutish kin, tangle tenders instead apply their racial cunning and understanding of complex systems to mechanical devices, constructing ingenious traps that whittle away those lost in the labyrinths with little or no direct danger to themselves. They build and reset traps, alter or conceal carefully whatever trails their victims attempt to leave, and strike from the shadows only once their victims are desperate, exhausted, and at each others' throats. Their tactics aren't motivated by cowardice; rather, these cruel creators love to inflict misery by outwitting their enemies rather than out-muscling them. Tangle tenders belong to the maze; they are intimately familiar with every twist and turn, and are keen to introduce interlopers to each in turn. Among minotaur tribes, tangle tenders hold a strange position, both necessary and loathed. They never shy away from bragging about their genius, and their kin recognize the value of a tangle tender's devices for trapping prey. But minotaurs respect strength, courage, and aggression first and foremost, and these clever rogues excel at none of those qualities-most thus see these trapsmiths as socially stunted, needlessly sadistic (even by minotaur standards), and physically weak to the point of embarrassment. Few voice these opinions, however, as those who do frequently face tragic accidents deep within the maze."

			"This small, carnivorous stinging nettle commonly grows in mires. It preys mostly on amphibians, fish, and small mammals, though they have been known to attack and kill much larger prey, especially when hunting in groups. Mire nettles are infamous for their hollow, needlelike thorns, which contain a natural toxin that causes extreme pain. While not lethal in and of itself, the pain caused by the toxins is intensely overwhelming.",

			"While most consider mire nettles a nuisance, certain humanoids make use of them. Some cultivate the plants to mark territorial boundaries, while others repurpose the toxic thorns to make blowgun darts or use them in snares or traps. A few tribes incorporate them for rituals in which young members of the tribe must endure hours of pain from the nettle's toxin as a rite of passage into adulthood. A creature can harvest 1d4 doses of mire nettle toxin from a freshly slain plant with a successful DC 20 Survival check. Mire nettle toxin retains its potency for 6 hours after the plant's death, but certain alchemical processes (requiring a successful DC 20 Craft [alchemy] check, 30 minutes of work, and the expenditure of 50 gp of reagents per dose) can extend the potency of the toxin to 1 week."

			"",
			"**Mirror Sight (Ex)** A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision.",
			"",
			"**Scrying Focus (Su)** Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Soul Mirror (Su)** The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex)** The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby.",
			"",
			"While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their lookingglass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however- any caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man.",
			"",
			"There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves.",
			"",
			"### Construction",
			"",
			"The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.",

			"#### Description",

			"Mirror serpents are large snakelike beasts that soar as easily through air as they do water. Ages ago, Azlanti sorcerers employed these serpents to guard their sanctums and vaults. Over the millennia since Earthfall, mirror serpents have grown feral and fiercely territorial. Because they lack the ability to reproduce and grow their number, mirror serpents are quite rare. The arcane knowledge of their creation rituals hasn't resurfaced in the current age; if anyone has discovered it, they have kept it a closely guarded secret. Most surviving mirror serpents reside within the ruins of Azlant, staying near the places they were once tasked to guard. Their original purpose as sentinels has imprinted on them a fascination for treasure. Mirror serpents typically live several centuries, unless they suffer a violent fate, but death does not necessarily spell an end to their existence, which is a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Mirror serpents grow much larger and wiser as they age beyond their first century.",
			"",
			"A mirror serpent's body stretches out to a length of 15 feet and weighs 400 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike most other creatures, mirror serpents don't permanently die unless their remains are purposefully destroyed to prevent rebirth. Each mirror serpent carries within its body an egg that holds the seed of its next life and matures along with its natural aging. If a mirror serpent dies prematurely, the egg within it simply decays along with the rest of the creature's internal organs. When a mirror serpent dies of natural causes, however, its soft tissue is absorbed into the egg as a final act of fertilization, leaving the egg amid the hollow husk of the serpent's reflective skin. Water is the most ideal location for the egg's 13-month incubation to take place, and thus when dying, most mirror serpents head for the nearest large body of water. The egg has an exceptionally hard, crystalline shell that protects it from predatory fauna and other dangers while it incubates. Additionally, shortly after an egg is fertilized, it becomes naturally invisible as a defense mechanism. If the egg remains intact, it eventually hatches, releasing a young mirror serpent into its predecessor's territory. While the newborn mirror serpent has its own personality, some echoes remain of the previous incarnation, such as intuitions on safe and dangerous areas nearby and an instinctual gravitation toward its old lair.",
			"",
			"While mirror serpents resemble snakes in many regards, their snouts are elongated and toothy, like the face of a gharial, and pair of crystalline horns crowns their brows. The reflective sheen of a mirror serpent's scales can be quite dazzling in bright sunlight as it dives into or leaps out of water, chasing birds and fish with equal prowess. The structure of a mirror serpent's scales resembles that of actual glazed mirrors, making the creatures vulnerable to sonic attacks. Mirror serpent flesh is hardy and resembles cloudy glass, and they bleed slightly luminescent blue liquid when they're wounded.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents' primary diet consists of amphibian and avian animals that live in or near their territories, though they are typically not opposed to eating those humanoids foolish enough to blunder into their domains, especially if the mirror serpent guards treasure of particular power, secrecy, or value. These serpents rarely fight to the death unless they feel there's no other choice. One function of their hunting is to keep major predators away from their territory so that when the mirror serpent dies, its egg has a better chance of surviving its incubation period. Mirror serpents use their natural invisibility when investigating whether creatures are food or a threat. When they choose to fight, mirror serpents make sudden attacks and retreats, turning invisible in order to hide their movements and strike from a new vantage point. They use their savage bites to separate their foes and attempt to fling them into water, where the serpents can take advantage of their superior mobility.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Most mirror serpents lair near or within ancient Azlanti ruins so they can seek out and collect treasures and trinkets that lie forgotten among Earthfall's devastation. Each lair is usually located near a body of water, and its opening is most likely overlooking or hiding below the water's surface. A common place for a den is on the side of a natural cliff or a part of a ruined tower that has no other access points. Even when the entrance is below the surface, the actual living area is situated above water level. When in their lairs, mirror serpents lie curled in the center, while their treasure is spread against the surrounding walls. Not all of the treasure-or even most of it-is of actual monetary value, since items need only to gleam and be beautiful to catch the attention of the serpents. Mirrored scales, or even a complete husk, are often found among the piled treasure as the newest incarnation has dragged the glittering remains of the previous mirror serpent into the lair.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpents hate creatures that defile nature or deface structures within their domain, causing them to become violent from the outset. It's possible to communicate with mirror serpents by speaking Azlanti; the knowledge of that language was imbued in the creatures during the ritual of their creation and remains with them through each rebirth. Once a person has entered the territory of a mirror serpent, there's a small window of opportunity to speak up in order to keep it from attacking and driving the intruder away. An offering of treasure or ornate trinkets goes a long way toward appeasing a mirror serpent to allow swift safe passage through its domain. If the territories of two mirror serpents are adjacent to each other, minor clashes may arise between the two beasts. Such fights rarely lead to death, as one them eventually yields to the more powerful rival, accepting defeat over endangering even its greatest enemy's cycle of rebirth.",
			"",
			"Mirror serpent scales are a valued material for those who craft magical armor. With proper techniques, it's possible to forge a suit of scale mail that retains a portion of the spell-reflecting ability that mirror serpents have. If a person comes upon a mirror serpent egg, she can attempt to train the newly hatched serpent and turn it into a guardian or a companion. However, the echoes of lifetimes it has spent free in the wild make this a challenge."

The mngwa fades away permanently if its focus of hate dies (or if all members of the group die). A mngwa knows the direction and general distance to its focus of hate (or the nearest member in the case of a group). This sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks scrying. While its focus of hate exists, a mngwa destroyed through violence fades away and reappears fully restored in 1d4+1 days.

Legendary for their skill at evading hunters, mngwas sometimes haunt a region for centuries, continuing to stalk the members of large tribes or extended families responsible for some ancient transgression.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mockingfey originally stem from the otherworldly realm of the fey, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or \"mockingdells,\" inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly uses its mock ability to appear as a perfect, miniature version of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unflattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish.",
			"",
			"This gibberish is not solely for comic effect. While mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters and can speak and understand Sylvan when necessary, they generally refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain whatever they wish to describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances.",
			"",
			"While many people find mockingfey's antics irritating, the little creatures can make surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and other realities. When such planar rifts occur between this world and the realm of the fey, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, and their presence in a region can be a reliable indication that such a breach between worlds exists somewhere nearby. In such situations, mockingfey often seek out more powerful fey creature to dwell near, as a source of both protection and entertainment. Of course, even fey can grow frustrated with the constant attention afforded by a jape of mockingfey!",
			"",
			"Mockingfey can serve spellcasters as familiars, and often enjoy the opportunity such servitude affords to travel and see the world with the safety and protection provided by an allied spellcaster. Illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have a caster level of 4th or higher to gain a mockingfey familiar.",

			"",

			"Those who slay many over the course of their lifetimes, be they serial killers, mass-murderers, warmongering soldiers, or battle-driven berserkers, become marked and tainted by the sheer weight of their murderous deeds. When such killers are brought to justice and publicly executed for their heinous crimes before they have a chance to atone, the remains sometimes return to unlife to continue their dark work as a mohrg.",
			"",
			"Undead things caring less for life than they did before their own deaths, mohrgs exist solely to wreak havoc on the living. Sometimes mistaken for skeletons or zombies, they are far more dangerous than those mindless abominations, retaining some semblance of their own memories-and the delight they once took in hearing the screams of the dying.",
			"",
			"When possible, mohrgs gather in small groups, seeking out lone targets much as they did in life. If faced with capable foes, a mohrg attempts to incapacitate them one by one, starting with divinely empowered characters first, both to protect itself from holy wrath, and to make the task of paralyzing and devouring the others that much easier.",
			"",
			"Some mohrgs retain enough of their former memories that they return to the favored locations of their pasts, \"haunting\" old hideouts and sometimes even resuming the depredations of murderers long dead, falling back on means of death and mayhem that were more comfortable in their breathing days. Such mohrgs are even more insane than most undead beings, and can sometimes be found wandering the streets of a city or town in cowls and cloaks, carrying on their old life's work of slaughter and murder as best they can.",
			"",
			"Of course, since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as undead themselves, the murders of a mohrg do not go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only upon society's dregs. A sudden uprising of undead in the streets is the inevitable result of a mohrg's attentions. Since these zombies remain under the mohrg's control, and since the mohrg itself possesses a hateful and cruel intelligence, it often holds its undead army in reserve, even commanding it to lie motionless until several weeks or months have passed and the local graveyard is filled with the sleeping dead. Then, when the time is right, the mohrg calls upon its army to rise and aid it in finishing the slaughter.",
			"",
			"### Variants",
			"",
			"**Source** [Undead Revisited pg. 31](source/undead_revisited) A mohrg is as much a product of the method of its execution as it is an undead manifestation of one who, in life, was a murderous criminal or warmonger. At times, unusual methods of execution can trigger equally unusual mohrgs. The extreme nature of these executions are such that these variant mohrgs are only rarely created by accident- more often, they are deliberate creations by officials who themselves dabble in necromancy and may in fact be as vile as those they put to death.",
			"",
			"Desert Mohrg (+0 CR): A desert mohrg rises from a violent criminal who has been executed via torturous means in arid, hot environments, typically methods designed to kill through exposure and draw out the criminal's expiration. Being affixed to a rock, tree, or other object and being buried up to the neck and left to bake in the sun are both methods that can result in the creation of desert mohrgs. A desert mohrg looks leathery and dry, not moist, but has the same statistics as a typical mohrg. Spawn created by a desert mohrg rise as [burning skeletons](unknown/burning_skeletons) rather than fast zombies.",
			"",
			"Fleshwalker Mohrg (+0 CR): When a criminal is executed through methods that leave no physical mark upon the body (such as by poison or a death effect), and then the corpse is preserved via a [gentle repose](spell/gentle_repose) spell, a fleshwalker mohrg is the result. While these mohrgs function as normal mohrgs, their flesh does not decay- further castings of gentle repose are unnecessary. Only upon close inspection (whereupon one might notice a faint underlying charnel stench, or might note the lack of breathing with a DC 30 Perception check) or in combat (when the creature's hideous tongue extrudes from its mouth) is the truth apparent.",
			"",
			"Frost Mohrg (+1 CR): Distinctive for the icy sheen over the blue flesh of its innards and tendrils, a frost mohrg's genesis is similar to that of a desert mohrg-a violent criminal that is executed via lingering exposure to the elements, only in this case, in a cold environment. Frost mohrgs look partially frozen and retain much of their flesh, albeit flesh blackened by frostbite. A frost mohrg has the [advanced](monster/template/advanced) creature simple template, and its attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage on a hit. Mohrg-mother (+1 CR): Perhaps among the most perverse category of mohrg arises when the executed murderer is also pregnant with child. The unborn, undead infants of these nightmarish monsters cling to the exposed entrails of the mohrg, but do not grant any additional powers. All mohrg-mothers always have the [advanced](monster/template/advanced) creature simple template. Once per day, a mohrg-mother can choose to animate a recently slain victim as another mohrg instead of as a fast zombie."

			"A spawning canker is a terrible dual creature, an unnatural parasite and the decapitated humanoid body its tentacles writhe from like a knot of lashing, aberrant heads. Few ever see a spawning canker without its humanoid armor, but within the chest cavity of these hollowed-out hosts squirms a heartlike body contorting with a misassembled mass of fetal features and trailing a thicket of spiny tendrils. These tendrils lash from the stump of the host body's exploded head, but also riddle the body, taking control of muscles and organs like the strings of some abominable puppet master. The body of a former host is pumped full of strange excretions and reinforced with the tendrils riddling its form, giving what appears to be a crippled frame an unnatural strength and speed. Those tentacles that extend forth serve as both the thing's sensory organs and its feeding tubes, through which a canker drains the essence of other thinking creatures. Once it has gorged itself, a spawning canker erupts in a burst of obscene generation, its body withering with terrible speed, splitting both its own and its stolen essence into tentacles. These limbs split and tear from the remains of the canker's body as writhing, dumb slugspawn, parasitic terrors with no desire but to infest other living creatures and, through their deaths, spread ever more of their terrible kind.",
			"",
			"A typical spawning canker stands as tall as the humanoid body it infests, plus 2 to 3 feet of added height from its dozen or so wild tendrils.",
			"",
			"### Slugspawn (CR 5)",
			"",
			"Bloated alien worms the length of a man's forearm, slugspawn are the basest form of a moit of Shub- Niggurath. These repulsive creatures possess sluglike bodies the color of rotting algae, covered with thick mucus. Vulnerable to the predations oflarger creatures, slugspawn rarely venture forth on their own. Although they can move at a speed of 10 feet per round, slugspawn frequently hide themselves in dark pools or shadowy crevices, waiting for the warm flesh and pliant brains they crave to come to them.",
			"",
			"Upon entering a square with a slugspawn in it (or if attacked by a slugspawn), a creature must make a DC 16 Perception check to note that a slugspawn is something other than a normal slug (though hidden slugspawn can be more difficult to detect). If this Perception check is failed, the slugspawn leaps upon the creature and burrows into its flesh. The creature can attempt a DC 16 Reflex save to avoid the slugspawn, but only if the creature is aware of the slugspawn's presence. Any amount of damage reduction is enough to provide immunity to infestation.",
			"",
			"Once a slugspawn has infested a living body, it burrows toward the host's skull and wraps around the lower brain, growing and feeding upon the energies generated by thought. On the first round of infestation, dealing cold damage to the victim can kill the slugspawn and save the host-but only if the victim takes 10 or more points within 1 round of being infested. Cutting the slugspawn out also works, but the longer it remains in a host, the more damage this method does. Cutting it out requires a slashing weapon and a DC 25 Heal check, and deals 1d6 points of damage per round that the host has been infested. If the Heal check is successful, the slugspawn is removed. After 3 rounds, though, the slugspawn has reached the host's brain and cannot be surgically removed without killing the host. Remove disease kills any slugspawn in or on a host.",
			"",
			"After a slugspawn has reached a host's brain, it proves to be a beneficial parasite-at least initially. A slugspawn's host benefits from complete immunity to mind-affecting effects, as the slugspawn's presence confuses and devours such magic. This benefit doesn't last for long, though, as after a variable period (typically lasting 2d6 days in humanoids, though sometimes more or less in other creature types) the slugspawn matures into a spawning canker, a new stage in its lifecycle that begins with it violently devouring its host's brain, erupting from its skull, and taking over the beheaded host body-a nearinstantaneous process that immediately kills the host. The result is a new creature, a spawning canker garbed in its former host's skin. If the host is killed before the slugspawn fully matures, the parasite undergoes a rapid, emergency maturation, taking control of the host body as if it had fully matured-though such spawning cankers rarely prove as long-lived as their fully matured brethren."

Mokele-mbembes require large quantities of food daily, and feed on fish, birds, and even large mammals' humanoids included.

A healthy mome rath is up to 6 feet long including its muscular tail, and weighs around 100 pounds."

When they do so, they often ally with powerful celestials, serving amid their forays as scouts and wise council.",

Creatures other than morgodeas and cockroaches within the cloud at the beginning of their turns take 1d6 points of damage. Any creature damaged by the cockroach cloud must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be exposed to a dose of morgod jelly.

A morgodea gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+6 for most morgodeas). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts a modicum of implanted intelligence in them, allowing the morgodea to train cockroaches and giant cockroaches and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats).

As a standard action, it can place an impulse into the mind of a single creature suffering from morgod jelly addiction within 60 feet. This functions as per the command spell, but the morgodea and its target do not need to hear or understand one another. Alternatively, the morgodea can inspire visions of insects crawling under the target's skin, sickening the target for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 15 Will save negates either effect. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Compelled to corrupt and debase, these disgusting creatures deal in a pleasure that can plunge their victims into the depths addiction and madness. Morgodeas appear as human or elven vagrants covered in dirty rags. These \"rags\" are actually layered flaps of hide the morgodea can open to reveal a brood of cockroaches crawling amid its waxy, yellow flesh. Large pores in its body constantly weep a pale, thick jelly that sustains its nest of vermin and inspires euphoric visions in humanoids.",

			"In combat, a morgodea's cockroach brood erupts into a flesh-eating cloud to defend their master. The fey itself can extend a hidden chitinous pincer from its abdomen, and needlelike stings from the palm of each hand. It uses its massive claw to restrain victims while it injects them with its addictive venom again and again. A victim caught in this way is overwhelmed by the morgodea's druglike poison, and the prey's consequent hallucinations render its attacker indistinguishable in the teeming mass of hissing, gel-smeared insects, even as the morgodea holds it in place. A morgodea stands 5 to 6 feet tall and weighs around 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas originated in the First World, where they once cleaned the filth and refuse from the Eldests' glittering cities. Some ancestral crime corrupted their entire bloodline, and saw their people banished to the Material Plane, where their bodies twisted and warped to mirror their foul, covetous hearts. They can eat any sort of rotting organic matter, but prefer the flesh of humanoid creatures rendered comatose by their addictive jelly. These awful monsters keep such victims alive as long as possible, carefully consuming only those parts of their victims' bodies that will not necessarily kill the prey. The addict's brain is the foremost delicacy, and saved for a final feast.",
			"",
			"Morgodeas reproduce by inserting a single egg into a comatose addict. Within days, the egg develops into a larva, which burrows its way into the brain and consumes it, and then begins to merge with the brainless body. Throughout this time, the parent keeps its young hidden away in a foul place, while the body emits a pheromone to attract cockroaches from the surrounding area to inhabit the corpse-laying eggs and multiplying by the hundreds-while feeding from the jelly produced by the growing larva. After 4 weeks, the body reawakens as an adult morgodea, already host to a large swarm of the insects and covered in porous, waxy flesh that weeps its own supply of morgod jelly.",
			"",

			"Morgodeas are strongly attracted to sprawling urban areas, where they nestle against the dark underbelly of civilization. Such settlements must be large enough to provide a level of anonymity to their inhabitants. Morgodeas' secret infestation of cities is like a foul disease creeping through the bloodstream to infect the vital organs of society. An infestation begins with a lone morgodea claiming a lair-often an abandoned building or sewer-and clearing the surrounding area of other predators before it begins selling the dubious pleasures of its jelly to the desperate and demented. Soon thereafter, the monster's growing number of thralls secure its place in the underworld and bring it rotting meats and fruits, strong alcohols, and sugary sweets in payment. Eventually, those overwhelmed by addiction slip into a nightmare-filled coma before becoming a meal or a newborn morgodea.",
			"",
			"A morgodea's nest slowly grows alongside its influence and stock of customers. A full infestation of morgodeas rarely contains more than five or six of the creatures, and even then, only the largest of cities and metropolises that can sustain such numbers without rapid detection of the nest. Morgodeas in excess of this number leave the nest to seek out new settlements to infest, or else are devoured by their own families long before they gestate from their larval states.",

This ability doubles the normal +8 racial bonus to Climb checks normally afforded creatures with a climb speed to a +16 racial bonus.",

While jumping, a morlock does not provoke attacks of opportunity for leaving a threatened square.",

Up to two morlocks can share the same square at the same time. If two morlocks in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.",

			"Degenerate humans long lost from the world of light, morlocks have regressed through years of subterranean dwelling into ravenous, barely thinking beasts of the endless night. They no longer remember the civilized lives their ancestors led, although many morlock tribes still dwell in the shattered ruins of their ancient homes. Ironically, in many cases morlocks worship the statues left behind by these ancestors as their gods. Morlock priests of such ancestor worship have access to the domains of Darkness, Earth, Madness, and Strength. A typical morlock stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs roughly 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"Morlocks move about on two legs at times, but often drop down to a creepy four-limbed shuffle when speed or stealth is necessary. Their wiry, often emaciated frames mask the strength of their limbs and their swift reactions.",
			"",
			"Morlocks typically give birth to broods of three to four babies at a time, ravenous creatures born with a full set of teeth and a cannibalistic predisposition. The first few weeks of a brood's life must be carefully mothered to prevent attrition-it usually takes that long for the morlock young to overcome their natural inclination to feed on whatever is closest. Morlocks mature quickly, achieving adulthood after only 5 years of life. A typical morlock can live to a ripe old age of 60-although the majority of their kind die far sooner than that due to violence.",

			"**Source** [Darklands Revisited pg. 31](source/darklands_revisited) Morlocks most often worship their ancient human ancestors, idealized versions of the legendary pure beings their race once resembled. As they don't venerate deities, these morlocks do not have access to cleric domains and most often take levels in oracle and shaman, with witches filling in as arcane servants of their tribes' ancestors in rare cases. Because morlocks have severe racial penalties to Charisma, many of their spiritual leaders are actually ancestor-touched morlocks, possessing a preternatural presence that makes them effective divine spellcasters.",
			"",
			"Ancestor-Touched Morlock (CR +0): Occasionally, morlocks are born as conduits for the divine powers they serve. Believing themselves to be mouthpieces for their ancestors, such morlocks are actually the reincarnated souls of the very ancestors they worship. These ancestor-touched morlocks gain a +6 bonus to their Charisma scores and can cast cure light wounds or inflict light wounds (select one) three times per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals the morlock's HD). Because of the awe and fear other morlocks have for these divine conduits, they lose their swarming racial ability."

			"The connection between [elves](race/elf) and [ghouls](monster/ghoul) is not clearly understood; elves are resistant to ghouls' paralyzing touch, but not the disease that transforms humanoids into ghouls. Angheuvore mortics, or \"half-ghouls,\" are lanky, pallid creatures with an insatiable hunger for flesh. They have the long ears and featureless, dark eyes characteristic of elves but have a larger jaw filled with sharp teeth. Born from elven parents afflicted with [ghoul fever](disease/ghoul_fever) or otherwise subjected to necromantic energies, angheuvores are often shunned as children due to their appetites. They typically grow up on their own or among degenerate communities of other angheuvores. Never fully satisfied without a belly full of humanoid flesh, angheuvores lurk at the edges of civilization looking for opportunities to sate their appetites. Some angheuvores keep other humanoids as prisoners to feast upon at their leisure, and the victims in these \"larders\" live in constant fear of becoming the next meal. Angheuvores living within humanoid communities often keep a low profile by subsisting on corpses and frequently work as gravediggers, morticians, or physicians.",
			"",
			"Like elves, angheuvores are long lived, often drifting from community to community for centuries. They share an appreciation for art, although angheuvore aesthetics are often unpleasant to other humanoids, as they predominantly center on the look and smell of blood, flesh, and organs. Unlike elves, angheuvores aren't particularly patient and don't take any particular care to live in harmony with their surroundings.",
			"",
			"Angheuvores and ghouls get along reasonably well, and they often share hunting territory or even coexist in the same isolated communities. Angheuvores enjoy the elven immunity to the ghouls' paralyzing toxin, but angheuvores are as susceptible to ghoul fever as any other humanoid, and can become infected via infighting or even by sharing food. An angheuvore who dies from ghoul fever always putrefies and rises as a ghast. These ghasts retain their memories and any class levels acquired by the angheuvore; the transition from living to undead is not as jarring a step for an angheuvore.",

			"Perhaps the most miserable of the mortics-humanoids infused with necrotic energy-etiolings are born from gnomes who have already begun to suffer from the Bleaching. The burst of negative energy into their living flesh twists the process and awakens connections to the First World and long-lost fey magic, leaving the surviving creature ethereal, manic, and overflowing with the vital essence of fey. While they resemble bleachling gnomes, veins of primal, First World energy pump beneath an etioling's pale flesh. Occasional pulses of unchecked energy crackle across their flesh and hair.",
			"",
			"Their transformation is hardly one of redemption. An etioling's touch decays living flesh to fuel the supernatural furnace that rages inside them, and their bodies shake uncontrollably as the churn of primordial magic and negative energy causes tremors and muscle spasms. Focusing for more than a few moments becomes impossible, and etiolings become creatures of instinct and impulse, acting on vague memories and emotional connections. Like ghosts, they stick for days or weeks into a routine, reliving some pivotal memory and assigning familiar identities to new people they meet. Etiolings suspend not only their living functions but also their physical connection to the living world, becoming ethereal when they hold their breath.",

			"An etioling stands between 2 and 3 feet tall and weighs about 25 pounds.",

Their existence is a constant battle of wills between the heady, screaming rush of euphoria provided by their rekindled connection to the First World and any semblance of rational thought. The struggle to maintain themselves can be overwhelming, and those who don't succumb to mania are often aggressive and irritable instead. This supernatural wellspring of emotion forces bleachling apathy from their bodies, manifesting it as a physical ectoplasm capable of turning aside attacks and infecting other creatures.",
			"",
			"Like most mortics, etiolings spring forth from disaster. Anywhere negative energy intrudes on the living world- especially in powerful surges-gnomes risk this unnatural transformation. The infusion of necrotic power hijacks the Bleaching that most gnomes succumb to, warping their minds and reigniting ancient connections to sylvan magic. Most mortic gnomes develop unsettling or \"ghostly\" magic focusing on illusions, fear, and confusion, but others develop more primordial and fey magic that hijacks others' emotions and inspires endless revelry.",
			"",
			"Whether courtesy of the negative energy replacing their souls or the powerful fey magic that burns inside them, etiolings can briefly slip from the physical world and become ghostly apparitions capable of flight and passing through solid matter. This ethereal state silences the mania bubbling from within and allows the crushing bleachling depression to flow over them, providing painful respite from their energetic lives. Because this unearthly state severs them from the wellspring of emotion that powers their magic, they cannot use any of their sylvan magic while incorporeal.",

			"Those etiolings who survive their radical change with their minds largely intact often band together in small communities for support. More often, evil and abusive fey flock to the mortic gnomes-attracted by the sylvan magic and primal emotion like flies to honey-and orbit the etioling to bask in the chaos they create or prey on creatures weakened by the dread gnome's deadly caress.",
			"",
			"Thanks to their magic and incidental allure to fey, etiolings usually find homes in primeval wildernesses. Even those who take up residence in permanent structures find their magic and unwanted followers transforming any dwelling into an overgrown ruin within weeks. Because they cannot control their corrupting touch, anything the gnomes interact with regularly is scrubbed clean of life, from insects and moss to gardens to mortal neighbors. While the world around them flourishes, their own circles decay into tumbledown sterility.",
			"",
			"Storms bring some measure of calm to the etioling's mind-as if the primordial energy within them were siphoned off by the more powerful forces swirling about- and the mortics can seem truly mad as they rejoice in dangerous weathers. Most are simply intoxicated by the terrible but awesome displays of nature, though a few become true servants of powerful weather-controlling outsiders or fey, striking grim bargains to bring suffering to others in exchange for control over their own unstable minds."

Gurgists can feel the decay of their flesh, just as they can feel the urgings of their gullet to rend and consume meat until they bloat with it. But unlike zombies and other carnivorous undead, mortics still have their wits about them and use their minds to find solutions to their nature. They hunt and herd to keep the rot at bay, they obsess over crafts or skills to distract from the hunger, and they wear extravagant masks and colorful garments to hide their hideousness.",

A [zombie's](monster/template/zombie) bite will do the trick, but so too will a [mummy's](monster/mummy) curse or a necromancer's enchantment, giving rise to a metaphysical anomaly that causes the gurgist's body to think itself dead and free to rot. The body first grows pale, and then develops purple-red splotches on its skin as the blood stills and stagnates. If the gurgist isn't careful, her flesh then grows gray or waxy and begins to rot, with hideous sores opening. A gurgist who allows this to persist will eventually see large parts of her body liquefy, which usually proves fatal to the gurgist in question.",
			"",
			"The only way for a gurgist to stop the process is to eat raw meat-the more, the better. Through some occult means, the gurgist's half-dead biology then repairs itself and can even reverse smaller changes.

This hunger is a constant, gnawing sensation at the back of a gurgist's mind, and while it doesn't drive her to madness, it certainly drives her to distraction. Luckily for all involved, gurgists have at best a very mild preference for human flesh, and so most subsist on enormous quantities of raw beef, pork, or wild game.",

Instead, most live in small villages out on the outskirts of civilization, in wild lands where law breaks down and a community of masked half-dead can live, if not unnoticed, then at least unmolested.",
			"",
			"Gurgist villages devote great effort to dealing with the twin problems of rot and hunger. Gurgists ensure there is always plenty of meat around, and so they often become herders and hunters. Many extend their animal-tending skills to other beasts as well. Gurgists are infinitely creative when it comes to taming the local wildlife, and their half-dead hardiness means they can risk dealing with creatures that other people would avoid, such as [ankhegs](unknown/ankhegs), [chimeras](unknown/chimeras), [griffons](unknown/griffons), and [mammoths](unknown/mammoths). Gurgists also think of weaker undead as just one more type of beast to train, though no gurgist willingly deals with zombies of any stripe- the similarities are simply too close for comfort.",
			"",
			"Dealing with the hunger is harder. Most gurgist communities use distraction to keep themselves sane. Gurgists find a hobby or activity and focus all their will and drive on that one thing, until it becomes greater in their minds than their hunger. Gurgists might become master animal trainers or leatherworkers, painters, carvers, poets, or anything else that keeps the edge of hunger at bay. In some gurgist villages, all residents choose the same mania, elevating it to something akin to a religion. More often, they each pursue their own private obsessions, placing their skills in the service of their communities.",
			"",
			"Masks and clothing are vital parts of gurgist culture. While there are exceptions, most gurgists find their slow rot no more pleasing to the eye than outsiders do. They instead make beautiful and colorful garb, with particular emphasis placed on unique and eye-catching masks. Gurgists wear their masks constantly, tying them with leather bands or in extreme cases even sewing them to their half-rotted flesh, and many gurgists consider their masks to be their true faces. Gurgist masks also often say something about the gurgists' roles in their community. Hunters or warriors have small, elegant masks, while artisans have more extravagant masks adorned with symbols of their trade.",

In wilder areas, such as in the depths of the Mwangi Expanse or near the Crown of the World, gurgists are sometimes even accepted as neighbors by local human communities-not necessarily comfortable or friendly, but as allies against more dangerous forces."

The jitterbone is considered proficient with these bone spikes and can make a bone spike attack with each hand.",

On a critical hit, this damage is instead 1d4 points of Strength or Dexterity damage. This ability damage has no effect against a creature without a skeleton.

			"Jitterbone mortics are halfling-like creatures with abnormally loose skeletons. With sufficient exertion of muscle control, jitterbones can control their skeletal structure, allowing them to shrug off crushing blows and slip through narrow spaces. They enjoy the taste of marrow- humanoid marrow in particular- and are adept at cracking and pulling their victim's bones. Jitterbones can be identified by their abnormally large heads. Their distinctive appearance and unusual appetites make jitterbones unwelcome in most halfling communities, so they form societies of their own in remote fields or forests. Among these communities of jitterbones, the most respected members are those that can contort themselves into the smallest or most awkward shapes; competitions to display this prowess and move up or down in the community's hierarchy are common. A traveler coming across one of these \"bone churning contests\" is likely to be plagued for years to come by the gruesome images of halflings twisting themselves into knots or shoving themselves through small pipes.",

			"",
			"**Mortic Ferocity (Su)** A lifeleecher mortic has ferocity, as the universal monster rule. However, when the lifeleecher mortic falls below 0 hit points, it does not lose any hit points per round and it is not staggered. A lifeleecher mortic still dies when it reaches a negative number of hit points equal to its Constitution score. Lifeleecher mortics fighting in this state are driven by instinct and default to attacking with their natural weapons, bolstered by their leech life and death knell abilities. Using manufactured weapons or using any other tactics or abilities requires the lifeleecher mortic to succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw to suppress its instincts.",

Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. When staggered due to such an effect, a lifeleecher mortic cannot use its leech life special ability and its mortic ferocity ability is suppressed. If the lifeleecher mortic is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while affected by a raise dead effect, it immediately gains the staggered condition and loses 1 hit point per round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Much like some of their orc kin, lifeleecher mortics often cover themselves in ritual scarring, brands, and auspicious tattoos. However, a lifeleecher mortic's skin is an ashen gray color, signaling their flirtation with death. Of all their markings, lifeleecher mortics most celebrate their death scar: the site of a mortal wound that would have felled creatures far more resilient than an orc, yet that failed to slay the lifeleecher mortic, instead unleashing their mortic heritage.",

Lifeleecher mortics are not born with their mortic abilities; rather, these powers manifest upon a mortic's initial brush with death. As the lifeleecher mortic receives what should be a fatal blow, their orc ferocity triggers something deep within that releases their mortic powers.",
			"",
			"Upon receiving any killing blow, the lifeleecher's mortic ferocity activates. The mortic enters a feral, furious state that drives them on, allowing them to continue fighting where other humanoids, even orcs, would fall. As they enters this trance, they forgo weapons and other tools, instead ravaging their opponents with natural attacks, especially their savage, life-leeching maw. The fact that lifeleechers consume their foes' life energy with their maws leads many of them to gravitate toward cannibalism in general, and even those who do not partake of cannibalism tend to prefer their meat fresh and raw.",

			"Lifeleecher mortics enjoy an almost celebrity status in orc settlements, both feared and revered for their strange ability to shrug off death blows. In a society where might makes right, death-defying lifeleecher mortics quickly climb their tribal hierarchies as their ability to defeat their orc cousins proves their strength and worthiness to rule. In other cases, powerful mortics find themselves quickly sold off to large gladiatorial stables in Belkzen and the Lands of the Linnorm Kings or the savage, tusk-lined fighting pits within the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Many managers enjoy having a lifeleecher mortic champion in these blood-soaked arenas, as the mortics' prolonged fights and supernatural displays both wow and terrify crowds in a gruesome spectacle often talked about for several seasons after the bout itself.",
			"",
			"Unfortunately, lifeleechers' penchant for animating those they defeat into wights, even temporarily, stirs many orc superstitions regarding death and magic. Tribes whisper insults depicting the lifeleechers as undead creatures themselves or suggest that they are possessed by fiends. Of course, most orcs would never say such things to a lifeleecher mortic's face; they are far more likely to grovel at the lifeleecher's feet to garner favor from their much stronger kin.",
			"",
			"Many soothsayers, shamans, oracles, and witches believe lifeleecher mortics hold the spirits of fallen orc heroes killed before they fulfilled their destiny, and it is this power that drives these nigh-indestructible warriors. When a lifeleecher mortic takes a mate, it prefers others of its kind; however, due to their orc heritage, these mortics can also breed with orcs and humans, and their often-high status gives them plenty of opportunity to do so. A mortic's offspring, whether orc or half-orc, all have potential to manifest as lifeleecher mortics when their racial ferocity triggers. Unfortunately, tribes all too often attempt to hasten this phenomenon, risking the lives of young orcs to spark this heritage, and it is more likely for a young orc with a lifeleecher mortic parent to die than for the child's mortic abilities to be unleashed.",
			"",
			"Lifeleecher mortics who live apart from orc settlements fare far worse than their half-orc cousins in similar communities. Something about their mannerisms, especially their dead eyes, is off-putting to non-orcs. Add to that their proclivity for cannibalism, and lifeleecher mortics find they do not assimilate well outside of gladiatorial pens or spectacle sideshows, and the public quickly drives them out into the wild when they discover the lifeleecher mortic's questionable heritage and unsavory diet. This suits most lifeleecher mortics just fine, as outside of orc lands they gravitate towards loner lifestyles as explorers, big-game hunters, and practitioners of guerrilla warfare."

			"**Fatal Accident (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a relictner can focus its deteriorating curse to wreak havoc around them. When using this ability, a relictner chooses a structure or manufactured object within 60 feet no larger than 15 feet by 15 feet, such as a statue, treasure chest, or support pillar. The chosen object falls, crumbles, or is otherwise compromised in such a way that it damages any creature adjacent to it, dealing 12d6 points of damage to each creature, or half as much damage to each creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Reflex save. Alternatively, the relictner can deal only 6d6 points of damage and also attempt a ranged bull rush, trip, or sunder maneuver check as a free action with a +4 racial bonus against each target that fails its Reflex save (sundering in this way deals 6d6 points of damage). This attack may deal more or less damage depending on the object chosen and the GM's discretion, and it typically creates difficult terrain in the area around it. The DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Ruin Bond (Su)** A relictner forms a bond with the structure it calls home. Single relictners form bonds with huts or houses, families of relictners bond with castles or temples, and clans can bond with entire ruined cities. All structures in a relictner's bonded ruin lose 1 hit point per day and can be reduced to a minimum of 10 hit points. Within its bonded ruin, a relictner gains a +10 bonus to AC and on saving throws against environmental effects and any traps. A relictner can have only one bonded ruin at a time but can create a new one by living in a suitable structure for at least 1 week. A relictner who spends more than 24 hours away from its bonded ruin becomes fatigued and shaken until it returns to the ruin.",

			"",
			"**Weathering Aura (Su)** A relictner radiates an entropic aura of decay and disrepair. All objects within 30 feet of a relictner, including held and worn nonmagical objects, have their hardness reduced by 5, to a minimum of 0, as long as they are within the area of the weathering aura and for 1 round after leaving the area. This is a curse effect.",

			"A relictner mortic is two entities in one: a vicious, grasping curse and its half-undead dwarven host. The hosts resemble gaunt, prematurely aged dwarves, their hair gray and ragged, their faces nothing but masses of wrinkles. The curse, however, is a strong and subtle thing, rotting and weathering everything the relictner sees or touches until only ruins are left. Outcast and eternally bitter, most relictners remove themselves to abandoned halls and forgotten ruins that they remake into shrines of mortal despair, filling their new homes with traps and pitfalls to snare the unwary.",
			"",
			"A typical relictner stands about 4 feet tall and weighs 125 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, when a dwarf survives the affliction of a [mummy's](monster/mummy) curse, a sliver of that dread power remains in her blood, lying dormant for years or even generations. The curse mutates, and its host mutates in turn to become the half-dead creature known as a relictner. The two grow together in a kind of twisted symbiosis, until it becomes hard to tell where the relictner ends and its curse begins. Removing a relictner's curse (possible only with [wish](spell/wish) or [miracle](spell/miracle)) kills it instantly, as the curse has long since taken over the host's vital biological functions.",
			"",
			"Soon after its curse manifests, a relictner feels an urge to claim some kind of structure or building as its own. A relictner considers its home a vital part of its being, much like a hermit crab's shell, and few relictners willingly leave their chosen lairs. A relictner forced to leave its home experiences bouts of twitchy, agoraphobic mania interspersed with melancholic lethargy. This is not to say that relictners don't sometimes grit their teeth and travel-a relictner is an intelligent creature, after all-but it takes quite a lot of motivation.",
			"",
			"A relictner's curse encompasses its chosen home, weakening it, desecrating it, and turning even the greatest example of dwarven architecture into a barely standing ruin within a matter of months. Relictners' ruins are places where terrible accidents can happen with little warning, and where lives can be lost in sudden structural collapses. Relictners themselves are almost never in any danger, however. The mortic's curse may not be alive in any conventional sense, but it does have some tiny spark of awareness, enough to make a point of never harming its host.",
			"",
			"Whenever someone dies inside the cursed ruins of a relictner, the mortic feels a sudden rush of energy and confidence as its curse fulfills its true purpose. The more painful, agonizing, and despair-ridden the death, the greater the subsequent high. The same ability also makes it easy for relictners to stalk prey within their domiciles, as they can usually find survivors nearby.",
			"",

			"A few relictners try to hide in larger dwarven society, though their destructive aura makes it difficult- people tend to notice when fine dwarven workmanship falls to pieces in a matter of weeks, and to dwarves, relictners are nothing less than abominations, horrific blasphemies that by their very nature destroy everything that dwarves strive to create. Those relictners who manage to hide do so by pretending to be older than they are and by living in slums or shantytowns, places where one more ruined building won't be remarked upon. More often, though, relictners are exiled or forced out. These bitter outcasts seek existing ruins, where they either live alone as hermits or in small, orderly clans, and from which they plan their revenge on the living.",
			"",
			"Relictner ruins tend to be terrifying places to visit. Relictners generally seek out the most impressive ruins they can find, ideally those with curses or undead residents of their own-relictners are immune to other jinxes, and they get along very well with [liches](monster/template/lich) or mummies, offering service in exchange for residence. They are expert trapmakers and delight in devising creative ways to violently mutilate and kill their victims.",
			"",
			"Of course, creating traps that never get triggered is boring, so relictners routinely lure visitors to their ruinous homes. Particularly duplicitous relictners have even been known to hire adventuring parties as unwitting meat for their grinders, finding these capable targets a satisfying test for their skills."

			"**Deadwood Curse (Su)** When a mosslord confirms a critical hit with one of its claws, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or a horrid curse transforms one of its limbs into an immobile wooden branch. Roll 1d4 to determine which limb is affected (1-right arm, 2-left arm, 3-right leg, 4-left leg; adjust the die as necessary for creatures with fewer or more limbs). The cursed limb hardens and becomes entirely immobile until the curse is lifted. If an arm is affected, the victim's Strength is reduced by 2 and it cannot wield weapons in that hand or use the hand in any way. If a victim's leg is affected, the victim's Dexterity is reduced by 2 and its base speed is reduced by 15 feet. Each time a creature is affected by this curse, a new limb is affected, and the effects stack. If a cursed limb is amputated and regrown via magic, the new limb regrows as deadwood as long as the curse persists. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Perennial (Su)** When a mosslord dies, its body decomposes normally but regrows in 60 days. A dead mosslord cannot regrow during winter months or when there is frost or snow on the ground where it was slain; in such a condition, its regrowth is delayed until the thaw. If the region where the mosslord was slain is affected by a lasting winter (either via magic or as a result of natural conditions), its regrowth can be delayed indefinitely. Even completely destroying a mosslord's body won't stop its eventual regrowth. A blight or diminish plants spell applied to a mosslord's remains can ensure its permanent death if the caster succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check. A mosslord slain on any plane other than the Material Plane remains dead permanently. Obscure rituals can also aid in the permanent death of a mosslord, at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"**Sheets of Moss (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, a mosslord can cover a 20-foot-square area in a thick blanket of toxic moss at a range of up to 90 feet. Living creatures in the area are automatically entangled and sickened and must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round until the moss dissipates or is destroyed. The moss has 25 hit points per 5-foot square, but can only be damaged by cold or effects that specifically target plants (such as blight) or deal additional damage to plants (such as horrid wilting). Otherwise, the sheets of moss wither away automatically after 1d4+4 rounds. The sickened effect and Constitution damage are poison effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Mold Blast (Su)** As a standard action, a mosslord can swiftly extrude a puffball and hurl it up to 60 feet. Upon impact, the puffball bursts into an unusually thick and potent cloud of yellow mold spores. This cloud of spores fills a 10-foot-radius area, obscuring vision as if it were a fog cloud and affecting all creatures within the area with yellow mold, except the Fortitude save to resist the mold's poisonous effects is DC 30. A creature that takes Constitution damage from these thick spores is also nauseated for 1 round. The cloud of spores persists for 1d4 rounds, after which it automatically dissipates. Creatures with greensight can see through these clouds of spores with ease. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Tales of the wretched mosslord have existed for as long as humanity has dared dwell amid the forests of the world. It appears in grotesque pictographs of long dead civilizations, covering the walls of lost cities on sunken continents or hidden in overgrown jungles. So ancient is the creature that its true origin remains unknown. In the cultures whose lore and legend tell of the mosslord, it is described as the living incarnation of the forest's vengeance against the encroachment of civilization, a fury given mind and focus toward the destruction of humanity. To date, no one has ever reported spotting more than a single mosslord at a time, prompting speculation as to whether more than a single mosslord exists, or if it is a singular entity that simply regrows itself each time it is destroyed.",
			"",
			"Most tales of the mosslord's intentions hold true, although the legends of there being but one mosslord are a false hope-in truth, multiple mosslords exist, and wherever one surfaces, ruin inevitably follows. Yet mosslords are hardly the simple, violent juggernauts that old legends purport. Instead, these wickedly intelligent creatures mastermind elaborate campaigns against civilization. Capable of commanding hordes of plant creatures, they typically spend months or even years seeding a target before launching an incursion-even if their attacks seem sudden and unprovoked to the victims. They are clever combatants, shielding themselves from direct attacks and avoiding melee if at all possible, in order to command and maneuver allies. Still, the creature is an able warrior in addition to having a potent arsenal of spells, and it doesn't shy from engaging opponents in melee when directly faced with an immediate opponent. Among all humanoid forms of life, they despise humans and halflings in particular.",
			"",
			"A mosslord has no known or ties to the fey world or to those worlds or planes beyond the material realm. Though the mosslord is no deity, it is a wholly supernatural being and the apocalyptic texts of over a dozen different religions depict its wrath. These texts often revile the mosslord and condemn those who would worship it or pay it reverence. Despite ominous warnings, history reports a handful of occasions when doom cults praised, venerated, and pledged fealty to mosslords. Some even credit or blame such cults for the creation of the first mosslords, for it seems odd that plant creatures would naturally form upon the wooden frames that hold its fungal flesh in the form of a bipedal humanoid. Regardless, such efforts tend to be short lived; as soon as the cultists capture the mosslord's attention, they find they have only attracted its relentless and utter destruction.",
			"",
			"The mosslord's body consists of a large skeletal frame that towers over 15 feet tall, fashioned from rough-cut pieces of wood. A thick layer of moss encompasses this frame, creating the appearance of flesh. While a mosslord's body appears constructed, the creature is fully sentient and highly intelligent. Despite their similar hateful and destructive views of civilization, mosslords do not cooperate with blights or whisperers, and they often compete with these strange entities for control over their woodland territories."

Yet despite their vast bulk, mu spores are capable of flying with an uncommon grace, venting jets of foul-smelling spores to guide their flight through the air.",

Mu spores are more than just ravenous eaters of nations-they possess uncommon intellects, and if peaceful contact can be made, their knowledge can be quite valuable. Even more valuable, to many debased alchemists, are the strange secretions and spores they emit, for these rare materials can be brewed into the strangest of drugs and elixirs."

			"Many cultures practice the sacred art of mummification, though the sinister magical techniques used to imbue corpses with undead vitality are far less widespread. In certain ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been refined through centuries of ceremony and countless deaths, giving rise to mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of great rank and exceeding malevolence, he might undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from his tomb as a fearful mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his resurrection, a mummy lord retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate both the living and dead."

			"#### Special Abilities",
			"",
			"**Blood Drain (Su)** A nachzehrer can suck blood from a pinned opponent. If the nachzehrer establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage to its victim. The nachzehrer heals 10 hit points or gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood.",
			"",
			"**Bound to the Grave (Su)** Nachzehrers are susceptible to certain rituals meant to keep them bound to their graves. Forcing a single coin into the mouth of a helpless nachzehrer (a full-round action) instantly incapacitates it. However, the nachzehrer is no longer incapacitated and can act as normal if this coin is removed, unless its head is also severed from its body (with the coin still in its mouth) and anointed with holy water, and both its body and head are buried at least 6 feet underground.",
			"",
			"**Call the Fallen (Su)** Once per day as a standard action while within any forest, the nachzehrer can harness the energies of the fey and humanoid creatures that have died nearby. This effectively causes 1d4 human juju zombies to rise from the earth in random places in a 30-foot radius around the nachzehrer. These juju zombies don't provoke attacks of opportunity when they rise in this way, are under the nachzehrer's control, and act on its turn. Juju zombies can't rise in this way from any surface that isn't natural soil (such as the floor of a structure or an area paved with natural rock or stone). Juju zombies the nachzehrer creates using this ability meld back into the earth after 24 hours and are permanently destroyed.",
			"",
			"**Fey Disguise (Su)** While in any forest, a nachzehrer can take on the illusory appearance of any Small or Medium fey creature. This does not affect the nachzehrer's statistics or give it any special abilities. A nachzehrer so disguised exposes its true nature through subtle mannerisms or flaws in its appearance, and anyone who interacts with the glamered nachzehrer can see through its disguise with a successful DC 25 Perception or Sense Motive check or a DC 24 Will saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Horrifying Vision (Su)** A nachzehrer can channel the foul energy of the terrible fate that befell it into its slam attack. Creatures damaged by its slam attack are panicked for 1 round as their minds are assaulted with the terrible trauma the nachzehrer endured, but the target can reduce this effect to shaken with a successful DC 24 Will saving throw. A nachzehrer can choose not to inflict its horrifying vision on a creature it attacks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The saving throw is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The inspiration of much fear and dread among forest-dwellers, nachzehrers are better known as fey vampires in the woodland regions where they typically dwell. Human locals often confuse them for true vampires, though in reality nachzehrers are a form of monstrous cousin to those hated undead. They rise from the fey victims of virulent disease; the more evil a pestilence's origin, such as from an Abyssal blight, the more likely fey who succumb are to return as nachzehrers. Unlike true vampires, nachzehrers cannot create spawn, though their aggressiveness toward and hatred of the living is just as intense as those fabled horrors.",
			"",
			"Tragically, nachzehrers typically rise from good or neutral fey, such as dryads, huldras, nymphs, and nereids. Their appearances are sick parodies of the forms they took in life. Their graceful limbs become spindly and bony, their skin becomes thin and papery, and their delicate teeth sharpen into wicked fangs. Nachzehrers are typically 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh about 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Although rare no matter the location, nachzehrers are most likely to be found in blighted forests or in woodlands that have recently suffered sweeping bouts of disease. Many nachzehrers were once fey creatures whose bodies managed to resist a polluting blight- such as the Abyssal Darkblight that infects the deepest Fangwood in Nirmathas-that might have warped their bodies and minds (see the blighted fey template on pages 46-47 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6). However, these fey nonetheless contract debilitating, wasting diseases that visit terrible suffering upon them until they finally succumb. The most unlucky of these fey find themselves returned to unlife as nachzehrers. In fact, dying from such diseases is the hallmark of all nachzehrers' rebirth.",
			"",
			"When nachzehrers arise, they do so in a weakened state-typically, nachzehrers begin unlife with only 1 hit point. Since most find themselves risen in graves that contain other fey creatures who also succumbed to disease, nachzehrers feed off the stagnant blood in those bodies, gaining vigor even as they drain the corpses of those who once loved them. In the rare case that a nachzehrer arises near no easily obtainable source of blood, the wicked creature typically slinks back to its ancestral enclave, waiting to pick off young and weak members of its former clan to drain the blood it needs to gain strength.",
			"",
			"Although they remember little about their lives before undeath, nachzehrers retain terrible memories of the pain and suffering they experienced during the infections that killed them. Worse, they can transmit these horrifying experiences to their enemies-and they count all living creatures as such, regarding them with equal parts hate and jealousy. Most nachzehrers wish to destroy life simply for the sake of doing so, but the oldest and most heinous of their number want to see as many creatures as possible suffer the same agony they did so long ago. Thus, because they don't need blood to survive, some nachzehrers capture victims and continually torture them with horrifying visions, without ever granting them the release of death.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because they suffered so deeply before rising as undead, nachzehrers particularly hate their ancestral fey clans, whom they blame for not finding a way to cure their disease or at least mitigate their agony. As a result, most nachzehrers stalk their former comrades, terrorizing them and waiting for opportune moments to steal lone victims. In the case of nachzehrers whose clans are gone-either wiped out by disease or otherwise fled from the area-the creatures roam about the woods, looking for other groups of living creatures to torment.",
			"",
			"Wandering nachzehrers are often drawn to places of great suffering in the hope that they might drown out some of the agonizing memories they continually relive. In fact, the most common place to find an unmoored nachzehrer is the site of a destroyed fey village in a blighted area or at the crossroads of woodland paths. Here, nachzehrers absorb the area's latent suffering while waiting for new victims to stumble upon their new lairs. Although their behavior is practically feral, nachzehrers are fiercely intelligent creatures. They are at least nominally aware that they're undead abominations, and that the hateful actions they commit are intensely evil. Thus, nachzehrers assume that nearby fey or benevolent humanoids will eventually seek to destroy them, and they fear nothing more than the arrival of planar allies such as angels to send them to oblivion.",
			"",
			"Nachzehrers hate and are uncommonly terrified of creatures that bear coins, which they assume are payment for a coming planar ally. Though nachzehrers can fight against coin-bearing individuals freely, placing a coin in a nachzehrer's mouth paralyzes it as much as a stake in the heart incapacitates a true vampire. Savvy adventurers can fully destroy a nachzehrer incapacitated in this way by going through the same grisly ritual they'd use to kill a child of the night. Those clever enough to lure a nachzehrer into helplessness find that this is the easiest way to dispatch the creatures. Tragically, though, all but the most discerning adventurers and scholars tend to mistake nachzehrers for their more common vampiric kin, and attempt to destroy them as they would true vampires, without using coins-always to disastrous results."

			"**Ley-Line Dependent (Su)** Deep nagas draw their power from ley lines deep underground. While attuned to a ley line, a deep naga gains an additional +1 bonus to its effective caster level, increasing the maximum bonus possible from a ley line to +6. If the deep naga is more than 100 feet from its attuned ley line or its attunement is broken for any reason, the deep naga takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per caster level of the ley line, cannot use its breath weapon, and must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) in order to cast spells until it attunes itself to a new ley line or its attunement to its previous ley line is restored.",

			"More bestial than their surface cousins, deep nagas jealously guard their lairs in the lightless depths of the Darklands. Deep nagas live near ley lines and other places of power because they hunger for magical energy, which they are able to siphon from their surroundings. Their volatile natures make them dangerous to deal with, but creatures who manage to appease them can earn safety within their territory. Most deep nagas measure 40 feet in length and weigh 1,800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Some deep nagas are infused from birth with energy native to another plane of existence. These variant deep nagas replace their breath weapon damage with one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or negative energy. They set up lairs in places where the borders between planes are thin rather than along ley lines, and their appearances often reflect the influence of those elemental planes.",
			"",
			"The chitinous scales that cover deep nagas' serpentine bodies are reminiscent of the dark purple plates that protect purple worms. Their heads resemble those of giant, androgynous humanoids, with wide mouths filled with multiple rows of sharp fangs. Though deep nagas enjoy eating flesh, they are obsessed with the magical energy they absorb. They are able to sustain themselves in hibernation on nothing but magical energy when sources of meat are sparse, but deep nagas have a fixation on magic that goes beyond mere survival and is more akin to an addiction. What deep nagas lack in sophistication compared to the innate magic of their surface cousins, they make up for in raw power.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas that reside in places of great magical power are able to extend their lifespans to centuries and beyond, and even their reproduction cycles are tied to magical energy. Once adult deep nagas have found a place with a steady flow of magic, they are able reproduce asexually, laying anywhere from one to three large eggs every few years.",

			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Deep nagas can be found throughout the Darklands, from the deepest Vaults of Orv to the uppermost reaches of Nar-Voth. Wherever magical energy runs strongest along ancient ley lines, deep nagas make their isolated lairs and protect them with a fervor unmatched by other naga species. Deep nagas tend to be solitary creatures in the upper layers of the Darklands, where they are rarer and surrounded by races like the dark folk, derros, drow, and duergar. These nagas even drive out their progeny as soon they can fend for themselves, so that the offspring won't wrest the lair from their parent as they grow in power. Deep nagas of Orv form nests in ancient sites of power, with the founding deep naga lording over several generations of her progeny, the number depending on her age-though even in Orv, the strong drive out the weak if the number of deep nagas grows too high for the lair to sustain.",
			"",
			"Solitary deep nagas and smaller nests are more likely to allow tribes of troglodytes, skum, or degenerate serpentfolk to live in their territory for mutual benefit. These tribes tend to treat deep nagas as fickle, godlike creatures who are dangerous but offer protection to those that placate them, for the nagas are extremely hostile toward intruders within their territory. Treating with deep nagas usually falls to the shamans of the tribes, and some tribes have even formed cults that worship the creatures. These tribes bring offerings of flesh and magic to deep nagas who share their territory with the tribe. The nagas especially enjoy the flesh of magic users, which makes dealing with them even more dangerous for the shamans. If a naga is in a bad mood, the head shaman might be tempted to send an apprentice in his place because-as the tribal lore teaches-a great serpent that has feasted is easier to deal with. Ever paranoid, a deep naga is never too far from turning on a tribe that worships her if given a reason, imagined or real. If creatures of another race aren't useful to the deep naga, they are treated as food or threats to be extinguished.",
			"",
			"Deep nagas are very particular about and protective of their lairs. They exert a substantial effort to find one that suits their needs, so they don't give them up without a fight. Unless the source of magic depletes or they are driven out by a more powerful deep naga, they rarely abandon their lairs. However, if a deep naga learns of an even more potent magical site, she might try to conquer this new lair for herself. Deep nagas do not usually care what tribes that serve them do, as long as the offerings keep coming, but they might push the tribes to conquer a superior place for a lair."

			"Although ferocious in shape, with radiant scales, cobra-like hoods, and powerful serpentine bodies, guardian nagas serve as dutiful protectors of places of fundamental power and sanctity. Their scales often bear elaborate patterns similar to those of exotic jungle snakes. A typical guardian naga stretches 14 feet long and weighs approximately 350 pounds.",
			"",
			"While many guardian nagas adhere to the exotic practices of ancient or forgotten faiths, others are merely drawn to sites of innate wonder-towering waterfalls, natural spires, mountaintop temples-minding them out of their own senses of duty and reverence. Often these nagas join a living faith, serving as protectors of sanctuaries or ancient treasures. A pair of nagas might take up residence near a site they deem worthy of protection, hatching a brood and raising their offspring there. When the young grow to adulthood, they have the choice of departing to seek their own homes or staying to protect their elder's charge. Sometimes, a guardian naga protecting a ruin or temple is but the current protector in a line of sentinels stretching back centuries. Such sentinels often take the same name as their forebears to appear as a single, exceptionally long-lived figure.",

Cloudy nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings.",

			"With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.",
			"",
			"As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs' usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.",

Nagaji venerate nagas as their creators, even going so far as to deify them. Despite the influence of their creators, nagaji maintain their own distinct cultures containing elements borrowed from those of both nagas and humans. They prefer warm to tropical regions and settle in wild, isolated regions such as steaming jungles, vast swamps, or volcanic mountains where they erect large temples in honor of their naga creators. These magnificent temples are surrounded by dozens of simple mud daub huts and clay brick structures, which serve as the nagaji's homes and public buildings.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A necrocraft is a medley of undead body parts and corpses grafted together with dark magic to create a single animated undead creature with abilities based on its component pieces and the surgical and necromantic talents of its creator. Necrocrafts are better suited for brute force than delicate manipulation, and most creators build larger hulks rather than smaller, more agile (and fragile) necrocrafts. Though necrocrafts can be of virtually any size and can be made up of undead bodies or parts of any size, a typical Medium specimen is 7 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"The details of the ritual to create a necrocraft vary greatly, and depend on the particular undead parts used and the intended size of the resulting creature. The final anatomy of the creation largely depends on the master's artistry, creativity, and personal preferences-as well as any specific goals it has in mind for the creature. For example, a necrocraft's \"teeth\" could actually be dozens of clawed ghoul talons, or its eyes and mouth might be located in its chest rather than in a distinct head.",
			"",
			"### Creating",
			"",
			"In order to create a necrocraft, a spellcaster must use at least five undead creatures (or their corpses), all of which must be under the creator's control, helpless, or slain. A larger undead or corpse can be used in place of two that are one size smaller. The creator must stitch, glue, or otherwise bind the parts together in the desired configuration, then cast animate dead and make whole to complete the construction (the material component cost of animate dead is 50 gp per Hit Die of the final necrocraft). The creator can't create a necrocraft with more Hit Dice than her caster level. As with animate dead, the necrocraft is under the creator's control when created. Note that creating a necrocraft requires casting a spell with the evil descriptor.",

Particularly macabre creators might even construct the creature from the skull of a friend or loved one of the intended victim in order to magnify the horror of the assassination, leaving much of the flesh on the skull so the victim can recognize its source.

A nehushtan can treat diseases and poisons (as per the Heal skill) without attempting Heal checks merely by remaining in continuous physical contact with the creature to be treated for 10 minutes. Additionally, a creature that takes a nehushtan as a familiar gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease or poison so long as the nehushtan remains within 1 mile of its master. A creature with at least 1 rank in Heal can use skin shed by a nehushtan to craft a draught that, when consumed, functions as either a potion of remove disease or a potion of neutralize poison, as chosen by the crafter. A nehushtan sheds enough skin to craft a single draught every 3 months, and crafting this draught takes 10 minutes.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Injury-bite; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 fire damage; cure 1 save.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"In many of Golarion's cultures, serpents symbolize wisdom, medicine, and the healing arts. This association may have its roots in nehushtans, a rare breed of bronze-colored serpents prized and venerated for their miraculous curative powers. Nehushtans' lustrous scales contain potent curative properties, making the snakes' shed skin extremely valuable to healers and apothecaries. In regions where nehushtans live, desperately sick or poor people sometimes turn to scavenging the hills, hoping to find the discarded, metallic skins in order to either use them or sell them.",
			"",
			"Were it not for their peculiarly metallic scales, nehushtans would be virtually indistinguishable from vipers of comparable size. A nehushtan's body is 4 to 5 feet long, and it weighs 5 to 7 pounds.",
			"",
			"According to folklore, Sarenrae created the first nehushtan to answer the prayers of a priestess whose tribe was plagued by venomous serpents. The Dawnflower commanded her priestess to craft a bronze serpent and carry it among her people atop a large wooden pole. The visage of this \"nehushtan\" repelled mundane serpents, and those faithful who laid their hands upon the bronze idol found themselves miraculously cured of the vipers' venom. Once its holy work was done, Sarenrae rewarded the bronze idol for its service by imbuing it with the divine spark of life.",
			"",
			"True or not, this story explains the nehushtans' antagonistic attitude toward other snakes. The creatures take great pleasure in hunting and killing venomous serpents, particularly when such creatures encroach on inhabited areas or endanger humanoid populations. Though a nehushtan usually consumes the snakes it kills, it attacks even serpents too large for it to swallow. Nehushtans' innate immunity to poison makes them extremely effective at hunting venomous creatures, and these make up a large part of their diet. Nehushtans are otherwise opportunistic carnivores, and feed on whatever small prey they can catch and swallow.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans are venomous, and possess a potent venom that combusts when exposed to living flesh. Nehushtans use this toxin to painfully cook their prey from the inside out, and generally prefer to consume cooked or burnt flesh rather than raw meat. Nehushtans generally reserve this venom for their prey, and though they may bite to defend themselves or their young, they don't usually inject venom unless the target is particularly aggressive or persistent.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans shed their skins two to four times a year, with younger nehushtans molting slightly more often. They shed throughout their lives, which are comparable in length to a human's, and their skin grows increasingly powerful with each desquamation. Rare nehushtans live for hundreds of years, growing to incredible sizes and have skins that can cure any ailment. A nehushtan's discarded skin grows rigid after it is shed, resembling a mangled bronze leaf.",
			"",
			"Popular folklore claims that nehushtans shed during certain times of the year, such as the month of Sarenith, but this is not true. Nehushtans can shed during any part of the year, with different individuals shedding at different times. Nonetheless, many hunters intensify their search efforts during the weeks preceding and following Sarenrae's holy days, hoping to gain favor from the goddess in the form of nehushtan skin.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The temperaments of nehushtans vary. Some congregate in large extended families, while others associate with other nehushtans only long enough to breed and raise young. A nehushtan mother lays a clutch of two to four eggs, and both parents remain close to the nest until the young hatch. Unlike most serpents, nehushtans continue to care for their young after hatching, and stay with their children during the 2 to 3 months required for the young to fully mature into adults. During this time, the ordinarily peaceful creatures become fiercely protective, and most nehushtan bites are the result of unwary travelers stumbling too close to a nehushtan's nest when its young are present. Nehushtans prefer to dwell underground, taking over animal burrows or crawling into disused basements. They usually hunt in rocky environments.",
			"",
			"Given the miraculous healing powers of their scales, many humanoids have tried to domesticate nehushtans. These attempts invariably meet with failure. Nehushtans languish if confined for more than a few days, and cannot survive more than a month in captivity no matter how comfortable their accommodations are. After this time, the miserable captives undergo a strange transformation-their scales grow dull and tarnished, and eventually the nehushtans loses their luster and turns into aggressive but otherwise mundane vipers. Some see this as a sign of Sarenrae's displeasure at mortals who would exploit her sacred gifts. Others suspect nehushtans require some unknown dietary or environmental factor that their captors can't provide.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who willingly choose to live among humanity suffer no ill effects. Entire families of the serpents sometimes establish colonies in human settlements, and thrive just as well as their wild counterparts, provided they are allowed to come and go as they please and generally left to themselves. These colonies enjoy residing in hospitals, temples dedicated to healing, and other places where the sick and infirm dwell.",
			"",
			"The presence of a nehushtan greatly enhances a patient's recovery and survival, and so mortals who operate infirmaries welcome these mystical serpents. Some healers even venerate nehushtans, and give offerings of milk and burnt meat to placate and honor the bronze serpents. In earlier days, hospitals that hosted nehushtans advertised this fact by incorporating bronze serpent motifs into their decorations. These symbols have long since become iconic for all houses of healing in the warm, dry regions from which nehushtans hail.",
			"",
			"Nehushtans who choose to serve spellcasters as familiars likewise suffer no ill effects. They favor Sarenrae worshipers as masters, though any particularly devout or compassionate spellcaster can entice a nehushtan into service. Nehushtans adapt well to the adventurer's life, and particularly relish the opportunity to reduce the suffering of others by doing good works. Nehushtans are quick to abandon masters who grow cruel or merciless, and may even attack masters who radically shift in alignment. A good-aligned spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a nehushtan as a familiar."

			"**Bound Spirits (Su)** A nemhain is surrounded by a whirling cloud of spirits that are bound to her-often the spirits of close relatives or friends she had in life. As a swift action, she can direct these bound spirits to strike at any creature within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack (with an attack bonus of +21). These spirits may be used to cause damage as if the nemhain had touched the target with her incorporeal touch, or they can be used to deliver a harm or slay living effect. Using these spirits to deliver one of these spell-like abilities is a swift action; the nemhain does not need to take a standard action to cast the spell-like ability, but it still counts against the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability. The nemhain can also send these spirits as a group up to 1 mile away to act as scouts; they have a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect). She can observe and listen through them, but as long as they don't share her space, she can't use them to deliver ranged touch attacks. These spirits are impervious to almost all attacks and magic, save the following: dispel evil, raise dead, or resurrection. Such spells cause the spirits to vanish and to be useless to the nemhain for 1 hour. True resurrection makes the spirits useless for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Profane Regeneration (Su)** This ability functions like regeneration except the nemhain possesses it despite the fact that she lacks a Constitution score. A nemhain reduced to 0 hit points is staggered instead of destroyed while her profane regeneration is active. As long as her profane regeneration is active, a nemhain ignores all damage that would reduce her hit points below 0.",

Until this object is destroyed, a destroyed nemhain automatically rejuvenates back to full hit points 1d4 days after she is destroyed, always appearing adjacent to her ritual object.",
			"",

			"A nemhain is formed when a soul deliberately assumes undead status as a means of protecting a person, object, place, or ideal. Often, a devoted priest or ally volunteers herself and her (often unwitting) kin for transformation into a nemhain in order to continue protecting her home even beyond her death. The blasphemous rituals used to create nemhains are often believed to have been lost.",
			"",
			"While most nemhain aspirants are evil to begin with-such individuals are often members of cults worshiping deities of lost or forbidden secrets-occasionally a goodly creature considers protecting a site worthy of a corrupted, tortured existence. Such an act, however well intentioned, is destined to damn her for all eternity."

			"Those who have learned secrets of the deepest vaults of Orv know of the neothelids of Denebrum. In fetid pools of poisonous swamps and surreal forests of twisted, phosphorescent fungi, these gigantic worm-things rule and wage war against Orv's other denizens and each other. While most know that the neothelids are ancient creatures, spawned by eldritch beings in a time and place far removed from the known world, very few are aware that some neothelids are old beyond imagining. In their eons of existence, they have changed, surviving the centuries of mindless hunger that drives the youngest of their kind and ultimately defeating enough of their peers to become truly hideous masters of the damp, nearly lightless depths of Orv.",
			"",
			"Scholars of such lore can only speculate as to what causes a neothelid to begin the transformation into an overlord. The change could be a natural process of age and development, though nothing about neothelids can truly be called natural. It may be that by delving into forbidden lore, they discover potent secrets, just as other rituals grant mortals the hideous power of lichdom. It might instead be that overlords' ascendant power comes from some link to the blasphemous entities they venerate, a connection that only the most dedicated among the neothelids are able to cultivate. Whatever the cause, the result is terrifying-even maddening-to behold.",
			"",
			"An overlord achieves such immense power and intellect that it reaches a state in which its consciousness splits into two minds that work as one. In a horrifying metamorphosis, the creature's head splits down the middle to form two separate heads, each of which contains a portion of the neothelid's intellect. The new neothelid overlord's enhanced cognition grants it a deeper understanding of reality and enables it to harness psychic magic beyond the ken of its younger kin. Though still able to crush a victim with pure psychic force, the neothelid overlord develops an awesome level of finesse and skill in the manipulation of both mind and matter.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords undergo other physical changes as well. Although they do not become significantly larger than typical neothelids, overlords take on a darker hue and their bodies sprout myriad tentacles that constantly squirm, as though each possessed a sentience of its own. The creatures' tails also split into three parts, the ends of which claw and dig at the ground as though trying to take root in the very bedrock. The functions of overlords' tentacles and triple tails are a mystery. It is possible that they have something to do with reproduction or the spawning of their seugathi servants, but the truth is something that only the most insane researchers could hope to uncover. Along with these physical changes comes an increase in might and a swiftness that one would not expect from something so large. A typical neothelid overlord measures approximately 100 feet in length from head to tail, though it usually remains coiled and takes up about one-fifth of that space. Overlords weigh about 100,000 pounds, though individuals can vary wildly in size.",
			"",
			"Neothelid overlords rise to become tyrannical rulers, directing less developed members of their race toward goals that no healthy mind can fathom. They reinforce their power over subordinates through manipulation and punitive displays of power, believing that fear of random-appearing punishments keeps their followers in line even when they are not under observation. Most assume that neothelid overlords serve either their own whims or those of the ones they worship-the shapeless and terrible entities of the Dark Tapestry that created neothelids and countless other horrors in the darkest reaches of space and time. Few who know of these monsters, though, dare to think that their purposes are anything but anathema to normal life whether aboveground or belowground.",
			"",
			"In The Dream Diary of Lady Elliara Celmenari, written in 3875 ar, the Taldan author claims to have visited Denebrum while in an astral form and to have seen at least one neothelid overlord. Her writings depicts the creature as guarding the resting place of two dormant bholes. The text describes the overlord sending out madness-inducing offspring into the world to find a means of awakening and controlling the legendary beasts. Most learned folk attribute Lady Celmenari's dreams of doom and destruction to a chronic nervous condition, compounded by the impending collapse of Taldan supremacy. But in recent years, rumors have come to light indicating that a certain cult of Groetus is working with agents of a mysterious and unwholesome nature toward a similar goal, which has dangerous implications for all of Golarion. To occult scholars, visions and whispers such as these serve as further evidence that terrible things wait in the dark places of the multiverse and must be opposed."

			"**Aura of Alien Dread (Su)** A neshmaal's presence is deeply disturbing. Any creature that comes within 20 feet of a neshmaal must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or become shaken for 2d4 rounds. If a creature is within the auras of multiple neshmaals, only a single save is required, but the save DC increases by 2 for each additional neshmaal (for example, the presence of two neshmaals increases the usual save DC to 25). Arcane spellcasters are especially vulnerable to this aura. The DC to cast spells defensively within the aura increases by 4, and the neshmaal can make an attack of opportunity against an arcane caster who fails to cast defensively. This secondary effect occurs even if the arcane caster succeeded at her save against the shaken condition. Once a creature is exposed to a neshmaal's aura, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Dominate Person (Sp)** A neshmaal can dominate only one target at a time when using its dominate person spell-like ability. If a neshmaal uses its dominate person spell-like ability on a new target while already dominating another creature, the previous target is immediately released from the neshmaal's control. This occurs whether or not the new attempt is successful.",
			"",
			"**Kiss of the Void (Su)** Three times per day, a neshmaal may forgo using energy drain on one of its three tendril attacks in a round and instead imbue the touch with the icy coldness of deep space. This attack deals an additional 6d6 points of cold damage and paralyzes the target for 1d4-1 rounds. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the paralysis. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Vulnerability to Sonic (Su)** Neshmaals are native to the noiseless void of deep space or their own alien dimension and, as a result, are especially vulnerable to sonic damage. Magical attacks that cause sonic damage bypass the neshmaal's spell resistance, and they take half again as much damage (+50%) on a failed save (normal full damage on a successful save). If a neshmaal fails a saving throw against an effect that deals sonic damage, it has a 25% chance of being stunned for 1 round.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The vast, dark spaces between the stars hold horrors aplenty, skulking in the unholy blackness with their aberrant desires and unspeakable appetites. Some of these beings exist simultaneously in two worlds, half in the emptiness of space and half in some other dimension of which mortals dare not even dream. The neshmaals are such a race, aliens of such inscrutable malice and hunger that even most other denizens of the darkness avoid them. These strange beings view the humanoids populating the universe as either cattle to eat or playthings to manipulate like marionettes.",
			"",
			"A neshmaal's body is formed of a tangle of writhing tentacles that is roughly 9 feet across. As they are incorporeal outside of their home dimension, the creatures have no weight.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Neshmaals are incorporeal in the Material Plane. They may be corporeal in their own dimension, but no one has journeyed there and returned to verify this. In the Material Plane, neshmaals spend most of their time in the empty darkness of deep space, where extremes of temperature are commonplace and the varieties of weather found on terrestrial worlds have no impact on these strange creatures. Due to this exceptional form of adaptation, neshmaals can be found virtually anywhere. Neshmaals have no need to breathe, so they are unaffected by inhaled poisons and can dwell underwater without restriction. Despite their many immunities and resistances, they are especially vulnerable to damage from sonic attacks, perhaps because they are accustomed to the silence of the void. Since outsiders don't normally need to eat, the neshmaals' ravenous hunger for the energy of all living creatures suggests that they manifest in the Material Plane only to gain sustenance. Neshmaals satisfy this hunger by draining the life force from living creatures, though it's assumed they also derive some nourishment from psychic energies from sentient beings as well, fear in particular.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Neshmaals, which exist at once on the Material Plane and in a dimension of their own, seem to have no interest in congress with other species, though they speak passable Aklo and possess telepathy. What little information exists about their culture is contradictory, though their endless appetites for raw life force support the theory that they are scavengers created by the Great Old Ones to cleanse worlds of sentience.",
			"",
			"Neshmaals are occasionally found in the service of much more powerful otherworldly beings from the Dark Tapestry. Some scholars believe these creatures to be agents of the mysterious Dominion of the Black. This is a reasonable assumption, as they have similar inscrutable methodologies to the creatures that make up the Dominion, and neshmaals have been recorded in texts that deal with various creatures that make up the Dominion of the Black. The role neshmaals might play in that dark hierarchy is unclear.",
			"",
			"Humanoid conjurers on the Material Plane have summoned these inscrutable beings to gain knowledge of the inky depths of the universe and beyond, though doing so places the conjurer's sanity in terrible jeopardy. The process is maddening, and the conjurer's safety is not diminished once the neshmaal is called to service. Attempting to obtain the service of a neshmaal is very dangerous, unless such service aligns with the neshmaal's goals, and only the mad can discern the nature of those goals. Neshmaals constantly modify the original agreement, and they often manipulate those they serve. A neshmaal's most common request is a never-ending chain of humanoids for them to drain of their life force.",
			"",
			"It's unusual to find more than a few of these otherworldly creatures in one place, making it difficult to calculate their total numbers. Neshmaals employ telepathy to communicate with others of their kind; while doing so, they intertwine their tentacles and tendrils in a manic, lascivious embrace. The book Secrets of the Dreaming Dark (which is thankfully rare) provides the ritual to summon neshmaals. The tome also reports that neshmaals are somehow connected to, seeking, or fleeing from something cryptically referred to as the \"Black Alluvion Dream.\" Even occult scholars, astronomers, and other seekers of secrets tend to steer clear of this esoteric and dangerous topic, given that those few who have pursued its study now occupy carefully guarded cells in asylums across the Inner Sea Region."

They appear as stooped, emaciated humanoids, yet possess a remarkable strength in their sinewy limbs.

			"",
			"Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger on sleepers, and gather in colonies to entertain each other by sharing emotionmemories through strange caresses. They sometimes war with the other creatures found in their desolate realms."

			"**Creeping Dark (Su)** The nightprowler's natural attacks leave a stain of dark shadows that linger in and around the wounds, known as the creeping dark-this condition can be resisted with a successful DC 20 Fortitude save. If the victim fails, it becomes staggered for 1 round, after which the creeping dark affects the victim further by preventing healing and hampering vision. A character attempting to use magical healing on a creature damaged by the nightprowler's creeping dark must succeed at a DC 26 caster level check, or the healing has no effect on the injured creature. As long as a creature suffers the creeping dark, its vision is obscured with shadows as well-all creatures gain a 20% miss chance from attacks by the victim. The creeping dark is a curse effect that lasts until removed or until all damage afflicting the victim is healed. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Shadowpounce (Su)** Nightprowlers have the pounce ability, and when they use this ability, they can also make rake attacks. Up to three times per day when a nightprowler pounces from an area of dim illumination, it generates a shimmering aura of false images that grants it a 50% miss chance, as if under the effects of a displacement spell, for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Only a fool would underestimate the danger presented by the hateful nightprowler, despite its position as the least powerful of the undead monsters collectively known as nightshades. The bestial nightprowler is a fearsome opponent armed with the same cruel and calculating intelligence possessed by all nightshades.",
			"",
			"Nightprowlers are feline quadrupeds that seem to be composed of living shadow. Their eyes, like the eyes of all nightshades, glow with red light. A nightprowler is 16 feet long from head to tail and weighs 8,000 pounds. Nightprowlers have all the nightshade traits found on page 308 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, except that they have darksense out to only 30 feet.",
			"",
			"Spawned by the fusion of pure darkness and the depraved souls of fiends, nightprowlers originate in the fell borderlands between the Shadow Plane and the Negative Energy Plane. These creatures are weak by nightshade standards, but truly terrifying to most mortals unlucky enough to encounter them.",
			"",
			"Although a nightprowler appears similar to a great cat, no tiger has ever had claws so long and sharp, and no lion has sported as murderous a maw. These creatures relish the taste of living flesh and the sight of life leaving a creature's eyes, but most of all, they enjoy fear. If a nightprowler feels confident in its kill, it prefers to attack with tooth and claw until the victim is crippled, then plunges the area into darkness and glories in the sight of the helpless creature struggling in vain to escape. On an even battlefield, or if a nightprowler realizes that it is outmatched, it summons shadow allies to harry its opponents. Nightprowlers do not respond to bribes or pleas for mercy, and will chase their prey to the ends of the earth.",
			"",
			"Nightprowlers do not retreat from fights, even when near destruction-they trust that they will be reborn in the umbral cradle that originally gave them unlife. Even so, these beasts value their own existence, and their powers of judgment do not allow them to undertake obvious suicide missions. If a nightprowler locates a formidable enemy, it often bides its time until it can recruit other undead to the cause. To this end, a nightprowler may promise allies pieces of the spoils, but often reneges on payment once the fight is finished. The other creature, surprised by the betrayal and weakened from battle, then becomes easy prey for the treacherous nightprowler.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Nightshade(monster/family:nightshade)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Like all nightshades, nightprowlers hail from the Negative Energy Plane. Born in that dread gulf and spurred by a seething hatred for all life, nightprowlers find cunning and clandestine ways to leave their horrid spawning grounds and travel to other planes. They particularly like to follow on the heels of other, more powerful nightshades, knowing that there is a share of the slaughter to be had in the wake of mightier allies.",
			"",
			"While nightprowlers often work with other nightshades, primarily playing reconnaissance roles, they don't serve living masters willingly. Even a truly sadistic mortal doesn't merit a shred of respect in the eyes of a nightprowler. If one of these deadly undead is forced into the service of a mortal master, it makes a poor servant at best. It remains patient and opportunistic, striking at the master's first sign of weakness. While nightprowlers despise mortal existence in all forms, they are known to accept the offerings of creatures that foolishly seek to become their minions. The mortal servants of such a creature are typically psychotic or sociopathic killers who see in the nightprowler a patron of murder and mayhem. Nightprowlers accept the supplications of their minions for a time, but out of either boredom or capriciousness, they inevitably turn their claws on their former servants.",
			"",
			"A mortal who wishes to catch the attention of a nightprowler must carry out a series of gruesome murders as sacrifices to the creature. Any killings will do, but nightprowlers prefer such sacrifices to be innocent victims or the clergy of good-aligned deities. Quick kills displease nightprowlers, while signs of torture on the offerings delight them. Supplicants who kill friends or family members garner special notice from nightprowlers. While pleasing a nightprowler is relatively easy initially, it demands ever-greater massacres using increasingly cruel methods, and it soon tires of even the most wicked mortal master.",
			"",
			"From time to time, nightprowlers stalk the Material Plane alone or in groups. They generally keep to caves, deep forests, and the cover of night when traveling this way. Nightprowlers prefer to move as solitary hunters, but are intelligent enough to collaborate when necessary. Packs of nightprowlers are loosely organized and can erupt into chaos in an instant. A pride forms when a particularly vigorous nightprowler lures others to its cause with promises of tender flesh and glistening entrails. This leader must mastermind sufficient destruction to keep the pride obeisant, for boredom in a nightprowler is a dangerous thing.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the common goal of all nightshades is nothing less than the desecration of all that is pure, and the death of all that lives. Mortals in the grip of madness rant of the coming night when nightshades great and small will march to rid all the planes once and for all of the curse of life. Nightprowlers will be the outriders in that terrible army, the mad ones warn, bringing undead allies with them into that final fray. It is easy to ignore these fevered prophecies or label them the ramblings of the insane. But in the baleful dark, when all lights have been extinguished save for a pair of red eyes, the potential truth in those words is undeniable."

The nightwing heals damage equal to twice the level of the spell drained-hit points in excess of its maximum are instead gained as temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. If a nightwing attempts to sunder a magic item with its bite, its magic-draining bite renders the item nonmagical for 1d4 rounds (if the item is a permanent magic item), drains 1d8 charges (if the item has charges), or renders it permanently nonmagical (if the item is a one-use item).

In the face of spellcasters from the Material Plane striding across their homeland-using it as little more than a umbral thoroughfare-and whole terrible races like kytons migrating to their native reaches, the nihilois have long retreated into the deepest darknesses of their realm. Yet as alien encroachment continues, slowly the nihilois have revealed themselves, and found to their surprise that they are powerful and feared.",

Unable to vocalize words, nihilois are widely distrusted by creatures foreign to the Plane of Shadow. Even a pair of the shadowy natives is unsettling to those encountering them for the first time as they silently gesture and nod, holding secret councils few others can understand. Creatures frequently interacting with them know the nihilois have a shared name for their race, though since these creatures speak only telepathically, the term sounds more like the passage of massive wings than a word pronounceable in most sentient tongues."

			"**Island Bond (Ex)** A nisid who resides on a small, uninhabited island for an extended period of time forms a strong bond with the land, gaining a number of powers meant to protect the sanctity of its territory. The island must be no larger than 1 square mile in area per Hit Die the nisid has (usually 6 HD), and the nisid must be the only intelligent creature on the island for 1 uninterrupted year to cement the bond. After the bond has been formed, the nisid gains the isolation and never come back abilities (see below), and receives a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks while on his island. A nisid who leaves his island for more than 1 hour per Hit Die or whose island is inhabited by an intelligent creature for longer than 1 month per Hit Die loses its island bond and must restart the bonding process, either on a new island or on the same island once all prerequisite conditions are met.",
			"",
			"**Isolation (Su)** A trespasser on the nisid's bonded island must succeed at a DC 17 Will save every full day she remains on the island or she takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage as the nisid magnifies the trials of survival on an uninhabited and dangerous island with little hope of rescue. This Wisdom damage does not heal naturally until the trespasser leaves the nisid's island (though it can be healed through magic normally), slowly driving her mad. The nisid can suppress this ability at will; typically, it does so until it determines the trespasser will not soon leave of her own volition or is otherwise going to be trouble. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Never Come Back (Su)** The nisid's ties to its island help keep it hidden from repeat visits, ensuring that even trespassers who want to return find doing so difficult. When a trespasser leaves a nisid's bonded island, she must attempt a DC 17 Will saving throw. Failure results in her memories of the place becoming hazy-especially when it comes to locating it again. She takes a -10 penalty on Survival and Knowledge (geography) checks to determine the island's location or find it again, and the island and the nisid are treated as though under the effects of a permanent [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell for any divination spells the target casts (use the nisid's caster level to determine the difficulty of overcoming this effect). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Nisids are castaway spirits, protectors of uninhabited or deserted islands. These little fey look like they might once have maintained a more delicate and youthful appearance, but after having spent decades or centuries alone, they look haggard, with unkempt hair and tough skin. Nisids rarely wear clothing, as they have little need for modesty or protection. They are excellent survivalists, living off what their island can provide.",
			"",
			"Loners by nature, a nisid claims and forms a bond with a single uninhabited island as his territory, and he seeks to preserve the island's untouched sanctity-and his own solitude. Should someone happen upon a nisid's island, whether as a castaway, stranded by a storm, or deliberately seeking something, the nisid first spies on the interloper using [invisibility](spell/invisibility) and [detect thoughts](spell/detect_thoughts) to assess her intent. If he determines that the trespasser simply wishes to get off the island, the nisid often offers to help his guest survive and escape (if only to hasten the process and return the island to its isolation). Using magic and his natural skill at survival, he may give the castaway access to water, food, or shelter-in exchange for leaving the island unsullied when she leaves. Those who agree and please the nisid might even be gifted with a final [gust of wind](spell/gust_of_wind) to send them on their way.",
			"",
			"However, those who arrive with no intention of leaving hastily, or who drastically overstay their welcome without hope of escape, find the nisid a more hostile host, as a nisid finds murder a small price to pay for solitude. Unwelcome guests find the trials of survival and hopelessness to be maddening, and every day drift closer to insanity through the nisid's isolation ability. Once the trespassers have been driven toward madness, the nisid attempts to turn them against each other, sowing distrust and casting [confusion](spell/confusion) on large groups. If all else fails, the nisid might coax charmed animals, the nisid's only companions, into attacking interlopers: nothing says \"get off my island\" like a giant beast crashing out of the jungle.",
			"",
			"With no desire to die-only to be left alone-the nisid eschews direct combat as much as possible, preferring to have his enemies deal with each other or succumb to the dangers of the island itself. If pushed to combat, he casts [call lightning](spell/call_lightning) and attempts to strike down his enemies from hiding, using his knowledge of the island to his advantage.",
			"",
			"Even when helping agreeable castaways, the nisid won't make life too easy, lest the trespassers decide to extend their stay. He makes just enough food and water available to sustain the \"guests,\" using abilities like [hallucinatory terrain](spell/hallucinatory_terrain) to keep any particularly bountiful areas of the island hidden. Should the island be a truly deserted one, perhaps where an ancient civilization once flourished, a nisid is especially vigilant in keeping ruins or artifacts that could attract further interest in the island well hidden. And once a castaway leaves a nisid's island, she rarely finds a way to return.",
			"",
			"A typical nisid stands 4 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds.",
			"",
			"Not much is known of nisids, since they are rarely encountered and even more rarely remembered. The first nisids may have been castaways themselves, banished from the First World until they discovered the small islands on which they could be alone, or other fey spirits who found their little pieces of land suddenly cut off from everything else. Whatever their origin, most nisids have lived solitary lives for decades or centuries-and prefer it that way, finding solace in solitude and having no desire to share their hidden homes.",
			"",
			"Nisids can be any gender, but have little interest in companionship or reproduction. With no one around to impress, they don't care about their appearance-though their fey nature still shines through despite their neglect. Over time surviving alone, their hair becomes ragged and their skin grows exceptionally tough. They craft their few weapons out of whatever the island has to offer.",
			"",
			"Nisids have no interest in treasure, as they have no use for it; however, they tend to collect the belongings of those who wash up on their shores and don't escape. They keep their treasure troves well hidden to prevent attracting interest from other trespassers.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nisids might choose any small, uninhabited island as home, regardless of climate. Jungle isles filled with strange fauna are equally as appealing to them as barren rocks in the icy north or island ruins in temperate climes. Some nisids favor deserted islands that once held civilization of some kind as homes. Those who choose such locales have the additional goal of keeping their islands' ruins a secret from outsiders; the last thing a nisid wants is a boat full of explorers and adventurers arriving on his island to plumb its depths, and he will use his abilities to keep such adventurers away.",
			"",
			"Nisids are introverts to the extreme. They have no interest in any kind of company, and engage in conversation for only as long as it takes to accomplish their goals. There is never more than one nisid on an island. No one has learned why nisids prefer such isolation, or what they do in their long years alone. Perhaps they spend time meditating on their leave of the First World-or seek a way back.",
			"",
			"A nisid's only companions are the local fauna, which the nisid charms to act as guardians. Small islands far from continental land are known for their oversized animals, and a canny nisid in residence holds the threat of such beasts as motivation for trespassers to leave or to avoid the island's inner depths-perhaps unleashing the animals upon them should their stay provoke hostility. However, their relationships with dolphins are a bit antagonistic, as the creatures delight in attempts to force the nisid to socialize and guide travelers to their isolated islands."

			"**Child-Scent (Ex)** A nochlean has the [scent](umr/scent) ability, but only with respect to humanoid children and immature animals. Thus, the nochlean could sniff out a child's hiding place or a den of wolf pups, but it could not sniff out the child's parents or the den mother.",
			"",
			"**Music Susceptibility (Su)** A nochlean is sensitive to music of all kinds, and different styles of music affect the nochlean in different ways. A creature within 20 feet of a nochlean can attempt to affect the creature with a Perform (keyboard, percussion, sing, string, or wind) check made as a standard action or when used to initiate another effect, such as a bardic performance. The nochlean must succeed at a Will saving throw with a DC equal to the result of the Perform check or become affected by the music for as long as the music persists. The nochlean is sickened by keyboard instruments, shaken by percussion instruments, enraged (per the [rage](spell/rage) spell) by singing, staggered by string instruments, and confused by wind instruments. The nochlean can be affected by only one type of music at a time; if it fails its saving throw against multiple types of music, only that with the highest Perform check result applies.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Predatory fey that delight in vandalizing homes, murdering pets, and stealing children, nochleans resemble incredibly thin, gangly humanoids with coarse black hair, large yellow eyes, and wickedly sharp claws. Their most recognizable features, however, are their extraordinary large ears. A nochlean's earlobes are several feet long, and it usually keeps them wrapped around its neck like a scarf or draped over its hands to conceal its claws from casual notice.",
			"",
			"Nochleans enjoy their wicked activities, frequently tittering from the shadows as they plan to raid a home, murder livestock, or lure away a lonely child. Nochleans are bold and crafty schemers who attack only when they feel like they have the advantage. A nochlean's careful plans evaporate in the presence of music, however, as the notes echoing around in their large ears affect them in erratic ways. Most nochleans flee from any source of music, and many tales tell of lone travelers unknowingly repelling the lurking creatures with casual whistling.",
			"",
			"A nochlean stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.",
			"",
			"Nochleans have lived at the edges of humanoid societies for millennia, their predations serving as a warning to children of all races and creeds to stay with their protectors and be wary of strangers. Nochleans are aware that humanoids use tales of their presence to frighten others, and they revel in the role thrust upon them and the depth of fear it can instill.",
			"",
			"Nochleans are gaunt and eerily slinky, as though perfectly built to hug shadowed corners, slither through windows, or extend a gangly arm from under a bed. They rely on stealth, suspense, and their alien appearance to frighten foes, as their build is narrow and hardly imposing. Still, to a child, nochleans stand frightfully tall. Nochleans usually wear simple clothes stolen from humans, but they generally have little use for propriety or modesty. Their long ears twitch frequently, particularly in response to sudden noises. When tracking by scent, a nochlean bends low to the ground, its dragging ears funneling odors toward its sniffing nose. A nochlean's claws are long and sharp, although its hands have a supernaturally narrow appearance. Their claws are remarkably agile despite their size, and nochleans use them to pry up windows, undo locks, or curl delicately around sleeping infants.",
			"",
			"Every few centuries, a nochlean develops a large cyst on its back, forcing it to give up its hunting for about a week as it sits hunched and uncommonly ponderous. The cyst grows quickly, soon becoming nearly as large as the nochlean itself. After a week, the cyst ruptures, and a fully formed duplicate of the \"parent\" nochlean emerges. This new nochlean understands how to hunt and how to speak Sylvan, although it picks up other languages it hears (usually, languages spoken in nearby humanoid communities) very quickly. The older nochlean typically drives the duplicate out of its hunting grounds to cut down competition, as nochleans are unwilling to work together even if they are copies of one other.",
			"",
			"Nochleans make their homes in small, rotten groves, which they fill with decaying plant matter, strung-up animal carcasses, and bedding that consists of soft but putrefying materials. A nochlean desires little else by way of physical comforts and eats very little. A nochlean might stay away from its lair for days at a time as it stalks a nearby settlement, returning to its putrefying bed to consume a rotting animal carcass and sleep for a few scant hours before leaving again. Although nochleans are unquestionably evil, many forest guardians who simply wish to see the forest thrive rarely trouble a nochlean or its lair. Despite their putrescent beds, nochleans subsist on decay; as they amass rotted vegetation and animal remains, they do actually beautify and aid the forest as a whole.",
			"",
			"Nochleans have an exceptionally long lifespan, although measuring a single nochlean's age is difficult when younger and nearly identical duplicates inhabit nearby lairs and might overlap in hunting areas. Most nochleans die at the hands of angry parents or forest guardians before reaching old age, but a nochlean surviving more than 500 years finds its black claws slowly whitening- the only indication of its advanced age.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nochleans can be found in any lush forest with plenty of undergrowth, particularly where humanoid settlements are near. Several nochleans live around the gnome community of Whistledown, although the cacophony of wind chimes placed on eaves and posts in that town usually keeps the nochleans at bay. To many in Whistledown, tales of big-eared child snatchers are mere fancy, as they don't realize how much their custom of hanging chimes to ward away \"evil spirits\" legitimately protects them from these evil fey.",
			"",
			"Nochleans lead solitary lives, aware that too many of their kind hunting in the same area would draw undue attention. Nochleans know they are safest when they are unnoticed by anyone other than their targets, and when frustrated farmers or grieving parents don't know whether to blame accident or malice for mysterious disappearances. No nochlean has a proper name; instead, each of them answers to the name \"Nochlean,\" although a few revel in epithets such as \"Snatcher\" or \"Shadowman\" bestowed upon them by frightened settlements where they hunt.",
			"",
			"Nochleans rely on subterfuge and a carefully studied knowledge of terrain to run or hide from confrontations, and some nochleans know the shadowed corners and overlooked hiding places around a settlement much better than the settlement's inhabitants do. Nochleans rarely enter a fight unless they feel they have the upper hand. In any confrontation, nochleans are notoriously difficult to pin down; they dart around attackers rather than stay put and, if pressed, teleport away from attackers that corner them. An endangered nochlean thinks nothing of abandoning its home or a fruitful hunting ground to find another, and the most fortunate hunters might find a kidnapped child trussed up but alive inside a lair a nochlean elected to abandon out of self-preservation.",
			"",
			"When they need to interact with humans in ways other than terrorizing or attacking them, nochleans prefer to disguise their distinctive appearance. They pull their common caps low, wrapping their distinctive ears around them like a scarf or a cloak, and remain in shadow to conceal their facial features. Certain unsavory traders strike deals with nochleans, as the fey monsters are skilled at procuring children useful for ransom, slavery, or darker purposes. Although nochleans like magic items that can aid them in their dark endeavors, they prefer to trade in favors, which they greedily hoard. A nochlean finds the mere presence of a musical instrument to be an unforgiveable offense, and a prospective negotiator might provoke a nochlean into a blind fury simply by failing to conceal a flute or fiddle."

In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is.

The dreams a nue impregnates creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice.",

According to these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a once-strong and proud target that has been brought low by its debilitating attacks.",

They are likely to settle in abandoned homes, which they take care of in their own peculiar way."

It is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while slowly wearing down the inhabitants' mental faculties with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of psychic magic prove to be favored targets, as their mental energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature that succumbs to a nulmind's mind drain aura might eventually become enslaved to the fungus's alien will, the nulmind using such unfortunate creatures to draw in further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple extension of the nulmind's need to feed.",
			"",
			"Left unchecked, a nulmind rapidly depletes the local wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and a nulmind inevitably works to find richer sources of intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles. Because of this, druid enclaves often actively hunt and destroy these creatures before they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Despite the fungi's plantlike nature, most druidic communities view nulminds as anathema to the natural order.",
			"",
			"Nulminds are fortunately rare, with no documented culture or organization. These creatures rarely work well in concert, as each is ultimately selfish and sees only to its own needs, draining even its fellows without hesitation. Despite their insatiability, nulminds seem to lack a taste for the mental energy of fey creatures. While the fungi still defend themselves against fey creatures, they go out of their way to avoid areas where such creatures live.",

			"These diminutive serpentine creatures are distant cousins to powerful linnorms. Nycars live in the frigid, desolate moors and marshes of colder climates where their cruel and savage activities often escape unnoticed. A nycar relishes the hunt and often stalks a creature for hours before finally inflicting a single savage bite, then withdraws to safety to wait for its prey to sicken and die. Nycars often kill wastefully, attacking creatures much larger than they can eat. The opportunity to eat a human or other intelligent creature is a rare treat, as a nycar's uninviting habitat usually prevents much interaction with all but the most isolated people.",
			"",
			"A nycar keeps a small subterranean lair, often accessed from an underwater entrance similar to the entrance to a beaver's den. Like a linnorm, it seeks treasure and hoards it in its lair. Much of its treasure is worthless trinkets and shiny baubles of little value, but by random chance one may discover a few valuable items over the course of its lifetime. A nycar usually sets simple traps and snares to protect its lair and treasure hoard while it is away or sleeping.",

Nycar eggs are black and about the size of an adult human's fist; a female will feed and look after hatchlings for up to a year, so long as they remain in her territory. Upon reaching adulthood, a nycar weighs about 12 pounds, and can live up to 90 years.",

Yet those who would seek to abuse or harm her or her home quickly find that behind her beauty is a fierce protector more than capable of defending her charge."

An obambo is cunning, spiteful, and treacherous, but it remembers its old role of teacher and storyteller, a duty and an obligation it both loves and loathes. While dealing with an obambo is dangerous, they are known to assist those in need, if supplicants can meet the obambo's price."

			"**Annihilation (Su)** Any spaces an oblivion moves through are left fallow and lifeless in its wake. Ground that it moves over using its base speed becomes barren and is treated as if affected by a diminish plants spell to stunt growth. Dead bodies that the oblivion moves through immediately crumble into dust. Any constrict damage an oblivion deals to a creature automatically bypasses all damage reduction. A creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this constrict damage is immediately slain and its remains (but not its gear) are disintegrated. Once per round as a free action, an oblivion can target a single object in its space. A non-magical object so targeted is immediately destroyed. A magical item must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Dubiety (Su)** An oblivion's presence is anathema to the gods and the forces that bind creation together. Its presence warps divine magic and severs living beings from the power of life. Any living creature that begins its turn within range of an oblivion's aura of dubiety takes 2d6 points of negative energy damage. This negative energy has no beneficial effect on undead. A creature attempting to cast a divine spell within 60 feet of an oblivion must succeed at a concentration check as if casting defensively (DC = 15 + double the spell level) or the spell is automatically subverted, allowing the oblivion to decide the spell's target and effect as if it were the original caster. If the affected spell uses positive energy, the subverted spell instead uses negative energy.",
			"",
			"**Immunity to Annihilation (Ex)** An oblivion is immune to destruction spells, disintegrate effects, spheres of annihilation, and similar effects that completely destroy living creatures.",
			"",
			"**Immunity to Banishment (Ex)** An oblivion is never treated as having the extraplanar subtype, regardless of what plane it currently inhabits, rendering it immune to banishment, dismissal, and similar effects. In addition to this, effects that force the oblivion onto another plane (such as plane shift or the violet beam of a prismatic spray) do not function against an oblivion unless the effect comes from an artifact, a creature capable of granting spells to its worshipers, or a mythic source.",
			"",
			"**Master of Annihilation (Ex)** An oblivion can establish control over a sphere of annihilation as far away as 100 feet. When an oblivion controls a sphere of annihilation, it does so through force of will and an inborn understanding of the sphere's reality-the oblivion's control check is 1d20 + the oblivion's Hit Dice + its Charisma modifier (the typical oblivion has a control check bonus of +31, and thus can never fail to control a sphere of annihilation unless control of the sphere is opposed). When an oblivion establishes control, it can maintain control at a distance of 100 feet + 20 feet per Hit Die (620 feet for the typical oblivion), and the sphere's speed under the oblivion's control is 20 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the oblivion's control check result in that round exceeded 30.",
			"",
			"**Servants of Entropy (Su)** As a full-round action, an oblivion can reform any living creature it has slain within the past hour, forging an obedient duplicate from its own dark mass. Servants created in this manner are identical to their original forms, with all their associated memories, racial abilities, and class abilities, except the duplicate loses any divine spellcasting ability its original form had. A servant's alignment changes to neutral evil, its type changes to native outsider (do not recalculate hit points, saving throws, or similar abilities), and it gains negative energy affinity. An oblivion can communicate telepathically with its servants anywhere on the same plane and can destroy a servant as a free action. An oblivion can manifest a total number of Hit Dice worth of servants equal to twice its own Hit Dice (52 for a typical oblivion), but no single servant can have more Hit Dice than the oblivion's CR. An oblivion cannot manifest more than one copy of any given creature at one time.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Creation (Ex)** An oblivion is a manifestation of disbelief and decay, and the forces of compassion and creativity are anathema to it. It is vulnerable to positive energy, taking damage as if it were undead, though it retains its control over any divine spells, allowing it to often usurp and corrupt cure spells and similar curative magic. An oblivion loses its regeneration any round in which it either takes damage from positive energy or is within 30 feet of a creature that succeeds at a DC 35 Perform check. Creatures under the effect of a good hope spell, an inspire courage bardic performance, or any spell effect of 5th level or higher that grants a morale bonus gain immunity to the negative energy damage dealt by an oblivion's slams and aura of dubiety.",
			"",
			"**Talisman of the Sphere (Ex)** The talisman of the sphere is anathema to an oblivion. A character who carries a talisman of the sphere can penetrate an oblivion's damage reduction with ease, ignores its spell resistance, is immune to its aura, and gains a +10 bonus on saving throws against the oblivion's special attacks and spell-like abilities.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Rare and powerful denizens of the Negative Energy Plane, oblivions are void and nothingness given terrible will. They lurk among crystalline sheets of accumulated entropy that line their home plane's darkest interior, hungering to unmake the walls of reality and drag all of the cosmos down to its eventual end, allowing themselves to also finally end. Once unleashed upon mortal worlds, oblivions crisscross the globe, destroying its denizens and laying waste to the land until destroyed themselves or until they strip a planet bare of substance, life, and heat. Despite its vast bulk, a single oblivion must often dedicate years or even centuries to ending a world, and each is so adept at scrubbing away all traces a being leaves upon the cosmos that people, nations, and entire worlds annihilated by an oblivion are soon forgotten by outsiders. Some gods claim that the brutal efficiency of the oblivions are intended to someday be released upon the multiverse to cleanse away creation so a new cycle of life can begin from chaotic nothing, while other deities insist the oblivions' work is nearly complete, leaving only isolated specks of life floating in a vast, unfeeling void.",
			"",
			"Unlike nightshades or other noteworthy denizens of their dark realm, oblivions serve no masters or agendas. They believe themselves to be the way all things must end. Though cunning, they rarely find reason to communicate with other creatures, leaving much of their motives, origins, and philosophy in the cosmos a mystery.",
			"",
			"Like grim doll makers, oblivions can recreate slain victims from their own dark substance, transforming a world's heroes and villains into hollow pawns they can dispatch to slay would-be heroes or undermine organized resistance. Lacking any inherent ability to traverse the planes, most oblivions rely on such servants created in the shapes of powerful spellcasters or outsiders to provide routes to new worlds. These hollow reproductions know little of their masters' will beyond sharing comfort in the coming end of days, and most desperately fill in the gaps with appealing philosophies. Some of the most powerful servants form doomsday cults on distant planets to prepare them for an oblivion's arrival.",
			"",
			"Oblivions share a symbiosis with the artifacts known as spheres of annihilation, coveting their powerful, highly destructive magic. The towering oozes are unaffected by the artifact's destructive powers, and can move them as easily as a child might carry a toy. Some speculate that the spheres are in fact the eggs or spores of these apocalyptic beings, as rare survivors recount tales of spheres spontaneously birthing the roiling, devouring entities.",
			"",
			"Oblivions typically measure several dozen feet across, though their presence corrupts and consumes life, making the roiling darkness that most people mistake for their bodies seem much larger. Despite their size, oblivions have no mass. Upon destruction, an oblivion collapses thunderously into nothing"

This functions as the combat maneuver form of the telekinesis spell (caster level 9th, combat maneuver bonus +14), including the need to maintain concentration.

This ability has a range of 1,000 feet, requires line of effect to some part of the area, and lasts as long as the oceanid concentrates.

At rest, their flat, pulsing bodies stand roughly 6 inches tall and can stretch out to a wide diameter-in motion, they often ball up into quivering spherical shapes and almost seem to roll as they move. Their malleable bodies allow them to seep through cracks and holes far smaller than the space they fill. Creatures dwelling below ground often attempt to seal up any such cracks to fortify their lairs against ochre jellies.",
			"",
			"An ochre jelly's highly specialized acid only dissolves flesh. This discovery has led many poisoners and hack alchemists to search out specimens for their tinkering. Some specialized weapons have resulted from these experiments that target the living body in wicked ways. Rumors of a slow-release poison that breaks down the cellular walls in living creatures surfaced a few years ago, but its creator guards the secret with his life.",
			"",
			"Notes in a long-forgotten tome mention a burial practice used in faraway places that resembles cremation. Instead of burning the corpse to ashes, the practitioners seal the body into a stone sarcophagus with an ochre jelly so it can dissolve the body. Afterward, the morticians place the ochre jelly into a large canopic jar, complete with a bronze plaque naming the deceased. This practice protects items entombed with the body (which is quickly reduced to nothing but a polished skeleton), and the creature's essence, it is believed, still rides along with the living jelly.",
			"",
			"Ochre jellies stand about 6 inches tall, spread out to a little over 10 feet in diameter, and weigh upward of 2,600 pounds. When in combat, they tend to pile up upon themselves and exude long, dripping pseudopods to slam and grapple anything that moves.",
			"",
			"Although the typical ochre jelly has stats as presented here, in the deepest reaches of the underground world these mindless predators can grow to enormous sizes. Perhaps more disturbing, though, are rumors of ochre jellies that have developed additional methods of capturing prey. Adventurers speak of jellies capable of poisoning foes with a touch or exuding clouds of noxious gas that burns the eyes and throat, leaving those who draw too near helpless as the immense protoplasmic beast slithers over their bodies and begins to feed."

If one of these hairs is plucked with a successful steal combat maneuver, the ohancanu gains 2 negative levels. The ohancanu automatically regrows the lost white hair and recovers the negative levels after 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are massive, brutal forest creatures that delight in destruction. Appearing as giant humanoids, ohancanus are thick and powerfully muscled, with simian arms that reach nearly to the ground. Although ohancanus have a single eye in the center of their foreheads, they are fey creatures and unrelated to the ancient cyclops race. Ohancanus have wide noses and large mouths filled with blunt teeth. All ohancanus are hirsute; males have full, thick beards and the rare females (called ohancanas) have long, unruly hair on their heads. All ohancanus have dark hair with a few white strands; on males, these white strands grow in their beards, while on females, they sprout from their heads. The white strands anchor the ohancanu's essence, so pulling out these strands causes the fey to weaken and die.",
			"",
			"An ohancanu stands 10 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are rapacious and destructive, befouling the forests in which they live. They block up streams in order to grab trapped fish, cause rockslides to wound prey, and hew down healthy trees just for the joy of killing. Ohancanus like to hunt, but they don't have the patience to set traps or wait in ambush; instead, they charge at their prey with their axes held high. Ohancanus kill far more game than they eat and leave the carcasses to rot.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus often live for centuries, spending their years ranging throughout large forests. They prefer to keep on the move and rarely stay in one location for more than a few days unless a need arises, such as manufacturing a new axe or waiting out a fierce and lengthy storm. Because they are so long-lived, ohancanus develop good instincts for where to find the easiest prey and how to avoid the few predators they can't simply slaughter.",
			"",
			"Despite their brutal disregard for the forest and its creatures, ohancanus' life cycle is inherently tied to old trees in deep forests. Ohancanus do not conceive or bear young. Instead, they murder the old and feeble among their kind and carve out their organs to bury among the roots of the oldest tree they can find. A year later, a young ohancanu bursts free from the earth in the same spot. If the burial tree is particularly vigorous, it might spawn twin or triplet ohancanus. Ohancanus emerge with rudimentary survival skills and the ability to speak; most dimly recall learning these skills from the spirit of their butchered \"parent\" while developing underground.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are born with a full head of hair (and, for males, a beard), including the white hairs that are so debilitating when plucked. Ohancanus emerge with only a few white hairs, but an ohancanu that survives a nearfatal experience (such as a long fall or a lightning strike) might sprout an additional white hair. An ohancanu with many white hairs is called a \"death dodger\" by admiring companions. Pulling out an ohancanu's white hair is not only enervating, but also painful and demoralizing; an ohancanu with a plucked hair is likely to flee to a place of safety until the white hair regrows.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are surprisingly nimble, given their great size, and are naturally athletic. They are agile climbers, can swim well, and can walk at a constant, plodding pace for days without tiring.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Ohancanus inhabit old-growth forests such as the Verduran Forest and the Fangwood. They wander the forest throughout their lives, searching for civilized structures to destroy, creatures to terrorize, and food to sate their prodigious appetites. Ohancanus prefer a diet of nuts, berries, and fresh meat (particularly humanoids and game animals such as deer and rabbits), but they can draw sustenance from most organic matter, including bark and carrion.",
			"",
			"Though they wander too much to establish true lairs, ohancanus sometimes form campsites in shallow caves or on small islands. These sites are marked by years of occasional occupation by wandering ohancanus and often contain old bones, forgotten trinkets, and simple whetstones to keep axes sharp. A traveler discovering an unoccupied ohancanu campsite is well advised to move on, as one of these itinerant brutes might return to the campsite at any time.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus take great joy in destroying things, particularly things built by humanoids. They eagerly demolish bridges, cottages, fences, and other structures with a compulsion that borders on fanaticism. They gleefully attack humanoid defenders as well, in order to fill their bellies after the effort of wanton destruction. If a structure is too well defended for an ohancanu to overcome alone, he retreats only long enough to gather allies before returning to attack again.",
			"",
			"Despite their brutish malevolence, ohancanus are social creatures and enjoy the company of their own kind. Ohancanus often congregate to form small hunting groups, although such groups rarely work well together. If the group corners appetizing prey, such as a large deer or a plump gnome, the ohancanus often fall to bickering over who claims it. Wily prey can turn the greedy ohancanus against each other long enough to flee. In the face of serious danger, ohancanus value their own lives over all other concerns, trampling their companions in a rush to escape. The only time ohancanus collaborate well is when destroying a large structure such as a dam, fort, or small settlement.",
			"",
			"Once every 4 years, the ohancanus of a forest gather in a large moot to exchange information, settle grudges, butcher the elderly, and participate in brutal sports. Although wrestling and sparring are popular pastimes, no ohancanu will pull the beard or hair of another. Pulling out the white hair of another ohancanu, even by accident, is one of the few taboos among these brutal fey.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus are not religious, but they have a deep respect for dramatic natural phenomena such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and forest fires. When a storm approaches, ohancanus collect prisoners to \"sacrifice\" to the storm by lashing them to the tops of windblown trees or pinning them beneath boulders in the path of flash floods.",
			"",
			"Ohancanus particularly enjoy riddles, although their limited intellect means that they have difficulty making up new riddles and that even their hardest riddles would be generally considered quite simple. Ohancanus typically see other creatures as prey to consume or predators to avoid, but a canny traveler can offer a riddle to an ohancanu to quell its bloodlust. Ohancanus' patience for exchanging riddles only extends so far, though, as they get frustrated when they cannot answer a riddle and angry when their simple riddles are easily answered. Most travelers seek to distract an ohancanu just long enough to plan an escape or lure the creature into squatting low enough to yank out one of his white hairs and send him fleeing. Discovering just the right level of difficulty to appease ohancanus without frustrating them enough to trigger their attacks is a puzzle of a higher order than most riddles!"

When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or attempt an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in a square adjacent to the oma. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size: two Huge creatures, four Large, and so on).

A creature 5 feet away in the mist has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

While an oneirogen is immune to the effects of these vapors, any creature that enters the mists within 5 feet of the oneirogen is affected (see below). These fumes don't impede vision any more than the oneirogen's obscuring fog ability already does. They can also be blown or burnt away (and recover) in the same manner. ",

The creature can attempt another Will save every round to wake up and can be woken up as if it had been affected by the spell sleep. Creatures that succeed at the save to resist this effect are immune to that oneirogen's veil of mists for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Oneirogens were once normal mortals who suffered a rare but terrible curse. Within them lies a sliver-sized tear between planes, a crack hardly larger than a pinprick that destroys everything they once were in an endless deluge of planar power. Created by magical mistakes and otherworldly conjunctions, oneirogens wander in a haze as living husks whose grip on any reality has been erased. What little remains of their minds is bent on self-preservation, even as they are locked at the center of storms of strange powers endlessly streaming from their mouths and nostrils. The death of their personalities might be a mercy, but what lingers on are primal beings, slaves of uncontrolled planar might.",
			"",
			"While the portal trapped within an oneirogen might connect to any plane of existence, it most commonly provides a path to the Dimension of Dreams. As mortal minds already drift toward that realm, breaches between the waking and unconscious worlds might occur when potent magics attempt to tamper with the boundaries of dream. The notorious tome, The Chain of Nights, is just one grimoire known to plumb the depths of thought and nightmare. Those who attempt to use such magic without full mastery, though, risk transforming themselves or those they would aid into drifters trapped between planes.",
			"",
			"Some rare, unsettling reports tell of groups of oneirogens collecting in a single place, flooding the surrounding area with planar energies. The effects of such energies on the world surrounding them are unpredictable and usually deadly to native inhabitants.",
			"",
			"Oneirogens might arise from any humanoid race, but always appear as mysterious figures cloaked in a strange haze or fog. These creatures rarely live for long, as their bodies swiftly wither from exposure to planar energies, and most lack enough sense of self to bother with eating or other basic needs. Only if protected and tended will an oneirogen live for more than a week.",
			"",
			"### Variant Oneirogens",
			"",
			"Although most oneirogens are living conduits to the Dimension of Dreams, an oneirogen might be linked to almost any plane of existence. While the creatures' statistics are the same regardless of the plane to which they're bound, the effects of the raw planar energy infusing its veil of mists changes. Presented here are variant veils of mists tied to other planes to which an oneirogen might be bound.",
			"",
			"Abaddon: The oneirogen's portal opens into the Plaguemere, the unholy realm of Apollyon. Creatures that enter the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be staggered by the noxious smell for 1 round and contract red ache.",
			"",
			"Abyss: The oneirogen's portal opens into a vicious Abyssal wilderness of gnashing fangs and nameless, shrieking things. A creature that enters the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be shaken for 1 round and take a -2 penalty on Will saves for the next 24 hours. The penalty on Will saves ends prematurely if the creature benefits from any effect that grants a morale bonus.",
			"",
			"Elemental Planes: The oneirogen's portal opens into an expanse of one of the Elemental Planes. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 1d6 points of energy damage. The type of damage varies depending on the relevant Elemental Plane: acid damage for the Elemental Plane of Earth, cold damage for the Elemental Plane of Water, electricity damage for the Elemental Plane of Air, and fire damage for the Elemental Plane of Fire.",
			"",
			"Elysium: The oneirogen's portal opens to euphoric haze somewhere in Elysium. Creatures that enter the veil of mists must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be confused for 1 round. Additionally, the character feels unusually excited or amorous for the rest of the day (no statistical effect).",
			"",
			"Energy Planes: The oneirogen's portal opens to the overwhelming reaches of either the Positive or Negative Energy Plane. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 1d6 points of damage of the appropriate type. They take an additional 1d6 points of damage 1 round later, even if they've left the veil of mists, due to the intense energy coursing through their bodies. If the creature is killed by unrestrained positive energy, its body is reduced to a fine ash, making resurrection more challenging. If the creature is killed by unrestrained negative energy, the corpse reanimates as a zombie in 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"Hell: The oneirogen's portal opens into a terrible inferno somewhere deep in Hell. Creatures that enter the veil of mists take 2d4 points of damage. Half of this damage is fire damage and half is untyped damage resulting from infernal energy.",
			"",
			"Shadow Plane: An oneirogen's portal opens to a realm of vaporous darkness within the Shadow Plane. Any creature that comes within 5 feet of the oneirogen is blinded for as long as it remains adjacent to the oneirogen. The oneirogen isn't affected by this effect.",
			"",
			"Wild Portal: In the rarest cases, one side of an oneirogen's portal is locked within its body, but the other wildly lashes through the planes of existence, connecting to a different reality every round. In the case of such creatures, roll 1d12 at the beginning of the oneirogen's turn. Its veil of mists ability randomly corresponds to the Dimension of Dreams, the four elemental planes, the two energy planes, Abaddon, the Abyss, Elysium, Hell, and the Shadow Plane."

Whenever an atamahuta casts a spell with a range of \"touch\" from its spell-like abilities, it can deliver the spell through any weapon it is holding as part of a free melee attack at its highest base attack bonus as part of casting its spell. If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. This attack uses the weapon's critical multiplier (usually &times;3), but the spell effect only deals \u001b2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier. An atamahuta cannot make a full attack during the same round that it uses a spell-like ability unless another effect would allow it to do so.",

			"**Ward Off Distractions (Ex)** An atamahuta uses one of its heads to defend against attacks while the other is using a spell-like ability, giving it a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity while casting.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Atamahuta are immensely strong oni spirits who have donned the physical guise of ettins. Combining oni's trademark guile with ettins' unadulterated brawn, atamahuta use their two-headed forms to inflict as much damage as possible by fusing their arcane powers with their distinctive melee combat style.",
			"",
			"Because of the raw power they infuse into the bodies they inhabit, atamahuta are slightly bigger than normal ettins. An atamahuta is 14 feet tall and weighs 5,500 pounds.",
			"",
			"While many might think an atamahuta possesses two heads and is therefore made up of two distinct oni, each being is composed of only one oni spirit. When an atamahuta takes form, it divides its powers into two parts, granting one half of its being its ingenuity and magical prowess and the other its anger and savage strength. An ettin's body is the most suitable for this division of powers, which manifests itself physically as one head having a seeming dominance over the other. The atamahuta's right head most directly controls its actions in physical combat, and is also the only one that talks; the left head, meanwhile, constantly spills nonsense words and mutterings under its breath, and is the source of the oni's arcane power. Oni scholars have speculated that an individual atamahuta's underlying, unvoiced wishes and desires are encoded in the gibberish that burbles from its left head, and that by listening closely enough, one can garner valuable information about the oni spirit, but few have survived an atamahuta encounter long enough to test this theory. Regardless of whatever babbling the left head produces, most witnesses agree that atamahuta strive for power and fear-induced respect more than anything else, and will go to grotesque lengths to garner them, through means both violent and utterly despicable.",
			"",
			"Atamahuta possess the ability to change shape just as other oni, but the visage of an uncontrollably violent ettin is often even more horrifying to civilized creatures than that of an oni, whom most regard as equally evil but at least somewhat reasonable. Thus, most atamahuta find it beneficial to procure a silver-tongued ally who can act as a gateway to the more powerful and wise oni itself. Once they have established control over a certain realm, atamahuta will usually either kill or enslave their allies, seeing the beguilers as potential threats to their rule. Atamahuta have little patience for any individual that wastes their time, and oversee their domain with an unforgiving and steadfast fist. Oni who inhabit the form of an ettin usually possess violent and unruly dispositions to begin with, but most know better than to act brashly when they first arrive in their physical forms and keep their rage at bay-at least until they establish their dominion over the lesser beings around them.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Oni(monster/family:oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Atamahuta resemble ettins in both temperament and physical form, but their similarities end here. Most atamahuta look down upon the monstrous giants as barbaric, imperfect versions of an ideal form, and impose their superior strength and intellect upon the creatures in order to enslave them. While a single atamahuta can easily coerce and garner the aid of several ettins, the oni tend to establish elaborate slave rings in order to most effectively \"recruit\" high numbers of individuals, including ettins as well as other intelligent humanoids. Several atamahuta oversee the operation, while their shackled minions act as both enforcers of the slavers' rules and prisoners themselves, hoping to garner some miniscule form of freedom through cooperation. Their sheer cunning allows atamahuta to trick their prisoners into thinking this, when in reality the only escape an atamahuta's slave can hope to achieve is through transfer to another owner or death.",
			"",
			"When atamahuta establish slave rings, they often make a business of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder in private auctions and black market deals. Occasionally, atamahuta will also run economically viable businesses on the side, putting their enslaved minions to work in remote fields or mines far from civilization. Atamahuta are rarely content to remain rulers over a stagnant position, and seek to advance their dominion as far as possible. Their prowess for ruthless business tactics and intimidating rivals into positions of subservience makes them potent forces in whatever realm they seek to control. Atamahuta often join merchants' guilds and other such organizations after starting their slave rings, creating legitimate business fronts in order to infiltrate the guilds and wrest control of them. With this power, they can impose seemingly fair taxes upon their competitors, ultimately running them out of business and establishing themselves as the sole means of trade within a community. Of course, they must do this all through surrogates, as few trade organizations would permit an oni or an ettin into their ranks, and even then, many guilds have imposed strict rules regarding representatives into their systems in order to prevent such atamahuta-run monopolies from developing in the first place.",
			"",
			"Atamahuta are typically distrustful of other oni, as they see them as potential threats to their power, and thus only rarely ally themselves with other such beings. Occasionally, however, such alliances can prove to be mutually beneficial, and so atamahuta team up with weaker oni such as yamabushi tengus or kuwa, so that they can reap the rewards of such a coalition while still retaining the most power. More intelligent or powerful oni recognize atamahuta for their oblivious nature and will often manipulate the beings for their strength, tricking the ettin-shaped oni into thinking they are dominant in the friendship until the more powerful oni has used the atamahuta for their intended purpose, at which point the beings are swiftly discarded."

			"Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of stone giants, earth yai scorn that race's humble ambitions, and instead prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power. This belief doesn't necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages, though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power, leading many to become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace more subtle, longterm machinations in their pursuit of gradual and farreaching ruin.",
			"",

			"",
			"Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the stone giants their otherworldly shapes mimic. While stone giants often appear to be sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no impact on their formidable resilience.",
			"",
			"Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of a catapult shot. Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy bridge supports.",

			"Earth yai dream of conquest like many other oni, but how they pursue victory tends to vary from individual to individual. While all would agree that victory is only attained when one's foes are crushed and shattered, the methods used to accomplish this goal range from brute displays of power to the slow erosion of a foe till nothing remains. The scope of an earth yai's ambitions also seems largely dependent on its age, with younger oni proving content to raid territories and subjugate peasant villages, while older individuals seek greater conquests and the destruction of whole lands.",
			"",
			"Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim. Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these oni would never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek new challenges-if such opportunities don't present themselves during the oni's rule. These oni might move on to find new opponents, but still regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and instill dread among their prisoners.",
			"",
			"While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and centuries of experience. An oni who finds itself bested time and time again might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait before a threat to them passes' perhaps with the help of a few inconvenient disasters to accelerate an enemy's decline.",
			"",
			"When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in such conflicts, but they are never exploited. These oni see a final battle between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred.",
			"",
			"Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs in mazelike mountain ravines and in large caverns near the earth's surface. These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the oni often make use of their passwall ability to sink through solid barriers or walk past gates that don't appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their liking. If any creature interrupts an oni in its lair, the oni violently attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they trespass upon the oni's private home. This obsession with privacy extends not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they themselves demand the lesser creatures' presence.",

Known as daifus, such earth yai have Charisma scores of at least 20 and can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: stoneskin, summon monster XI (earth elementals only), wall of stone. Most earth yai daifus are sorcerers or oracles with abilities tied to the earth or destruction. Earth yai daifus add +1 to their CRs."

			"A ja noi is an oni spirit that takes the form of a hobgoblin, and differs physically from the hobgoblins in a variety of ways, most notably its unearthly strength and distorted appearance. A ja noi's skin blazes a fiery red rather than a drab gray, and the oni bears prominent ridges on its brow and forehead.",
			"",
			"Ja noi live to fight. While not as physically powerful as most oni, ja noi nonetheless have an insatiable thirst for combat that drives them to pursue the trials of battle and bloodshed. The sensation of hot blood splattering on a ja noi's skin provokes an adrenaline rush that only fuels its lust for the kill. Its broad, tightly muscled physique and prowess in combat inspire awe within typical hobgoblins, who see the ja noi as a leader who ensures victory in their conquests.",
			"",
			"Towering over the hobgoblins it resembles, a ja noi stands a little over 6 feet tall and weighs about 220 pounds.",
			"",
			"All oni believe the Material Plane's inhabitants fail to take advantage of the wealth of sensations they have at their disposal. While most of these evil spirits inhabit shells and rise to power by working behind the scenes' manipulating others into doing most of their foul deeds for them-ja noi take a more direct approach, conquering and slaughtering any who would stand against them and their armies. Ja noi embrace the carnal joys of slaughter, and no situation is more pleasant to a ja noi than the heat of combat upon a war-ravaged battlefield. These hardened oni often recognize the inevitable outcome of their warlike tendencies, knowing that death could always be just around the corner; this knowledge, however, only further stimulates their greed for sensation, inspiring them to embrace every fight, as they know it could be their last. A ja noi silences its mind and ignores everything else while on the battlefield, reveling in the current moment and the sensations of combat: the crunch of bones beneath a worn club, the spray of dying foes' blood, and the scattered guts and heads of fallen brawlers.",
			"",
			"Like other oni, ja noi possess the ability to change shape, and often use this ability to confuse enemies in the midst of battle, altering their appearances to look like allies, only to bash in an unsuspecting foe's head before the victim knows what's happened. This brutish trickery is usually the extent of a ja noi's guile, however, as the hobgoblin oni are hardly known for their cunning. Even in regard to tactics, ja noi usually implement only the basest plans of action, simply relying on their weaker minions to take the brunt of an opposing army's blow while they target the commanders, always seeking the most worthy challenger and forever striving for that feeling that comes just as one is fighting for one's life. The most powerful ja noi are exceptions to this rule, however, and tales tell of expert ja noi leaders who excel in both physical prowess and tactical wit. These commanders quickly reach the status of generals, and work alongside other oni to manipulate vast armies of soldiers, both humanoid and goblinoid.",
			"",
			"Once they take physical form, ja noi rarely last more than a couple years on the Material Plane, their deadly lifestyle often a limiting factor in this regard. They either die in battle or at the hands of mutinous troops or allies, minions who realize that they are merely pawns in the game of war that the ja noi is constantly playing. Thus, most of these oni practice their battle skills constantly against one another, their strongest hobgoblin followers, and their adroit adversaries, always fighting and becoming more powerful. While they care little for the arcane, ja noi hone some magical abilities in order to inflict maximum damage on the battlefield, and a few even seek out magical items to bolster their strength.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Oni(monster/family:oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Whereas many oni prefer to act alone and in secret, ja noi recognize the concept of strength in numbers, and understand that banding together is often a surer way to glorious victories than lone pursuits. The rare lone ja noi may seek out renowned heroes and martial senseis to challenge in one-on-one combat, but most of these creatures know the best way to demonstrate their prowess is in the midst of the chaotic battlefield in front of other oni, especially fellow ja noi. Often, when ja noi work together to bring carnage to the field of war, they keep track of each other's kills, ranking one another in terms of strength and skill. An individual who shows cowardice repeatedly or does not prove a useful ally swiftly meets the blade of a supposed comrade, as ja noi have little patience for weak accomplices.",
			"",
			"Ja noi are seen as lowly and primal by other oni, but they possess immense amounts of authority among the lesser hobgoblins around them, and so they surround themselves with these minions, viewing them as useful fodder for the battles to come. During the fight, a ja noi's amateur hobgoblin warriors combat the masses of the opposing army, allowing the prideful oni to engage the commanders. Having found what they consider an ideal militaristic race, ja noi prefer to use hobgoblins for their war campaigns if possible, though they settle for other soldiers if doing so clearly benefits the oni and they have the mortals' unquestioning loyalty. More often, a ja noi will employ non-hobgoblin minions to serve as slaves or some other form of chattel, putting them to work crafting armor and weapons or cleaning up during the aftermath of a successful battle.",
			"",
			"In rare cases, more powerful oni ask ja noi to lead armies against particularly stubborn groups of opponents. Ja noi rarely refuse such requests, knowing that much blood will be shed in the ventures-and that denying the requests of stronger oni is a sure path to a quick death. Like all oni, ja noi despise and seek out kami, reveling in the destruction of minor spirits and hunting the more powerful individuals for the sheer challenge of it. Because of the strictures of the Laws of Golden Perfection, ja noi cannot directly slay kami, and so they work to direct their vicious hobgoblin armies to complete the task instead.",
			"",
			"In extremely rare cases, when they have no campaigns to wage and no humanoid enemies to battle, ja noi simply disappear into the wilderness to fight the mightiest creatures they can find. Laying waste to big game such as bulettes and owlbears can distract a ja noi between large-scale battles, but it doesn't take long before the natural warrior quickly feels the lust for battle surge within it once again. Given too much time between skirmishes, a ja noi might turn its violent attention toward its followers, slaughtering entire hobgoblin tribes out of frustration and madness. Canny hobgoblins in service to a bloodthirsty ja noi are wise to find opposing groups for the oni to battle, that the resulting conflict might temporarily sate the ja noi's incessant desire for war."

			"**Grasping Eddy (Su)** As a standard action, a kigyo can create a powerful underwater eddy that holds its enemies in place. The oni selects a grid intersection within 30 feet on or beneath the surface of a body of water as the center of the eddy. The oni can attempt an immediate grapple combat maneuver check against any enemies within a 10-foot radius of this point, as though the targets were within its reach. As a swift action in each subsequent round the eddy remains in place, the oni can maintain the grapple on those targets caught within the eddy's grasp (attempting a separate combat maneuver check for each target). In order to pin a target or deal damage with this effect, the oni must take a standard action as normal. The eddy persists as long as the kigyo continues to take at least a swift action on its turn to maintain a grapple. The effect immediately ends if all targets escape the eddy or if the kigyo does not spend any actions to use this ability, falls unconscious or dies, or moves more than 30 feet from the eddy's center. The kigyo can maintain only one grasping eddy at a time.",
			"",
			"**Trident Mastery (Ex)** Kigyos are experts at employing tridents as deadly weapons.

			"",
			"**Underwater Grappler (Ex)** Kigyos are skilled grapplers and know how to use their underwater environs to their advantage when in close combat with their foes. A kigyo gains a +4 racial bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks while it or its target is at least partially underwater. This bonus also applies to grapple combat maneuver checks the kigyo attempts while using its grasping eddy ability. The kigyo gains no bonus to its CMD against grapple attempts.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Oni are most often found in Tian Xia on the opposite side of the world from ancient Azlant, though some, such as the powerful [ogre mage](monster/ogre_mage), have expanded their influence to include other continents including Avistan and Garund. Not all oni live on land, however, and the vengeful spirits have been known to take the form of humanoid species that dwell mostly or entirely underwater. While most oni are rare, those that take aquatic forms are scarcely ever encountered by terrestrial folk, though [locathahs](unknown/locathahs), [merfolk](monster/merfolk), and other aquatic races are more likely to encounter these sea-dwelling oni than they are to meet ogre mages or other land-borne spirits. The most common submarine oni is the kigyo, which adopts a form resembling a corrupted parody of a merfolk.",
			"",
			"Like merfolk, kigyos have a torso and arms, with an aquatic lower body that allows them to maneuver lithely through the water. Unlike a merfolk, however, a kigyo has a monstrous face and its body more closely resembles that of a seahorse.",
			"",
			"A typical kigyo is 7 feet long from its head to the tip of its curved tail and weighs 190 pounds.",
			"",
			"As with many types of oni, kigyos are hateful, vengeful creatures that prey upon mortals not out of necessity but out of spite and malice. Kigyos enjoy seeing their victims drown, and they are said to be drawn to the sites of shipwrecks or tragic deaths at sea where mortals met their end in the unforgiving ocean. While this may not be true, plenty of kigyos have been the cause of such deaths, either in combat or by manipulating their victims into dangerous situations from which they could not escape. Kigyos have the ability to create powerful underwater currents that swirl in tight eddies, latching on to multiple creatures and holding them in place until they either drown or fall victim to the oni's other attacks.",
			"",
			"In the same way that a kigyo draws a sense of accomplishment from drowning a victim, it also feels a sense of superiority at making an enemy willingly give up something of incredible value in exchange for its life or that of a loved one. To oni, life and mortality are foreign concepts, and they can derive only so much pleasure out of seeing a living creature's essence snuffed out by death. As jealous and possessive beings, however, kigyos can more easily comprehend the sacrifice of giving up something other than one's life. Many kigyos develop obsessions with a single type of ransom they demand, such as firstborn children, spouses, a victim's reproductive or sensory organs or lungs, or even (in rare cases) pure material wealth. Those who hunt kigyos or research kigyo activity across the world can sometimes follow a single oni from nation to nation and from ocean to ocean by the specifics of what it demands of its victims. Thus have specific kigyos developed almost mythic status while victims across both distance and time suffer the same sadistic fate at the oni's hands.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Oni(monster/family:oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kigyos rarely congregate with others of their kind, preferring instead solitary lives in the forms of aquatic elves, gillman, locathahs, merfolk, or other aquatic or shore-dwelling humanoids. In these forms, kigyos attempt to seduce unsuspecting mortals, and trick them into bringing the oni-who usually pretend to be castaways or injured victims-onto their vessels or into their seaside communities. Once in these societies, kigyos bed unsuspecting mortals who take pity on them and then abscond with items of value while their partners are sleeping. After amassing particularly valuable or numerous prizes, a kigyo reveals itself to its victims and demands a ransom of something far more precious for the items' return.",
			"",
			"Like all oni, kigyos are filled with hatred, especially for their uncorrupted kami counterparts. Kigyos see [suijins](unknown/suijins) in particular as contemptible, and they are known to form elaborate hunting parties to seek out the benevolent nature spirits and destroy them and the untainted waters they protect. These raiding bands constitute the few large groups of kigyos on Golarion, and they can present deadly threats to those who encounter them, be they kami or other creatures. The oni fight tactically in tandem, half of the kigyos using their grasping eddy abilities to hold their foes in place while the other half surround and stab at them with their tridents. Even when encountered alone, a kigyo presents a formidable challenge to even the most adept underwater fighters, as it can hold an entire party in one of its powerful whirlpools, reducing its foes' ability to conduct their own group fighting tactics."

			"While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and thus often end up having associations with giants and other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni who clothe themselves in human flesh. While their true forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin, claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns, kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans. As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind, and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves' guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of command, but avoid positions so important that they have too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste, and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa increases its opportunities for such abuse.",
			"",
			"Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure, and like any oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, like-minded humans to lead in banditry and worse.",

The target must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be affected by this effect. In addition to being subject to suggestion's normal effects, any creature affected by the contagious whisper can pass the enchantment on to other targets. Doing so requires the target to communicate the nogitsune's suggestion, forcing the new target to save as if it were the initial target. If such a secondary target resists the contagious whisper, it is unaffected, but this does not remove the suggestion from the initial target. Failing the save puts another creature under the nogitsune's compulsion. Newly affected creatures are also able to spread the suggestion. A nogitsune's compelling whisper can affect a number of creatures equal to the its Hit Dice and lasts for a number of hours equal to its Hit Dice. Creatures that successfully save versus the nogitsune's compelling whisper (as a primary or secondary target) cannot be affected by that particular nogitsune's compelling whisper for 24 hours.

			"Nogitsune are always female, and resemble shapely humans with a covering of fur and a fox's head. A nogitsune's fur color varies and can be orange and white, grey, pure white, or even black. Whenever nogitsune use their shapechanging abilities to assume a humanoid form, they still evince somewhat pointed, vulpine features. In addition, any hair on their assumed form betrays the natural coloration of their pelts. Nogitsune stand between 5 and 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Oni manifest themselves in different ways based on the creatures they take as vessels for their depraved wrath. They take particular joy in corrupting kitsune to form nogitsune, delighting in turning the mystical creatures into deadly killers and spreaders of woe. Most nogitsune become spies or assassins. Though they need no real reason to kill others, the coin they receive for their services allows them to afford the other vices they enjoy, such as pleasures of the flesh and excesses of drink and narcotics (when available). Nogitsune are deft killers because of their speed, grace, and spell-like abilities. Those who have seen them and lived tell tales of these oni running toward walls at blinding speed and then simply continuing upward to vault the wall's crown as if it were no more difficult to walk on than the ground. Still others claim that nogitsune can dive into a shadow like a pool of water and disappear, while others mention the cloud of smoke that nogitsune often use to escape pursuit, even when running full speed.",
			"",
			"Although they often don human form to disguise themselves for the purpose of infiltration, nogitsune prefer to stalk and kill prey in their natural form. This gives the creatures the choice of whether to use manufactured weapons or their own sharp claws and deadly bite. When wielding weapons, all nogitsune enjoy using poison, whenever possible employing toxins and venoms that do not kill outright (unless a contract so requires it) but rather render the victims unconscious or helpless. This gives the oni the joy of dealing the killing blow with their jaws and slaking their bloodlust in abject savagery.",
			"",
			"A nogitsune's most feared weapon, however, is its contagious whisper. This powerful compulsion, often whispered into the victim's ear in honeyed tones, not only forces the targeted creature to believe whatever lie the nogitsune crafts, but also infects the subject of the contagious whisper with a corruptive echo of deceit that causes the victim to unknowingly pass on the nogitsune's suggestion to others. Nogitsune may use this ability to convince a successive series of servants to open all of the doors to a well-guarded castle, or to make a host of witnesses believe they saw an innocent man commit a brutal crime that was really the oni's own handiwork.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Oni(monster/family:oni)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Nogitsune inhabit large urban areas, where they can have their pick of a nearly endless stream of victims. Occasionally they will inhabit a town or village in the countryside, but such locales are always in the shadow of a large castle or estate that can provide additional opportunities to stalk and murder others. Wherever they choose to dwell, nogitsune lair in the seediest districts, where drugs, brothels, and crime are rampant. These areas not only discourage chase by would-be pursuers, but also place the oni in the midst of people who society generally doesn't miss if and when a contract doesn't slake the creature's bloodlust.",
			"",
			"Those looking to hire a nogitsune can do so, but such a practice is both costly and dangerous. Although little binds a nogitsune to its accepted contract when it receives payment, most nogitsune happily carry out their orders for the sheer joy of bringing death to another. But many who foolishly hire nogitsune to do their killing find themselves the next victim once the initial target is slain. Nogitsune have little honor, and such treachery not only feeds their bloodlust, but also leaves fewer witnesses.",
			"",
			"Nogitsune prefer to lead solitary lives and be in command of their own foul fates. Thus, most avoid associating with more powerful creatures, other oni, or even other nogitsune. Those honorable samurai and good ninja who have fought and killed nogitsune recount seeing a conflicted and turbulent anger within the creatures, as if the once-righteous kitsune within a nogitsune constantly battles to reassert control. Although there is no record of such a reversal occurring, many believe that these malevolent oni drown themselves in death and bloodshed in order to extinguish the last vestiges of the creatures they were before."

It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal and can still use its spell-like and special abilities.",
			"",
			"**Void Missile (Su)** As a swift action, a void yai can launch a bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment.",
			"",
			"**Void Trap (Su)** When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spell-like abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of \"void\" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race.",
			"",
			"Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes.",
			"",
			"### Voidlords",
			"",
			"Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling category of unique void yai. But to even use the term \"middling\" in this context is something of a folly, for these unique void yai, known collectively as the voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures to walk the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"While void yai typically content themselves with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a greater mission-to control entire worlds and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible.",
			"",
			"Martial Arts: A voidlord of martial arts always attacks with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk with the flurry of blows ability for the purposes of determining its damage and number of attacks per round with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following spell-like abilities three times per day: forceful hand, grasping hand, and greater shout.",
			"",
			"Swordplay: A voidlord of sword fighting always carries a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities three times per day: blade barrier, keen edge, and mage's sword. They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and any sword they wield is treated as a +5 weapon, in addition to any other magical qualities the weapon might have. A voidlord of swordplay can also permanently transform any magic weapon (save for artifacts) into a sword of any size or type by touch.",

When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai's caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the result of this check is hurled 1d6 &times; 10 feet straight up, and lands prone in a spot 1d4 &times; 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle.",

This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8 points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature.",
			"",
			"Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes.",
			"",
			"A wind yai is 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"A wind yai does not appear to walk upon the ground so much as glide across it-but even then, its exaggerated movements and overbearing demeanor make every footstep a thunderous stomp. An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural acts of destruction.",
			"",
			"Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring them crashing back to the earth.",
			"",

			"Cloud giants possess one other thing wind yai yearn to claim mastery over-their instruments. But rather than use such delicate tools to create melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate, they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare, magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies.",
			"",
			"Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the more satisfying."

When it does so, the creature bitten must make a DC 16 Will save or lose the ability to speak aloud. This prevents the use of any spell with verbal components and the use of command-word- activated magic items, among other difficulties. The yamabushi tengu's voice changes to match the one stolen. The victim's voice remains stolen until the oni steals another voice, until the oni agrees to give the stolen voice back (a standard action requiring the oni to touch the victim), or until the next sunrise. Any effect that removes curses (such as remove curse or break enchantment) can restore a stolen voice (DC for success equals the save DC of the steal voice ability-DC 16 for most yamabushi tengu), as does the death of the oni who stole the voice in the first place. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Yamabushi tengus are oni with a predilection toward thievery and trickery, wearing the flesh of wicked, fiendish tengus. When a yamabushi tengu first appears, its first course of action is invariably to seek out a well-hidden nest or other nook to serve as a lair. Despite their ability to fly, most yamabushi tengus are nervous in open areas, since it's easy to be seen in such environs. A yamabushi tengu is more at home indoors or at night, where it can skulk in the shadows when it's unsure of its surroundings.",

			"",
			"While most yamabushi tengus look like normal tengus, they can actually manifest in a number of humanoid bird shapes. Ravens and crows are the most common model which these creatures take their appearance from, yet tales exist of yamabushi tengus with features more akin to cranes, eagles, peacocks, gulls, vultures, and even pelicans. Only the features of ducks and other billed avians (like geese) are notably absent from yamabushi tengus. In fact, yamabushi tengus have a strange loathing for ducks-they find these birds to be a mix of comic tragedy and pitiful hideousness, from the blunt shape of their bills to their distinctive gait and their warbling quacks. The presence of a duck can often provoke even the most restrained and crafty yamabushi tengu into making poor choices: faced with choosing between attacking a truly dangerous foe or using their weapons and magic against a nearby duck, most yamabushi tengus make the choice to kill the duck, even if such an act might compromise their position to their actual enemy.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Yamabushi tengus are driven by greed, particularly for shiny treasures like coins, jewels, gems, and polished weapons. Many extend this obsession to clothing (favoring brightly colored silks) and armor (preferring light armor over medium or heavy armor). Most of what a yamabushi tengu plots or plans can be traced to a desire to gather as much shiny treasure as possible, but they are also especially entranced and intrigued by avian humanoids-particularly tengus, dire corbies (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Misfit Monsters Redeemed) and garudas (see Pathfinder Module: Cult of the Ebon Destroyers). Yamabushi tengus share the most in common with tengus, of course, for it is from these creatures that the oni take their forms. Dire corbies and garudas, being non-humanoid monsters (monstrous humanoids and outsiders respectively) are in strange ways both similar and quite different from tengus, and as such yamabushi tengus find them endlessly fascinating. In the case of dire corbies, the creatures' feral natures, xenophobic personalities, and overall lack of civilization make them ideal groups for a yamabushi tengu to infiltrate and take control of-although in most cases, a yamabushi tengu who infiltrates a dire corby flock eventually grows tired of the crude creatures and moves on. Garudas are more difficult for yamabushi tengus to interact with, for these outsiders are generally good. Encounters between garudas and yamabushi tengus almost always end in combat, typically with the more powerful garuda the victor. As a result, when confronted by a garuda, most yamabushi tengus choose subtlety over direct confrontation. In a best-case scenario, a yamabushi tengu's minions or allies capture and restrain the garuda, giving the yamabushi tengu ample opportunity to interrogate or even vivisect the garuda prisoner.",
			"",
			"Most yamabushi tengus, though, find greatest comfort dwelling among thieves' guilds-particularly among those populated by tengus, in which case a yamabushi tengu appears in its natural form, using its wings as an obvious badge of superiority over its flightless tengu kin. Among thieves of other races (such as humans), a yamabushi tengu prefers to stay in its humanoid form. However, when a yamabushi tengu assumes the form of anything other than a tengu, its true nature is difficult for it to hide, for invariably the shapechanged oni's nose remains quite prodigious, usually to an almost comical degree. Strangely enough, however, yamabushi tengus generally don't think of their unusual noses as flaws in their magical disguises. A yamabushi tengu can also retain its wings when using its change shape ability, and these pinions, as well as its beaklike nose, are a sure way to tell a disguised yamabushi tengu apart from others."

Onwu azus return to the river where they were born to reproduce, and die shortly afterward.",
			"",
			"Onwu azus use their glide ability to hunt prey, and although they are capable of subsisting on smaller fish and other marine animals, they prefer the blood and meat of land-dwelling creatures. After spotting a target, schools of onwu azus soar over the waves at great speeds, hurling themselves at their preferred food sources and biting with their incredibly sharp teeth, employing a suction grip that is difficult to break. Once attached, the onwu azus continue biting until their prey is killed. Their bites cause continuous bleeding, and most of their victims die from shock and blood loss long before the onwu azus reach vital organs. These fish can survive for up to 5 minutes out of the water, and if they succeed at killing their prey on land, they briefly feed before flopping back into the water to look for their next meal.",
			"",
			"More than one pirate has been knocked from his ship by a surprise onwu azu attack. Rather than just leaping to take a bite of air-breathing prey, the fish will often bull rush prey on either a coast or ship's deck, intending to knock it into the waiting mouths of the school below. Shallow inlets and river mouths in the paths of spawning onwu azus are often littered with the remains sailors and explorers who ran afoul of these deadly fish. Adventurers who find treasure in such areas would do well to wonder what killed any corpses lying beside loot and take appropriate precautions.",
			"",
			"Onwu azus grow to over 4 feet in length with fin-spans of over 6 feet, and can weigh close to 90 pounds. Their skin is generally dark blue or brown, and their pectoral fins are a scintillating red that shimmers in the sun with a kaleidoscope of colors."

			"Mischievous menaces of the streets, onyvolans are gangly, humanlike creatures with grotesquely long limbs that end in peculiar keratinous wheels, which the creatures use to roll along at high speeds. Onyvolans enjoy creating mayhem by roaming around in gangs and terrorizing a city's residents, especially in older, rundown districts. Pure troublemakers at heart, onyvolans prefer mischief to actual violence, and they show their cowardly side whenever their quarry stands up to them. They trawl dump sites and trash piles in search of food and clothing, which is their primary means of obtaining both; however, they occasionally attack victims who seem to be carrying-or wearing-items of particular interest. Onyvolans love garish clothing that most people wouldn't wear, and they especially adore ostentatious hats.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans' arms are roughly the same length as their legs, allowing the creatures to reach the ground easily with their front wheels and roll on all fours, which is their natural stance. Onyvolans are eerily pale-skinned, and their mouths are nearly always twisted into a disturbing grin that reveals their pointed teeth; they find that their frightful countenances aid in putting their targets on edge.",
			"",
			"A typical onyvolan is about 7 feet tall from head to back wheel when upright and weighs about 170 pounds.",
			"",
			"The most curious aspect of onyvolan physiology is the strange wheels the creatures have where one would expect hands and feet. These wheels are made of a hard, keratin-like substance, and they are connected to the onyvolans' arms and legs with an axle and fork composed of the same material. This substance makes the wheels extremely durable, and they typically withstand the onyvolan's rolling locomotion with surprisingly minimal wear and tear; most onyvolans' wheels remain in good shape for the creatures' entire lifespans. The hardness of the wheels also makes them useful as bludgeoning weapons in combat. An onyvolan usually rolls on all fours, but it occasionally uses just its back wheels when it needs its arms for other tasks. The wheels spin surprisingly smoothly, allowing for the onyvolan to move at high speeds on packed dirt and even well-cobbled streets without producing much noise.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans typically wear garish, multicolored clothing, which the creatures tend to favor over all other garments. Due to their lack of hands, these creatures find it nearly impossible to create clothing for themselves; they scavenge what they can after it has been discarded by those with more conventional fashion sense. Since most humanoid apparel was not designed for such long-limbed wearers, clothing the onyvolans wear tend to be ill-fitting at best. The creatures do not seem to mind for the most part, and they wear their strange outfits with a misguided sense of pride. Onyvolans are particularly fond of hats, and gangs of the creatures are more often than not found wearing an eclectic set of headwear.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Onyvolans are nearly always found in cities, most often lairing in back alleys and sewers. The creatures establish bases that they consider permanent homes, which they use mainly for storing their scavenged spoils. Onyvolans spend little time in their home bases, however, as they are usually out and about either scavenging for clothing and food or otherwise causing trouble, returning home only when they have found sufficient supplies. Onyvolans are most commonly found in large metropolises-notably Oppara and Cassomir in Taldor, as well as in Absalom- but they have been seen in smaller settlements, especially those with an outsize number of clothiers and tailors.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans rarely venture far from cities, as their wheels tend to get stuck in mud and undergrowth. However, rumors suggest that lone onyvolans may tough out treks into the wilderness to hide particularly desirable treasures from others of their kind. These would be exceptionally strong and resourceful members of their species, as navigating forests or swamps is nigh impossible for ordinary onyvolans.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans traditionally form gangs that live and scavenge together. These gangs typically operate relatively close to the creatures' home base, and they send out individual scouts that venture to farther reaches of their city in search of new sources of clothing and food. The leader of an onyvolan gang almost always has the most stylish clothing of the lot, at least in the eyes of its peers, as they consider it an indication of exceptionally resourceful scavenging. When there isn't enough loot to go around-either because the gang has become too large or because of unsuccessful scavenging-unrest begins to stir. This often opens up opportunities for onyvolans to split off from the group to form a new gang, recruiting others to their side by filling potential recruits' heads with promises of fancy clothes and bountiful vittles.",
			"",
			"Onyvolan gangs get in minor scuffles over clothing finds, food sources, and scavenging areas. The gangs' leaders are nearly always former members of other gangs, and because there is inevitably bad blood between the old and new groups, onyvolan gangs rarely coexist in complete peace. Nonetheless, fights between such groups rarely escalate to any substantial level of violence; instead, two quarreling clans scream and yell as the groups circle one another-much to the dismay of any residents of nearby buildings-until the onyvolans get bored or distracted and roll away in opposite directions.",
			"",
			"Onyvolans tend to rove back alleys and darkened streets for fun, where they can terrorize those unfortunate individuals who find themselves trapped in a corner with no help in sight. The bullies find particular joy in scaring pedestrians with their creepy cackles and eerie grins, knocking victims to the ground and rolling in circles around them while taunting them with grating voices. Although they are rather fearsome in appearance and their behavior is off-putting, onyvolans are more often than not looking to scare people for the fun of it rather than to inflict any actual major physical harm, although if an onyvolan gang spots someone vulnerable-looking wearing colorful clothing or a fancy hat (or transporting a large quantity of food), they may end up resorting to violence to claim such a prize. A target of an onyvolan attack can sometimes get out of trouble simply by standing up to the creatures and attempting to intimidate them, as the creatures are prone to cowardice. However, if a target has something the onyvolans strongly desire and doesn't prove overly threatening, the wheeled creatures gleefully attempt to bowl him over and take what they want."

			"**Channel Negative Energy (Su)** As a standard action, an onyx scourge can channel negative energy in a 30-foot burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Entropic Strikes (Ex)** An onyx scourge's slam attack deals an additional 3d6 points of negative energy damage. When used against an object, its slam attack ignores the first 5 points of hardness.",
			"",
			"**Negative Energy Capacitance (Su)** An onyx scourge's body stores negative energy, making it immune to death effects, energy drain, and negative energy. Additionally, if an onyx scourge is targeted by a negative energy attack, the next time it channels negative energy within 1 minute, it deals 50% more damage, as though this were an empowered spell.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Onyx scourges are vicious brutes from the Plane of Earth that revel in their deadly power. They resemble elder earth elementals with striations of red and black onyx. Negative energy pulses and flows through the streaks of onyx like blood through exposed veins. The hollows and depressions that serve as an onyx scourge's eyes and mouth are deep voids warped into expressions of rage and hatred.",
			"",
			"Negative energy flows through each strike an onyx scourge makes, disrupting living and unliving matter alike. Onyx scourges can also unleash this energy in a devastating blast, which they enjoy using to inflict damage on multiple opponents at once. They gleefully wade into battle whenever given the opportunity.",
			"",
			"An onyx scourge is 40 feet tall and weighs 70,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The endless tunnels on the Plane of Earth are home to wondrous creatures. Elementals dwelling there are formed from the plane's very substance, displaying limitless variations in combinations of different ores, minerals, and materials. In most cases, elementals gain no special benefit from their constituent minerals other than distinctive coloration. In rare situations, however, an elemental encounters a phenomenon that interacts with its physical makeup in strange and terrible ways. Legends circulated among the shaitan posit that one such occurrence gave rise to the first onyx scourges.",
			"",
			"Shaitan tales say that, in the distant past, the elder earth elemental Ozusteg discovered a strange anomaly: a sphere of black onyx the size of a small mountain exuding wisps of chill, dark power. Curious about the object's nature, Ozusteg entered the sphere to explore its interior, but discovered too late that the onyx sphere surrounded a breach between the Plane of Earth and the Negative Energy Plane.",
			"",
			"Planar scholars theorize that the onyx sphere formed around the breach as a defense mechanism, to contain the destructive power of the Negative Energy Plane. Ozusteg should have been annihilated by its exposure to the negative energy of the breach, but its body absorbed the onyx to likewise contain the negative energy. The elemental survived the ordeal but emerged from the sphere radically changed-a twisted elemental creature infused with the essence of entropy and filled with the desire to destroy.",
			"",
			"Ozusteg gathered other elementals through coercion, trickery, or promises of power, and then forced them to enter the onyx sphere just as it had done. Only the most powerful elementals survived, similarly transformed into creatures like Ozusteg. Infused with destructive energy and feeling no loyalty to each other nor to Ozusteg, these creatures spread ruin across the Plane of Earth and eventually into other planes. They came to be called onyx scourges, after the pulsing energy in their onyx striations and the devastation they leave in their wake.",
			"",
			"No shaitan claims to know how many onyx scourges exist, or if they were all created by Ozusteg. Explorers have never found Ozusteg's planar breach on the Plane of Earth or even definitive proof that Ozusteg existed at all. It is possible that more than one breach exists, each with the ability to create onyx scourges from elementals that venture too close yet are powerful enough to survive the exposure.",
			"",
			"Tracing the origin of onyx scourges is difficult for several reasons. First, onyx scourges are truculent, prone to answering questions with lies if they deign to answer them at all. Second, the creatures are by nature powerful and incredibly destructive; they generally attack any creatures in their path and are disinclined to leave survivors. Finally, the creatures constantly wander until they find a territory to call their own and so are likely encountered far from whatever their point of origin might have been.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Onyx scourges are most often found on the Plane of Earth. They are generally solitary creatures that lay claim to a certain region of the plane- usually several miles wide-and viciously attack elementals and other denizens of that region. After dwelling in one area for a time, a scourge moves to a new area and wages war on whatever creatures happen to reside in its new chosen territory. If a scourge's domain encompasses a major trade route on the Plane of Earth, shaitan merchants soon dispatch agents to destroy or relocate the creature.",
			"",
			"Although some scholars dispute the details of the story of Ozusteg, others believe there is a grain of truth within the tale and seek the fabled onyx sphere. Necromancers desire the negatively charged onyx to enhance their vile experiments or to create powerful new undead monsters and constructs. Forbidden tomes theorize that the black onyx can be used to unlock greater powers from the legendary Shadowstaff and other necromantic artifacts. The promise of such power has led many wizards to spend their fortunes and their lives to find Ozusteg's domain.",
			"",
			"Onyx scourges on the Plane of Earth make terrifying predators. Although their primary motive is to wage war against all creatures in the territories they have claimed as their own, onyx scourges sometimes venture into other earth elementals' territories to capture prey, which is very rarely seen again. Ayrzul, the Fossilized King of the Plane of Earth, is mostly indifferent to his elemental subjects but appreciates the destructive power of the onyx scourges and plots ways to use them as weapons against his rival, Ymeri, and her minions on the Plane of Fire. However, Ayrzul hasn't yet figured out how to compel the cruel and chaotic creatures to help him in any significant way.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, onyx scourges present an even greater danger to mortals. Their destructive power is compounded by their ability to bolster nearby undead, creating devastating juggernauts that would be prized weapons in a necromancer's army. Onyx scourges can heal undead forces while annihilating living troops and their defensive fortifications. Thankfully, only the most powerful spellcasters can bring an onyx scourge through a gate, and the creatures are too strong to be magically controlled by normal means. That doesn't stop ambitious spellcasters from making the attempt, and the cleverest of them might even use the onyx scourges' love of destruction to convince one to join a campaign."

Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related.",
			"",
			"Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses.",
			"",
			"Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults, weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas."

As a culture, orcs are violent and aggressive, with the strongest ruling the rest through fear and brutality. They take what they want by force, and think nothing of slaughtering or enslaving entire villages when they can get away with it. They have little time for niceties or details, and their camps and villages tend to be filthy, ramshackle affairs filled with drunken brawls, pit fights, and other sadistic entertainment. Lacking the patience for farming and only able to shepherd the most robust and self-sufficient animals, orcs almost always find it easier to take what someone else has built than to create things themselves. They are arrogant and quick to anger when challenged, but only worry about honor so far as it directly benefits them to do so.",
			"",
			"An adult male orc is roughly 6 feet tall and 210 pounds. Orcs and humans interbreed frequently, though this is almost always the result of raids and slave-taking rather than consensual unions. Many orc tribes purposefully breed for half-orcs and raise them as their own, as the smarter progeny make excellent strategists and leaders for their tribes."

Orphne are immeasurably cruel, and without oversight, their lives gravitate towards hurting others for their own amusement, pulling the wings off songbirds or scarring mortal captives in artistic ways. They delight in watching creatures that were once full of life decay into shells of corruption or undeath."

			"**Bone Chariot (Su)** An ostovite presented with a corpse that in life had 2 Hit Dice or fewer (not counting Hit Dice from class levels) and that contains a skeletal structure can spend 1 hour extracting the bones and then softening and reweaving them around itself, creating a deformed and skeletal version of the original creature. This \"bone chariot\" functions as if the corpse had reanimated and gained the skeleton template, but gains the construct type instead of the undead type and has no will of its own-it moves and attacks at the direction of the ostovite, which rides in its center. An ostovite cannot use its own attacks while ensconced in its bone chariot, and damage done to a bone chariot does not harm the ostovite until the bone chariot has been reduced to 0 hit points, at which point the skeleton crumbles and the ostovite can attack and be attacked as normal. Multiple ostovites can combine their abilities to animate the skeletons of larger creatures, so long as they all ride within the same bone chariot-each additional ostovite increases the maximum Hit Dice of the corpse that can be animated by this ability by 2.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Tiny Abyssal scavengers, ostovites skitter across demonic battlefields, amid charnel pits, and through that plane's festering sewers looking for corpses on which to feed. When they find these morsels, they use their acidic saliva to digest the flesh, taking what they need for sustenance. Yet what ostovites truly desire is not food, but self-improvement.",
			"",
			"Though only barely intelligent, ostovites have a deepseated jealousy of larger races, as well as an instinctive shame regarding their own forms, which resemble silverfish made out of thin, compressed bones. When an ostovite locates the corpse of a larger creature- particularly that of a humanoid or other intelligent being-it doesn't stop at feeding. Instead, as soon as it has sated its hunger, it begins using its acid to soften the creature's bones, drawing them out and reconstructing them into a twisted parody of their original configuration, with the ostovite resting in a nest-like structure in the sculpture's center. Once it's finished, the ostovite magically animates its creation, controlling it like a puppet and at last experiencing the thrill of being larger and-to the ostovite's mind-more important. These ghastly creations are generally more disturbing than normal undead, as ostovites' understanding of biomechanics is often crude, potentially resulting in humanoid skeletons that move around on all fours or drag themselves along like landbound octopuses. Like hermit crabs changing shells, ostovites regularly replace their chariots in order to increase their social status and impress potential mates. Though they often squabble over smaller skeletons, when a particularly prime corpse is located, an entire nest of ostovites may band together to create a single bone chariot of epic proportions.",
			"",
			"Adult ostovites are 2 feet long and weigh 3 pounds. Natural cowards except when enshrined in their chariots-at which point most believe themselves invincible- ostovites have a species-wide hatred of the more powerful vermlek demons, with whom they often compete for quality corpses."

They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking effluvia.",

In fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste. Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care."

			"**Body of Serpents (Su)** An ouroboros is simultaneously one enormous serpent and a collection of smaller, entwined serpents. These smaller serpents can split from the whole and lash out at the ouroboros's enemies. An ouroboros can make up to 8 bite attacks each round. As the ouroboros is uniformly composed of serpents, it can even target creatures it has swallowed whole with these bite attacks, the serpents lining its stomach lashing out at the swallowed creature.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Coils (Su)** The mere sight of an ouroboros overwhelms the minds of lesser creatures. Any creature within 100 feet that can see an ouroboros must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds, watching its endless consumption and churning coils. Any creature that begins its turn paralyzed by this ability must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or take 1d8 points of Wisdom damage as it slowly loses its grip on reality. Every time a creature takes Wisdom damage from this ability, it can immediately attempt a new DC 27 Will save; on a success, the paralysis effect from the hypnotic coils ends. Once a creature recovers from the hypnotic coils' paralysis effect, it is immune to further paralysis from that particular ouroboros's coils for 24 hours. This is a vision-based mind-affecting effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Maw (Ex)** An ouroboros gains a powerful bite attack while not engaged in self-consumption. This is a primary attack that always applies 1-1/2 times the ouroboros's Strength modifier to the damage roll. When it bites with its maw, its regular bite attacks become secondary attacks.",
			"",
			"**Perpetual Renewal (Su)** An ouroboros continually consumes and regrows itself. The duration of any spell or effect that causes an ouroboros to be dazed, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, or stunned can never have a duration of longer than 1 round. Any ability damage or drain an ouroboros receives is automatically healed at a rate of 1d4 points per round per ability. Perpetual renewal functions only while the ouroboros consumes itself.",
			"",
			"**Ruinous Blood (Su)** The blood that sprays from the ragged stump of an ouroboros's tail is so potent with positive energy that it warps the flesh of those exposed to it, transforming them into fractured pieces of the ouroboros itself. Once every 1d4 rounds as a move action, an ouroboros can spray a 60-foot line of blood from the stump of its tail. Creatures caught in this area must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be permanently transformed into a venomous snake swarm that retains no memories of its previous life, as per baleful polymorph when the target fails its Will save to resist the spell's secondary effect. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Self-Consumption (Su)** An ouroboros continuously eats its own tail. So long as the ouroboros continues its self-consumption, its regeneration cannot be suppressed by any form of attack and it benefits from the effects of perpetual renewal, but it cannot use its maw attack or its ruinous blood ability. Any effect that would kill the ouroboros outright merely halves the ouroboros's remaining hit points. Once an ouroboros's hit points are reduced to less than half its normal maximum (198 hit points for a typical ouroboros), the monster ceases its self-consumption, loses its perpetual renewal ability, and gains its maw and ruinous blood abilities. All its movement speeds are doubled when the ouroboros is in this state, but its regeneration can now be suppressed via damage caused by mythic weapons or spells. An ouroboros can resume self-consumption as a standard action as long as it has more than half its hit points. An ouroboros need not eat or drink to survive-its own body is all the sustenance it needs.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The ouroboros-the serpent that eternally consumes itself- occupies a place in the mythology of many civilizations, yet few suspect that these legends are inspired by a real and terrifying race of creatures. Living ouroboroses dwell on the Astral Plane, where they are content to drift aimlessly through the silvery void.",
			"",
			"Ouroboroses are capable of tremendous devastation, yet they have little reason to seek out such violence. They are each a world unto themselves, autonomous and reliant on no other creature for their sustenance or livelihood. An ouroboros can exist forever, constantly eating itself and replenishing its body with its own infinity. Barely sentient, an ouroboros has a powerful, almost pathological will to survive, which drives it to destroy any and all creatures that pose even the slightest threat to its well-being. This propensity to attack without clear provocation or warning has given ouroboroses a reputation for being engines of mindless destruction.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros might appear to be a single creature, but closer inspection reveals the truth: its body is formed from a myriad of smaller entwined serpents, which are not independent creatures and become lifeless once separated from the main body. Those who have examined serpents detached from an ouroboros report that these creatures too are formed from smaller serpents that, when inspected under magnification, prove to be composed of tinier serpents still.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which has many miraculous properties. Many have tried to harness the healing powers of the ouroboros's blood to restore life to the dead or regenerate grievous wounds. While such treatments can be successful, given the application of the correct but obscure occult rituals, ouroboros blood is uniquely suited to the generation of ouroboros flesh and no other. Patients treated in this way typically suffer the fate of those exposed directly to the ouroboros's blood and transform into serpents.",
			"",
			"While ouroboroses seem mindless, they have crude intellects and can understand speech. Yet whatever motives the ouroboroses have for hiding away on the Material Plane are unclear. Most find their way to this reality by accident, tumbling through rents in reality from the Astral Plane or perhaps conjured here by powerful magic wielded by mad spellcasters eager to unleash devastation upon the world.",
			"",
			"An ouroboros is usually coiled into a circle roughly 50 feet in diameter. It weighs 260 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ouroboros Blood Ritual",
			"",
			"The most common ritual that utilizes ouroboros blood is detailed [here](unknown/here); full rules for rituals are [here](unknown/here)."

Lurking nearby, the shadowy creature listens in on nearby thoughts, always searching for a collection of fears and worries it can capitalize on for its own machinations. It may serve as an intermediary between doppelgangers on the surface world and dark folk in subterranean lands.

			"Few remember that the Shadow Plane once had its own demigods, akin to the Eldest of the First World. Called the Forsaken, these mysterious, evil entities had a direct hand in shaping the caligni race but then vanished for unknown reasons.

Known as owb prophets, these god-touched beings grant spells to faithful worshippers on behalf of their Forsaken patrons. Unfortunately for the Forsaken, owb prophets don't pass along this divine energy gladly, always seeking a way to hoard it for themselves. The most cunning owb prophets develop long-term plans to ascend to the status of demigod independently and join the ranks of the Forsaken. No owb prophet has yet acquired sufficient spiritual energy to make this leap, but the first to succeed would be more than a peer to the distant Forsaken-it would be the only active Forsaken in the multiverse.",

			"",
			"Eyes That Watch (NE Forsaken of feelings of inferiority, felines, and strangers): None can fully describe the Forsaken known as Eyes That Watch, as it appeared only as a trio of feline eyes staring from shadows with an arrogant gaze. Eyes That Watch's owb prophets gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet, can always act in the surprise round, and can use [burning gaze](spell/burning_gaze) at will as a spell-like ability.

			"Grasping Iovett (CE Forsaken of accidents, parasites, and reckless lust): Clad only in heavy black silks that shifted to reveal sensual forms of an indescribable variety, Grasping Iovett's touch left painful welts and tick infestations.

			"",
			"Husk (NE Forsaken of emptiness, loneliness, and narcissism): Husk was an attractive, androgynous humanoid whose joints were gaps that revealed the Forsaken to be entirely hollow beneath paper-thin skin. Husk's owb prophets are immune to bleed, disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison, and they can use [silence](spell/silence) at will as a spell-like ability.

			"The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear-perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite well-established in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator.",
			"",
			"Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed.",
			"",
			"Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs.",
			"",
			"Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets.",
			"",
			"While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult).",
			"",
			"A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds."

Once the item is embedded, its magic is channeled into the paguroida's body and the item no longer functions normally. It is not considered to be wielded or worn, and the item functions as though in an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field) while embedded in the paguroida's shell. A paguroida that has embedded magic items with a total caster level that is at least equal to its Hit Dice (11 for a typical paguroida) gains a +4 deflection bonus to its AC and a +2 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. A paguroida with embedded magic items whose total caster level is at least twice the creature's Hit Dice doubles these bonuses and gains the advanced creature simple template. A paguroida can remove an embedded magic item as a full-round action, adjusting the total caster level of its embedded items accordingly. The magic item can then be wielded or worn, but it still functions as if in an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field) for 1d4 minutes, after which time it returns to normal function.",
			"",
			"**Nondetection Aura (Su)** A paguroida emits an aura out to a radius of 30 feet that makes divination difficult. All creatures and objects within the aura are affected by a [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell that requires a successful DC 20 caster level check to overcome. Creatures or objects revealed to a spellcaster who succeeds at this caster level check remain detectable for 24 hours to that spellcaster, even if the creature or item exits and reenters the aura. A paguroida automatically succeeds at the caster level check to overcome this effect when using its constant [detect magic](spell/detect_magic) spell-like ability.",

(The statistics above assume that the paguroida has items with a total caster level equal to 11 embedded in its shell.) Removing or adding a magic item after the start of the day does not increase or reduce this number until the next time the paguroida regains PE.",
			"",
			"**Undersized Weapons (Ex)** Although a paguroida is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most paguroidas). Additionally, because it has only one hand-its other appendage is tipped with a massive pincer-a paguroida can wield only a shield or a light or one-handed weapon at a given time.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Believed to have been created by the [aboleths](monster/aboleth) in ages long past as part of the alghollthus' experiments on the [murajau](monster/murajau), paguroidas are reclusive, hermit crab-like monstrous humanoids who live in hidden grottoes and seaside estuaries, typically on isolated or remote coastlines. One of their upper limbs terminates in a humanoid hand, while the other ends in a large pincer capable of gripping and crushing prey. A paguroida's face is similar to that of a crab, with protruding eyestalks and a wide mandible-filled mouth, though its torso is distinctly humanoid in shape and size. A typical paguroida stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Paguroidas live solitary but long lives-their isolation and extreme paranoia about interaction with other species precludes many unnatural causes of death. In most cases, a paguroida eventually succumbs to old age after having lived for as many as a dozen centuries. Despite their longevity, paguroidas are not fecund, and they reproduce only once every 200-300 years after reaching reproductive maturity at the age of 150. Female paguroidas each lay a single egg in a secluded location, which they abandon among a small cache of magical items from their shells. Nearby male paguroidas locate the eggs by following the unique magical aura they exude, as well as the magical auras of the items in the eggs' cache-nests. Once fertilized, an egg ceases to emit such an aura, but the male that fertilized it remains nearby to protect it during the 6 months it gestates before hatching.",
			"",
			"Hatchlings are incredibly vulnerable, their shells taking as many as 5 years to harden. Paguroida fathers often give their offspring one or more magical items from their own shells, and they assist the offspring in embedding them and the items from their mothers' cache-nests into their soft shells to bolster their defenses in their first year.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Paguroidas live almost entirely alone, only rarely congregating in groups, generally for purposes of defense or to consolidate resources. Even then, these groups almost never exceed 10 members, as paguroidas have an innate understanding that the valuable items embedded in their shells would draw more treasure hunters to them, negating the advantages of greater numbers.",
			"",
			"Typically making their lairs near ancient ruins filled with long-abandoned magical relics, paguroidas prefer to dwell in underwater grottoes inaccessible from the surface. They protect these lairs with powerful illusions and abjurations, counting on remaining hidden to protect themselves and their treasures from potential thieves. A paguroida who encounters an intelligent interloper first attempts to trick the creature into leaving its territory, preferring to avoid conflict altogether. If discovered and unable to persuade the trespasser to leave, a paguroida may offer one of the magic items from its shell as a bribe to send the unwanted guest on its way. This is often a last resort, however, as most paguroidas know that once granted a single item of power, most creatures will seek more and respond with force if their demands are denied.",
			"",
			"Because of their mutual penchant for hoarding wealth, dragons are a paguroida's primary threat, and the crabfolk avoid even good and neutral dragons out of a strong sense of self-preservation. Only when offered substantial magical wealth as signs of good faith do paguroidas cooperate with dragons, and even then they do so warily."

When a pallid angel kills a creature using a manufactured melee weapon, she can splash its blood (or similar remains) on herself as a free action, even if it's not her turn. This grants her 8 temporary hit points and a +2 profane bonus to Strength. These benefits stack with themselves, to a maximum of 40 temporary hit points and a +10 bonus to Strength, and they last until 1 minute after the pallid angel last used this ability.",
			"",
			"**Hunger for Life and Death (Su)** A pallid angel is healed by both positive and negative energy. In addition, whenever a positive energy or negative energy effect would heal or harm one or more creatures within 30 feet, the pallid angel can consume the energy as an immediate action. The pallid angel regains a number of hit points equal to the greatest amount of healing or damage a targeted creature would receive, and no other creatures are affected by the effect. A pallid angel can consume energy this way three times per day.",
			"",
			"**Profane Ward (Su)** A pallid angel's spell resistance is increased by 5 against spells with the good descriptor and spells cast by worshippers of good-aligned deities.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Urgathoa is known best as a goddess of plague and undeath, yet the Pallid Princess has wider interests than the uninitiated might assume. Pallid angels, created by Urgathoa from the souls of her most dedicated champions and priestesses, represent these interests. Warriors and tacticians, wielders of profane magic and cruel weaponry, pallid angels are embodiments of the goddess's appetite for wanton bloodshed and forbidden pleasures.",
			"",
			"The average pallid angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds.",
			"",
			"Created by Urgathoa as mockeries of true angels, pallid angels strongly resemble the celestial beings for which they were named, and if cleansed of the stains of their hedonism they can often pass for such goodly creatures. Pallid angels particularly enjoy such deceptions, taking advantage of gullible mortals to revel in their adulation and spread the indulgent ways of the Pallid Princess. However, unlike true angels, pallid angels are universally female, with bodies resembling those they had or most desired in life.",
			"",
			"As outsiders, pallid angels have no need to eat or sleep; however, befitting their nature as favored servants of the goddess of indulgence, they seek out and revel in the pleasures of the flesh. Though any act of carnal pleasure is of interest to them, great feasts both mundane and cannibalistic, sexual excesses, and intoxicants of every variety are common pursuits for pallid angels. Most pallid angels also blend their hedonism with enjoyment of milder sensual delights such as massages, luxurious comforts and furnishings, and even long periods of indolent slumber, for less intense acts make the greater pleasures all the more ecstatic by comparison.",
			"",
			"In addition to their hedonistic urges, pallid angels' love of violence and bloodshed drives them to brutally abuse, and often eventually slay, any innocent unfortunate enough to fall into their grasp. Pallid angels take great pleasure in tormenting hostages and prisoners of war, and they occasionally spare unconscious foes for this purpose. A pallid angel denied such victims eventually sates her violent urges upon her companions and servants.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"If the daughters of Urgathoa are the goddess's most favored servants in life and unlife, pallid angels are her most favored in what comes after both. Pallid angels are created by Urgathoa from the souls of her greatest female worshippers, given bodies capable of enjoying all the pleasures of the flesh as reward for their service. In Urgathoa's domain on Abaddon, pallid angels spend much of their time indulging their desires, though most also serve as governors, arbiters, and vicious defenders against psychopomp raids.",
			"",
			"Pallid angels are often sent in response to planar ally spells or called by planar binding spells; a wise caller is ready to satisfy the angel's hedonism, such as by casting heroes' feast for the angel's exclusive benefit. Pallid angels are often conjured to serve as generals of great armies, particularly those heavy with undeath. Several pallid angels served the Whispering Tyrant as commanders in his initial conquest of Ustalav; at least one remains somewhere in the mountains of Virlych, magically entrapped by Arazni before her death at the Tyrant's hands.",
			"",
			"In addition to the angels' role as military leaders, small cults or lone priests might call upon a pallid angel to defend their sanctum from invaders or aid an assault against the forces of good, while hedonistic cults or worshippers occasionally conjure pallid angels simply to share in their pleasures. Urgathoa sometimes sends pallid angels to such pleasure cults unbidden, especially if such a cult has not yet descended fully into evil; the pallid angel serves as a guide to even more perverse indulgences and ensures the cult's corruption to Urgathoa's service.",
			"",
			"Pallid angels and daughters of Urgathoa both hold great authority and honor among the faithful of the Pallid Princess, and many of those who eventually became pallid angels were first elevated to be daughters of Urgathoa upon their mortal deaths. When brought together, pallid angels serve as a martial counterpart to the more ecclesiastical role played by daughters, much like the paladins and clerics of good faiths. In such cases, pallid angels and daughters cooperate in service to the goddess's will, though their relationship is often strained. Pallid angels often treat daughters with subtle pity and condescension for their reduced access to physical pleasures and their less direct relationship to Urgathoa, while daughters frequently hold angels in quiet contempt for their status as living-and thus less perfect-beings."

In part because of the low nutritional value of bamboo, pandas lack the energy for aggression, and avoid danger wherever possible."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The panotti are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for one startling difference: their enormous ears. A panotti's ears are attached to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang loosely, like an elephant's, but extend almost the length of their bodies. These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but appearances are deceiving. Panotti possess remarkably smooth muscle control along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control their ears at will.",
			"",
			"Even though panotti look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary. Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in panotti children.",
			"",
			"Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the company of their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally hearty and capable warriors.",
			"",
			"On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan."

			"A pavbagha is the reincarnated soul of an enlightened mortal worshiper of Irori transformed into the shape of a white tiger. Having lived one full mortal lifetime (if not more), it is patient, calm, and wise. It prefers to draw on its experience to guide and instruct mortals on ways to better themselves. Many enemies mistake a pavbagha's inner peace for weakness or pacifism, but the servitor was a warrior and a fierce predator in previous lives, and it quickly leaps into battle to defend its students or confront those who would dare destroy knowledge.",

Fulfilling the roles of guardians in the mortal world pleases pavbaghas, whether they're looking after a special person or watching over a sacred site. Although they don't need to eat, they enjoy the challenge and exercise of hunting and stalking prey. Rather than killing its catch, a pavbagha usually lays a single paw upon its target before allowing the creature to run away, secure in its triumph.",
			"",
			"Some pavbaghas serve in temples and monasteries dedicated to Irori, where they help in training students in physical combat, particularly in how to deal with monsters and other dangerous beasts. Others guide students in meditation, helping them unravel those quandaries they might have on the path to perfection. Still other pavbaghas that make their homes in monasteries on the Material Plane focus their efforts on attending to those who visit Iroran shrines and temples looking for divine assistance.",
			"",
			"A pavbagha measures about 10 to 12 feet long and weighs between 750 and 900 pounds."

When interlopers do find a pech's lair, they are met with open arms, friendly advice, and a firm insistence that the pech is to be left alone.",

			"The pegasus is a magnificent winged horse that sometimes serves the cause of good. Though highly prized as aerial steeds, pegasi are wild and shy creatures not easily befriended. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Most pegasi are white, though occasionally one is hatched with conventional horse colors and markings.",
			"",
			"The pegasus is, despite its appearance, as intelligent as a human. As such, those who try to train a pegasus to serve as a mount find the pegasus to be recalcitrant and even violent. A pegasus cannot speak, but it understands Common and greatly prefers the company of a good companion. The proper method to convince a pegasus to serve as a mount is to befriend it with diplomacy, favors, and good deeds. A pegasus is generally indifferent to a good-aligned creature, unfriendly to a neutral one, and hostile to an evil one-before a pegasus will serve as a mount, a pegasus must be made helpful via Diplomacy checks or other means. Riding a pegasus requires an exotic saddle or no saddle at all, as a regular saddle's straps interfere with the creature's wings. A pegasus can fight while carrying a rider, but the rider cannot also attack unless he or she succeeds on a Ride check. Trained pegasi are not afraid of combat, and the rider does not need to make a Ride check each round merely to control his mount.",
			"",
			"Pegasi lay eggs-they are worth 2,000 gp each on the open market, while young are worth 3,000 gp per head. However, as they are intelligent, good-aligned creatures, selling eggs and young is essentially slavery and is looked down on or outlawed in good societies.",
			"",
			"Pegasi mature at the same rate as horses. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a pegasus, which serves a good or neutral master with absolute faithfulness for life.",
			"",
			"A light load for a pegasus is up to 300 pounds; a medium load, 301-600 pounds; and a heavy load, 601-900 pounds.",
			"",
			"In some pegasi, the blood of a mighty heroic stallion ancestor runs strong. These champions have the lifespan of a human, the advanced template, perfect flight maneuverability, fire resistance 10, a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison, and an immunity to petrification attacks. Some are able to speak a few words in Common or Celestial. They are fully aware of their superiority over common horses and pegasi, and need no training to fly with a rider, but only allow themselves to be ridden by great heroes."

			"Perytons loathe all other creatures, even their own kind, and adult male perytons often attack one another on sight. However, strong females sometimes lead small family flocks composed of the alpha female, two or three weaker females, and up to six fledglings. The flock drives off males when they come of age, but females are allowed to join the pack when they mature, provided they swear allegiance to the alpha female. Unpaired males frequently attack such flocks in the hope of making off with a mate; failing that, they approach more peacefully, with offers of warm humanoid hearts (or even still-living victims) to attract females.",
			"",
			"Perytons mate once per year. The mating ritual is short, brutal, and in the end often fatal for the male. Afterward, the female lays a single, foot-tall black egg, which hatches 7 months later.",

			"",
			"Roosting on statuary and eaves, pest drakes are the bane of masons and carpenters across Golarion. By itself, a single pest drake is a tolerated nuisance, eating insects and other vermin in the city. Its distinctive song-like chirp greets passersby and thanks those who throw it scraps of food. When pest drakes gather, however, they become much more dangerous. The little wyvern-like dragons erode the stone where they nest and grow territorial in large groups, becoming deadly, acid-spitting flocks when agitated.",
			"",
			"Some of the smallest dragons, adult pest drakes are just under a foot in length and weigh 1-2 pounds. They live approximately 10-15 years.",
			"",
			"Centuries ago, a wizard who was jealous of his colleague's bond with a pseudodragon captured a clutch of pseudodragons, determined to create his own draconic familiar. He drained his family's fortune in countless experiments to create a less intelligent and more obedient dragon. His experiments routinely failed, with many of the resulting offspring unable to properly bond as familiars or so frail they died within days of hatching. Decades later, a young paladin of Apsu discovered the wizard's atrocities against dragonkind and confronted the wizard. The wizard's daughter, who had cared for the failed experiments all of her life, released them from their cages, attempting to spare them from her father's magic and the paladin's ire.",
			"",
			"Not long after the paladin left the wizard's mansion, the drakes returned to their pen. The daughter, intending to grant them freedom, released them further and further away from her home, only to discover them back in her courtyard each time she returned. Unable to \"free\" the drakes, she instead created a messenger service with them in an attempt to recover her family's fortune. Her plan did not work quite as intended. The drakes became a decades-long fashion fad that spread like wildfire across Golarion's nobility, especially after it was discovered that the creatures could be easily bred to exhibit a variety of colors, spikes, and frill styles. By the time the drakes fell out of fashion, they had become too embedded in their urban homes to ever be fully removed.",
			"",
			"Unlike their draconic cousins, pest drakes are highly fertile and mature quickly. Mated pairs lay clutches of two to three eggs each year in the spring and fall. The eggs incubate for 2 months, and a hatchling reaches physical and sexual maturity within 5 months. A mated pair of pest drakes remains together while incubating eggs and raising the hatchlings, but they often find new mates within the flock after those young mature. Each adult in the flock takes at least some role in a hatchling's growth, often teaching it which places to frequent for food and which to avoid due to danger. Some smaller flocks have been known to follow people who feed them, even as those people age and move to different homes within the city, passing the tribal knowledge of previous kindness from one generation of pest drakes to the next.",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are not as vicious as their drake cousins, and they rarely attack creatures larger than themselves. They are omnivorous, subsisting primarily on berries, seeds, insects, and small rodents, though those that inhabit cities get the majority of their diet from scraps dropped by the city's inhabitants. Many pest drakes perch patiently in parks where citizens are likely to rest and eat, waiting for a dropped scrap or the opportunity to steal an untended meal. Some pest drakes have learned that chirping, dancing, and other displays often delight the local populace, leading to the drakes getting more scraps of food.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pest drakes are social, communal creatures that exist almost entirely within cities. Flocks within cities tend to claim sections of the city as their territories and defend these territories from outside menaces, whether those menaces are other flocks of pest drakes, an invasion of stowaway rats on the docks, or new construction in the nobles' district that disrupts their nests. Flocks of pest drakes found outside of cities still frequently gravitate toward humanoid settlements, latching onto tribes or villages. Pest drakes communicate with each other through a mixture of body language, chirps, clicks, and whistles. They can understand basic words and simple commands in the languages of the humanoids around them, but they lack the ability to fully understand or speak a language.",
			"",
			"Masons despise pest drakes. The drakes' acidic biology eventually permeates their roosting places, slowly eating away at the structure beneath. Their acid erodes details on statues, inscriptions on walls, and designs on column capitals. Buildings and statuary made of marble or painted in lighter colors are particularly susceptible to this corrosion, as it slowly darkens the stone and dissolves the paint. Once established, these pests have proven difficult to remove, as they are often too numerous and too prolific to fully exterminate, especially when the local populace so regularly feeds the friendly creatures. In poorer areas where vermin are more prevalent, the citizens often encourage the habitation of pest drakes to help keep the populations of other pests down.",
			"",
			"Many minor nobles still collect and breed pest drakes for racing stock due to their innate ability to always find their way home. Some pest drakes are bred for speed, others for endurance. These races are collectively referred to as \"Rainbow Races\" due to the bright streaks of color that fill the sky when the pest drakes are released. Owners keep racing drakes in housing that limits the drakes' ability to form a bond with others of their kind. Current Rainbow Races have regulations limiting how many pest drakes can be raced at the same time after the Great Drake Disaster in Taldor, in which thousands of half-starved pest drakes were released for a race and subsequently bonded into a flock that decimated the nearby farmland."

The nature of Geb's curse remains mysterious even today-it is simply known that occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden's stone weapon changes to steel (though it remains fused within the maiden's grasp). The weapon can be recovered when the maiden is destroyed.",

When peuchens are not flying, their leathery, batlike wings lie folded along their bodies, matching the coloration of the hides below. Their eyes are a brilliant green, with snakelike pupils.

They ambush their prey by coiling up and lunging with their strikes from a distance father than their prey usually expects. Peuchens prefer to drain the blood of humanoids, but they will eat sheep, goats, cats, dogs, or poultry if they fail to capture their favorite prey. They happily lair in haylofts or open attics, but also create nests in large trees or rock formations.

A moment after it attacks with invisibility, the creature appears briefly as a semi-transparent version of its normal self. This allows any viewer with line of sight to the phantom fungus to pinpoint its location at the time of the attack (though if the creature moves after it attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it again). An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can turn completely visible as a move action, though it normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey.",
			"",
			"A phantom fungus's primary advantage as a predator is its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling the perimeters of caverns, a phantom fungus remains invisible until it is behind its prey, at which point it snaps at its victim with its vicious maw.",
			"",
			"A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures. When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if possible-characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud attacks (such as bards or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter creatures.",
			"",
			"The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This \"mouth\" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to siphon away nutrients.",
			"",
			"A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Although they prefer dwelling underground, they have been encountered above ground as well."

			"When a worshiper of an evil god forsakes his faith, the deity being spurned sometimes takes note. In such a case, the betraying worshiper may not have the luxury of living the rest of his life and putting off divine punishment until some point after death. Sometimes, the god is so offended that the infidel is transformed into a pharmakos. While a pharmakos has much power, the metamorphosis into such a cursed creature is rarely one a worshiper seeks, for the pain and humiliation of the punishment is significant. That the altered worshiper can go on to serve the deity as a powerful guardian is of a secondary concern to the god in most cases, and regardless, when a pharmakos finally meets the end of its pain-filled life, then true divine punishment begins."

Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit.

Numerous mushrooms sprout from the main body-vile green stalks topped with purple or red caps that seem to steam with rank-smelling smoke. This smoke is in fact vapor escaping from the numerous globs of acid the plant produces as a method of both self-defense and reproduction.",

			"Because of the filthy environment in which this fungus thrives, goblins are one of the few races that have learned to coexist with phycomids. Not content to simply give the fungi a wide berth, these foolish goblins actually harvest the phycomids, prodding them into positions in their warrens where they can serve as guards and sentinels, utilizing long poles they call \"slime sticks\" or placing delicious-smelling carrion to attract the fungus to a desired position. Although phycomids are deadly to eat, many goblin tribes view those who eat a phycomid mushroom and survive as great heroes. Needless to say, most goblin lairs that attempt to utilize phycomids as guardians eventually become nothing more than phycomid lairs-a goblin tribe's luck can only hold up for so long, after all."

Though they might become curious about a tribe of barbarians, take sudden interest in learning the cant of a local group of thieves, or even study the method of distribution for the local brewery, they watch such things from a distance, never interacting with such \"lesser minds.\" But if a pipefox finds a creature that loves knowledge as much as it does, it becomes intrigued, and after spending a period of time observing such a creature, will eventually muster up the courage to make the relationship more personal.

Collectors of exotic pets sometimes ship tanks of these carnivorous fish home, and some unscrupulous owners even put the fish to work disposing of unwanted bodies. When the authorities draw near, panicked criminals sometimes dump the fish into nearby rivers, inadvertently unleashing schools in waters woefully unprepared for their ravenous introduction!"

Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most pixies)-the dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits-it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow.

			"Perhaps the best-known and most elusive of all fey creatures, pixies live in the deepest, most pristine forests, but their insatiable curiosity often leads them far from home. Most pixies stand just over 2 feet tall-though they typically fly about the eye level of creatures they're conversing with in order to maintain eye contact-and weigh about 30 pounds. Pixies talk quickly and easily become overexcited.",
			"",
			"Strange beings both of and beyond the natural world, pixies have magic that occasionally favors them in strange ways. For example, one out of every 10 pixies exhibits an additional spell-like ability that it can use once per day (caster level 8th), usually baleful polymorph, beast shape II (Tiny creatures only), or even a powerful spell like irresistible dance. Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows-as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects. Confusion, fear, hideous laughter, and hypnotism are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers. You should take care when assigning alternate powers to a pixie, though, since doing so can create a threat that far exceeds what their physical statistics (and relatively low CR) can logically support."

Curing any of this Constitution damage restores a creature's movement to its full speed. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The pixie circle is an aggressive invasive species that opportunistically drains energy from nearby plant and animal life to fuel its teleporting abilities. It uses these abilities to remove potential threats from its habitat, typically teleporting creatures away when it is threatened or hurt. These sturdy vines are resistant to heat, cold, and drought conditions, and an infestation is notoriously difficult to root out once it has taken hold. A mature pixie circle measures 20 feet in diameter and is always in flower regardless of the season.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"While it shares a passing resemblance to wisteria or honeysuckle, pixie circle behaves like mistletoe and parasitically attaches itself to larger plants and trees while it establishes itself. Smaller infestations do not flower and can be difficult to detect, as the pixie circle tends to blend in with its host foliage. Once the plant is mature enough to put out flowers, it is large enough to attack and teleport victims, and continues to grow at an astonishing rate.",
			"",
			"The flowers of a pixie circle resemble the multicolored wings of [pixies](unknown/pixies) when seen from a distance, making them a clear signal for people aware of the plant to keep their distance. Its growths can easily dominate large trees and can cover small cottages in a single season. Left unchecked, the plant can overwhelm groves or entire sections of woodlands, burying everything living beneath the pretty green and purple vines and leaving wide patches of dead forest in its wake.",
			"",
			"The plant is opportunistic in nature and initially prefers to absorb energy from host trees before progressing to insects, small birds, and eventually the larger animal life that wanders into range. As a result, most humanoids encounter the vine only when it is large enough to be a threat. Because of its growth pattern, a pixie circle tends to form a ring around an open meadow, creating a natural lure for large herbivores and adventurers seeking a safe place to camp. Adventurers with sharp eyes and knowledge of the natural world can recognize these meadows by their odd circular pattern and the unnatural silence within them. The vines of well-established patches typically hide the bones of previous victims, animal and humanoid alike. The belongings of the deceased are often in excellent condition, as scavengers tend to avoid these remains.",
			"",
			"Pixie circles spread underground using offshoots strong enough to punch through clay and rocky soils. Solid rock or a brick wall can contain the runners within a garden, but such barriers must extend at least 6 feet belowground. Clippings and small pieces will take root within a week if left in contact with fertile soil. Pixie circles are also self-pollinating, and their seeds are light enough to carry on wind. This makes containment of the plant extremely difficult, as these seeds can cover several miles of distance with a slight breeze.",
			"",
			"Once a pixie circle reaches its full size, it secretes a unique toxin from all of its vines. This toxin dries out cells and causes a pixie circle's victims to grow weak, making it difficult for prey to escape. In addition to its predatory applications, this toxin is also laced with arcane energies. Once the toxin is flowing through a victim's veins, the pixie circle can attempt to harness the arcane energy to transport the creature to another pixie circle elsewhere.",
			"",
			"Scholars disagree as to the exact details of a pixie circle's teleportation abilities. Some believe that the pixie circle developed these abilities to keep its particular habitat clear of any predators or competition for food. Others claim that this ability allows them to propagate much more easily as a species, as it allows pixie circles to share prey with each other. This becomes especially useful for pixie circles attempting to establish footholds in new territories.",
			"",
			"Some adventurers risk intentionally provoking these plants to benefit from their teleportation abilities. Those who have studied pixie circles know that they are more intelligent than they let on. By speaking with a pixie circle, these insightful adventurers can convince it to teleport a target without the need for combat. The pixie circle will send willing targets to another pixie circle of their choice, though this process still requires exposure to a pixie circle's toxin. While painful, this is a somewhat reliable process, and bold druids and rangers make use of it.",
			"",
			"Given its rate of growth and tolerance of a wide range of environments, many believe that the pixie circle is not a naturally occurring plant; signs seem to point to an origin associated with fey. Whether it was created through magical experimentation or intentional breeding is unclear, and it remains an open question whether the first pixie circles escaped to the outside world of their own accord or through deliberate release.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pixie circles grow in nearly any environment, from snowy taiga to humid jungles, so long as there are suitable creatures in the area to serve as prey. The plant is rare in sandy deserts and other barren environments, and underwater and underground growths are unheard of. Regardless of its environment, a pixie circle adopts the appearance and coloration of local flora to better hide.",
			"",
			"Although pixie circles are highly invasive and difficult to clear, civilizations do their best to contain or remove these plants when they grow nearby. Several workers can clear a patch of young pixie circles within a few days, but even the smallest scrap of root or branch left behind can allow them to reestablish themselves, requiring repeated efforts to keep them under control.",
			"",
			"In rural Avistani communities, parents warn children to avoid pixie circles should they encounter them, lest the children be stolen away by the fey-a reasonable concern given the plants' ability to teleport victims. Alternatively, some tell stories of a stranger staggering out of the circle speaking a language none in the village recognize or wearing clothes that are hundreds of years out of style. A few lucky survivors return with stories of adventures in the First World or Nithveil."

Additionally, once a creature takes 7 points of Dexterity damage from the pulsing puffs, the domed mounds burst, releasing a 10-foot-radius burst of diseased spores. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature caught within the burst radius or that moves through it is exposed to the pulsing puffs disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"",
			"**Puffballs (Ex)** Poleviks have learned how to nurture myriad species of symbiotic fungi upon their bodies, and the most treasured of these are their deadly puffballs. Each 6-inchdiameter spherical fungus has a thorny internal stalk covered by a thin skin of spore-laden flesh. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a polevik can pluck and throw a puffball with a range of 20 feet. On a successful hit, the thorns expand and pulsate on impact, bursting through the flesh of the puffball. This inflicts vicious wounds and releases fungal spores that infect the victim with pulsing puffs. As soon as a puffball has been plucked, another grows in its place. Once a puffball has been plucked, it decomposes after 1 round, becoming inert.",

			"The secretive and suspicious poleviks cultivate gardens of fungi in deep bogs and caves far from civilization, jealously guarding the secrets of their fungal alchemy from the rest of the world. Once natives of the First World, they retain some of that plane's potent life energy, which specifically encourages the growth of fungi and molds. This enables them to turn their own spry and twisted bodies into fertile ground in which to cultivate their signature puffball weapons.",
			"",
			"Averaging a few inches shy of 4 feet tall and weighing approximately 115 pounds, individuals can vary in size depending on the number and size of fungal growths that they nurture upon their bodies. They rarely live beyond 300 years.",
			"",
			"Poleviks are omnivorous but prefer decomposing meat that is already furred with fungus or ripe with mold. They rarely go to the trouble of actively hunting food; instead, they scavenge the remains of small creatures that find their way into their lairs and fall victim to the dangerous plants and molds they cultivate. Although poleviks could subsist on the mushrooms that they grow, they consider it a terrible waste to use these mushrooms for something as prosaic as food.",
			"",
			"As with many creatures of the First World, their cycle of reproduction is somewhat bizarre; poleviks reproduce only after their death. As a polevik's body begins to rot, one of his unique fungal infestations begins to consume his flesh and eventually grows into a colony of large toadstools. After a period of 1 year, the stalk of the largest toadstool bursts open and gives birth to a new, fully grown polevik. While already possessing all the skills and abilities of his race, the newborn carries none of the memories of his progenitor. As a result, a newborn polevik knows nothing about the world beyond his immediate surroundings, and his paranoid nature gives him little desire to learn more. Instead, he begins to enthusiastically cultivate the corpse-grown fungal colony that gave birth to him, adding it to the fungal garden of his long-decomposed predecessor.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Poleviks are solitary and reclusive creatures who consider fungi and molds to be both their closest friends and their most treasured possessions. Though they are able to communicate with all types of molds and mushrooms, poleviks occasionally find fungi's limited frame of reference frustrating. This sometimes leads poleviks to associate with intelligent fungoid creatures such as leshies and myceloids, although they treat the former as servants and the latter as rivals.",
			"",
			"Most scholars agree that the poleviks were cast out of the First World, exiled for some ancient insult to one of the Eldest. Though scholars disagree on which of those unique beings the poleviks offended, evidence of polevik gardens has been discovered by travelers in the Hanging Bower of the Green Mother, leading to speculation that poleviks may have once been her servants. Exile may have stripped them of an unending existence in the First World, but the stability of the material world gives them ample opportunity to cultivate and experiment with their beloved fungal companions. It is for these experiments that they are widely hunted by wizards seeking obscure spell components, and by alchemists who wish to learn the secrets of the polevik's miraculous ability to mix fungi into concoctions that seem impossible to create outside of a laboratory.",
			"",
			"Fearful of the outside world, poleviks rarely leave their lairs, but creatures that find their way into a polevik's gardens face vicious opponents. While poleviks are dangerous on their own, their usual tactic is to lead interlopers within reach of the deadly molds and fungi with which they share their lairs. Most who seek poleviks fall prey to ascomoids, brown molds, phantom fungi, phycomids, violet fungi, yellow molds, and others long before they face the direct attacks of these obsessive fey.",
			"",
			"### Puffballs",
			"",
			"The most treasured of a polevik's fungi is the puff ball. In addition to the standard puff ball, which is rife with the deadly pulsing puffs disease, poleviks cultivate certain other varieties, each with its own unique properties.",
			"",
			"Deathrot Spores: Despite their name, these black puff balls are no threat to living creatures. When applied to a corpse, they quickly consume the necrotic flesh, stripping all meat from the skeleton over the course of a minute. This ability to easily conceal the identity of a murder victim makes deathrot spores prized by assassins. These puff balls can also be brought to bear against certain types of undead. When hurled as a ranged touch attack against non-skeletal, corporeal undead, deathrot spores inflict a -2 penalty to the creature's natural armor for 10 rounds.",
			"",
			"Flamequench Mushrooms: These dun-colored puff balls are grown from a species of brown mold. When thrown into a fire, the puffball releases spores that suck in the heat from their immediate area. This has the effect of completely extinguishing a 5-foot square of nonmagical fire."

The poltergeist experiences great trauma over its condition; this trauma twists its psyche to evil and fosters an overall hatred of the living expressed in outbursts of rage. A poltergeist is bound to a specific place, usually a building, room, or recognizable area (a section of a cemetery, a stretch of lonely road, and so on).

			"",
			"**Grace (Su)** A poludnica adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.",
			"",
			"**Searing Weapons (Su)** Any weapon a poludnica wields becomes incredibly hot and conducts and amplifies her ability to cause fatigue by reducing the target's ability to resist the effects. In melee combat, such a weapon deals an additional 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d2 points of Constitution damage. The Constitution damage is negated with a successful DC 21 Fortitude save. The weapon cools rapidly if it leaves her grasp, losing these additional abilities immediately.",
			"",
			"**Sunstroke Haze (Su)** A poludnica radiates oppressive heat in a 10-foot radius. Any creature that starts its turn within this area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and become fatigued. A fatigued creature that fails a second saving throw becomes exhausted. The fatigued or exhausted condition lasts for as long as the nonlethal damage goes unhealed. A poludnica can activate or suppress this ability as a free action and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tied to Day (Su)** A poludnica's connection to the sun tethers her to the Material Plane. During daylight hours (from dawn to sunset), her abilities are as shown above whether she can actually see the sun or not. During the nighttime hours (from sunset to dawn), a poludnica shifts to the Ethereal Plane (as ethereal jaunt). This is automatic, involuntary, and causes a poludnica great distress. While on the Ethereal Plane, a poludnica is affected by her darkness powerlessness and is nearly helpless. This curse cannot be dispelled or removed by anything short of divine interaction.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Driven by an obsession that few can fully comprehend, poludnicas are bitter creatures of light, heat, and envy. Although they are surprisingly strong and deadly combatants, these scythe-wielding women resort to violence only when guile and trickery have failed. They are lonely creatures that seek the company of mortals by luring farm workers and children away from their families so that they can briefly enjoy a feeble simulation of family life. In the rural farming communities where her kind is most commonly found, a poludnica might also be known as Cornwife, Lady Midday, or Mother Noon. She might even be mistaken for a vengeful or beneficent ghost depending on how she presents herself.",
			"",
			"Averaging 6 feet tall and weighing approximately 170 pounds, poludnicas could easily be mistaken for strapping farm girls if it were not for their radiance. Their maximum life expectancy has not been documented and it is commonly believed that poludnicas are effectively immortal unless they suffer some deadly mishap. It has been theorized that permanently keeping a poludnica in magically darkened conditions would eventually lead to her death, but no scholars have so far attempted to prove this hypothesis.",
			"",
			"Poludnicas draw their physical sustenance from sunlight, but they often eat and drink to emulate the simple folk who are the subjects of their obsession. However, emotional nourishment is more difficult for them to obtain and their need for companionship and the simulation of a normal family life leads them to commit questionable acts of kidnapping or even murder.",
			"",
			"Like bees who pollinate nearby flowers-which then go to seed and produce more flowers the next season-a poludnica's ability to enrich local plant life leads farming communities to thrive around their lairs. These plentiful fields bring more farmhands and more families, all potential companions for the poludnica.",
			"",
			"Though the magic that pulls poludnicas into the Ethereal Plane at nightfall is viewed as a curse, it is also one of their most useful abilities. Though distressed and weakened on the Ethereal Plane, poludnicas can nonetheless perceive events upon the Material Plane. They often spend their nights spying on mortal families. Each night they move ethereally through mortals' homes, watching them eat, sleep, and enjoy the company and intimacy of others. Though this fills all poludnicas with sorrow, many are also driven to impotent, jealous rage as they watch children sleeping peacefully and wives embracing their husbands.",
			"",
			"The origin of their cursed existence is a mystery- whether poludnicas were created by some powerful creature that did not anticipate the maddening effects of their abilities or whether they were once different creatures cursed for some failure or insult is not known. Either way, the curse has driven these lonely fey slightly mad.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Poludnicas usually claim a few hundred acres of fertile land as their territory, most often centered on a lair that is hidden in plain sight, inaccessible, or avoided by the community, such as a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a tree, the tumbledown barn of a former companion who no longer lives, or an abandoned and supposedly haunted farmhouse.",
			"",
			"By day, a poludnica prowls crop fields seeking to lure, coerce, or physically abduct an overworked farmhand back to her home where she has built a mockery of a human farmhouse kitchen or bedroom, expecting her abductee to indulge her whims in a pantomime of normalcy, companionship, or intimacy. Sometimes one of these companions might choose to play along with his captor or try to escape during daylight hours, but those that bide their time until nightfall when the poludnica disappears at least have a chance of escape.",
			"",
			"If a companion survives until nightfall, the poludnica fades away, leaving the suitor or child to fend for himself while she watches impotently from the Ethereal Plane. This may not prove to be a problem, but since many poludnicas make their daytime lairs in inaccessible places, if the captive cannot free himself before dawn, the poludnica often simply returns-likely unhappy with the \"inconsiderate\" companion's lack of loyalty to his new \"family.\"",
			"",
			"Some poludnicas who are kinder than most choose to hide their presence altogether. They avoid coming into contact with the peasants working the land, except at night where they can invisibly and sorrowfully observe mortals enjoying the companionship that is denied to the poludnicas themselves. More commonly, poludnicas are driven to lure away farmhands and kidnap children who they believe will come to love them and consider them their new family.",
			"",
			"For all the suffering poludnicas cause, dwelling in a poludnica's territory is not without its benefits. Their crop-enriching powers provide abundant food, and many farming communities have come to see them as a kind of guardian spirit. Children often weave cornhusk dolls to placate a local poludnica, ask for her protection, or thank her for sparing their fathers or brothers. Some poludnicas are touched by these displays and stop, or at least reduce, their predations on those in the community."

The pooka doesn't mind a little rough retaliation, but flees any attempts to kill it.",
			"",

			"The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless hunter that, once it picks up a potential meal's scent, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is sated. A kronosaurus's diet consists of everything from large fish and sharks to small whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown kronosaurus can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.",

			"The nothosaur resembles a smaller version of the land-based brachiosaurus, sharing the distinctive long neck and tail and short legs of its herbivorous brethren. Nothosaurs are also similar in many ways to seals-they spend much of their time in the water, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is most vulnerable out of the water, but when caught unawares, it can return to the water with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in water of any temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of many months. From head to the tip of its tail, an adult nothosaur is 12 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.",

A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient flukedriven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.",

			"**Kiss of the Speakers (Ex)** Moment by moment, an izfiitar tinkers with the myriad possibilities in which it can act or move, granting it the prescience to choose whichever possible moment best suits it. As a move action once every other round, an izfiitar can grant itself one of the following options on its next round's action: double all of its speeds for 1 round, gain the ability to roll one d20 roll twice in the next round and choose which result to use, or gain an additional standard action that can be used only to activate a spell-like ability.",

			"**Reshape Reality (Sp)** This ability functions as mirage arcana heightened to a 9th-level spell, except the changes created are quasi-real, like those created by shadow conjuration. A creature that interacts with reshaped reality can attempt a DC 26 Will save to see through the illusion. Terrain thus created can provide concealment, and against foes who fail the Will save to see through it, reshaped reality can provide cover. For disbelievers, quasi-real objects and terrain have only 20% of the normal hardness and hit points, and break DCs are 10 lower than normal. Damage caused by dangerous terrain can't exceed 5d6 points of damage per round (1d6 per round against disbelievers). This ability can't damage existing structures, nor does it function in areas where planar travel is prohibited.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"While the keketar proteans hold vague ideological sway over their kind's infinite choruses, the izfiitars loom above them, cardinals among the slithering clergy. Aloof and distant even compared to the keketars, izfiitars rarely venture beyond the Maelstrom's deepest reaches, content to divine the will of the plane's unknowable dualistic godhead, the Speakers of the Depths.",
			"",
			"Bound to a single chorus, izfiitars are and yet are not distinct from the keketars who pay them obeisance, leading many to speculate that they are essentially elevated keketars, chosen for reasons unknown and propelled along a path of apotheosis either by the Maelstrom itself or by one of the so-called protean lords. Yet their position remains paradoxical, befitting the Maelstrom's rejection of stability and consistency. Not every chorus contains an izfiitar, while some contain multiple, and the size and influence of any given chorus is entirely independent of their presence.",
			"",
			"Although smaller in size than keketars, izfiitars have monstrous physical attacks and stupendous magical powers. They wield a more powerful version of lesser proteans' warpwave, as well as abilities that bend reality and alter probability, focused on the proteans' desire to return all of reality to the freedom of pure, unbound chaos.",
			"",
			"### Hearld of the Speakers",
			"",
			"Among the izfiitars, those termed Heralds of the Speakers wield greater power and authority than their kin and take a more direct hand in guiding the choruses than the much more distant protean lords. Each Herald of the Speakers is effectively a unique being; they often have additional Hit Dice or levels in a particular class (typically cleric or oracle), the advanced creature simple template, and possibly unique powers granted by their dualistic and inscrutable divine patron. Listed below are three sample unique abilities of Heralds of the Speakers, but these examples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers they might wield.",
			"",
			"Planar Transposition (Su): The Herald's connection to the fabric of the Maelstrom that underlies every other plane of reality provides it a considerable ability to influence its surroundings even while on other planes. As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, the Herald can suppress one planar trait or add one of the Maelstrom's planar traits to an area equal to one 10- foot square per Hit Die it has. Alternatively, the Herald can effectively shift the area in a 90-foot radius centered on itself into the Maelstrom, swapping a corresponding region of the Maelstrom onto its current plane and choosing whether to move creatures or leave them in place. Creatures can resist being transported by succeeding at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the Herald's HD + the Herald's Charisma modifier).",
			"",
			"Reality Flaunt (Su): The Herald can selectively ignore or redirect a spell or spell-like ability once every 1d4 rounds as an immediate action. The Herald can choose to buck the laws of reality and ignore such an effect by attempting a Wisdom check (DC = the caster level of the spell or spell-like ability). If the Herald exceeds the DC by 10 or more, it can choose to redirect any targeted effect to a new target of its choosing within 60 feet.",
			"",
			"Voice of the Speakers (Su): The Herald of the Speakers has additional spell-like abilities (20 spell levels' worth of 1st- to 4thlevel spells usable at will and 20 spell levels' worth of 5th- to 8thlevel spells usable three times per day). All selected spells must come from the cleric spell list, the Chaos domain, or the Protean subdomain.",

			"Debate rages as to whether or not the strange and capricious creatures called voidworms are actually proteans at all. To the wizards and sorcerers who summon them as familiars, the answer seems obvious-these tiny dwellers of Limbo have all the requisite racial traits of proteans, down to their serpentine shapes. Yet the established protean castes find such claims outright insulting, claiming instead that it is such acts of conjuration that call voidworms forth from the raw stuff of Limbo, giving them shape and life according to the spellcasters' expectations, and that these lesser beings are but pale reflections of their formidable kin. Voidworms themselves have little to say on the matter-creatures of the moment, and sparing little thought for the constantly mutable concept of \"reality,\" voidworms only barely grasp cause and effect, and the past has no more substance or significance for them than a dream. In order to gain a voidworm as a familiar, a spellcaster must be chaotic neutral, be caster level 7th, and have the Improved Familiar feat.",
			"",
			"Regardless of their actual origins, voidworms maintain a thriving ecology in the chaos of Limbo, forming together into darting, flashing schools that are often hunted for sport by naunets and other predators of chaos. Mortal wizards, however, most commonly encounter voidworms as summoned familiars. These tiny, serpentine creatures are particularly valued by illusionists, evokers, and other magical practitioners who deal with distorting or molding reality, though the familiars' bizarre logic and miniscule attention spans sometimes make them more trouble than they're worth. Still, their confusing attack and remarkable hardiness have saved more than one wizard on the battlefield, and their strange thought processes can sometimes offer unique insights in the laboratory. When traveling in more mundane lands, wizards often order voidworm familiars to use their change shape ability to disguise themselves as ordinary pets or animal familiars, though these disguises tend to slip when the voidworm grows curious or playful.",
			"",
			"A voidworm is only 2 feet long and weighs a mere 2 pounds. No two voidworms are exactly alike in their coloration or markings. Their two feathery wings generally take on brighter colors than the rest of their bodies, and in the case of voidworms conjured as familiars, these \"wings\" are the same color as their masters' eyes.",

			"**Create Spawn (Ex)** A creature that dies while suffering from a proto-shoggoth's infect flesh ability, either from the effects of the infection itself or from any other source, becomes a potential host for a new proto-shoggoth. Only 2d6 hours after death, as long as the majority of the creature's body remains relatively intact, a new protoshoggoth tears itself out of the corpse. This destroys the old body, preventing spells like speak with dead or raise dead from functioning on the remains. A creature slain by an effect such as disintegrate that leaves no body behind can't spawn a proto-shoggoth. Likewise, if an infected body is completely destroyed by fire, acid, or any similar effect, it can't spawn a proto-shoggoth. A body infected with proto-shoggoth material is not contagious-it can't infect other creatures through contact.",
			"",
			"**Infect Flesh (Ex)** When a living creature takes damage from a proto-shoggoth's constrict ability, the monster infects the creature's flesh with its alien enzymes. The victim can resist this infection with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. Otherwise, the creature becomes sickened as microscopic fragments of proto-shoggoth tissue infest the victim, slowly transforming it from the inside into proto-shoggoth material. In addition to being sickened as long as the creature remains infected, it must succeed at an additional DC 23 Fortitude save once every 24 hours or it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain as its body begins to consume itself. This is an infestation effect. An infestation is similar to a disease, but it can be cured only through specific means; no matter how many saving throws a target succeeds at, the infestation continues to affect the target. While remove disease or similar spells can halt the progress of this infected flesh as if it were a disease, immunity to disease offers no protection. Application of negative energy can halt this infestation as well; each time an infected creature is reduced to negative hit points by such an effect, the victim can attempt a new DC 23 Fortitude save. On a success, the infection immediately ends as the negative energy scours the proto-shoggoth material out of the victim's body. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Merge (Ex)** As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, two proto-shoggoths can merge together in an attempt to fuse. In order to do so, each proto-shoggoth must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save-if either fails, both proto-shoggoths become staggered for 1d6 rounds. Those two proto-shoggoths are then incompatible, and can never again attempt to merge with each other, although the individual proto-shoggoths can attempt to do so with other proto-shoggoths in the future. If both proto-shoggoths succeed at the Fortitude save, they immediately merge together and form a Large proto-shoggoth syncytium (see the stat block below).",

A proto-shoggoth syncytium often acts as a protector over its mindless \"children\" and has been known to use rudimentary cunning to lure (or more often chase) unsuspecting living creatures into proto-shoggoth nests."

			"Pseudodragons are tiny cousins of true dragons, and are playful but shy. They often only vocalize in chirps, hisses, growls, and purrs, but can communicate telepathically with any intelligent creature. If approached peacefully and offered food, they are usually willing to share information about what they've seen in their territory, but threats or violence make them flee.",
			"",
			"Pseudodragons are carnivores, devouring insects, rodents, small birds, and snakes, though they sometimes eat eggs, and most also enjoy butter, cheese, and fish. They either hunt on the ground like lizards or look for prey on the wing like a raptor. As smart as a typical humanoid, they do not enjoy being treated as pets and prefer being treated as friends. They are wary of evil folk but can bond with sorcerers and wizards as familiars, and some have befriended druids and rangers or partnered with good dragons as scouts. Pseudodragons will serve as familiars if they approve of a spellcaster's personality (and if the spellcaster takes the Improved Familiar feat), but often also bond with those whose company they enjoy or who have proven themselves true friends. A pseudodragon might follow another character in this manner for days, weeks, years, or even a lifetime if the creature is treated well, provided with food, and generally well-loved.",
			"",
			"Upon reaching adulthood, a pseudodragon's body is about 1 foot long with a 2-foot tail, and weighs about 7 pounds. A pseudodragon egg is the size of a chicken egg, but leathery and spotted brown, and a mating female lays 2-5 eggs every spring. A clutch of pseudodragons (the collective noun-not to be confused with pseudodragons from the same brood of eggs) usually consists of a mated pair and several near-adult offspring."

Hard to please, they are likely to attack their owners and try to escape unless kept on a very short leash or managed by a skilled handler.",

And though psychementals seek out interactions with intelligent creatures for the pleasures of learning about the world and socializing, an encounter with one can be a dangerous affair if it feels threatened or provoked. Unfortunately, this occurs fairly often, as the upsetting stimuli that prompted a psychemental's creation leave it more easily startled than other creatures. A psychemental's attacks are never lethal on their own-the stolen mental fragments eventually reform themselves within the victim's mind over time-but the potential to leave a victim comatose for an extended period of time can be quite dangerous in its own right. Yet sentient beings who approach a psychemental calmly and without any ill intent find the creatures to be extremely engaging conversationalists, and psychementals' very natures guarantee that they are experts in a variety of esoteric topics. A creature that manages to make a psychemental feel safe may have just earned a highly unusual friend for life."

			"A psychepore is a symbiosis of two different plant creatures-a lurching bit of undergrowth distantly related to the shambling mound and an intelligent cluster of hard fungal growths that possess a malevolent hive mind. On their own, the shambling undergrowth is an unintelligent creature, barely aware enough to move itself to new sources of sunlight and water, while the fungal conks, for their part, are intelligent but immobile. The two pose a serious threat only once the psychic fungus infests the shambling undergrowth, and the creatures transform into the horrifying psychepore.",
			"",
			"A psychepore procreates through microorganisms in its poison, spreading into victims fungal spores that try to bond with that host's physiology to create a new psychepore. Generally, the only creatures with which these spores can coexist are the shambles that form the base of a psychepore, but these spores also have strange effects on creatures that aren't their typical hosts. Such creatures suffer from delusional visions as their minds try to assimilate or reject the images presented by the alien will of the strange symbionts, and their bodies desperately attempt to force the foreign spores out. Some cultures harvest psychepores to distill their poison into a powerful drug, using it in religious rituals that search for inner knowledge or in dark alleys as a temporary escape from cruel, short lives-or transforming it into a truth serum used during psychological torture and other types of interrogation.",
			"",
			"Most psychepores attack only in vain attempts to procreate, never seeming frustrated by their usually futile efforts, but more intelligent specimens pursue less direct but more fruitful approaches, often serving those who aid in gathering the undergrowth they need to replicate. There are rumors of even more highly developed and intelligent versions of these creatures that learn the secrets of telepathy and how to adjust their poison to replicate possession magic. These superintelligent psychepores become more aware of cultural structures and take great joy in manipulating other forms of life to achieve their goals.",
			"",
			"A psychepore is a hulking thing with a dense composition. It stands 6 feet tall or slightly taller and weighs about 300 pounds."

It accomplishes this by way of soothing wisdom and its celebration of the deceased's life through song.

			"",
			"In order to mingle with mortals without alerting them to its nature, a calaca disguises itself from head to toe in local finery, wearing gloves and colorful masks to hide its true nature.

			"",
			"Many cultures speak of kindly strangers or masked wanderers who appear in the wake of a beloved's death to offer words of consolation and songs of catharsis, and calacas are often the root of these myths. A calaca typically arrives at the door of a widow, widower, or next of kin by mysterious means and always claims to be a distant friend or admirer of the dead. The calaca may show up during a wake or other funeral procession-as long as doing so would not be disruptive or insulting-bearing food and drink for the mourners. While they treat the bereaved to sustenance and music, calacas use their social charms to get to know the grieving and to learn more about the deceased so that they can tailor their consolations to each individual. Because they use no compulsion magic and cannot speak with the dead like some psychopomps, calacas must rely on their natural graces and aptitude for conversation while interacting with mortals.",
			"",
			"Far from mere charlatans, calacas do in actuality feel the sympathy they express so strongly to survivors of the dead. However, their grief stems not from the departure of the individual to the afterlife (in fact, most calacas never meet the spirits of the dead for whom they are sharing consolations), but from the pain of knowing that mortals will never fully understand the beauty or necessity of the transition from life to death. They are a forlorn race of psychopomps who express their sorrow in the form of joyful music and mirthful laughter.",
			"",
			"A calaca's role is not in combat, and most retreat if a fight seems inevitable, returning another day to give peaceful mediation another try. In spite of calacas' pacifistic nature, each bears on its person an antique weapon such as a pistol or an exotic sword, which is perhaps the creature's most mysterious detail. Even the calaca does not know the purpose of this weapon-whether it is a relic from the creature's past as a mortal or just part of its disguise. However, if asked, a calaca replies that its weapon is an item gifted directly by the gods, and its use will become obvious when the appropriate time has come. A calaca's second-most important belonging is its instrument (typically a guitar or fiddle), which is capable of unleashing powerful magic if destroyed as a last resort.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Psychopomp(monster/family:psychopomp)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A calaca's prime directive is to discreetly dissuade any survivors who might consider necromancy or other unnatural means of reviving the dead. Calacas accomplish this through tact and persuasion, not magic or trickery, and by instilling the belief that death is simply a second chapter in the story of one's life. If a calaca cannot sway a mortal from trying to revive the fallen, it calls upon other psychopomps more suited to handling the threat.",
			"",
			"Because death is common on Golarion but necromancy is not, calacas do not appear before just anyone who has lost a loved one. Their typical targets are the rich and powerful; after all, individuals with the resources to bring the living back from the dead often need more dissuasion than peasants without means, who simply resign themselves to their loss. For particularly difficult cases or in the instance of mass casualties and thus multitudes of mourners, a number of calacas may band together to combine their efforts, appearing as a troupe. Such troupes typically throw elaborate performative feasts, with each calaca taking up a different instrument or part in the act. As long as their disguise holds, calacas will perform for mortals for days if necessary. Other psychopomps like [catrinas](unknown/catrinas) may also join them in larger groups, as their abilities complement the calacas' by calming distraught family members and angry mobs.",
			"",
			"When not performing their core duty consoling the aggrieved, calacas accompany other psychopomps on missions to the Material Plane, either as heralds or to provide support. A calaca typically reports its success or failures to a [nosoi](monster/nosoi), who scribbles details of the calaca's latest encounter with a mortal. When a [morrigna](monster/morrigna) has been given a target for assassination, several calacas may be sent in advance to soften the morrigna's prey before the attack. Calacas can also be found in the backs of the ranks of [vanth](monster/vanth) forces, maintaining the pace of the psychopomps' march with their haunting battle dirges. Truly, wherever there are psychopomps, the somber songs of the calaca are never far behind."

This action is not considered to be against the target's nature or self-destructive. Any damage taken by the target (other than damage the catrina deals) immediately ends this effect.",

In such instances they serve as companions and ushers into the realm of the dead, not executioners. However, they're capable of serving in both capacities, especially if misguided mortals try to keep them from their duty, using their deadly but painless kisses to end a life in an instant.",
			"",
			"Catrinas always appear as festively dressed skeletons-usually in women's garb but sometimes in colorful men's formal wear, and usually decorated with or carrying flowers. They do not have true genders, but an individual catrina may have a more masculine or feminine voice and personality. They typically stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and weigh about 20 to 30 pounds.",

They are simpleminded, loyal, and utterly devoid of the compassion that defines so many other psychopomps-terrible things created and directed with terrible purpose.

While intelligent enough to speak and read, they lack the intellect and forceful personalities of most powerful outsiders, instead serving as the penultimate enforcers of the Boneyard's will-second only to Pharasma herself.",
			"",
			"These titanic psychopomps are too aggressive to collect souls, and instead rend souls free and allow their lesser kin-always close at hand when fulgatis march-to shepherd their victims to the Boneyard. What fulgatis do collect is the motivating life force, or quintessence, of the creatures they slay, pooling it until they invest it into the rubble around them to animate earth and stone as minions to assist in their destruction. These animated soldiers sometimes remain active for decades or even centuries after the psychopomps' grim work is done, tearing down what ruins remain and ensuring no trace of a destroyed civilization can ever be reclaimed.",
			"",
			"Fearsome psychopomps of last resort, a dozen known fulgatis slumber in isolated sepulchres deep within the Spire, awaiting those rare occasions when Pharasma herself has no need for subtlety or patience. Many more guard Pharasma's Palace, likewise held in deep sleep until released and directed against the Boneyard's enemies. Many psychopomps note that the structures housing the fulgatis continue far down along the Spire's length, well beyond the reaches of where they are permitted to travel, and it is possible that more of these powerful reapers-or even more powerful manifestations of their kind-slumber at the Spire's base, waiting to tear it down at the end of the cosmos as Pharasma brushes away the last traces of the multiverse.",
			"",
			"The fulgatis' ability to cast plane shift means the willful among them can escape and even hide for centuries at a time, reaping not at the Lady of Graves' command, but at whim. Teams of psychopomps relentlessly hunt these wayward destroyers, but few among their number, save the legendary yamarajes, can stand to the reapers of realms. Some psychopomps compare these wild fulgatis and their lust for random destruction to the spawn of Rovagug, but others believe Pharasma fashioned her own killers in response to Rovagug's arrival in the multiverse, likely to reap his divine spawn. Other claim that the souls of Rovagug's offspring are too terrible to exist freely, and so the Gray Lady devours them and rebirths them as new monsters-ones she alone can control.",
			"",
			"Despite the fulgatis' incredible power, few outside the courts of the Boneyard are even aware they exist. The mortal need to turn away from death is so powerful that living minds often wipe clean any encounter with a fulgati, leaving survivors to rationalize the destruction and death left in their wake as terrible accidents and natural disasters. Because of this, mortal scholars are unsure how often-or even if-the fulgatis have ever been unleashed upon the Material Plane. The reapers may be unleashed upon the world every few centuries, or they may simply slumber and exist only in nightmares and legend.",
			"",
			"Fulgatis resemble massive, female forms bearing eight stout arms, four of which serve them in place of legs. Their unusual locomotion allows them to climb and burrow with ease, even springing forth from the earth in the midst of their targets. While they wear no clothing, their flesh resembles worked metal and stone carved into elaborate whorls and patterns, giving the illusion of magnificent armor. The horns they bear are perfectly functional and deadly in close combat.",

			"**Grave Dependent (Su)** A kere is mystically bonded to a single gravestone-typically the most impressive or oldest in a graveyard-and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded).",
			"",
			"**Grave Meld (Su)** A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes.",
			"",
			"**Grave Tell (Sp)** This ability functions as the spell stone tell, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates, mausoleums, and similar constructions.",
			"",
			"**Infectious Fear (Su)** Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Shroud (Ex)** A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its owner's death.",
			"",
			"**Spiritsense (Su)** A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight ability.",
			"",
			"**Spirit Touch (Ex)** A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability.",
			"",
			"**Veil of Tears (Su)** Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by darkness and mind fog (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell slow (Will DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting dispel magic or a similar spell upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kere's Charisma.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces disregard the fundamental sanctity of such ground-mortal and deathless heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous otherworldly guardian.",
			"",
			"Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the Boneyard, the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life. While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend.",
			"",
			"Keres appear as pale, sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"**Family:** Psychopomp(monster/family:psychopomp)",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind, keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful ghosts and mythical beings from storytellers' tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead- out of a loathing for such perverse creatures-their unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A kere's exact methods usually matter little, as they tend to keep to more vulnerable, remote cemeteries, and prove most active when night cloaks the dark deeds of trespassers. But, occasionally, overzealous keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not.",
			"",
			"More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking psychopomps often find the added excitement isn't worth the bother.",
			"",
			"For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath."

A noisoi looks like a songbird-usually a crow, sparrow, or whippoorwill-though it wears a funerary mask that accentuates its beak. Many nosois craft decorative artificial tails from grave goods and other decorations that trail behind them as they fly. A nosoi typically measures about 1 foot in length but is deceptively heavy, weighing between 10 and 15 pounds. It can use drawing and writing tools suitable for Small or Medium creatures without penalty.",

			"",
			"**Fated Touch (Su)** An olethros's fated touch shows her target glimpses of its own fate and draws the creature inexorably closer to its doom. A fated touch deals 10d6 points of damage that bypasses all damage reduction. This is an aging effect when used against a living target. Against undead foes, it manifests as positive energy damage. Nonliving creatures (such as constructs) and creatures that are specifically immune to aging effects are immune to an olethros's fated touch. A creature that is critically hit by a fated touch is wracked by anguish and suffering for every bitter failure it has or shall experience, and is permanently shaken and sickened. This effect is a curse and a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"**Fateful Arrows (Su)** Each time an olethros deals damage to a creature with an arrow fired from her silkbow, the creature gains 1 fateful arrow point. These points persist for 24 hours. As long as a creature has any fateful arrow points, it takes a penalty equal to that point total on all saving throws against effects created by a psychopomp. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Mirror Garb (Ex)** Each tiny bronze mirror woven into an olethros's gown is a suitable focus for greater scrying, and she can view the world through them all easily with her all-around vision, allowing her to keep track of numerous situations at once. Her mind can process hundreds of streams of information simultaneously in this way. When an olethros succeeds at her saving throw against a spell or spell-like ability that targets only the olethros, there's a 50% chance that one of these mirrors reflects the effects of the attack back upon the caster as per spell turning.",
			"",
			"**Silkbow (Su)** An olethros's strange bow functions only for the olethros who created it. In her hands, it counts as a +5 longbow. If an olethros's silkbow is destroyed or set aside, it collapses into nonmagical silk; an olethros can create a new silkbow as a standard action. Arrows are created automatically as the olethros fires her silkbow and deal an amount of piercing damage equal to 2d6 + the olethros's Charisma modifier",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Psychopomps embody the natural cycle of birth and death; while most psychopomps are focused mainly on the transition between death and the afterlife, olethroses focus on birth, death, and the fate of those hanging in the balance between them. Olethroses are among the Boneyard's most powerful agents in the mortal world, and they work outside that plane's normal hierarchy, answering to only the psychopomp ushers and the enigmatic goddess of death herself. They move among mortals in disguise, watching the strands of fate interweave and acting to promote their view of fate and stymie those who fight against fate's flow. An olethros might appear in the guise of a wise midwife or a person's former mentor, offering words of wisdom or advice that open up new possibilities.",
			"",
			"Olethroses often see themselves as extraplanar rivals to the fey norns, though stories tell of at least one star-crossed romance between a norn and an olethros. Although inveterate meddlers themselves, olethroses can't abide lipika aeons, disapproving of their manipulation of the cycle of life for some alien sense of karma. Occasionally, a shadow war of manipulation breaks out between an olethros and a lipika that can span lives, families, and even dynasties. Among psychopomps, morrignas look upon olethroses with respect and adulation, while nosois sometimes consider them bossy. Yamarajes respect their independence but sometimes requisition one to serve as an expert witness or an advocate during a particularly difficult judgment. Olethroses never refuse such a requisition, but most chafe at being assigned such tasks more than once in a long while.",
			"",
			"While all psychopomps loathe undead, olethroses only incidentally spar with those abominable exceptions to the cycle. Instead, the focus of their enmity is upon sahkils. Olethroses sometimes use their plane shift ability to hunt their traitorous kin on the Ethereal Plane. While none know for sure precisely why olethroses fixate on sahkils, legends say that one of the first sahkil tormentors to rise was an olethros who went rogue.",
			"",
			"Many psychopomps use manufactured weapons, such as scythes or staves, in their war against those who would endanger the flow of souls to the afterlife, but olethroses use strange weapons that function only for their kind. These are silkbows, ranged weapons built from diaphanous strands of cloth and silk that function as magical longbows.",
			"",
			"While most psychopomps are forged from mortal souls in Purgatory, olethroses are born from other olethroses via rarely occurring immaculate conception. Olethroses claim that new members of their kind are born when a new branch of fate forks off, and the newcomers are destined to study and nurture that branch and the lineages involved. Whatever the case, very few olethroses become pregnant in this way, but those who do grow enormously in power. Olethros mothers range in CR from 20 to 25. A few of the more powerful olethros mothers advance with levels in a spellcasting class (typically cleric), but most of them advance by gaining additional Hit Dice and unique powers over birth, fate, and death. Olethros mothers occasionally use weapons other than their usual bows, either because they have developed the ability to create a different sort of weapon or because they've acquired a particularly powerful weapon and augmented it with their own powers. Such olethros mothers trade away the silkbow and fateful arrows abilities for amazing abilities related to their new weapons.",
			"",
			"Olethros mothers are much more likely to have subsequent daughters than an ordinary olethros is to have a first daughter, so olethros mothers are far less common than other olethroses. Each one develops her own distinct specialty, and in that area of expertise, even yamarajes defer to her; in fact, the most powerful olethros mothers serve as advisors and near peers of even the psychopomp ushers themselves.",
			"",
			"A typical olethros stands only 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds. An olethros mother is much taller; it is not uncommon for such powerful psychopomps to be nearly 8 feet in height and weigh 250 pounds",

Vanths are ancient creatures, perhaps predating the current gods of death, and are rumored to be ascended souls of a distant world of death-worshiping soldiers. They rarely speak or show emotion and their hollow voices carry unnaturally far. A vanth's scythe is a badge of its station, reflecting its role as a harvester of souls. It features symbols in a language that was already lost when the death gods claimed Purgatory.",

			"Equal parts regal and horrifying to mortal sensibilities, yamarajes preside as judges of death and dispensers of ultimate justice. Superstitions of the living call them by many names-the final judges, the grave magistrates, the dragons who eat men's souls-but all agree that these nobles of death wither even the stoutest hearts. The grave magistrates glide with authority throughout Purgatory, commanding flocks of lesser psychopomps, tolerating the ministrations of devils and angels bickering for souls of note, and ordering the endless procession of petitioners. Many also serve as diplomats or military commanders to maintain Purgatory's neutrality, but any such role is secondary to maintaining the flow of souls and the balance of the multiverse. Though in theory each yamaraj answers to the gods of death, in practice each is unquestioned within its own courtroom.",
			"",
			"Yamarajes vaguely resemble black dragons, though they are easily distinguished once one realizes the gigantic creatures are cloaked in feathers rather than scales. Each yamaraj measures at least 30 feet in length and weighs 4 tons. Despite their massive size and largely sedentary duties, yamarajes show astounding grace when they move.",
			"",
			"Impossibly old, yamarajes are outsiders forged from lesser psychopomps or the souls of legendary mortals. As with other outsiders, they need not eat, drink, or sleep to survive, and the grave magistrates normally remain perched upon Purgatory's ruins for months at a time, overseeing the smooth organization of their realm. Hard work wears at their immortal drive, and like living lords, they eagerly indulge in exquisite banquets during their infrequent personal time. These bacchanals make for strange bedfellows among outsiders, as solars and pit fiends may hobnob alongside one another, vying for the attention of a yamaraj to help organize the release of judged souls and attempting to win future favors.",
			"",
			"When called into physical action, all yamarajes can breathe raw decay in the form of clouds of carrion-eating insects, and their venom saps the youth and vitality from living creatures.",
			"",
			"Yamarajes serve as lower judges and lords of Purgatory, directing the activities of other outsiders there, presiding over the dead, pre-sorting souls destined for ultimate judgment by the death gods, and seeing to the efficiency and safety of the plane's infinite inhabitants. As the highest order of psychopomps, they are simultaneously the most dedicated to their role as shepherds of the dead and the most prone to impressing their own opinions on their work in the form of overturning precedents, rambling speeches, and extensive opinions attached to rulings. Such flexibility is necessary when making immortal decisions based on the ever-changing actions of the living, but frustrates more absolute outsiders to no end.",
			"",
			"Unsurprisingly, yamarajes tend to vary greatly from one individual to the next. Most develop deep interests in various worldly subjects that determine the sorts of mortals they ultimately choose to watch over. A given yamaraj might go out of its way to seek out artisans, followers of specific deities, or thieves, depending on its studies or whatever has come to interest it during that eon. Yamarajes might seek to guard such pet souls, ensuring their safe travels through Purgatory, learning more from the souls as they journey together, and ultimately advocating that the death gods grant a more peaceful judgment. Others act in reverse, finding certain sorts of mortals truly disgusting, tormenting their souls through their procession to the goddess's throne, and even suggesting that the spirits should face particularly monstrous damnations. How a yamaraj reacts to an individual thus proves unpredictable, depending on its changeable tastes. Such idiosyncrasies vary between individual yamarajes, and might change over the course of centuries.",
			"",
			"Just as many yamarajes become fascinated with souls possessing specific experiences or from certain backgrounds, some of the psychopomps go out of their way to judge beings from specific worlds, collecting bits of information and insight with every creature that passes them by. Thus, some become experts on one or multiple worlds, having spent eternities ferreting out the histories and secrets of worlds from firsthand accounts over millennia of inquiries. Many yamarajes welcome the opportunity to share the details of their investigations, though they sometimes see inquiries into their worlds of expertise as opportunities to conscript new allies to aid the psychopomps' cause. Standing at the pinnacle of their race, yamarajes are well informed as to the challenges and goals of many subservient psychopomps, and might only negotiate with mortals who perform a service in aid of their underlings.",

A sleek, mottled blue-and-green variant of the giant worm dwells in deep underground lakes or tropical seas (this variant loses its burrow speed but increases its swim speed to 40 feet). A deep crimson variant of even greater size dwells in remote badlands and rocky deserts (this variant is never less than Colossal in size). Other species doubtless remain to be discovered in the far corners of the world."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Putrid oozes are primarily made from organic mire animated with Abyssal energies. These creatures can exist near any rift or portal to the Abyss. They caustically burn through plants and animals in pursuit of their vicious, mindless hunger. Putrid oozes get their name from their disturbing habit of subsuming dead creatures into their own gelatinous bodies. Putrid oozes generally are a combination of churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to chunky tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold undigested portions of the creatures they consume. At any one time, they present a mixture of rotting limbs, severed heads, and entangled entrails among the miscellaneous sludge that makes up their bodies.",
			"",
			"Most hardy materials putrid oozes consume are never completely devoured. Putrid oozes slowly break down their meals into the same gray-black, chunky morass that makes up their bodies. Although it's rare for a putrid ooze to starve, those weakening from hunger use the last of their dwindling energy to seek out chasms or ravines where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander past. In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near. Though the creatures are essentially in hibernation, all it takes is a simple touch to awaken them. In contrast, active putrid oozes are intimidating sights to behold, and rarely take anyone by surprise.",
			"",
			"Unlike other oozes, putrid oozes don't reproduce via mitosis-splitting into two identical, smaller oozes. Instead, they form spontaneously from corrupted rifts to the Abyss. Some cultists of Jubilex, demon lord of ooze monsters, have experimented with generating putrid oozes by exposing slurries of entrails, filth, and acid to foul energies. They see the spontaneous creation of these oozes as manifestations of the Faceless Lord.",
			"",
			"When putrid oozes take enough damage to be destroyed, they melt into an inert pool of muck like most other oozes, though whether putrid oozes eventually reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say that sunlight further breaks down putrid oozes once they are destroyed.",
			"",
			"A putrid ooze typically covers an area that measures 12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a height of no more than 8 feet. A putrid ooze weighs about 20 tons."

In truth, young pyraustas are conceived in the warmest months of the year, when swarms of the creatures gather high in the night skies and perform elaborate courtship rituals with their colorful flames, frolicking playfully in mid-flight. These swarms are often mistaken for fireflies, auroras, or other phenomena. A pyrausta's flame and its heart are one, and its fiery breath changes color depending on the creature's emotions. Pyraustas use their inner flames primarily to express themselves, creating vivid pyrotechnic displays to communicate their feelings. They can also use this flame as a weapon if necessary, but prefer not to.",

			"",
			"### Elder Pyraustas",
			"",
			"Pyraustas who outlive the short life spans their frailty often imposes on them can grow to become far larger and more dangerous than their younger kin. They gain the giant and advanced simple templates, and the range of their breath weapons increases to a 15-foot cone. Elder pyraustas don't usually grow arrogant as their might increases; they instead either offer wisdom to other pyraustas, settling disputes and acting as guardians and mentors to their younger kin, or else travel far and wide, bridging the gaps between disparate pyrausta communities."

			"Pyrogeists are the burning ghosts of arsonists and pyromaniacs who were killed in the fires they started. Whether the pyrogeists' deaths were accidents or suicides, the horribly painful and often humiliating deaths create pyrogeists from the arsonist's or pyromaniac's soul. A pyrogeist is a mass of spectral fire that emits no heat and damages only living creatures. A large face floats upon its surface, resembling a twisted mockery of the person the pyrogeist was when alive. A pyrogeist haunts the area surrounding its remains and is consumed with a desire to immolate others. A pyrogeist most often haunts its victims with terrifying illusions before engulfing them and adding their souls to the creatures' perpetual torment.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The form of a pyrogeist flows and roils, its large face appearing and disappearing along with the faces of the other souls the pyrogeist has consumed. The ghostly inferno changes colors based on the pyrogeist's mood. Most often an angry red and orange, as of flickering flame, the pyrogeist's hues might shift to an envious green, a calm blue, or a haughty violet at a moment's notice. Although a pyrogeist rarely chooses to communicate with the living except when mocking or haunting them, when it chooses to speak, its voice sounds like roaring and crackling flames.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists are obsessed with sharing their torment with the living, but they are too clever and sadistic to simply immolate their foes. Pyrogeists prefer to first drive their victims into paranoia and insanity. When feasible, they first start with minor events that could be explained as accidents or unfortunate events, such as by using [mage hand](spell/mage_hand) to push flammable items near open flames or [ghost sound](spell/ghost_sound) to emulate the crackling of a fire in another room. When the pyrogeist's victim starts to doubt its senses, the pyrogeist inflicts increasingly horrid nightmares that always involve fire. These nightmares usually culminate in people or places the victim loves being set ablaze, often by the victim's own hand. The pyrogeist then uses its [major image](spell/major_image) spell-like ability to bring these nightmares into the waking world, causing its victim to see charred corpses or dancing flames wherever it looks. Eventually, the pyrogeist moves in for the kill, destroying its victim with whirling spectral fire that annihilates flesh and bone but leaves clothing and other items intact. A pyrogeist can make its victim's torment endless by consuming the victim's soul, creating another face that flows across the pyrogeist's churning form. Pyrogeists are reluctant to release souls it has entrapped, usually doing so only as part of a bargain that ensures its ongoing existence or promises additional souls in exchange.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists draw pleasure from burning victims with their ghostly fire, but they are aware that this manner of death leaves distinctive clues for ghost hunters. As the pyrogeist's attacks deal negative energy damage, they cannot harm objects, clothing, or equipment. To cover its tracks, the most devious pyrogeists-especially those that have been destroyed and rejuvenated in the past-ignite normal fires to hide their tracks. Although a pyrogeist might knock over an oil lamp or shove a flaming fireplace log with its [mage hand](spell/mage_hand) spell-like ability, it prefers to have its victims set the blaze on its behalf, perhaps promising an end to their psychic torment in exchange for an act of arson. Identifying a pyrogeist's supernatural burn marks is much more difficult after a mundane fire has swept through a location.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists choose their victims based on their proclivities in life and the circumstances of their death. Some pyrogeists prefer to target victims of certain classes or occupations, or by targeting buildings of specific architectural styles or colors. Pyrogeists that formed from murderous psychopaths often continue gruesome trends in undeath, such as collecting trophies from their victims or leaving certain calling cards at crime scenes. Other pyrogeists spend their time forcing victims to recreate the circumstances of their own deaths.",
			"",
			"Putting a pyrogeist to rest permanently requires burial rites be performed with at least some piece of the pyrogeist's mortal remains. As those remains have usually been reduced to little more than ash and bone fragments, they often go unnoticed among the smoldering wreckage of a destroyed building. A pyrogeist senses when its mortal remains are disturbed and usually moves quickly to prevent anyone from disturbing them.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists most often form in heavily populated cities, where structure fires are more common and the anonymity of crowded streets allow arsonists and pyromaniacs to blend in as they do their wicked work. These pyrogeists have no contact with their former families or friends, but they sometimes seek out their old acquaintances to become their first victims. Pyrogeists can also originate in remote villages or in the wilderness, usually during forest fires or other calamities triggered with malicious intent. Recent rumors place a vengeful pyrogeist along the Jalrune River in southern Taldor. There, a saboteur set fire to a laden merchant vessel belonging to a rival trade prince, only to be trapped within the burning ship. This pyrogeist now haunts passing ships, lairing in the blackened shipwreck that rests at the bottom of the river.",
			"",
			"Pyrogeists are almost always solitary creatures, so consumed by their hunt for souls that they rarely interact with anything else, living or dead. On rare occasions, multiple arsonists die together and merge into a single pyrogeist, sharing a morbid coexistence. These pyrogeists are usually the most erratic, as different personalities vie for control.",
			"",
			"Powerful necromancers sometimes attempt to create or control a pyrogeist, in search of an incorporeal assassin that prevents its targets from being brought back to life. Pyrogeists resent these attempts, making them highly dangerous minions; if the necromancer's control slips enough to allow the pyrogeist any amount of freedom, the incorporeal horror would surely focus its murderous attention on the one that enslaved them."

The stone casing has hardness 8 and 90 hit points. As long as the casing remains intact, the pyropiscis within remains unharmed.

			"Few environments are more inhospitable to life than the depths of a volcano, where magma surges through the rock like blood through veins. Of the creatures that do live in this hellish landscape, few are better adapted than the pyropiscis. Pyropiscises depend on this deadly environment of extreme temperatures and choking gases for their very lives. While they have a fishlike appearance, pyropiscises do not swim-their bodies are far too dense to float in water or similar liquids. Instead, pyropiscises rely on their powerful muscles and sharp scales to burrow through molten rock.",

			"The unique physiology of pyropiscises allows them to derive sustenance directly from molten rock, leaching necessary minerals and volatiles from lava as it passes through their gills. A pyropiscis draws energy directly from the lava in which it dwells, using the intense heat to power its metabolic processes. While pyropiscises don't need to consume the flesh of other creatures to survive, they require nutrients from flesh to grow and to reproduce. A well-fed pyropiscis continues to grow throughout its lifetime and can reach an immense size.",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises typically lurk close to the surface of active volcanoes, and ride eruptions like flowing tides to find prey. They burst forth from rivers of lava to snatch fleeing creatures with their jaws, and consume the charred corpses of those who can't outrun the volcano's fury. Once they have finished feeding, they swim back against the current of lava and into the volcano. Those pyropiscises that linger to gorge themselves, and those too weak to fight the downhill flow, become stranded on land. They then enter hibernation, awaiting the next eruption. A pyropiscis can hibernate for centuries at a time. Eventually, however, a stranded pyropiscis begins to starve, and will break out of its hibernation in search of food.",

			"Pyropiscises reproduce by laying clutches of four to six eggs. They surround their eggs in fiercely guarded nests constructed of iron drawn from the surrounding stone. Newly hatched pyropiscises look like worms made of lava. Their scales are soft, and they lack the protective plating of their adult counterparts.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, pyropiscises venture deep into the hearts of volcanoes that host portals to other planes, and wander through in search of sustenance. The Elemental Plane of Fire is their most common extraplanar hunting ground, but occasionally pyropiscises are found hunting in Hell. Lengthy sojourns into infernal realms sometimes grant pyropiscises fiendish traits.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises are found across Golarion, almost exclusively in areas of intense volcanic activity. They can reach many of the world's active volcanoes by navigating the interconnected series of magma chambers that worm their way through the depths of the earth, ranging from arctic hot springs to volcanic tropical islands.",
			"",
			"These lava-dwelling fish rarely venture far onto the surface, preferring to remain belowground where rock remains molten for hundreds or thousands of years. The natural instability of their homes sometimes turns against pyropiscises, however, and particularly violent eruptions send angry pyropiscises raining down on nearby surface settlements, where they gorge themselves and cause even greater destruction.",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises are social creatures. They live in schools of a dozen or more individuals, typically hunting alone or in smaller packs. They reproduce infrequently, and only ever after a successful hunt. Pyropiscises are intensely protective of all the young in their school regardless of parentage, and take turns guarding them. When a new crop of young reaches maturity, they form a school of their own, venturing to a different part of the same volcano. Even if a pyropiscis's hunts take it to other planes, it always strives to return to the volcano of its birth to spawn. Pyropiscis schools readily adopt stranded wanderers, but while welcoming to their own kind, these fiery beasts are hostile to all other creatures.",
			"",
			"Some fire giants domesticate pyropiscises, overcoming their surly, willful nature through stubbornness. The giants' size and immunity to fire allow groups of them to handle an unruly pyropiscis throughout its training. Still, fire giants must continually placate their pets with charred flesh to prevent them from lashing out. This steady stream of food grows the pyropiscis to an enormous size, and some fire giants have been known to ride giant pyropiscises as mounts into battle. Pyropiscises also serve fire giants as fortress guardians, swimming in moats of magma at the entrances to their tunnels.",
			"",
			"Pyropiscises are a recurring bane to miners and excavators. The rumble and activity of mining efforts can stir hibernating pyropiscises from their slumber, and the newly wakened pyropiscises spare few lives in their search for food and safety. The most unfortunate miners may even break directly into a pyropiscis's cocoon, as a hibernating pyropiscis encased in solid rock is indistinguishable from the surrounding stone. Those with the skill or unfortunate experience to recognize a sleeping pyropiscis for what it is can make a decent profit selling the monster to individuals in search of a guardian or owners of particularly opulent menageries, provided they can chisel the cocoon free and transport it to market without rousing the creature inside."

The egg grows rapidly, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain every day. Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg \"hatches\" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as baleful polymorph with the creature having failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature.

			"",
			"The gongorinans are the spawn of the qlippoth lord Yamasoth, although one could be forgiven for thinking of them less as offspring and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an immense, stocky crab, save that it lacks crabs' aquatic adaptations-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical gongorinan has no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that. Each gongorinan has four arms, and each is a different, highly specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or wielding weapons, while the mantis-like claw is used to shred flesh and create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to snatch and hold victims close for oviposition.",
			"",
			"A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder. Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist (and often have additional and even more dangerous arms), but these are quite rare save for in realms where Yamasoth's influence is strong.",
			"",
			"All gongorinans carry a brood of horrific egg masses, yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind (a process governed by a more traditional and nightmarish method best left undescribed). Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans' lord Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs. The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor that's neither tongue nor toothed, prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the oviposition process leaves the horrid qlippoth open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to a lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed.",
			"",
			"Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location for the duration. Victims are often cocooned in webs while the egg gestates. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't hatch so much as it merge with the host, effecting a horrific and permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can influence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful creatures already found in the region, for these \"young\" are loyal to their parent and serve it as guardians or playthings. Victims retain no portion of their previous personality, but those who have been rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of their time as a monstrosity. Many never quite recover from these ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard their life as a monster as having been their true life, and their true form and life as the curse. The most despondent seek the promise of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing to return to the qlippoth's arms.",
			"",
			"Gongorinans are an industrious breed of qlippoth, and wherever they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes in which to live. These gongorinan \"cities\" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers for their transformed children. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but the Material Plane is no stranger to their hive cities",

For every 4 additional Hit Dice an elder gongorinan has, it gains an additional arm-these additional arms may duplicate an existing claw, sting, pincer, or hand. An elder gongorinan with additional hands can make additional weapon attacks, but these are all treated as offhand attacks. The final CR of an elder gongorinan should be calculated after comparing its statistics to the expected values on Table 1-1 on page 289.",

When a hydraggon wields a two-handed weapon in this manner, it takes a -4 penalty on attacks with the two-handed weapon and a -8 penalty on attacks with its \"off-hand\" weapon.

Treat this as an engulf attack, except that at the start of the iathavos's turn, an engulfed creature must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or be transformed into a nyogoth qlippoth that immediately squirms out of the iathavos's body to serve its new master. Creatures transformed into nyogoths are not controlled by the iathavos, but function and behave as if they were typical members of that species-they retain no memories or abilities they may have possessed in their previous lives. Items held or worn by the unfortunate victim remain lodged within the folds of the iathavos's body and can only be retrieved if the iathavos is helpless or dead. A creature transformed into a nyogoth in this manner can be restored to its true shape via break enchantment, miracle, or wish. Otherwise, slaying the nyogoth allows the poor soul to be restored to life via reincarnation, resurrection, or true resurrection. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Each of these beams of energy can be directed at a single target within 300 feet of the iathavos, but no more than one beam may be directed at any one creature. Beams that are not directed at a creature are wasted. The qlippoth must make a +15 ranged touch attack to hit with each beam. Each beam has the same effect as a CL 20th disintegrate (40d6 damage, DC 32 Fortitude partial for 5d6 damage), except a creature killed by this damage explodes in a 5-foot burst of energy, flesh, shadow, and smoke instead of turning into dust. Any creature in this burst must make a DC 32 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures in reach of these strands of ichor must make a DC 32 Reflex save or become entangled. At the start the iathavos's turn, all creatures entangled by the ichor take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the qlippoth ends its turn with no hit point damage, the ichor melts away into harmless mist, releasing all entangled creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"The most terrible of the qlippoth, with the exception of the qlippoth lords, is doubtless the immense iathavos. Believed by many to be a singular entity, a unique qlippoth so abhorrent that even the Abyss cannot bear to allow more than one to exist at any one time, the iathavos is often encountered attended by numerous nyogoth qlippoth that squirm over its body or under its bulk, feeding upon the wastes and fragments left behind by its shuddersome passing. These nyogoths are invariably other creatures that the iathavos has absorbed and remade-they represent one of the most heinous fates that could await would-be explorers of the deepest Abyssal rifts.",
			"",
			"The iathavos crusades against the demonic scourge, but the monster does not limit its attentions to seeking out and destroying demons in preparation for the return of the Abyss to qlippoth rule. Indeed, the iathavos has the ability to shift among the various planes of the multiverse, and often travels to Material Plane worlds to systematically scour realms clean of mortal life, thus ensuring that these worlds can no longer provide the raw materials-sinful mortal souls-the Abyss relies upon to create new demons. Worlds visited by the iathavos are notable for the widespread devastation and the unusually large populations of nyogoths that remain behind to consume every last speck of decay the iathavos leaves behind.",
			"",
			"The iathavos can be called via the most powerful spells, such as gate, but its immunity to mind-affecting effects and its vast size ensure that only the most desperate or most insane ever attempt such a self-destructive act. In all known cases, the deliberate conjuration of the iathavos to another world has done little more than draw the attention of the powerful creature to that world, so that even if it is banished back to the Abyss before it can cause too much devastation, the iathavos remembers the visit. It often returns under its own power at a later date to pursue its own goals on the newly discovered world. Only if the iathavos is presented with defenders that prevent it from achieving its destructive ruin does it flee back to the Abyss via plane shift-in such cases, the qlippoth often waits for centuries or even millennia before returning to that world, for there are always easier realms to destroy.",
			"",
			"The iathavos is a powerful and horrifying monster made all the more devastating by its incredible intellect. The creature takes care to plan its major assaults on demonic enclaves or mortal cities, even though it is powerful enough that few creatures in the multiverse can give it pause.",
			"",
			"When the iathavos is slain, the multiverse typically has only a relatively short time before the Abyss births a replacement monstrosity for the defeated qlippoth. This newly born iathavos is an entirely new creature-it does not share the memories of the previous incarnation, nor does it possess any advanced hit dice or class levels the previous monster may have gained, yet its appetite and hatred for demonic life and the sins that create such life remain constant and unending.",
			"",
			"To call such an iathavos a \"newborn\" is somewhat misleading. Although technically a freshly created creature, newborn iathavoses do not undergo a \"childhood.\" They form fully grown, as presented here. Yet with each new incarnation of the qlippoth monstrosity, changes can occur. A new iathavos might have slightly different spell-like abilities, for example, or the nature of its horrific appearance might change from that presented here. As an iathavos continues to hunt and destroy, it grows more powerful-an advanced iathavos typically gains more racial Hit Dice as a result. An iathavos that gains power by taking class levels is not unheard of, but it is quite rare-most who do take levels in sorcerer.",

The exception to this is when they accumulate in vast numbers near planar scars and rifts on the Material Plane where the god left some fleck of his terrible carapace or dripped vile and blasphemous liquid from his wounds.

			"The Abyssal realm of Sekatar-Seraktis is a byword for chaos, contested by 13 different potential rulers split between bickering balor lords, [vavakias](unknown/vavakias), and [vrolikais](unknown/vrolikais), yet all leave the portion of the plane claimed by the qlippoth lord [Yamasoth](faith/yamasoth) alone. The Kingdom of New Flesh is populated by the unholy experiments of the qlippoth lord, ravenous monstrosities who feed upon one another and any other beings so foolish or unlucky as to wind up in this accursed place. Some of the most fecund of these experiments are called vexenions, and they have proliferated across the Abyss. These abominations have the appearance of enormous bloated, pulsating tumors, mouthless, armed with muscular tentacles sprouting from their glistening form and gifted with bulging eyes capable of protruding from their bodies and just as quickly disappearing into their shuddering wet flesh.",
			"",
			"A vexenion feeds on flesh by physically absorbing creatures into its own amorphous form through its membranous skin. The ingested creature is slowly dissolved by the qlippoth's acid. Once the flesh is consumed, the victim's bones and other indigestible parts are expelled, and the vexenion moves on to its next meal, forever hunting, forever hungry.",
			"",
			"Vexenions often serve as shock troops in qlippoth armies, sent in the vanguard of attacks to break the formations of an advancing force, grappling and absorbing enemy soldiers in their path. While it is believed that Yamasoth employs these sickening things to gather material for its own endless experiments, the qlippoth lord seems to care little where the vexenions travel. For this reason, the creatures proliferate like a plague across the Abyss. Perhaps this is Yamasoth's ultimate intent.",
			"",
			"Vexenions are at home in nearly any environment where they can find flesh on which to feast, though they often lair in places where they might easily ambush prey: demonic crossroads, ruins, and blasted forests where they can use the high limbs and trunks of dead trees to ambulate above their unknowing prey. In fact, this is the qlippoth's preferred method of stalking potential meals: suspended above, employing their impressive climbing skills to move from tree to tree. Caverns of stalactites or the pillars of ruined demon cities can serve the same purpose for them.",
			"",
			"Despite their hideous, almost ooze-like appearance, vexenions are intelligent creatures. They lack the apparatus for speech but delight in telepathically sharing their hungers and the flavors of their food with others around them, impassively inquiring about their victim's favored flavors and meals. The vexenion's unsettling habit of sharing the flavors of a creature it feeds upon with that creature as it digests them is perhaps the qlippoth's most sadistic trait.",
			"",
			"Temples of Yamasoth and other places where his otherworldly and malign presence has infected the world, such as the deeper levels of Hollow Mountain, are no stranger to the predations of the vexenion. Dungeon complexes are well loved by these qlippoth, and despite their prodigious size, their malleable bodies allow them to slither and squirt and force themselves through narrow confines-provided their bodies are not currently engorged upon a still-solid and still-struggling meal.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Qlippoth](monster/family/qlippoth)",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Vexenions reproduce asexually. When one has consumed sufficient quantities of flesh, it finds a hiding place and goes into a kind of senseless larval state, its eyes and tentacles retreating into itself. The exterior flesh of the thing quickly hardens into a stony shell; in this form, they are difficult to discern from surrounding rocks. After 24 hours, two fully grown vexenion burst forth from the shell, each of which retains the memories of the original. While gestating in this shell, the vexenion stews in a rancid-smelling slurry of amniotic fluid that has strange effects on potions, elixirs, and similar magic items if used as an additional component when creating the magical liquid (merely mixing the fluid with an already created potion or elixir ruins the magic drink). A character can harvest a gestating vexenion's fluids with a successful DC 21 Survival check, after which the fluid must be refined in an alchemical lab over the course of 8 hours with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A single vexenion can supply a single dose of fluid in this manner. Used as an additional resource during potion or elixir creation, the fluid has a 50% chance of causing the resulting potion or elixir to function at a caster level 2 higher than normal, and a 50% chance of instead causing the potion or elixir to function normally but to nauseate the drinker for 1 round after it is imbibed. A single dose of vexenion catalyst, as the prepared fluid is known, is worth 1,000 gp.",
			"",
			"Vexenions are often confused with [nyogoths](unknown/nyogoths), in whose company they are sometimes found. However, vexenions are more intelligent and better able to set up ambushes and traps for unsuspecting prey. Fortunately for nyogoths, they are among the only creatures in the Great Beyond that vexenions find unpalatable."

			"Few creatures can match the speed of a quickling. These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, often killing their victims without ever fully revealing themselves; the victim simply spurts blood and falls over dead, with no witnesses to the quickling's deed. Though related to brownies and grigs, quicklings share none of their kin's generosity or merriment, choosing instead to live a life of cruelty and viciousness. Quicklings pride themselves on insults and brutality, and frequently stalk and harass their quarry until the victim gives up the chase. While quicklings are naturally invisible when motionless, they rarely contain themselves, and bob and twitch while standing and talking to other creatures. Quicklings hate every other race of creature, particularly elves, gnomes, and other kinds of fey. They barely tolerate their own kind, and rarely work together for longer than a few weeks.",
