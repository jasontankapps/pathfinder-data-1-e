			"The following sections re-create monsters found in the Bestiary. Many of them are variants on the initial creatures, meant to mimic creatures with class levels or alternate ability sets. Each entry includes a breakdown of the significant choices made for the monster, discounting simple procedures such as selecting the attacks and damage for a monster that don't deviate from its array numbers. After each breakdown, the monster's statistics appear in a new format unique to this book, as described in the sidebar above. The monsters are presented in order from simplest to most complex. Some of the monsters that appear early on-particularly combatants-have a high CR but simple abilities, so they're still easy to create.",

It removes the listings of any monster options or abilities that only increase existing values. For example, the extra armor option wouldn't be listed because the new AC values are already implemented.",
			"",
			"In addition, each statistic block is divided into defenses, attacks, and statistics, with options and spells that fit into those categories appearing in the appropriate section. For example, instead of all a monster's spells appearing in one list, its offensive spells appear under attacks, and its defensive spells appear under defenses.",

Dodge expert changes the imp's AC from 14 (touch 12, flat-footed 12) to 16 (touch 16, flat-footed 10). By the numbers, the imp's flat-footed AC would drop to 6, but the GM sets it as 10 as part of the reality checking process. For its poison, the imp gets two advantages, which were used to remove the onset time and change the frequency to 1/round for 6 rounds.

			"To use simplified spellcasting, find the appropriate progression table for your class (or the table for a class that normally has the same spell progression as your class) and consult the row for your caster level. The 3 highest spell levels in the row each have a listed number indicating spells per day. Prepare these spells each day as you normally would; you still gain bonus spells per day for those levels if you have a high enough ability score. The letter -P- appears in the columns of all other available spell levels (except level 0) to indicate lower-level spells that are cast using your class's spell pool.",
			"",
			"Each day, you can spontaneously cast a number of lower-level spells from your class's spell list equal to the number listed for your class level in the Pool column of the table. The level of spell doesn't matter (as long as it's one of the levels that uses your pool), so if you could cast five spells from your pool per day, it wouldn't matter if you cast five 1stlevel spells, five 2nd-level spells, or a mix of the two. A spell cast using slots from your spell pool must still be on your spell list or in your spellbook, just as it would need to be if you were preparing the spell. It also must meet any other restrictions imposed by your class or other abilities, such as restrictions on casting spells of an opposing alignment. The slots in your spell pool refresh after 8 hours of rest, and any effect that prevents you from preparing spells also prevents you from refreshing your spell pool. Your pool increases if you have a high spellcasting ability modifier, similar to how you gain bonus spells in slots you prepare. Add a number of spells to your pool equal to 1/4 the ability score modifier of the ability score you would normally use to calculate your number of bonus spells per day.",

			"If your class grants bonus spells that are selected from an extremely limited number of options (such as domain spells, spirit spells, or similar bonus spells), you gain those spells separately from your pool. If your class grants bonus spells from a somewhat limited list (such as wizards' specialty school spells), when you gain a pool, you gain one additional slot in your spell pool each day that can be used only to cast spells of that type, and at 13th level you gain a second additional slot with the same restriction.",

For instance, if the 13th-level necromancer in the example above has conjuration as an opposition school, he could expend two slots from his spell pool to cast [summon monster II](spell/summon_monster_2).",

Any bonuses that would normally make the spell more difficult to avoid (such as the Spell Focus feat) also apply. The DC of this roll is equal to 11 + the target's relevant save bonus. If the caster succeeds, treat the spell or effect as if the target had failed its save. Otherwise, treat it as if the target succeeded at its save.

Since the orc's Will save modifier is -1, he has to roll a 16 to succeed, and thus will fail his save 80% of the time. Under the spell attack roll rules, rather than the orc attempting a Will save, the wizard makes a spell attack roll with a +5 bonus (the spell's DC of 15 - 10) against a DC of 10 (11 + the orc's -1 Will save modifier). The wizard has to roll at least a 5 to succeed, so he still affects his target 80% of the time.",

			"While magic deals with complex formulae, precise manipulation of components, and intense concentration, martial acumen often relies on seizing opportunities and pushing the body and the will to carve a path to victory on the battlefield. Those who make their way in the world by skill at arms know that the determination to test the limits of endurance often separates the living from the dead and the vanquished from the victorious.",
			"",
			"Stamina and combat tricks can help characters better reflect this opportunistic flexibility and the give-and-take of the battlefield. This system allows a character to draw upon an internal reservoir of will and gumption to overturn the assumed limitations of combat, at least for short bursts. With luck and proper timing, a martial character using this system can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat or put a despicable villain to a stunning end.",
			"",
			"There are several ways you can implement this system in your game.",
			"",
			"**Feat Access:** The easiest way to introduce stamina and combat tricks into your game is to grant access to the [Combat Stamina](feat/combat_stamina) feat, detailed below. This allows those taking the feat to opt into the system, gain a stamina pool, and use stamina to increase the utility of combat feats and class features they already have or will gain in the future. In general, the [Combat Stamina](feat/combat_stamina) feat is quite strong for martial characters with a variety of combat feats.",
			"",
			"**Free for Fighters:** If your goal is to provide an additional edge to the [fighter class](class/fighter), you can allow fighters to gain the Combat Stamina feat as an additional bonus feat at 1st level.",
			"",
			"**Fighter Bonus Feats Only:** If you want to significantly strengthen fighters compared to all other classes and keep this system as a special fighter-only perk, you can restrict the [Combat Stamina](feat/combat_stamina) feat to fighters and limit the feats a character can use with his stamina pool to those gained with the fighter's bonus feats. A multiclass fighter can't use stamina with bonus feats he gained from any other class, even if that class can take fighter-only feats as bonus feats (like the [warpriest](class/warpriest) and the [swashbuckler](class/swashbuckler)). In this version, if a character really wants the stamina ability of a few key feats, he will need to diversify his martial training by taking a level in fighter.",
			"",
			"**Free for Everyone:** If your goal is to immediately boost all martial characters and the whole group is ready to handle the stamina and combat tricks system, you can grant [Combat Stamina](feat/combat_stamina) as an additional bonus feat for all martial characters, or even for all characters."

			"When you have an ability that grants you stamina points, you gain a stamina pool with a maximum number of stamina points equal to your base attack bonus + your Constitution modifier. During combat, you can spend stamina points from this pool to perform a combat trick, the specific effects of which are dictated by a combat feat you possess. Spending stamina points in this way is not an action, but you can't do so if you are unconscious, fatigued, or exhausted. You can use as many combat tricks on the same action or attack as you like (as long as you have the stamina points to spend), but you can't use the same combat trick twice within its scope. For instance, if you have a combat trick that affects a single attack, you can't use that combat trick more than once on the same attack.",

However, permanent increases to Constitution, such as the bonus granted by a [belt of mighty constitution](magic-wondrous/belt_of_mighty_constitution_2) worn for more than 24 hours, do adjust your stamina points.",

			"You regain stamina points by resting for short periods of time. You don't have to sleep while resting in this way, but you can't exert yourself. You stop regaining stamina points if you enter combat; take an action that requires a Strength-, Dexterity-, or Constitution-based skill check or an ability check tied to one of those ability scores; or take more than one move action or standard action in a round (you can still take free, immediate, and swift actions). This reduction in your number of actions per round also effectively halves your overland speed. For each uninterrupted minute you rest in this way, you regain 1 stamina point. If you are suffering from any of the following conditions, you can't regain stamina points: confused, cowering, dazed, dead, disabled, exhausted, fascinated, frightened, helpless, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, petrified, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned."

			"Under the core rules, multiclassing can lead to a wide disparity in character ability. With this system, each character can choose a secondary class at 1st level that she trains in throughout her career, without giving up levels in her primary class. Once selected, this choice is permanent (though if using the [retraining rules](unknown/retraining_rules), the secondary class can be retrained by paying half the cost of retraining all her class levels). A character who selects this option doesn't gain feats at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, but instead gains class features from her secondary class as described on Table 2-8: Multiclass Character Advancement.

			"In a standard Pathfinder game, when a dragon with 800 hit points has taken 798 points of damage, it's still fighting at full capacity, but as soon as it has taken 801 points of damage, it's knocked completely unconscious. Though this ensures that injured characters remain useful and effective, it can feel unrealistic, and it devalues any healing that doesn't strictly prevent a knockout. Consider using the following variant to add tension and increase the strategic value of healing, but be aware that it can lead to situations that punish the side that's already behind, and that the pace of fights could drag in the late stages as two injured parties slug it out.

			"The piecemeal armor system splits up armor into three general types of armor pieces. An armor piece is a small group of armor parts, rather than simply being any discrete part of the armor. A single armor piece comprises the armor parts one needs to protect its corresponding area-either the arms, the legs, or the torso (including the head); a single arm or leg armor piece provides armor for both arms or both legs, respectively. A plate arm armor piece typically consists of pairs of pauldrons, gardbraces, rerebraces, vambraces, and gauntlets along with bits of chainmail and padded armor, while a chain lamellar arm armor piece consists of two chain sleeves, gauntlets, and perhaps pairs of pauldrons and couters. Both protect the arms, though they have a different number of specific parts and types of overall components.",
			"",
			"The protective qualities of each individual piece of armor are listed in Table 5-7: Arm Armor Pieces, Table 5-8: Leg Armor Pieces, and Table 5-9: Torso Armor Pieces. If a character has only one armor piece, that piece is considered the totality of her armor, and she uses the statistics of that piece as her armor. If a character is wearing more than one armor piece, she add the armor costs, armor bonuses, and weights of the armor pieces, and takes the worst maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and speed limitations from among the various armor pieces to determine the full statistics and qualities of the armor she is wearing. As long as she is wearing a single armor piece, she is considered to be wearing armor for any effects that rely on wearing armor (such as the fighter class's armor training and armor mastery).",
			"",
			"If a character is wearing all three categories of armor pieces, she is wearing a suit of armor. Suits of armor can have all armor pieces of the same type (all three plate pieces make a suit of full plate), or a mixture of armor pieces (a plate arm armor piece and torso armor piece combined with a chainmail leg armor piece creates a suit of half-plate).",
			"",
			"Wearing an entire suit, whether its pieces are mixed or the same type, grants a +1 armor bonus on top of the protection the combination of pieces already grants the wearer. Wearing a mixed suit of armor increases the arcane spell failure chance by 5% because of the awkwardness of the design. Wearing less than a full suit of mixed armor does not increase the wearer's arcane spell failure chance. For example, if you wear a breastplate with a plate arm armor piece and a chain leg armor piece, you should consult Table 5-5: Half-Plate Suit Pieces for your armor's statistics. The top line lists the cost, bonuses, penalties, and so on for the half-plate suit as a whole, and the lines below list the statistics for the component pieces, as well as the benefits that result from the pieces constituting a suit.",

			"The most efficient way to create masterwork armor or to enchant magical armor is to create or enchant the same suit. In order to do this, the suit's pieces need not all be of the same type, but they must be constructed and then enchanted together. The drawback is that none of the individual pieces are considered masterwork or magical on their own (though if magic, they do detect as magic, and can be identified as part of an armor suit).

Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. Relics occupy a space somewhere between normal magic items and artifacts. Unlike most magic items, relics can't be crafted. Unlike artifacts, however, they can be destroyed normally. Eventually, these extra-powerful items are misplaced, forgotten, or ignored, and their power wanes as a result-though it is not entirely lost.",

			"As she adventures, the wielder of a relic might achieve great deeds, called triumphs, tied to the item's associated cause, which she can apply to the relic to increase its power. Each volume of the War for the Crown Adventure Path indicates which deeds qualify as a triumph for the relics of old Taldor. Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",
			"",
			"An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding [Koriana's Blade](magic-relic/koriana's_blade), the sword wouldn't gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs' third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a [bag of holding](magic-wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1), for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",
			"",
			"**Increasing DCs:** Some effects have DCs that increase as the relic attains more triumphs; these are indicated by a note such as \"DC = 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained.\" An effect with such a DC counts neither the triumph that the effect came from nor any previous triumphs. For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",
			"",
			"**Fading Glory:** When the PCs discover a relic, the power of the item has faded significantly since it has gone many years without being used for its cause. In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there. This can vary by item and is ultimately determined by the GM, but a good benchmark is one triumph entry lost per 1d4 years."

A triumph should always be linked to the achievement of a major goal within the campaign's storyline. Include less frequent triumph events if the PCs are highly likely to succeed at all of them. If there's a high chance the PCs will fail to achieve a particular triumph, you might include another triumph event fairly soon after. You can always alter future triumph events if items are looking like they'll outpace the rate of one triumph every 2 levels.

In general, PCs should not gain access to a relic until their character level is at most 2 levels lower than the lowest-level ability of the scaling item on which that relic is based.",

			"**Counterspelling Wordspells:** If a wordcaster is attempting to counter another wordspell, she can make a Spellcraft skill check as normal to identify the wordspell as it is being cast and then cast an identical wordspell to counter it. This means that the opposing wordcaster must know all of the effect words of the wordspell and either have an identical wordspell prepared or have an available spell slot of an equal or higher level. If the wordspell contains multiple effect words, but the opposing caster only knows one of the words (or only has a wordspell with one of the effect words prepared), that caster can still attempt to counter the wordspell, but this functions as if using [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) and does not come with the guarantee of success. The opposing caster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell. She must still expend a spell of the same or higher level containing at least one word of the wordspell to be countered.",
			"",
			"If a wordcaster is attempting to counter the spell of a normal spellcaster, she must make a Spellcraft skill check to identify the school of the spell being cast. She can then counter that spell using any wordspell so long as it is of an equal or higher level than the spell being cast and contains at least one effect word of the same school as the spell. This works like a [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) counterspell attempt, and the wordcaster must make a dispel check to counter the spell. If a spellcaster attempts to counter a wordspell, she must use a spell of an equal or higher level that is of the same school as one or more of the effect words in the wordspell being cast. This too works like a dispel magic counterspell attempt, and the spellcaster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell.",
			"",
			"**Wordspell Schools:** If a wordspell has more than one effect word, it can belong to more than one school, although it never benefits from effects based on school (such as Spell Focus) more than once. It can take penalties based on school more than once; for example, if a target has a bonus on saving throws against necromancy and illusion spells, that character would add both bonuses on the saving throw if the wordspell is of both schools.",
			"",
			"**Wordspell Saving Throws:** The type of saving throw for a wordspell is determined by the highest-level effect word used that allows a saving throw. If the save is successful, it applies to both effect words, but the result for each word can vary based on the individual word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words. The save DC is equal to 10 + the wordspell's level (not the effect word's level) + the wordcaster's spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, and rangers; and Charisma for bards, paladins, and sorcerers). For example, if a 5th-level wordspell contains a 2nd-level effect word that allows a Reflex save for half and a 4th-level effect word that allows a Will save to negate, targets of the wordspell make a Will save with a DC of 15 + the caster's ability score modifier. If the save is successful, the target takes half the normal effect from the 2nd-level word and negates the 4th-level word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words.",
			"",
			"**Wordspells and Spell Resistance:** If the wordspell uses more than one effect word, and any of those words allow spell resistance, the resistance applies to all of the effect words of the wordspell. A wordspell only ignores spell resistance if all effect words ignore spell resistance.",
			"",
			"**Multiple Effect Words and Damage:** If more than one effect word causes the wordspell to deal damage, the total number of dice of damage the wordspell can deal can be no greater than the wordspell's caster level. The caster can decide which dice belong to which effect word, in any combination, so long as the total number does not exceed his wordcaster level and the number of dice allocated to a specific effect word does not exceed its maximum.",

The wordspell also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen by the wordcaster). Finally, the wordspell grants an additional +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against death spells and death magic effects; the subject cannot gain negative levels while this wordspell is in effect, and the target is automatically stabilized if brought below 0 hit points.

			"Words of power represent a primal form of magic used in ages past. As such, use of the words of power system is rare these days, and its practitioners tend to be masters of esoteric lore. Words of power constitute a root system, from which all modern magic descends. Although powerful, this system is more primitive in some ways than modern magic. Flexible, but lacking the refinement of modern spells, this system allows spellcasters to shape magic in ways they never could before, while simultaneously preventing them from producing the same sort of incredibly specific effects that ordinary spellcasters master. It is not surprising that most magical institutions and centers for learning treat words of power as an archaic art, to be studied along with other historical matters, but not actually practiced. Those who delve into the lore of words of power often find themselves lost in an ancient art that they alone might now know. There is power there, but each wordcaster must find it alone."

Each loss of hit points, in this case, suggests that he is becoming progressively less nimble over the course of combat-in other words, that the decreasing hit points are a marker for his overall endurance and condition.

Healing Spells and Effects: When casting healing spells or using an ability with a healing effect (such as channeling holy energy on living creatures or the paladin's lay on hands ability), the creature casting the spell or using the effect must choose whether it wants to heal wound points or vigor points. The creature decides this before casting the spell or using the ability.

			"\"Hunger\" is perhaps a misleading term to describe a vampire's lust for flesh, consciousness, or youth. As unliving things, they technically require no sustenance, and yet ravenousness is often considered a key characteristic of those who walk without life. In truth, this desire is driven not by need, but by psychological greed. Feasting grants the undead no physical nourishment, but does fill them with a pleasure and power they can't attain by any other means. For undead, the act of feeding can be likened to that of an addict satiating her inner demon.",

If denied living nectar for too long, however, even the sharpest creatures hurl themselves at whichever warm, soft parts of the living they most covet.",
			"",
			"This section presents optional rules for the hunger of undead creatures. Consult your GM if you want to use these rules in your game, since the added element of feeding can have a drastic effect on vampire-focused campaigns, especially for players running vampire PCs."

A vampire who refuses to feed on intelligent beings is relegated to the dull taste of animal blood out of necessity, and forsakes the euphoria of a true feed.",

This is especially true of spawn still under the control of their creator, who often view their hunger as just another restriction on their freedom.",
			"",
			"Other vampires are so frustrated by their immortal addiction that they dedicate their lives to the search for a cure for their affliction-or at least a substitute for feeding. This is more common for mortals unwillingly turned into vampires and those who truly understanding the ongoing implications of their transformation. Those nosferatu who have sufficient intellect are among the most likely to seek such a cure, and many feed with guilt.",

To mortals, this revulsion-filled consumption is indistinguishable from savage bloodlust. Instead of pity and understanding, these vampires are greeted like any other of their kind-with stakes and torches and holy rage."

If the undead creature fails its save, it enters withdrawal and begins to take penalties according to the [Withdrawal Penalties table](rule/withdrawal_effects).

Feats and abilities that affect mortal hunger (such as Endurance or a rin13 of sustenance) do not apply to vampire hunger.",

			"What constitutes a feeding differs for each undead creature according to its own addiction. For creatures with a blood drain, level drain, or ability drain ability, each use of that ability counts as a feeding. Hungering creatures that lack a drain ability, such as zombies and ghouls, count consuming 1 pound of flesh as feeding (larger and smaller undead require proportionately more or less flesh). For these creatures, the flesh of a creature that has been dead for more than 1 hour staves off withdrawal but does not grant any other benefits, such as feeding bonuses (see below).",
