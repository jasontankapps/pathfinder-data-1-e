			"Typically, player characters find themselves buying and selling magic items as they gain levels to keep up with the increasing threats they face. Items come and go from each character's inventory with such frequency that they hardly have the chance to impact the game's story. Scaling items, however, increase in power along with the characters who carry them, allowing an old and cherished item to develop and retain its utility rather than being sold and forgotten.",
			"",
			"Scaling items work like normal magic items, but they gain new powers as their wielders gain levels, and their existing powers sometimes also improve. Additional item powers appear in a scaling magic item's entry with a header indicating the character level at which they unlock.",
			"",
			"The caster level of the item scales up as well. A scaling item's effective caster level is its listed caster level or the character level of its wielder, whichever is higher, to a maximum of the item's highest-level ability. For instance, if an item has a base caster level of 5th and additional abilities at 7th and 9th levels, it's treated as caster level 8th in the hands of an 8th-level character, but is treated as only caster level 9th in the hands of a 10th-level character.",
			"",
			"Each scaling item has a base price that represents its value to a character whose level is equal to or less than the item's caster level. As the item's caster level increases in the hands of a more powerful character, the item's value increases as well. The values of such items fall into three categories (baubles, prizes, and wonders), which indicate the rough percentage of the character's wealth a scaling item represents.",
			"",
			"The weakest items, baubles, represent 5% of a PC's [character wealth at her level](rule/placing_treasure) and can be compared to consumable magic items (even though baubles aren't destroyed by use). Items in the middle category, prizes, represent 15% of a PC's suggested wealth and correspond to magic items of moderate power. An item of the most valuable category, wonders, represents 30% of a PC's suggested wealth and corresponds to a major magic item, such as a fighter's most beloved and powerful sword. Wonders exceed the normal cost assumptions of the game at their highest level. Such items approach the power of minor artifacts, though they're not indestructible and can still be created normally."

			"***Per Character:*** If you apply the scaling item treasure reduction for each character, do so after dividing up shares of treasure for the characters. Reduce the treasure received by a character with a scaling item by the percentage listed for the item's category (5% for baubles, 15% for prizes, and 30% for wonders).

Since the value of a scaling item is based on wealth for an entire level, apply this adjustment to every treasure allotment the character receives. If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items. This might be magical residue, vibrant crystals, or spellbook-style pages of magical phrases that increase the item's power. In any case, this substance should be treated as almost worthless to sell, and therefore useful only for upgrading scaling items.",

			"***Group Basis:*** You can use the scaling items of the whole party to adjust treasure. This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters. For example, if a group of four PCs have between them one bauble, three prizes, and a wonder, their treasure is reduced by 20% (80% divided by 4)."

			"To determine the price when creating a new scaling item, determine the cost of the base item without any of the level-based upgrades, and increase that price based on each additional ability as described below.",
			"",
			"***Pricing the Base Item:*** First, decide whether the new item is a wonder (best for major items), a prize (best for utility items), or a bauble (suitable for items that are interesting but not significant). Price the base item according to the [normal rules for creating magic items](rule/magic_item_creation). Then, using the column on [Table 4-13](rule/adjusting_treasure) that corresponds to the item's category, find the lowest gp value that includes that initial price. Use that value to determine the item's starting caster level.",
			"",
			"***Adding Scaling Abilities:*** Use the following steps to assign additional abilities and spells, and the levels at which those abilities unlock.",
			"",
			"***Adding Unlockable Abilities:*** Determine the first unlockable ability or increase in power. Price the item again, using the new ability plus all the abilities of the base item; you will use this price to determine the level at which the ability unlocks (see below). However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) so well.",
			"",
			"***Adding Spells:*** Assign a price for any spells the item allows its owner to use. Table 4-14: Spell Prices includes the typical prices of one daily use of spells at different caster levels. Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does [fireball](spell/fireball)), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for [fireball](spell/fireball). Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.",
			"",
			"Remember to readjust the price at each further power unlock level, since the caster level of the item will match the owner's level. On a worn item, waive the standard 50% price increase on the additional spells.",
			"",
			"***Assigning an Unlock Level:*** Now that you have a cost for the next scaling ability, assign a level at which that ability unlocks. This follows the same process as the Pricing the Base Item step, but using the new cost. You should usually round down, but if you're almost at the higher-level price, bump up the level. For example, a prize that priced out at 8,000 gp at a given set of powers would unlock those powers at 9th level (6,900 gp), but if the price hits 9,000 gp, the abilities should instead unlock at 10th level (9,300 gp).",

Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook.

Its wearer gains the constant effects of [endure elements](spell/endure_elements) against cold conditions only.",

			"***7th Level:*** As a standard action, the wearer can launch an icicle at a foe within 30 feet as a ranged attack. On a hit, the icicle deals 1d6 points of piercing damage and 1d6 points of cold damage. In addition, the wearer can walk across icy ground without slipping.",
			"",
			"***10th Level:*** As part of her move action, the wearer can step into the air, creating crystalline stairs beneath her feat, adding new steps in whichever direction she travels.

			"***18th Level:*** When the wearer calls forth a tower of ice, if there is enough open space, she can choose to call forth a small palace instead, 100 feet square at the base with 20-foot-high rooms, with a central tower 20 feet square and 100 feet high. At will, she can spend 5 rounds to transform into a flurry of snowflakes that can move at incredible speed. Treat this as [wind walk](spell/wind_walk) except she gains vulnerability to fire. It normally takes 5 rounds to transform back into her normal shape. However, she can revert to her original form early as a standard action. If she does so, she cannot transform into snowflakes again for 24 hours. When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can choose to summon 1d4+1 Medium ice elementals, 1d3 Large ice elementals, or one [Huge ice elemental](monster/huge_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VI](spell/summon_monster_6).",

When she uses the tiara to summon ice elementals, she can also choose to summon 1d4+1 Huge ice elementals, 1d3 [greater ice elementals](monster/greater_ice_elemental), or one [elder ice elemental](monster/elder_ice_elemental) as [summon monster VIII](spell/summon_monster_8). She can create ice stairs without a daily limit, and if she wishes, they last for 1 minute before melting, even if another creature tries to climb them. If she chooses to make them last longer, she can dismiss the stairs behind her as a swift action, potentially causing creatures climbing the stairs to fall.",

Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",

			"An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding [Koriana's Blade](magic-relic/koriana's_blade), the sword wouldn't gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs' third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a [bag of holding](magic-wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1), for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",

For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",

			"***Fading Glory:*** When the PCs discover a relic, the power of the item has faded significantly since it has gone many years without being used for its cause. In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there. This can vary by item and is ultimately determined by the GM, but a good benchmark is one triumph entry lost per 1d4 years."

			"The most conventional way to rid a victim of a curse is the spell [remove curse](spell/remove_curse), occasionally with the aid of other or more powerful magic. When making a new curse, especially one with a strong story background, consider novel ways to remove the curse beyond just casting a spell, as with the spell [conditional curse](spell/conditional_curse). Robbers might be cursed until they return every ill-gotten coin, while a haughty aristocrat might suffer until she cleans the feet of a dozen beggars. In these cases, it's best to make the victim vaguely aware of how to end his torment, but let him discover the specific details on his own through either research or trial and error. Curses with story-based remedies are often hard to break with [remove curse](spell/remove_curse) and [break enchantment](spell/break_enchantment). Increase the DC for removal by 2, 5, or even 10 based on the power of the curse. Particularly powerful curses resist [remove curse](spell/remove_curse) and [break enchantment](spell/break_enchantment) entirely, requiring either specific conditions for removal or the application of [limited wish](spell/limited_wish), [miracle](spell/miracle), or [wish](spell/wish).",
			"",
			"Some curses are easier to remove than normal; improvised curses, because of their impromptu nature, tend to be easier to remove. A simple cleansing ritual might suffice to remove them, which the PCs could discover through exploration, research, or a successful Knowledge (religion) check. Such curses could even fade over the course of days or weeks. While many NPC casters offer curse removal with no questions asked, it is common knowledge that curses are rarely picked up accidentally. Some of these casters might want to know the circumstances behind the curse (often employing Sense Motive or even divination magic during the discussion). Good-aligned churches might expect acts of atonement or charity as at least partial payment for removing a justly gained curse."

			"***Death:*** Some curses end upon the death of the victim, perhaps leading a victim to take her own life in the hope of being raised from the dead free of the curse. Although some find release this way, others are sorely disappointed; some gods may not smile upon such wanton suicide-or the victims might be restored to life, only to find themselves still afflicted by the curse.",

Undoing the misdeed and additionally offering a comparable effort to make up for the trouble caused might allow a new saving throw against the curse to remove it. Forgiveness from the curse-layer grants a +4 bonus on this saving throw. For curses that require amends, [remove curse](spell/remove_curse) generally fails unless and until such amends are made.",
			"",
			"***Symbiosis:*** On rare occasions, a character might allow the curse to infect her very being as a desperate attempt to mitigate the effects, hoping that this will give her some measure of control. Symbiosis with a curse is rarely successful, and it usually leads to contracting an [accursed corruption](corruption/accursed), as the curse takes over the creature's personality. In rare cases, curse symbiosis might transform the accursed into a monster associated with curses (such as a hag) without first going through an accursed corruption."

			"***Opposite Effect on Target:*** These items are rarely appropriate for a character to intentionally craft, as they might lead to weird situations where a reverse attack or a dispelling of certain spells is actually beneficial when used on allies, or vice versa. For effects where the opposite is not a new effect (such as [inflict light wounds](spell/inflict_light_wounds) instead of [cure light wounds](spell/cure_light_wounds)), the crafter might as well just craft the opposite item to begin with unless she plans on tricking the owner of the item.",

A stained item functions as normal for a cursed item of its type except that the DCs of checks for remove curse or similar magic to suppress or remove the item's curse from any creature responsible for the curse-layer's death increases by 5.",

They can also be artificially created with spells, such as [curse of night](spell/curse_of_night), [curse of fell seasons](spell/curse_of_fell_seasons), and the [curse terrain](spell/curse_terrain) spells. A regional curse has an area in addition to the features all curses have. All regional curses have a DC for the purpose of removing the curse, but many of their effects allow no saving throw.

The cursed lord gains power over the realm, but is incapable of leaving unless the curse is somehow broken, which usually involves killing or redeeming the cursed lord. Characters can accomplish this only by enacting very specific circumstances, similar to the restrictions placed upon the destruction of artifacts. For example, a cursed realm might trap a villainous cursed lord who profited by selling false maps to escaped slaves and refugees, who then drowned while attempting to cross a river at a non-existent ford; the realm would be impossible to free from the stain of his heinous crime until he is slain and his body is placed in the river by a former slave."

It cannot take hostile actions, although whenever another creature takes a hostile action against the affected creature, it can attempt a Will save at the disease's DC to suppress this effect for 1 minute. Additionally, whenever anyone makes a request of the affected creature, it must succeed at a Will save at the disease's DC or be compelled to perform the request, similar to a creature that failed a saving throw against the [suggestion](spell/suggestion) spell, except this suggestibility is a nonmagical disease effect (not a spell, spell-like ability, enchantment, or compulsion).",

An appropriate environment can lead to a much deeper sense of horror and a more memorable session, since creatures are something the PCs usually fight and defeat directly, while the environment is pervasive and unstoppable. Use the following horrific locations, hazards, domains, and nightmare dreamscapes to build the tension and increase the growing dread the players feel."

			"The following locations have particular features that fit well in the context of a horror game, such as minor unusual magic or creepy special effects. Though they might not be directly threatening like the hazards in the next section (and thus don't possess their own CR), they nonetheless add an ambience of horror and a sense of unease to the game, and sometimes make the journey through the surrounding area much less pleasant.",
			"",
			"***Divining Water:*** Certain special bodies of water grant insight into the spirits of those reflected in them. The reflections of creatures that appear in divining water show each creature as though it were viewed with [true seeing](spell/true_seeing), bypassing any illusions or polymorph effects and revealing the creature's true form. However, either right away or after establishing their divinatory properties, the reflections sometimes shift to show images of horrific creatures (generally undead and evil outsiders) instead of creatures' true forms, especially when the viewer is in a state of fear or mental turmoil.",
			"",
			"***Faceless Statue:*** These specially created stone statues are humanoid in appearance and elegantly carved, but they stand out because of their completely blank visages, which appear as though the sculptor simply forgot to give them faces. Whenever a character casts [project image](spell/project_image) within range of such a statue, she can project her image onto the statue, instead of creating the spell's normal effect. This causes the statue's blank face to transform into that of the caster, and the statue mimics the caster's actions, rather than a projected image doing so. The statue has a movement speed of 0 feet, but a caster projecting her image through the statue can direct it to make up to two slam attacks per round as a full-round action, using the caster's base attack bonus. The slam attacks each deal 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage. A [project image](spell/project_image) spell cast in this way has a duration measured in minutes, rather than rounds, and the caster isn't required to maintain line of effect to the projected image at all times. A faceless statue can also be affected by [enter image](spell/enter_image), causing the faceless surface to transform into an image of the caster's face for the duration of the spell, instead of producing the spell's normal effects. The statue's hardness is based on the type of material from which it is made. Dealing an amount of damage to the statue equal to double the caster's caster level ends either of the special spell effects channeled through the faceless statue.",
			"",
			"***Godless Void:*** Godless voids are pockets of altered reality that typically infest ruined temples, forsaken battlefields, and churches that fell from grace through the blasphemous deeds of corrupted worshipers. Even the divine might of deities is denied influence within these voids. The radius of a godless void is usually 1d6 &times; 100 feet. Within lesser godless voids, divine spells become more difficult to cast, and a divine caster must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the level of the spell) for a spell to function normally. If the caster fails, the spell doesn't function, but the prepared spell or spell slot is still lost. In addition, the DC to resist channeled energy of all sorts is reduced by 4. Greater godless voids are more troublesome, as all divine magic melts away within them, so divine casters must operate totally cut off from their god, as if within an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field).",
			"",
			"Selective godless voids exist, though they are rarer still than their normal counterparts. Such blasphemous sites affect divine casters of alignments opposed to the void's influence or who worship a deity or belong to a religion opposed to the void's influence. For instance, evil lesser godless voids impede good-aligned casters' access to spells and weaken their ability to channel positive energy as described above, while evil greater voids totally cut off spells and class abilities from good-aligned divine casters or casters who gain their powers from good-aligned deities. Good-aligned godless voids, or those aligned to law or chaos, are less common. Godless voids created by a great blasphemy against a particular deity might affect only that particular deity's power.",
			"",
			"***Grave:*** Macabre reminders of mortality, a grave could be found among many more within a necropolis or alone on a windswept hill. Digging a grave (4-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet deep) in typical soil takes 1d4 hours, while digging a grave in frozen or otherwise harder-than-average soil takes 2d6 hours. Without standard digging equipment, these times are doubled. Climbing out of an open grave usually takes a move action and a successful DC 5 Climb check (plus another move action to stand if the creature started out lying down).",
			"",
			"Careful examination of the surrounding area can reveal the presence of an unmarked grave or provide insight into how long ago a grave was dug. A successful DC 15 Perception check allows a character to notice an area of recently disturbed earth. For every week since the soil was disturbed, and for every day of rain since the soil was disturbed, the DC increases by 1. A successful DC 20 Profession (gardener, gravedigger, or other similar profession) or Survival check allows a character examining a patch of recently disturbed earth to determine roughly how long ago it was disturbed, as long as it was disturbed no more than 1 year ago.",

			"",
			"***Holy Ground:*** When first constructed, most good-aligned churches, temples, and holy sites are consecrated by the religion's clergy in elaborate and expensive blessing ceremonies, culminating in the casting of a [hallow](spell/hallow) spell. This effect permanently wards the site with a [magic circle against evil](spell/magic_circle_against_evil) effect, bolsters channeled positive energy while reducing the effects of channeled negative energy, and protects interred bodies from turning into undead abominations. The magic circle prevents intrusion by evil summoned creatures, and GMs may rule that other evil creatures refuse to trespass on holy ground. This [hallow](spell/hallow) spell also carries the protection of an additional spell for the first year-most often [aid](spell/aid), [bless](spell/bless), [death ward](spell/death_ward), [dimensional anchor](spell/dimensional_anchor), or [zone of truth](spell/zone_of_truth). The temple's attendants usually renew this spell in a special ceremony each year on the anniversary of the blessing ceremony, but the effect isn't in place for churches that have fallen into disrepair or been abandoned by their faiths. However, the remaining lingering [hallow](spell/hallow) effect in a ruined holy site might still provide sanctuary for those seeking respite from dark forces.",
			"",
			"The lingering presence of evil in or near a holy site can slowly undermine and eventually dispel the [hallow](spell/hallow) effect. This usually takes years or decades, and even a small amount of resistance by pure-hearted attendants can protect the site.",
			"",
			"Evil denominations also perform rituals to increase the power of their unholy sites, but with the exact opposite effects, replacing [hallow](spell/hallow) with [unhallow](spell/unhallow), and providing similar protections against good creatures. Evil clergy are more likely to utilize detrimental additional effects like [bane](spell/bane) or [cause fear](spell/cause_fear) to discourage trespassers on their unholy ground or even more powerful spells like [dimensional anchor](spell/dimensional_anchor) to ensure the trespassers will never leave.",
			"",
			"***Lost Halls:*** The corridors of some decrepit mansions can mislead those who seek to discover their hidden secrets. Within these lost halls, doors vanish, corridors impossibly twist and turn, staircases climb endlessly, and passages appear and disappear to confuse explorers. Creatures caught in lost halls find themselves temporarily trapped in an extradimensional labyrinth. For each round spent exploring the twisting turns, an affected creature can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check as a full-round action to find its way back to the point where it originally became lost. During this time, others might hear it calling out, but can't see or detect the lost creature. The phenomenon is short-lived, so if the creature finds itself hopelessly lost, 10 minutes later it finds its way back to the point where it first disappeared. This phenomenon can affect multiple creatures at once, in which case they can hear the disturbing echoes of other lost creatures trying to extract themselves from the twisting halls, but they can't otherwise interact with or assist their allies in any way. Unlike most of the other locations in this section, a lost halls phenomenon is normally harmless, if extremely unsettling, but when populated with creatures that target the separated characters, lost halls can substantially alter the threat of encounters."

			"The following hazards help build an atmosphere of horror and dread when used separately, but can also be combined with creatures to create truly frightening and memorable encounters (for instance, consider a battle with ogres within an animating fog, such that each ogre that dies rises again as a zombie).",
			"",
			"***Animating Fog (CR 6):*** Arising from polluted cemeteries and other recesses of stagnated evil, these areas of heavy, corpse-gray fog reek of rot, and seem to have a strange and malevolent sentience. These fog banks act as [normal fog](rule/fog), but usually have a radius of 1d4 &times; 50 feet and creep along with the wind at a rate of 10 feet per round. When the fog comes into contact with a mostly intact corpse, that corpse is immediately animated as a [zombie](template/zombie) and attacks nearby living creatures, as if under the effect of [animate dead](spell/animate_dead). This animation is temporary, ending 1d4 rounds after the zombie leaves the fog. Corpse fogs can animate up to 30 Hit Dice of corpses in this manner at any one time, and they have no limit on the total number of Hit Dice of zombies they can animate over time.",
			"",
			"Some particularly foul and virulent variations of this fog (CR 7 instead of CR 6) produce plague zombies instead of normal zombies. Creatures slain by the plague zombies' zombie rot who rise as zombies don't count against the fog's limit on the number of Hit Dice it can animate, and they remain zombies after the mist passes. Diseased animating fog also exposes every living creature within the fog bank to zombie rot each round as an inhaled disease (Fortitude DC 15 negates).",
			"",
			"***Apocalypse Fog (CR 12):*** An apocalypse fog is an augmented and highly dangerous form of animating fog often called into being by some foul deity. Its radius is 20 times wider than that of an animating fog and has the same ability to animate the mostly intact corpses within itself, but the apocalypse fog can move 10 feet in a direction of its own malign choice, rather than being subject to the whims of the wind. The dread energies that birth the mists bolster the undead within, granting the zombies the benefit of an aligned [desecrate](spell/desecrate) spell: a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws, and +2 hit points per Hit Die. Apocalypse fog can animate up to 100 Hit Dice worth of corpses at any one time.",
			"",
			"***Bat Colony (CR 2):*** Bats often congregate in large colonies in underground areas. Though bats are mostly harmless and bat colonies generally have little interest in adventurers or humans in general, if they are disturbed, they can prove dangerous to inexperienced adventurers. Any Small or larger creature moving within 30 feet of a bat colony must succeed at a DC 15 Stealth check each round or use wild empathy or a similar ability to keep the bats calm, or else there is a 50% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed. Additionally, each round the bat colony is exposed to normal or brighter light conditions or loud sudden noises, there is a 30% chance the bat colony becomes disturbed.",
			"",
			"If the bat colony is disturbed, the bats begin to fly about, shrieking and milling in an oversized swarm. When disturbed, the colony takes up a 20-foot-radius area. A creature that ends its turn in the area takes 1d6 points of damage, and is affected by the distraction and wounding special abilities of a [bat swarm](monster/bat_swarm). The colony remains disturbed for 1d4+1 rounds (or until the swarm is dispersed by damage), after which the bats either return to their previous position or flee the area, depending on whether they feel a threat is still present.",
			"",
			"***Blood Moon (CR 3):*** Two situations give rise to the infamous occurrences known as blood moons: astronomical alignments that result in a calendar month having a second full moon, and atmospheric phenomena when pollution and toxins hang heavy in the air, distorting the rising moon and giving it a blood-red cast and a seemingly larger size. Both types of occurrences are considered bad omens, and are revered as unholy events by worshipers of deities of filth and decay. While the light of a blood moon shines, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and creatures exposed to its light take a -2 penalty on saving throws against diseases, curses, [corruptions](main/corruptions), and [madnesses](rule/madness). Certain foul occult rituals related to such magic must be performed on blood moons. Blood moons caused by astronomical alignments last as long as the moon is risen, while blood moons that result from atmospheric distortions last 1d4 hours, fading as the moon rises higher in the night sky and casts off its ruddy sheen.",
			"",
			"***Bottomless Pit (CR 9):*** A bottomless pit is a yawning chasm that appears to be a perfectly natural fissure in the earth, other than the fact that it appears too deep to see the bottom. In actuality, bottomless pits are entrances to extraplanar spaces filled with nothing but endless empty void. A creature that falls into such a pit (whether it is pushed, runs afoul of a trap that conceals the bottomless pit, willingly dives into it, or enters the pit in some other fashion) falls endlessly in inky darkness at a rate of 500 feet per round. Other than its depth, the extraplanar space's dimensions match those of the pit's entrance, and the falling creature can attempt to catch itself on the wall, using the Climb skill (DC = 20 + the wall's Climb DC, as normal for catching yourself when falling), and can attempt to climb out of the pit from there. The wall's climb DC typically matches the type of terrain the opening was in, so a rocky chasm has a Climb DC of 15, for example. The creature can attempt to catch itself once per round. Because the creature falls endlessly, it can rest and even prepare spells while falling (although it must be careful not to drop any possessions, since it will likely fall at a different speed than the possessions do, causing it to lose them forever). If a campaign uses the [sanity system](rule/sanity), for each hour a creature falls in the bottomless pit, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or take 1d4 points of sanity damage.",
			"",
			"***Captivating Reflection (CR 3):*** Some narcissistic people need little encouragement to stop and admire their visage in the surface of the water, but occasionally this behavior comes from the bizarre supernatural influence of the water itself. A creature that sees its reflection in the surface of this captivating water must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw or become fascinated by the reflection for 1 minute, after which it can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect and look away. A creature that fails the second saving throw is fascinated for another minute, kneeling by the surface of the water and staring at its reflection, its nose nearly touching the surface. At the end of this time, the creature can attempt a third saving throw to end the effect. If the creature fails this third and final saving throw, it is compelled to plunge its head under the water, at which point the fascination suddenly ends, but the creature is paralyzed for 1 minute, unable to hold its breath because of paralysis and therefore immediately forced to attempt Constitution checks to avoid [drowning](rule/drowning).",
			"",
			"The creature's allies can pull its head from the water, but meet with surprising resistance, and must succeed at a DC 20 Strength check to do so, regardless of the paralyzed creature's own Strength score. If the creature avoids drowning by the end of the third minute, it can thereafter act normally, and is immune to the effects of this particular captivating reflection hazard for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"***Corpsefruit Tree (CR 5):*** This gnarled, twisted tree grows only from ground containing the corpse of an intelligent creature (a creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher), providing an insidious tether that binds that creature's spirit to the world of the living and twists it toward malevolent spite. The tree is shrouded by a veil of illusion, which causes intelligent creatures that see the tree to believe it bears a heavy bounty of ripe, succulent fruits, and such creatures are compelled to eat the tree's fruit unless they succeed at a DC 15 Will save. In fact, the tree's fruits are brown, shriveled, and rotten, and any creature that succeeds at the Will save can plainly see this.",
			"",
			"Creatures that consume the fruit also consume a tiny portion of the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree, forging a spiritual connection between the deceased and the unfortunate victim. The next time the creature rests, it is affected as though by the [nightmare](spell/nightmare) spell (DC 17). The tree is treated as having a body part of the creature's, and the tree uses the appropriate modifier based on the knowledge the spirit that nourished the tree has of the creature-typically none. The victim continues to be affected by [nightmare](spell/nightmare) for 3 days, or until it succeeds at a saving throw to resist the spell. Further, if the spirit of the creature whose corpse nourished the tree has become an incorporeal undead of any kind, the creature that consumed the fruit takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist the spells and spell-like abilities of that undead creature.",
			"",
			"***Exploding Window (CR 1):*** Whether from supernatural influence or simply from more mundane physical forces, windows can sometimes explode in a rain of glass shards. When this occurs, for each 5-foot square containing an exploding window, the shattered glass blasts out in a 15-foot cone that deals 1d6 points of slashing damage to each creature in the area (Reflex DC 12 negates). A creature caught in more than one of these cones (either from multiple simultaneous exploding windows or one large exploding window) takes a cumulative -1 penalty on its saving throw for each cone beyond the first, but attempts only a single saving throw and takes only 1d6 points of damage if it fails, regardless of the number of cones whose areas overlap on the creature's space. Additionally, the glass shards remain on the ground, functioning as [caltrops](equipment-misc/caltrops) until they are cleared away.",
			"",
			"***Field of Bone (CR 6):*** This supernatural hazard usually plagues those who trespass on old battlefields still littered with the bones of soldiers who have never been laid to proper rest. These 30-foot-radius patches of strewn bones are considered difficult terrain, and they spring to a foul mockery of life 1 round after a living creature enters the area, causing 1d6 [skeletons](template/skeleton) to animate and attack, as if subject to an [animate dead](spell/animate_dead) spell. A field of bone can animate up to 24 skeletons in this manner from any single instance of trespassing (regardless of how many living creatures trespass into the area at once), at a rate of 1d6 skeletons per round. The skeletons continue to animate until all are destroyed, all living creatures leave the area, or the field of bone reaches its animation limit, whichever of these conditions comes first.",
			"",
			"***Gnarled Tree (CR 5):*** Some trees become poisoned and malignant, tainted by the corrupt land around them, and spring to a macabre semblance of animation to attack those who trespass on their dark realms. Gnarled trees animate in the presence of living creatures, and attack indiscriminately for as long as creatures are within range. The victims' spilled blood seeping into the ground further feeds the trees' corruption. Gnarled trees appear as twisted, or even dead, trees of great age and a variety of species, and they blend in with the surrounding forests. Spotting one as an anomalous growth requires a successful DC 17 Perception check (the DC may be higher, depending on the prevalence and condition of local trees). Though a gnarled tree is stationary and can't move from its rooted spot, it attacks as if it were a [treant](monster/treant). The gnarled tree doesn't gain the treant's animation and rock-throwing abilities, but does have the treant's vulnerability to fire. When all living creatures move more than 30 feet away from the gnarled tree, it immediately returns to its normal, non-animated state, until a potential target appears within range once more and provokes the corrupted tree's ire again.",
			"",
			"***Grasping Graves (CR 4):*** Treading on the burial sites of the unquiet dead can be treacherous, as the buried dead seek to drag the living down into their restless graves. These patches of shallow graves are often found near sites of mass burials, such as those that follow plagues or famines, and are typically 60 feet across. Once a creature enters the area, rotting, grasping hands rip from the earth, turning the entire patch into difficult terrain and targeting each creature inside with a grapple combat maneuver check each round at the end of that creature's turn. The hands don't provoke attacks of opportunity, and have a CMB of +12 (with a base attack bonus of +8 and a +4 bonus due to their Strength). This check is attempted each round for every creature in the hazardous area.",
			"",
			"If the hands successfully grapple a creature, that creature takes 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage, gains the grappled condition, and is unable to move without breaking the grapple first. The grasping claws receive a +5 bonus on grapple checks against creatures they are already grappling, but can't move or pin foes. Each round the grasping claws succeed at a grapple check, they deal 1d6+4 additional points of damage. The skeletal hands have a CMD of 22, hardness 5, and 5 hit points each. The hands take full damage from channeled positive energy (no save). However, destroying a particular set of hands doesn't harm the overall hazard, which generates new skeletal hands to grasp all creatures freed in this way on the following round. The only way to evade the hazard is to move out of the affected area, after which the unquiet spirits that animate the grasping graves become dormant once again.",
			"",
			"***Grasping Undergrowth (CR 2):*** In many forests, undergrowth is thick and tangled enough that it seems to be attempting to hinder travelers, but in some places, whether due to a malevolent spirit or the ire of nature itself, it actually is. Whenever a creature moves through an area of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a trip combat maneuver check (with a CMB of +5) against that creature. Tripped creatures fall prone in the first square of grasping undergrowth that they entered that round, and lose the rest of their movement. Creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at half their speed (after factoring in any reduced movement speed for being in a forest) gain a +4 bonus to their CMD against trip combat maneuver checks from the grasping undergrowth, and creatures that move through the grasping undergrowth at a quarter of their speed gain a +8 bonus.",
			"",
			"If a creature begins its turn prone in a square of grasping undergrowth, the grasping undergrowth attempts a grapple combat maneuver check against it, dealing 1d6 points of damage on a successful check and preventing the creature from moving from the spot until it breaks free of the grapple. The undergrowth can't move or pin the grappled creature on subsequent rounds, and has a CMD of 17. For their own cryptic reasons, some patches of grasping undergrowth grant safe passage to characters of certain alignments or races.",
			"",
			"***Insidious Domicile (CR 4):*** The dwellings of some powerful evil creatures impose pervasive effects on those who disturb the restless hate that dwells within. These areas are typically single structures-a castle, a tower, or a home-infested with spite and malice. Creatures that enter the structure must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be infected with overwhelming hate toward another creature, as if under the effects of [malicious spite](spell/malicious_spite). For each day spent within the domicile, the target takes 2 points of Wisdom damage if it doesn't act to subtly and indirectly slander, abuse, blame, extort, or cause mortal violence against the target of its spite. The [malicious spite](spell/malicious_spite) effect ends if the creature leaves the location, but resumes if the creature returns. Affected creatures get a saving throw every 24 hours to negate the effect. If the effect ends, the target remembers the spiteful behavior, but not the motivation for it.",
			"",
			"If a campaign uses the [sanity system](rule/sanity), the target takes 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of taking Wisdom damage.",
			"",
			"***Misleading Echoes (CR 2):*** Some places create supernatural echoes that seem to come from random directions, or even all directions at once. An area suffused with misleading echoes imposes a -4 penalty on hearing-based Perception checks, and a listener must succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check whenever she detects a noise, or else she believes the noise came from a random direction instead of its actual direction. Further, the misleading echoes can replicate the effects of [ghost sound](spell/ghost_sound) (DC 11) once per minute. Any creature that fails a Wisdom check or Will save to resist the effects of the misleading echoes takes a -2 penalty on saving throws to resist fear effects for as long as it remains in the area of the misleading echoes, and for 1 minute thereafter.",
			"",
			"***Misleading Path (CR 3):*** When the surrounding trees begin to move and change the paths when creatures aren't looking, and the towering branches above even block out the sun, it can be difficult indeed to stay on track. In other environments, shifting dunes or underground tunnels can have the same effect. The DC for Survival checks to avoid becoming lost within an area of misleading paths increases by 2d6. Characters that become lost either travel in random directions, as normal, or are led by a strange intelligence toward a specific location, at the GM's discretion. Because travelers appear to be on a path as they travel, the DC of the Survival check to identify that they are lost increases to 25.",
			"",
			"***Pervasive Gloom (CR 4):*** Some locations ooze dread and foreboding, whether from old evils left to stagnate or the presence of some lingering psychic residue from years of torture or oppression. The locations can be single rooms, entire structures, old cemeteries, or even decaying forest groves. Trespassing creatures find the gloom nibbles away at their mental defenses, and take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects, effects with the emotion descriptor, the effects of haunts, the progression of corruptions, madnesses, and sanity damage.",
			"",
			"***Plague of Flies (CR 2):*** Often harbingers of famine and decay, these swarms of flies spread disease and pestilence wherever their buzzing wings carry them. These insects typically form a cloud 20 feet across, made of tens of thousands of flies. This cloud moves at up to 10 feet per round, and obscures all sight (including darkvision) beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (20% miss chance), and creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target). Moderate or stronger winds can temporarily disperse the cloud, as per [obscuring mist](spell/obscuring_mist), but the flies reform 1d4+1 rounds later to continue their pursuit of carrion. Spells such as [fireball](spell/fireball), [flame strike](spell/flame_strike), and [wall of fire](spell/wall_of_fire), as well as similar area spells, destroy the cloud of flies if they deal at least 10 points of damage. Creatures that spend at least 1 round in the cloud must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or contract the [shakes](disease/shakes). Some plagues of flies carry other virulent diseases instead, which might affect the CR of the hazard if the DC is significantly higher or lower.",
			"",
			"***Rain of Gore (CR 3):*** This unusual and unsettling phenomenon results in the corpses of small animals (ranging from Diminutive to Small) falling from the sky in a localized area. A rain of gore generally covers a 500-foot-radius area, and lasts for 2d4 &times; 10 minutes. During this time, each round that a character remains in the open, it takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. In the wake of a rain of gore, scores of animal corpses are left strewn about in the area. Sometimes, a rain of gore will deposit animal corpses that are infected with [filth fever](disease/filth_fever) or another disease, in which case each time characters take damage from the rain of gore, they risk infection. This version of the hazard has a CR of 4 or higher.",
			"",
			"***Sanguinary Cloud (CR 6):*** Often found floating over campsites of unfortunate travelers drained of all bodily fluids, these blood-red fog banks can be mistaken for colossal [vampiric mists](monster/vampiric_mist). A sanguinary cloud typically settles over a 60-foot-radius area, obscuring all sight beyond 5 feet, including darkvision, granting concealment (20% miss chance) to all creatures 5 feet away or farther. Creatures caught within a bank of this deadly fog must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save each round or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage as their bodily fluids are forcibly extracted from their pores and mucous membranes and drawn into the crimson mist. A severe or greater wind disperses a sanguinary cloud, leaving behind a thin sheen of bloody bile.",
			"",
			"Sour Ground (CR varies): These corrupted holy sites usually feature long-toppled standing stones and spiraling rock paths carefully arranged by a forgotten culture to invoke powerful divine magic. On these grounds, divine casters restored life to those who died before their time and buried those whose time indeed was up. However, time, overuse, and trespassers caused the ground's life-giving properties to sour, corrupting the corpses of those whose loved ones are foolhardy enough to lay them to rest within the necropolis's boundaries. Any mostly intact corpse of a creature buried within these ancient cemeteries animates 24 hours later as a [juju zombie](template/juju_zombie) and seeks its revenge on those who condemned its corpse to this vile existence. These terrible creatures still retain a semblance of their former personalities and are often barely distinguishable from the living with the exception of cold flesh, slightly sunken features, distracted behavior, and an increasingly foul smell. They lure in mourning loved ones with comforting embraces before engaging in a murderous rampage, perhaps burying the resulting corpses in the same sour ground to increase their numbers and extract more revenge on the living. The CR and the XP reward of sour ground are based on the number of juju zombies that arise.",
			"",
			"***Suicide Copse (CR 4):*** Certain forests are known for attracting unusual numbers of suicides. The exact cause can vary, and may be the result of mind-altering pollen, strange psychic phenomena, or the work of mournful or malevolent spirits. Whatever the cause, suicide copses don't so much attract suicidal creatures as inspire suicide in those nearby. Each hour a creature spends within the suicide copse, it must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be affected by the spell [terrible remorse](spell/terrible_remorse) (CL 10). A creature that succeeds at this saving throw three consecutive times is immune to this effect for 24 hours. At the GM's discretion, some creatures affected by the suicide copse might be compelled to hang themselves, drown themselves, or kill themselves by other means, rather than being affected by [terrible remorse](spell/terrible_remorse), but such compulsions still last only 1 minute. Though called a copse, this effect can potentially cover entire forests spanning hundreds of square miles.",
			"",
			"***Watchful Doll (CR 1):*** These porcelain dolls resemble young children, and stare forward with blank, glassy expressions on their stylized yet eerily lifelike faces. Whenever a creature moves within 30 feet of a watchful doll, the doll's head rotates to face the creature, and emits a childlike laugh that echoes as if across a great distance, and can be clearly heard up to 60 feet away. Creatures within 30 feet that hear the laughter must succeed at a Will save (DC 13) or be shaken for 1 minute. Creatures with 4 or fewer Hit Dice that fail their saves are instead frightened. Once triggered, the doll doesn't laugh again for 1 minute, but its head continues to move so its gaze follows the creature that triggered it. The fear from the laughter is a mind-affecting fear effect.",
			"",
			"***Well of Evil (CR 5):*** These places are accursed morasses of depravity, nexuses of lingering hate and festering evil that bode ill for the pure-hearted who trespass upon them. A well of evil is typically a single room, cave, or structure, though it can expand to fill an area with a radius of up to 2d4 &times; 10 feet. Good-aligned creatures can feel the powerful evil presence tainting a well of evil, and such creatures that approach within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become sickened and refuse to enter the location for 1 hour. A successful Will save negates these unfortunate effects, but if the creature actually enters the location, it becomes sickened with no save. Within a well of evil, the DC to resist negative channeled energy increases by 2, and good-aligned creatures take a -2 penalty on saving throws against curses, corruptions, madnesses, spells with the evil descriptor, and the effects of haunts. Haunts that lurk within wells of evil also gain a +4 bonus on their Initiative checks and to Perception check DCs to notice them.",
			"",
			"***Witch Light (CR 1):*** Often confused with will-o-- wisps, these shimmering lights also tend to lead unwary passersby to their dooms. Witch lights appear as flickering lights resembling lantern or torch flames, but can be seen only with a successful DC 10 Perception check. A result of 30 or higher on the Perception check allows the viewer to identify the witch light as a mirage. The witch light seems to move with the viewer, retreating if the creature moves toward it and following if it moves away. Some witch lights have a mind of their own, or are controlled by malevolent entities, and lead viewers toward specific places-often pits or other hazards, but sometimes treasures or long-buried secrets. Creatures actively following a witch light take a -4 penalty on Perception checks and a -4 penalty on Reflex saves to resist the effects of traps and hazards."

			"Some powerful creatures are so corrupted that their malignancy creeps into the land around them, establishing dangerous domains of evil over which they rule. And though some vile lords find themselves trapped within these cursed realms, they also become capable of exerting tremendous influence over the atmosphere and composition of their domains, such that their lands grow to reflect their dark moods and deeds. These dark rulers are described in the [dread lord template](template/dread_lord).",
			"",
			"Domains of evil are dark pockets of supernatural activity embedded in a plane (often the Material Plane) like boils on pockmarked flesh. Most domains are hostile and uninviting at best, full of twisted forests, rough and intractable terrain, and putrid rivers that reek of rot and pollution. Wildlife could be similarly tainted, in which case even the occasional hare or ground squirrel is bony, cancerous, and infested with vermin. Packs of mangy coyotes, pustule-plagued wolves, and murders of molting crows might constantly harass travelers, nipping at their heels, ripping the flanks of their mounts, or snatching at the fingers of careless campers.",
			"",
			"Supernatural creatures might also plague the unwary, as moaning zombies wander wind-blown mountain passes and spectral dead seek to drain the life from the living at every turn. Packs of ghouls roam the lowlands, devouring entire villages, and the gnawed skeletons they leave in their wake animate and attack travelers. Everywhere lurks the foreboding presence of some foul master, who has an uncanny knack for knowing the whereabouts of trespassers and is capable of bending the lands to his will to make them most unwelcome.",
			"",
			"Such domains are not always devoid of humanoid populations-they may harbor villages of fearful and superstitious locals that usually serve as chattel and livestock for the domain's lord. These populations tend to be incredibly insular and suspicious of outsiders and intrusions on their lifestyles, as trespassers into the realm-particularly adventurers-have ways of disrupting the locals' tentative impasse with their lord."

			"When created, a domain of evil warps reality around it into a foul reflection of its master, with a radius of 5 miles for every Hit Die of its new lord (see the [dread lord template](template/dread_lord)). This radius usually centers on an ancient ancestral manse or cursed cairn that housed the dread lord's family or was the scene of a tragedy that led to the domain's creation. Though domains of evil are still located on their original plane (usually the Material Plane), with all the terrain, weather, flora, fauna, structures, and features normal to the area where they were created, their special natures cause them to have [planar traits](rule/planar_traits) that alter their physical and magical properties, as well as some features exclusive to them. Domains of evil have the following features, as befits the horrible creatures that preside over these realms.",
			"",
			"***Alignment:*** If its master has 10 Hit Dice or fewer, a domain gains the mildly aligned planar alignment trait reflecting the alignment of its master. Domains with masters with more than 10 Hit Dice instead become strongly aligned.",
			"",
			"***Borders:*** Some domains are formed simply by the foul presence of an evil that has long inhabited the land, whether it's a nosferatu lord lurking in the shadows or a restless ghost bound to the soil of its unquiet grave. The borders of such a domain are open; creatures can freely enter and leave, and its lord can pass to and from its domain without penalty, though the influence he has over his lands doesn't extend past the domain's established borders. Other domains of evil serve as torturous prisons for their cursed lords (see [Cursed Domains](rule/cursed_domains)), who find it impossible to leave the realms to which they are bound, oftentimes hindered by a pervasive bank of dread fog that prevents their egress. These mists resist intrusion into the domain, though the strange whims of dark powers might allow passage through the fog for those who might further trouble or torment the land's lord.",
			"",
			"***Disturbing to Animals:*** The overwhelming taint of unnatural presences disturbs animals that are not native to a domain of evil. Animals don't willingly approach the domain's border unless their masters succeed at DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy checks, and the masters must continue to attempt checks each hour within the domain to prevent their animals from trying to leave the area. The DCs of all other Handle Animal, Ride, and wild empathy checks to influence non-native animals increase by 5 while the animals remain within the domain's border.",
			"",
			"***Hazards:*** The domain morphs into a dark and twisted reflection of its lord, with dangerous landmarks and supernatural hazards (such as the ones on in the [Hazards](rule/hazards) section) mirroring the master's temperament and personality infesting the landscape. Forests might become darker and more foreboding, full of misleading paths or gnarled oaks that grasp and tear at trespassers. Seemingly sentient fogs drift across the crags and crevices of the land, animating undead in their wakes, while bat colonies infest the domain's caves and ruins. These hazards can shift and change over time as the land reacts to the moods and whims of the dread lord (a slow process that takes at least 24 hours, during which no hazard functions), but the total CR of all hazards found with a lord's domain (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) can't exceed double the dread lord's Hit Dice, and no individual hazard can have a CR that exceeds the dread lord's Hit Dice. If the land is the domain of a cursed lord and bordered by dread fog, the fog's CR value doesn't count against this limit.",
			"",
			"***Magic:*** The domain can have the enhanced magic, impeded magic, or wild magic planar trait, as befits the personality and temperament of its lord. If the domain has enhanced, impeded, or limited magic, one type of magic per 5 Hit Dice of its lord can be enhanced, impeded, or limited. The categories of magic that are affected are relatively narrow. For example, an entire school of magic would be too broad, but \"effects with the healing descriptor or that restore hit points\" or \"death spells and spells granted by the [Death](domain/death) and [Repose](domain/repose) domains\" would be appropriate. A type of spell can't be both enhanced and impeded by the same domain.",
			"",
			"***Time:*** A domain's time passes at the normal rate by default. In some cases, the lord's powerful whims alter the passage of time, whether replicating the slow churning of years felt by a lich's long existence, or the quickening felt by a blood-sated vampire. This alteration can be temporary or permanent, and the domain can have the erratic time, flowing time (half or double normal time), or timeless trait."

There is no escape for a cursed lord, who is continuously subject to living and spectral reminders of the tragic misdeeds that trapped him (see the [cursed lord template](template/cursed_lord)). These realms have all the qualities of domains of evil, with the following additional traits.",
			"",
			"***Dread Fog:*** This cloying mist often encapsulates the boundaries of cursed domains, raised by terrible powers to prevent entry into, or escape from, the cursed lands they protect. Like normal fog, these pervasive banks of thick mists obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet, granting concealment to all creatures at least 5 feet away (20% miss chance). Navigation and orientation within the mists is treacherous, and creatures usually find themselves easily separated from their companions unless extraordinary means are taken to prevent separation, which can include shackling or binding adjacent creatures to one another with rope. Those within the fog have little hope of navigating the mists and risk becoming hopelessly lost. A creature must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence check each hour after entering the mist. Creatures that fail continue to wander in the fog until they succeed. Creatures that succeed exit the fog 1d10 &times; 100 feet from the location where they first entered the miasma. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as [teleport](spell/teleport) and [dimension door](spell/dimension_door), don't help a creature escape this fog, although a [plane shift](spell/plane_shift) spell allows the creature to exit at the location it originally entered the fog. Penetrating the fog to actually enter or exit the realm it protects is subject to the GM's discretion. Navigating through might require difficult Knowledge (planes) checks, random happenstance, complicated arcane rituals beseeching favor, or simply the desire of the mysterious entities responsible for the cursed realm's creation to see the torture of their prisoner ended or increased with the intrusion of the adventurers.",
			"",
			"The fog's hopelessness is pervasive, and creatures take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per hour they are within the fog. The wraiths and geists of those who have perished in the mists might also materialize to drain the life from travelers. Those who lose their lives within this miasma are forever lost, incapable of being restored to life by any means short of direct divine intervention. They often turn into incorporeal undead themselves, their souls feeding the strange boundary's continued existence.",
			"",
			"***Haunted Lands:*** Cursed lords are plagued with the spectres of the acts that led to the creation of the domain, which materialize as haunts. The realm of a brutal dictator might be tormented with the haunts of those he tortured to death, reflecting the various violent means by which they were killed. The domain of a lich cursed for sacrificing her entire family to fuel her transformation into undeath may contain the spirits of those she betrayed, who wander the halls of a ruined manse at the core of the land. The cursed lord has no control over these spectral trespassers, placed to remind him of his former misdeeds. When a cursed realm is created, the domain manifests a number of haunts with a total CR value (that is, the CR of a hypothetical encounter with all of the hazards at once) of up to double the cursed lord's Hit Dice, with no single haunt having a CR that exceeds the cursed lord's Hit Dice. These haunts are [chained](rule/haunt_templates) to the cursed lord and can't be completely destroyed while the cursed lord still exists. Other haunts not chained to the cursed lord might manifest within the domain of evil, but such haunts don't count against the CR limit."

			"Willfully transforming one creature into another through magical and alchemical processes is a terrifying technique performed by the most cruel and vicious of creatures. Power-hungry necromancers, heartless alchemists, demon worshipers, [aboleths](monster/aboleth), and the [drow](race/drow) are some of the best-known practitioners of this foul art, using dark knowledge and secret formulas to flay the creature's flesh and twist them into amalgamated forms.",
			"",
			"Some sages theorize that other amalgamated creatures, such as [chimeras](monster/chimera), [owlbears](monster/owlbear), and maybe even [skum](monster/skum) and [bulettes](monster/bulette), could have also been the result of an archaic form of fleshwarping. Legends involving [Lamashtu's](faith/lamashtu) creation of the chimera give a certain amount of credence to this theory, but even it's true, the secrets to these early fleshwarps are long lost.",
			"",
			"While fleshwarping often yields results useful to those depraved enough to carry it out, the act of creating a fleshwarp is always evil, as it requires unspeakable acts and horrific physiological and psychological torture inflicted upon the subject of the transformation. Unfortunately, this has not stopped the occasional alchemist or arcanist from pursuing fleshwarping for the well-meaning but ultimately deluded purposes of species genesis.",
			"",
			"Worse still, while the rare fleshwarp formula develops a truly unique race, this seems to be the exception rather than the rule. In the majority of cases, the process involves the utter corruption of sentient beings warped into lurching monstrosities that are both intellectually stunted and existentially compromised. As such, most fleshwarp creatures are sterile. The most famous fleshwarp mutation, the [drider](monster/drider), is the chief exception to this rule. Still, the process of creating a drider is no blessing, but rather a cruel punishment perpetrated by the depraved dark elves upon their own kind. If possible, the processes drow inflict on other creatures are even crueler. This also points to another rule of fleshwarping: creatures that are inherently evil tend to take forms that are useful and powerful, while good creatures tend to metamorphose into more twisted and helpless forms. Another quirk of true fleshwarping is that targets of mixed race, such has half-elves and half-orcs, usually transform into creatures that more strongly reflect their non-human parentage. Lastly, while dwarves have proven strangely resilient to drow methods of fleshwarping, the methods of other races have successfully warped dwarves into new creatures.",
			"",
			"***Fleshwarping Process:*** The creation of a true fleshwarp is partly magical and partly alchemical. While a team of alchemists, spellcasters, and torturers is often assembled to perform fleshwarping, it must be led by at least one creature that has the [Fleshwarper](feat/fleshwarper) feat and must be performed on a living creature or creatures. Any attempt to fleshwarp a corpse automatically fails.",
			"",
			"Before the process, a fleshwarper usually restrains the subject or subjects. She then must make precise cuts in a subject's flesh and insert tubes into those incisions. These tubes connect to vats of bubbling alchemical substances, which are pumped into the subject's body, racking it with agony. These fluids break down the subject's corporeal form, making it more malleable. Each subject undergoing the fleshwarping process must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or instantly die from this procedure. If the fleshwarper succeeds at a DC 20 Heal check during this process, she grants the subject a +2 bonus on this saving throw.",
			"",
			"Assuming a subject survives the fluid infusion, the fleshwarper then forces a breathing tube down the subject's throat. Unable to speak, the subject is at best able to make strangled noises as the fleshwarper immerses it into the alchemical concoction that completes its transformation. Once immersed in the alchemical compound, the subject's body goes through a rapid series of transformations. During this arduous process, attendants must periodically remove necrotic tissue and organs, as well as flesh that has sloughed off the creature's body.",
			"",
			"The entire fleshwarping process requires 1 day per Hit Die of the final fleshwarped creature. During this time, the fleshwarper must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal to the creation DC of the fleshwarped creature (typically, 15 + the final fleshwarped creature's Hit Dice) each day. Creating a fleshwarped creature takes a number of days equal to 1 + the final fleshwarped creature's CR. The fleshwarper can't gain the benefit of aid another nor can she take 10 on these checks. Failure indicates each subject undergoing the fleshwarping process takes 1d3 points of Constitution damage, which can't be healed until the process is complete, and that day's work doesn't count toward the creation time. If a fleshwarping subject's Constitution damage (whether from this failure or the final Constitution damage at the conclusion) ever equals or exceeds its Constitution score, its body collapses into protoplasmic goo. Creatures slain in such a fashion can't be raised from the dead except by [true resurrection](spell/true_resurrection) or equally powerful magic, and if any of the component creatures breaks down in this way, the final fleshwarp fails.",

The ingredients for fleshwarping vary from one practitioner to the next, but often include corrosive fungi, poison from several breeds of giant insects, assorted pulverized oozes, essences from a chaos beast, protean spittle, and other exotic reagents.

Once attached, a fleshcraft immediately begins functioning and grants its listed abilities to the grafted creature. While a fleshcraft is partially magical in genesis, it doesn't radiate magic or have a caster level, regardless of whether it has been grafted to the subject or supplied via an elixir.",
			"",
			"***Fleshcraft Grafts:*** Creating a fleshcraft graft requires the [Fleshwarper](feat/fleshwarper) feat and an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the graft to be created. Creating a fleshcraft graft is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value.",

At the end of the hour, the surgeon must attempt a Heal check against the graft's listed DC. Failure indicates the patient's body rejects the graft and the graft dies. Regardless of the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if employing the [sanity system](rule/sanity)). Although fleshcraft grafts are not magical, some occupy a magic item slot on the body, preventing that slot from being used for any magic item or other graft.",

Alternatively, the surgeon can remove the graft more delicately and use healing magic to save the subject, attempting a DC 15 Heal check and applying a [heal](spell/heal) or [regenerate](spell/regenerate) spell immediately afterward. Failing this Heal check always results in the destruction of both graft and subject. A successful surgery removes and destroys the graft.

Creating a fleshcraft elixir is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value. These potionlike concoctions can bestow the effect of an individual fleshcraft graft (a creature can't benefit from more than one at a time), but for a limited period of time. Imbibing a fleshcraft elixir works similarly to imbibing other potions or elixirs, except that it's slow acting, taking effect the round after it is imbibed (as if the imbiber were casting a 1-round casting time spell).

The second failed saving throw while the creature is within the same area increases the severity of the mutation.

Once a creature has at least one advanced mutation, further exposure within the same area causes another advanced mutation on a failed save. However, this level of physical deformity is extremely taxing on a mutated creature, and each subsequent new mutation imposes a cumulative -2 penalty to the creature's Constitution score as long as the fleshwarped creature has the mutation.

It's possible to suffer from multiple forms of the same madness.

Recovering from a madness without magical aid is a lengthy process requiring significant rest. After 7 consecutive days of uninterrupted rest, the afflicted character can attempt a Will save against the madness's current DC. If she succeeds, the DC is reduced by a number of points equal to 1/2 the character's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Instead of relying on her own strength of personality to reduce the effects of madness, a character can also seek out a single confidante, priest, or other advisor. The recovering character must meet with that person regularly (at least 8 hours each day) and gain guidance during the 7 days of rest. At the end of the rest period, the ally can attempt a Wisdom or Intelligence check (whichever is higher) with a DC of 15 for a lesser madness or a DC of 20 for a greater madness. On a success, the recovering character can reduce the madness's DC by 1/2 the ally's Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (whichever is higher, minimum 1) in addition to the decrease for resting.

You can't simply assume that you know what your players will be okay with.

If a player expresses concerns about a game's content, he doesn't need to explain himself; either remove the sensitive element, run a different game, or ask the player to participate in a different game.

Elaborated upon, it's the terror of becoming physically monstrous and the awfulness that might hide within.",

This might be in a mundane fashion, such as a character racing to find a cure for a withering disease, trying to escape enemy territory with a broken leg, or knowing that a parasite is devouring his flesh. Unleashed from reality, body horror might involve an uncontrolled transformation, a disease that has gained sentience, or a monster that consumes flesh or blood. Body horror plots can involve a timeline or countdown, evoking a disease running its course or an untreated wound turning gangrenous. The only way to stop the spread of whatever fleshy terror has been unleashed is to cure it medically or excise it with sword or spell before it is too late. Doing so often comes with the greatest threat of body horror: infection. Characters might suffer [curses](rule/curses), [contract terrible illnesses](rule/diseases), [undergo horrific corruptions](rule/corruption), or become host to ravenous parasites.

			"",
			"The enemy in a body horror game can also be unclear. While it might be individuals spreading a plague, a race of sentient parasites, or a mad scientist transforming victims, it might also be simply a disease itself. The former examples lend themselves toward common Pathfinder plots. The latter, though, might unfold as a scavenger hunt or series of challenges that contribute toward concocting a cure. In such cases, the final challenge should be the most harrowing and present the greatest risk of exposure to infection. In that way, the defeat of the invisible menace has a climax, but it also has the extremely personal threat of another outbreak.",

A GM might provide bread crumbs leading toward this knowledge, but the PCs' limited perspective grants only glimpses of the terrible whole. The discovery of strange cults or unsettling artifacts might push characters to uncover devices and creatures not native to their understanding of the world. These elements are best revealed slowly, like evidence in a mystery story, and they should build upon one another to suggest ever-greater threats. Ultimately, the threat might be entities from beyond gulfs of existence, or even be something like the arrangement of the stars themselves-foes that can't be defeated with sword and spell. While the PCs might win a skirmish with such forces and prevent the apocalypse du jour, their world's days are numbered.

These are not typically spiritual beings, like angels or demons, but neighbors in existence that prove the laws of reality aren't exactly fair. Many creatures from the works of H. P. Lovecraft and other authors of this subgenre exist in the Pathfinder RPG and fit naturally into cosmic horror adventures, such as [deep ones](monster/deep_one), [denizens of Leng](monster/denizen_of_leng), [elder things](monster/elder_thing), [Great Old Ones](family/great_old_one), [mi-go](monster/mi-go), [shoggoths](monster/shoggoth), and [Yithians](monster/yithian), to name just a few.

Magic might bear the threat of arcane backlash or addiction.

It's a pessimistic sort of fantasy where threats are many and death seems likely, yet the heroes of these stories have the opportunity to defend the rare places of warmth and light. Not unlike other fantasy heroes, they become champions of the helpless and foes of evil. However, here the odds are stacked far more heavily against them.",

Usually relatively short tales, stories in this subgenre focus on wayward souls and the tragic events that keep them from passing on.

The protagonists of a ghost story tend to be latecomers to the tragedy. By entering the zone of spiritual fallout, they either embroil themselves in healing residual scars or try to escape before becoming the next victims.",

The former might be sorrowful entities that make the PCs their agents in the hopes of being set free. The latter are vicious things, incarnations of madness and violence that take their wrath out on any who dare trespass on their haunting grounds. In neither case does a ghost need to be a sympathetic character, but in both, the spirit's origins affect its appearance, abilities, and behavior. While revealing the lore behind a haunting might be story enough, in a typical Pathfinder ghost story, learning the spirit's background and using it to put the ghost to rest is central to the plot.",

			"***Monsters and Threats:*** Obviously, these tales focus on ghosts, but in the Pathfinder RPG, \"ghost\" might mean a variety of things, not just the monster of the same name. However, a [ghost](template/ghost) is an excellent choice of monster due to its rejuvenation ability, which means the spirit can only be truly defeated if the PCs discover the correct means. This ability forces the PCs to involve themselves in a ghost story to defeat their foe. A GM might use any number of ghostly spirits to create specific sorts of ghost stories-for instance, [banshees](monster/banshee) terrorize barren moors, [poltergeists](monster/poltergeist) disturb peaceful households, and [yuki-onnas](monster/yuki-onna) haunt snowy vistas. Looking up creatures with the [incorporeal subtype](subtype/incorporeal) can point to strong ghost story candidates. Ghosts don't need to be incorporeal. [Phantom armors](family/phantom_armor), [revenants](monster/revenant), [skeletal champions](template/skeletal_champion), and [zuvembies](monster/zuvembie), for example, all make fine corporeal threats. A \"ghost\" also doesn't need to be undead, especially as the line between spirit and outsider is often blurry. Consider having any of a variety of fiends-such as [owbs](monster/owb) or [vulnudaemons](monster/vulnudaemon)-haunt a ghost story. For story purposes, a GM shouldn't hesitate to give non-ghosts the rejuvenation ability as well, but only so long as the threat stays bound to a single plot-rich locale. More so than in other subgenres, [haunts](rule/haunts) make obvious choices. Spectral beings (especially [geists](monster/geist)) teamed with a variety of flavorful haunts can work together to create a wider and more satisfying haunting.",

			"***Storytelling:*** Among the most challenging subgenres of horror to re-create in a Pathfinder adventure, psychological horror stories often deal with themes of conspiracy, doubt, and paranoia. In film and fiction, these stories might focus on a single individual being pushed beyond her limit as the lines of reality blur around her. In a Pathfinder adventure, it's difficult to make one PC the victim of such horror-but it is possible. While the rules for sanity simulate a variety of psychological effects, these are most effective when a player chooses to roleplay their effects, forcing the group to acknowledge that the character's grip on reality has slipped. Beyond those rules, the techniques described in the [Warp Reality section](rule/fear_from_the_unexpected) and in the [Secrets and Suspicion](rule/secrets_and_suspicion) section can help sow uncertainty among the players, leaving them wondering what's real and who they can trust.",

Conspiracy plots might unite a cadre of foes seeking to hide some shocking truth, perhaps making the PCs question whether lifelong beliefs have been lies all along. In more extreme cases, the PCs might become victims of gaslighting (perhaps by a [gaslighter mesmerist](archetype-mesmerist/gaslighter)), either in subtle ways or in elaborate experiments - like a dungeon of shifting passages or a deadly puzzle room - meant to drive them insane.",

Psychic magic is an obvious threat in these tales, warping memories and outright controlling the weak willed, but so are illusions, which can manipulate what a victim perceives or thinks he knows. More insidious than monsters in psychological horror stories are the everyday people who manufacture plots to undermine someone's sanity or the individuals whose stresses and delusions become uncontrollable enough to set them on deadly courses-like a deranged individual who makes his home a trap-filled murder pit or a zealot who believes his sins can only be purified with innocent blood.",

These tales typically follow the rampage of a single weapon-wielding psychopath and his targets' desperate attempts to survive. The slasher is usually more than a normal person, possessing a drive or fortitude that makes him more akin to a deadly force of nature. Only bravery and cunning hold any hope of defeating the slasher, and even then, usually only after he has spilled seas of blood.",

Therefore, seclusion is important. Perhaps the PCs-the likely victims-are isolated by geography (on an island, in the mountains), by terrible weather, or by some other physical factor (a flood washed out the road, the PCs are in a labyrinth that's supposedly inescapable). Social factors can also create seclusion. Perhaps the PCs don't speak the language and can't effectively go for help, know the town guard wants to shield the murderer, have a responsibility to stay in a place, or are cursed and can't leave an area. In any case, the PCs are trapped with a menace they're not likely able to physically overcome.",

Elusiveness, relentlessness, and the perception of invincibility are the slasher's greatest weapons. To avoid this, the slasher can't just be an opponent the PCs outmatch, making them have to find ways other than combat to defeat their foe. A GM should make the slasher difficult to fight, but not impossible to defeat. The PCs need to be able to find tools and prepare traps that give them an edge over their foe. Objects meaningful to the slasher (and perhaps his origins) might aid them in their fight. The plot might encourage characters to split up to defeat the slasher and thus make them vulnerable to their foe-see [Splitting the Party](rule/splitting_the_party) for ways to help build tension in situations like this.",

Finally, more monstrous creatures easily become slashers, even though the PCs might have a limited ability to see something of themselves in such foes.

			"Once a GM has decided to create a frightening adventure, what sort of terror should be included? As explained in the discussion of horror subgenres, there are many types of horror. A GM should be able to boil her horror story down to something basic, perhaps even a singular fear. This might be as primal as a fear of spiders or of losing one's teeth, or it could be more sophisticated, like the fear of abandonment or mechanical disasters. Once the GM has chosen a fear, then she can choose an avatar or incarnation of that fear. This might be a monster, person, or other threat that embodies that fear and proliferates it. For example, nothing exploits a fear of spiders quite like giant spiders or spider swarms, while representing the fear of abandonment might require a creature like an [attic whisperer](monster/attic_whisperer) or the spirit of a bitter old man who waits for death but can't be convinced that he's dead. This avatar can be anything a GM wants. Feel free to make it more terrifying or unnatural if that helps-the giant spiders could actually be scheming [Leng spiders](monster/leng_spider), or the attic whisperer might control an army of animated dolls. This can work as mere flavor, or a GM might search out rules (or designs of her own) to back it up. Remember that the chosen threat might not need to be a literal embodiment; for instance, a fear of alien abductions and experimentation is literally embodied by [grays](monster/gray) but also metaphorically embodied by [derros](monster/derro)."

For example, the [tooth fairies](monster/tooth_fairy) that embody the fear of loosing teeth might have created an underground hive constructed from billions of molars, and a mechanical terror could unfold in a half-functioning clock tower. Whatever the choice, it should provide challenges for the characters to overcome, as this - or another later setting - will likely become a sort of dungeon to explore.",

These allies might be less powerful than a primary foe, or at the very least, less actively horrific. For example, the [Leng spiders](monster/leng_spider) might surround themselves with a cult of [ettercaps](monster/ettercap), while the tooth faeries might feed their stolen teeth to a half-slumbering, albino [purple worm](monster/purple_worm).

			"While the Pathfinder rules present a finite number of statistics and rules options, how a GM pieces them together allows for infinite scenarios. In the case of horror adventures, this also means infinite opportunities to shock even the most jaded, rules-obsessed players. Opportunities abound in adventures to surprise the characters by revealing terrible secrets or presenting images that make them realize things are far worse than expected. For example, perhaps the PCs find a life-sized mother doll among the [attic whisperer's](monster/attic_whisperer) collection, one that's tending to a mewling newborn. Or maybe the automatic clockwinder at the top of the clock tower is rebuilding the interior to account for a thirteenth hour that occurs only once every eon.",
			"",
			"While startling revelations in a narrative are most powerful, a GM can also twist the game rules specifically to unsettle the players.",
			"",
			"***Mask Monsters:*** There's no reason a GM must adhere to the basic bestiary descriptions of monsters. By adjusting or completely revising monster descriptions, she gains not only new versatility from the bestiaries, but also the adventure-perfect foe for whatever terror she's unleashed. The PCs might be horrified by the thrashing pile of snakes and maggots that tangle their legs, knocking them into its squirming maws, but behind the GM screen are just the stats for a [wolf](monster/wolf).",
			"",
			"***Transform Monsters:*** Veteran players might immediately identify a ravenous corpse as a [ghoul](monster/ghoul), but if the [tooth fairies](monster/tooth_fairy) have stolen its teeth, perhaps its bite attack is changed to a harmless, wet gnawing. While this might mean the ghoul is less powerful, the shock and revulsion it evokes is far more important to a horror adventure than dealing 1d6 points of damage. Altering creature statistics can be easy, particularly if a GM does so with the intention of creating unsettling encounters, not of making a creature more powerful. Swap around attack types or perhaps exchange abilities with creatures of similar CRs. As long as a GM doesn't intentionally combine powers that can be exploited for some lethal synergy, such a unique encounter should be fine. And if a GM accidentally improvises something that's more deadly than it is narratively unsettling, she can err in the PCs' favor and keep the story moving. The [Rules Improvisation](rule/rules_improvisation) section includes tips on how to make the Pathfinder RPG rules work for a horror tale.",
			"",
			"***Warp Reality:*** The rules are the physics of the game-the laws of what can and can't happen-and sometimes the most unsettling thing a GM can do in horror adventure is plan to break those rules. Maybe the PCs have a bizarre group nightmare, are pursued by a reality warping [mothman](monster/mothman), or begin to lose their minds. Regardless, a GM can convey this by having the game not work the way the PCs expect. Maybe a [detect magic](spell/detect_magic) spell reveals its information as a chorus of screams, an isolated character can momentarily walk on walls, time reverses for an instant, or when a PC tries to use an ability, he's told it doesn't work, without explanation. These tricks work best when used sparingly and when the PCs' lives aren't in jeopardy, because they signal that perhaps the world isn't as reliable (or unbiased) as the characters thought."

			"In most Pathfinder adventures, the PCs are destined to succeed. When running a horror adventure, that doesn't necessarily mean it should be more challenging, and it certainly shouldn't be a guaranteed total party kill. Most of the time, a GM wants the PCs to be unsettled by the story instead of their die rolls, so she should plan for the PCs' success; many adventures have horrific consequences for failure, but in a horror adventure, consider the various ways that success, too, could have horrific consequences.",
			"",
			"During the course of the adventure, the PCs should have numerous victories over lesser enemies, traps, haunts, and other challenges. This is standard for Pathfinder adventures, and a GM should reward the PCs as normal with experience and treasure. Follow the usual rules for awarding experience, but don't save experience just for successful combat encounters. Horror adventures often include investigation, research, and roleplaying encounters. If a GM wants players to take those elements of the game just as seriously as the combat encounters, she can reward them for successes in those arenas-typically with an XP reward equal to their average party level. See the [Encouraging Horror Roleplaying](rule/encouraging_horror_roleplaying) section for more details on using experience in horror adventures.",
			"",
			"Treasure can also be particularly useful in horror adventures, both in revealing more of the plot and in unnerving the PCs. A GM can customize treasure to her adventure's needs. There should rarely be just a +1 dagger lying around in a horror adventure. Rather, that +1 dagger could bear the symbol of the city watch and the letters \"J. B.,\" the initials of the guard who disappeared after claiming he saw spiders drag a dog into the sewers. Even when an encounter just calls for a heap of coins and mundane supplies, don't hesitate to slip in letters, journals, or books the PCs can research to learn more about the plot (though try to avoid the adventure cliche of including a bizarrely specific letter or unnecessary journal entry that directly reveals the story in an awkward and heavy-handed manner). Tidbits that make sense for that NPC and that the PCs can piece together contribute more to the air of mystery and horror. Evidence that the PCs aren't the first to face the horror can be rattling-especially if their predecessors failed-and can also serve as a reason for why magic items perfect for fighting a creature are in its lair. Additionally, rewards that act as a double-edged sword, such as a partially cursed item that provides just what the PCs need at a cost, often work better than cursed items that the PCs could just avoid as if they were other hazards. This gives the PCs the chance to dig their own graves and tempts them to keep the rewards around.",
			"",
			"Finally, a GM should know what success means for her adventure. PCs often assume that violence puts an end to things. For instance, they may think that killing the attic whisperer or setting the clock tower on fire destroys the fear. But fear and evil are notoriously resilient. Truly destroying the horror might require learning its origins or discovering its special weakness. If the attic whisperer continually arises from the ashes, eventually-with a little guidance-the PCs could discover that the creature's father is still alive, and might even be the priest who asked them to put an end to the lonely creature's menace. Of course, even then, it's difficult for the characters within a horror story to know whether an evil is truly exorcised-or merely lying in wait for a sequel."

Stories should be built so the characters expect horrible things before they actually see anything. Situations should get gradually worse and be punctuated by encounters that feature terrible creatures or that provide evidence of gruesome fates. Don't give the characters all of the details, though.

Telling a great story is only part of a horror adventure. The GM still runs a Pathfinder game, and unlike most horror stories, this means the players are not just her audience but also the stars of her story. While she wants to terrify the characters, she wants to give the players the opportunity to dread something as well-to share a sympathetic sort of fear with their characters. While the game's atmosphere can contribute to players' fear, a GM can also subtly alter the roleplaying game experience to sow suspicion and dismay.

Rather than trying to hide that one player has secret information, consider broadcasting it. As soon as the players know they don't share an even footing, matters of trust and suspicion become a choice rather than a foregone conclusion. Consider the following techniques to build suspicion between players.",
			"",
			"***The Secret:*** The GM has one player step outside of the room with her or otherwise out of earshot of the other players. She then provides him with secret information he's learned during the course of play or something only he's noticed. She possibly gets a brief response, then as swiftly as possible, they return to the game table. How and whether that information is shared with the rest of the party is up to the player-but now everyone knows that something special happened to him.",
			"",
			"***The Bluff:*** The GM pulls a player away from the table and asks him how he thinks the game is going, or how his day is, or tells him there's nothing special to reveal. Then they return to the game. Now all the other players think the player has a secret. Even if the player tells the truth and explains that he was pulled away for no reason, who in the party's going to believe him?",
			"",
			"***The Observation:*** The GM pulls a player away and tells him something inconsequential-maybe that his character feels like rats are staring at him, that he never noticed the hint of blond in the bard's hair, or that all the fallen leaves seem to point to the west. Now the player has to wonder whether this is a meaningful secret or just a random observation. Maybe he fixates on it-especially if the GM encourages him to do so. Perhaps he mentions it to the other players, at which point the GM can decide whether to confirm the observation and have the other characters notice too, or to deny it, causing the other characters to mistrust the observer and causing the observer to mistrust her. This works particularly well if a single character has become slightly unhinged or if one character is legitimately more perceptive than the others.",
			"",
			"***The Shell Game:*** Combining the techniques above, the GM calls each player away from the table one at a time. She tells one character something relevant, but provides the others with either nothing or pointless observations. The players who got nothing now have to wonder if they were the only ones, while the player who learned a secret has to wonder what other players learned. This works well in situations where one player has become the GM's coconspirator-perhaps via an enchantment effect on the player's character or by the PC being replaced by a monster."

She might not need this roll for anything at all, but the players won't know that. This works particularly well for refocusing the attention of distracted players.",
			"",
			"***The Stolen Check:*** The GM rolls a d20 and asks a player what his Perception modifier is. She notes the result. Repeat for the entire group-or not. This could just be a technique to make the players wonder if they've missed something, or it could be a legitimate hidden check (there are even several sorts of rolls that generally dictate that they are rolled by the GM). This trick works best when used in both ways throughout a game, leaving the players wondering about any given stolen check. As a variation, the GM might have the players roll 10 Perception checks at the start of the session and keep the results on hand. During the adventure, don't ask players to roll Perception checks, just reference the existing bank for results. That way the players won't know whether they rolled well and noticed all there is or poorly enough that they should search again.",
			"",
			"***Reconsider Game Aides:*** Many Pathfinder adventures feature a variety of tools that encourage strategy and precision gaming. A GM could throw precision out the window. When vague horrors are reduced to pawns and squares, the fearfulness of the unknown withers. Instead, the GM might play faster and looser with game measurements, tracking player arrangements vaguely on whiteboards or in the imagination alone, erring in the PCs' favor in terms of range and movement whenever possible. It takes some experimentation, but GMs can find that players identify more intimately with characters in their heads than with miniatures on the game table."

Whether in a GM's storytelling or how she runs encounters, the following techniques can help add tension to a game.",
			"",
			"***Accentuate the Unnatural:*** The GM is the game's narrator. That doesn't mean she has to be an impartial or reliable narrator. Consider having the world seem to function in ways it shouldn't-or in outright supernatural manners. A creak might sound like a player's name; the wind coming through the window might cease as soon as the PCs enter the room; a rat might stop in the middle of the hall, rise on its back legs, look into the characters' eyes, and whisper \"Beware.\" These elements don't need rules because they're not dangers or things to fight. they're glimpses into the world-a world where something is unsettlingly wrong.",
			"",
			"***Acting with Urgency:*** The GM can describe a battle as being as hectic as she pleases, but if the PCs have lengthy strategic conversations during combat, it loses any hint of urgency. The GM can make the situation's stressfulness real by demanding that PCs act swiftly. Speak quickly and demand to know what a PC will do as soon as his turn comes up in initiative. If he falters or reaches for a book, the GM insists that he either delay his turn or make a decision in 6 seconds or else he loses his action-then begin counting down. The purpose here isn't to cheat players out of turns, but a constrained window of action lets the players share the same strain as their characters. Don't be too much of a stickler about the countdown, especially with players new to the game.",
			"",
			"***Countdown to Terror:*** During a stressful situation, the GM starts a tally of rounds that pass, sets a timer or countdown, or makes a show of accounting for the time-\"This is round three, right\"? Ideally, this countdown leads to an occurrence on a particular round, but it doesn't have to. It could just be a trick to make the PCs worry that something's coming. Alternatively, a GM can strip the mystery away and let the players know something their characters couldn't: that when the countdown ends, something terrible will happen. What? That's up to the GM. But unless the PCs manage to defeat the monster, activate the device, or escape, things are about to get worse.",
			"",
			"***Purposeful Misperceptions:*** The GM tells a PC that he thinks he hears something. When he asks what, he's told he doesn't know, and then can decide whether he investigates further. Maybe the GM tells him he thinks it's nothing-but can he be sure? It could be something the character heard, a shadow he thought he saw move, or even just a memory that pops to mind. Regardless, by giving PCs bits of uncertain or unsettlingly meaningless information, they begin to wonder what's important and what's not, what's real and what's just in their character's head.",
			"",
			"***Refuse Rest:*** When the PCs rest, they recover hit points, spells, and other abilities or elements the adventure has worn down. But when the PCs can't rest, the situation becomes more dire. Spellcasters covet their last spells, healers wait to dole out their last potions, and combatants think more strategically and retreat more readily when their hit points run low. How a GM denies the party rest might involve the adventure needing to occur within a limited span of time or there merely being no convenient safe space. As an alternative, circumstances might prevent a rest from recovering the PCs' resources (for instance, the nightmare spell prevents an arcane spellcaster from preparing spells). While this technique is crucial for portraying dwindling resources and maintaining momentum and tension, use it with care. Players quickly grow frustrated if the restrictions seem artificial rather than tied to the story.",
			"",
			"***Splitting the Party:*** It's relatively common in horror stories for the protagonists to become separated. If this happens in a game, the GM divides the group and sends those who aren't currently playing out of the room-she doesn't want them knowing their allies' fate or distracting the players currently in the limelight. Switch between groups about every 10 or 15 minutes until the group meets back up, trying to end each scene with a group either on a mini-cliffhanger or at a point when they have something to discuss (which can happen away from the table). Keep the party split for as brief a period as possible; not only are divided groups weaker in a fight, but players quickly lose their immersion when away from the game table and forced to put the game on hold."

Few GMs are above fudging a die roll, having a foe die suddenly, or having villains start taking prisoners if bad rolls turn an encounter against the players. Total party kills should be reserved for when they make the best stories, like at the hands of a truly terrible foe.",
			"",
			"Still, sometimes characters die, and it's not always convenient or plausible to stop the adventure to find a cleric capable of restoring them. In such cases, a GM might take it on herself to make a deal with a player, trading a miraculous recovery (and thus, his continued role in the game) for a price she determines. Such a bargain might last for a set period: until the session's end, until it's convenient to make a new character, until the party comes up with a better solution, or-most menacingly-simply until the GM says so. The terms of the deal should be set outside the earshot of the other players, and the PC has the right to refuse. Regardless of the specifics, if the PC accepts, he works for the GM now, a factor that can lend new threats to several sorts of horror games. In all of these cases, the GM should take the blame for the PC's treachery because she doesn't want to cause hurt feelings between players.",

			"***The Doppelganger:*** Inform the PC that he barely survived-but only because he was replaced by a shapeshifting creature at some point in the past. He is now playing a monster with the exact same statistics as his character. When he sees an opportune moment, he should attack or otherwise betray the party to the villain. Once this occurs and the player's monstrous nature is revealed, it raises the question of what happened to the real character: they might now be a prisoner somewhere, waiting to be saved by the others.",
			"",
			"***The Evil Spirit:*** Inform the PC that he died, but his corpse has been animated by an evil spirit. He can continue to play as normal, but when something in particular happens in the story (or simply when the GM says \"now\"), he should turn on the rest of the party or perform some other action prescribed-like attack the paladin. The GM might grant the character some fitting special ability or other monstrous power.",
			"",
			"***The Devil:*** Inform the PC that he died and now stands before a devil, a grim reaper, or something worse. This godlike entity offers to return the PC to life but will come to call later and demand a service. Whatever this service might be, the PC is compelled to comply and also to keep the terms of the bargain secret. Perhaps the GM knows what the entity wants at the bargain's outset, but even if not, this kind of loose thread is perfect for future exploitation."

			"Pathfinder is not a game anyone wins, but it's not uncommon for players to want to overcome challenges in an exceptional fashion or with the minimum expenditure of resources. That means that some players view time spent indulging in terrified reactions and unheroic roleplaying as a waste of time-particularly when such roleplaying arises during combat encounters. If a GM wants her players to care about and emphasize not just roleplaying but also reacting to horror, it's up to her to encourage it-or at least not to penalize it. To incentivize her players into displaying frightened reactions, she can point them toward the [Playing a Horror Hero](rule/playing_a_horror_hero) discussion, and consider employing the following techniques.",
			"",
			"***Time for Terror:*** Many players' first reaction to a threat, no matter how overwhelming, will be to fight. Before rolling initiative for a particularly terrifying scene, the GM can ask the players whether any of them would like to use the instant before combat for a terrified reaction. This is not a surprise round or any other in-game unit of measurement, but rather a special instance for characters who want to play up their reaction to the scene with a free action like yelling a warning, dropping an object, falling backward, or shrieking. In this way, the GM rewards players who want to express their shock and gets the group's reactions all at once, rather than drawing out the first round of combat.",
			"",
			"***Reward Terror:*** Whenever a player does something that improves the game's story, enhances the session's atmosphere, or just seems cool, the GM can give the party an ad hoc experience award. There are few more powerful ways to encourage behavior that benefits the game than with immediate positive reinforcement, and the GM has an endless supply of experience points to dole out. This shouldn't be much, maybe as little as 50 XP at lower levels, maybe creeping up to 200 XP at higher levels-nothing that feels like a game-changer. Even then, though, a little reward can serve as a strong incentive to encourage good roleplaying and story investment. Best of all, it encourages not just one player but the entire group to prioritize behavior the GM rewards."

			"Some GMs make the mistake of thinking that if a frightening gimmick works for a haunted house or campfire story, then it will work for their horror adventures. Such is rarely the case. At best, overdoing it on artificial, half-creepy tricks can break the atmosphere and distract from the game. At worst, they become jokes or can upset players. As a rule, a GM should keep a horror game on the game table. Here are a few gimmicks to absolutely avoid.",

			"Since playing Pathfinder can take up a considerable area, the size of which is often limited by any number of practical constraints, game space can be one of the most difficult environmental factors to influence. If the GM has a choice, though, she can seek a quiet place where interruptions will be few-traffic and background noise can negatively impact the atmosphere being created. If she has to share a space, it might help for the GM to tell non-players that she's running a game and would appreciate not being interrupted, or she might schedule a time when disturbances will be limited. While a GM might consider running the game outside or in creepy surroundings like a crypt or cabin in the woods, keep in mind that such a venue could be distracting in itself and is probably more trouble than it's worth."

Make sure that the players can see, though-there's a lot of reading and page referencing in Pathfinder that GMs don't want to turn into a chore. A room with lights on a dimmer switch works well, as does turning off overhead lighting and moving a single-bulb lamp into the room. Candles and non-electric lamps typically prove distracting and troublesome, if not outright hazardous. While rooms with natural lighting can create issues during the day, at night, the dark can make them prime game spaces."

			"Used well, music can be a powerful tool for creating atmosphere. Handled poorly, it can be a major distraction that irreparably warps, or even completely ruins, a game's mood. When a GM uses music in her horror game, the goal is to create a subtle but ever-present auditory undercurrent that reinforces her descriptions of settings and events. The music fills in gaps in the action with content that supports the story's atmosphere. Often breaks in play get filled in with distractions, but effective musical choices can counter that. Consider the following tips when selecting music to include in a horror adventure.",
			"",
			"***Avoid the Familiar:*** Music should evoke a theme, but not a specific scene or character. Therefore, be wary of using immediately recognizable songs. Players who identify a particular theme will naturally associate a game with the source's events, often to distracting ends.",
			"",
			"***Keep It Simple:*** Don't let tinkering with audio devices or searching for the perfect song get in the way of a game. Assemble a playlist before the game. Select a theme for major NPCs and significant events, a few for prominent locations, one or two for battles, and one for a final battle. If a GM can run her music from a computer or phone, preferably linked to a wireless speaker, she can readily switch between tracks without leaving the game table.",
			"",
			"***Repetition:*** RPG scenes usually last longer than a typical music track. Rather than assembling dozens of pieces of music for every event or location in a game, find songs that work well in repetition. Video game scores work well for this as they're often designed with repeat listening in mind. Set a music player to repeat a track, changing it when the scene or story demands. Avoid songs that have an obvious element to them, like a particularly dramatic crescendo-so players don't notice the same section every time. In the best cases, players will notice the music for only a few moments at a time before their attention shifts back to the game.",
			"",
			"***Steady Mood, No Lyrics:*** A GM shouldn't have to compete with the music for the players' attention. When selecting music for a game, instrumental music that fades into the background is ideal. Avoid music with lyrics, as language distracts from what's being said and is noticed more readily when it repeats. By the same token, a GM wants songs that inspire a consistent mood. If a piece jumps from somber to upbeat, it won't serve when needed for one or the other.",
			"",
			"***Volume Manipulation:*** Most times, a GM wants background music to be low and subtle so players focus on the game. That said, manipulating volume allows her to create a number of special effects. Try using the music's volume to manipulate player attention. If the players' attention drifts, a GM can slowly turn up the volume until their focus shifts back to her. Once they've noticed she's waiting or has begun speaking, she can turn it back down. This is a fantastic way to end breaks and signal that play is restarting.",
			"",
			"***Volume Matching:*** In action-packed scenes, a GM can turn an energetic track up and raise her voice over it, quickening her speech's tempo to evoke a sense of urgency. If everyone has to speak louder to be heard over the music, it's easier to envision the hectic or dangerous nature of the accompanying scene. As with all narrative special effects, this technique works best when used infrequently."

			"Portable games, social media, and other hobbies vie for everyone's attention. A GM, though, is the arbiter of the rules, both those in the game books and in her own house rules. Consider setting a simple house rule: When at the game table, the group is playing Pathfinder- and nothing else. Phones are away, computers are off, other hobbies and distractions-even RPG-related ones like painting miniatures-are set aside. The GM might expand this to most food and drink as well since eating and the presence of food containers undermine immersion.",
			"",
			"There are a number of reasons to adopt such rules. The first is simple engagement. Some players say they can do two things at once, but if they're not focused on the game, they're not imagining the story, thinking in character, or noticing the atmosphere. The second is a matter of verisimilitude. The characters likely don't have electronic devices. It's easier for everyone to envision their fellow players as their characters if they're not engaged in activities that run counter to what's possible in the game world. The final reason is just a matter of courtesy. A GM puts thought and time into an adventure, and the other players invest a similar degree of consideration in developing their characters. Just as an audience would in any other storytelling medium, players should repay such efforts with their respectful attention.",
			"",
			"If including rules for what is and isn't allowed at a game table, the GM should make them clear before the game starts, possibly explaining why or showing players this section of text as reasoning.

			"It's impossible to predict every character action, and Game Masters often have to improvise when a party follows an unanticipated plot thread. While GMs can cultivate the ability to remain flexible in the face of unpredictability, coming up with new plot elements on the fly is only one challenge. Creating and employing new rules without any preparation is another one entirely. In the context of a horror adventure, such rules improvisation is not only useful, but all the more critical, as interruptions and page flipping can ruin a scene's atmosphere, while a quick improvised decision can keep the tension intact.",
			"",
			"Fortunately, as a benefit of being a well-developed game system, the Pathfinder RPG offers guidelines and subsystems for adjudicating hundreds of hazards and encounter types. Still, the game rules can't account for everything. In such cases, it's up to the GM to use her knowledge of the rules to improvise options. Coming up with quick, simple ways to support characters who find themselves in unique situations or who want to attempt audacious actions is usually preferable to avoiding such game-defining events. Depending on the case, a GM might ask players to merely roll an ability or skill check, setting a DC that seems appropriate. Another option-which can often be more fun-involves considering the situation and adapting existing rules to work for the game's needs.",
			"",
			"The remainder of this section presents a variety of situations that might appear in a horror adventure, but for which concrete rules don't exist. Each of the following sections references existing Pathfinder RPG rules that GMs could retrofit to handle the encounter. These aren't definitive rules for any of the situations described below. Instead, they are a primer on customizing rules to meet specific needs, and they should help GMs look beyond the overt purpose of certain rules systems and identify precedents and components that might be repurposed in unlimited ways.",

			"While encyclopedic knowledge of existing rules certainly helps with improvising new ones, it's not necessary by any means. The majority of the time, existing rules supply all the direction needed. In cases where they don't, don't worry! Almost everything in the Pathfinder RPG comes down to the roll of a d20. So the main questions are often simply how high to set a DC and what sort of bonus the PC should apply to it. While the latter is largely thematic and up to the GM's judgment, setting DCs can get a bit more technical. Fortunately, the likelihood of a too-high or toolow DC \"ruining\" an adventure is infinitesimal, especially when taking the following into account.",
			"",
			"***Custom DCs:*** Need to generate a DC for a specific situation on the fly? Look at tables like those for the Acrobatics, Bluff, Escape Artist, and other skills and extrapolate whether the challenge should be harder or easier based on the DC precedents there. GMs can find some great charts for adhoc DCs for parties of various levels in the sections on [social conflicts](rule/social_conflicts) and [influence](rule/influence).",
			"",
			"***Monster Statistics:*** Need something other than a DC? [Table 1-1](rule/step_2_target_statistics) provides a wealth of level-appropriate benchmarks for creature hit points, Armor Class, damage, saving throw DCs, and more. These aren't just for monsters, though. Consider finding the party's level and using these statistics for any challenge required, increasing or decreasing the figures as necessary to adjust the difficulty."

Even if he's able to move, the coffin itself and the earth beyond present nearly insurmountable barriers to escape. Relevant to these challenges are the [Escape Artist skill](skill/escape_artist), [rules on hardness](rule/smashing_an_object), and details on [cave-ins and collapses](rule/cave-ins_and_collapses_cr_8), as well as the bury alive ability of the [gravebound](monster/gravebound), which uses the aforementioned systems to determine the ability's effects, including the amount of time it takes to dig up a buried character, with or without a shovel.",
			"",
			"***Extrapolation:*** The Escape Artist skill allows a character to move through a tight space by spending 1 minute and succeeding at a DC 30 Escape Artist check. This seems similar to the difficulty of moving within a coffin. As such, the GM might rule that for any action requiring motion to be successful-such as producing an item, making an attack, casting a spell, and so on-the character must spend 1 minute and succeed at this check.",
			"",
			"As for the coffin itself, a normal casket is probably of similar quality to a good wooden door or treasure chest, which would mean it has a hardness of 5 and 15 hit points. As soon as the coffin is broken, though, things get much worse for the character who was buried alive. According to the rules on cave-ins and collapses, characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried. If such a character falls unconscious, he must succeed at a DC 15 Constitution check each minute. If he fails this check, he takes 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute until freed or dead. Thus, a GM might rule that a character can attempt a DC 20 Strength check every minute. If the character succeeds, he manages to clear enough dirt to drag himself upward 1 foot. At that rate, then, it would require six successful Strength checks for a character to dig himself free from a coffin buried 6 feet underground. This, of course, assumes that loose dirt covers the coffin. Other substances, like rocks or metal slabs, would make such a dig far more difficult, at the least, if not outright impossible.",

Tiny or smaller creatures would not have their movement restricted in a coffin constructed for a Medium creature. [Crawling hands](monster/crawling_hand), [rot grubs](infestation/rot_grubs), [scarlet spiders](monster/scarlet_spider), and [vipers](monster/viper) all make particularly horrible coffinmates, particularly if they're crawling all over the character in swarms. Additionally, breaking out of a coffin and finding himself underwater, buried in a walled-off enclosure, or at the bottom of a tank of flesh-eating beetles might make a character quickly regret his escape."

With rules for heat damage, catching fire, and-most realistically-smoke inhalation, the forest fire rules can be combined with the [grapple rules for tying someone up](rule/grapple) to provide everything necessary for binding a character to a stake and lighting the roaring flames.",
			"",
			"***Extrapolation:*** Binding a character to a stake-and setting a DC to escape said bindings-can be covered by the tie-up options detailed in the grapple combat maneuver. Once the character is bound, likely amid heaps of unlit kindling, the process of starting the fire is relatively simple. Given dry conditions and a ready flame, a GM might rule that it takes 1 minute to get the fire burning to a point that smoke inhalation becomes a threat to a bound victim. After some initial encouragement, the fire takes over; after 1 minute, the victim begins taking 1d6 points of fire damage every round while facing additional Fortitude saving throws as detailed in the heat damage portion of the forest fire rules. Finally, 1 minute later and every minute after that, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or catch fire, as per the [catching on fire rules](rule/catching_on_fire). Characters still bound to the stake take a -4 penalty on this saving throw.",

Cages and magical paralysis are more effective at restraining victims, while illusions can lure unfortunates into traps.

Characters counting squares to move out of a dungeon as swiftly as possible hardly captures the adrenaline of panicked flight, rather resembling a chess endgame. But the rules for [chases](rule/chases) work more like a race against the clock and thus fit the situation far better than combat rounds would.",

The GM can simply do away with the \"fleeing character\" entirely (unless the PCs are also chasing another character out of the collapsing structure) and instead set out a slate of obstacle the PCs must overcome to get out of the structure in time.",
			"",
			"These might include dodging falling timbers, leaping across gaps in the floor, noticing paths that circumvent dangers, squeezing through narrow gaps in the rubble, fighting off the effects of smoke inhalation, and so on. Some challenges might allow characters to charge through walls of flame, weakened barriers, or splintering banisters, causing them to take hit point damage in exchange for successes. Typically these barriers deal an appropriate amount of damage to add to the sense of urgency for characters of the PCs' level without making the barriers themselves harmful enough to kill the PCs-unless they press their luck on these damaging barriers one too many times. In total, the GM should establish a number of challenges just like she would for a normal chase, but replace the threat of a fleeing character \"getting away\" with the threat of the PCs failing to escape the crumbling structure before it's too late.",
			"",
			"This does mean that all the PCs will have to navigate the escape all the way to its end, or die trying. This means that it's more important than usual to consider each of the pairings in the chase and make sure to include at least one option in each pairing that the characters will be able to attempt. For example, pairing a DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) check with a high DC Escape Artist check might mean that the paladin can't possibly pass that chase square; for a normal chase, this would put the paladin out of the action for a little while, but in this modified chase, it means the paladin might be guaranteed to die.",

If they're allowed to do so, perhaps any character near an adjacent obstacle can use the aid another action to assist another character.

This should be a number of turns that exceeds the number of challenges by 2 or 3 (or even fewer in particularly harrowing situations).

Consider the following three options.",

Immediately after the last PC escapes, the structure collapses, implying that the characters escaped at the last possible moment.",
			"",
			"***Heightened Danger:*** Once the time limit expires, the situation in the structure becomes increasingly dangerous. Perhaps anyone still in the structure now takes damage every round. This might begin as 1d6 points of fire damage (or whatever is appropriate), but every 2 or 3 rounds the amount of damage doubles, suggesting a worsening situation. Or in the case of an alien sanctum falling apart into an unknowable void, perhaps strange and dangerous creatures crawl their way out of the nothingness with increasing frequency. Either way, this makes lagging behind dangerous, but not immediately fatal.",
			"",
			"***Near-Fatal Conclusion:*** The GM might rule that, once the timer expires, the structure collapses-a fate that probably means death for anyone trapped inside. See the [Cave-Ins and Collapses](rule/cave-ins_and_collapses_cr_8) rules. The GM might add the threat of additional damage to those trapped within (or who try to rescue those left behind) if the conditions call for it-like dealing additional fire damage to those caught beneath a collapsed burning ruin.",
			"",
			"***Horror Considerations:*** Write a 10 on a whiteboard or set a die at 10 in front of the PCs. After their first turn trying to escape, change the number to 9. Decrease the number every turn. A generous GM might let them know that when the count reaches 0, the structure collapses (to whatever terrible end; consider the rules for [cave-ins and collapses](rule/cave-ins_and_collapses_cr_8)) or not. In either case, few things motivate a group like a ticking clock. Beyond collapsing structures, PCs may need to flee a burning topiary garden, a tsunami-battered village, the nightmare of a waking dreamer, a city being destroyed by [kaiju](family/kaiju), or a forest come to life."

			"Whether by the snapping of a neck or lengthy strangulation, hanging is a time-tested form of execution, and stories abound of heroes rescuing a victim in the nick of time.",
			"",
			"***By the Rules:*** Being hanged kills by either breaking the victim's neck or strangling the victim. Breaking the neck implies a quick, instant death from damage, like a [coup de grace](rule/helpless_defenders). Getting into a noose (and the DC for escaping it) would be covered by the [tie up aspect of the grapple rules](rule/grapple). Strangulation suggests consulting the rules for [suffocation](rule/suffocation).",
			"",
			"***Extrapolation:*** How a PC might have wound up in a noose is up to the GM, but once he has, a few things might occur. If the execution involves a drop, the noose could deal 1d6 points of damage + 1d6 for every 5 feet he falls, to a maximum of 20d6. The victim is considered helpless, and this attack is treated as a coup de grace-requiring a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + damage dealt) to avoid death. If the character has his hands free and uses them to hold on to the noose during the drop, he gains a +2 bonus on this saving throw.",
			"",
			"Once a character has survived the drop (or if one never occurred), his time is still limited as the noose chokes him to death. As the rules for tying someone up describe, a character can bind someone, creating a situation where the DC to escape such bonds is equal to 20 + the rope-tying character's CMB. This seems like a good way to set a DC for escaping a noose. A character can attempt to escape a noose, but doing so requires that his hands be free (otherwise, he must escape from those restraints first). Once they are, he can attempt to break the noose's \"grapple\". While dangling from a noose, a character is helpless.",
			"",
			"***Horror Considerations:*** A noose quickly turns into a lifeline when the ground is hundreds of feet below a struggling victim. Nooses made of chain or metal cord might also be more difficult to escape."

			"Be it a misbehaving reflection, a whispering taxidermy, or a leering portrait, sometimes the most minor supernatural effect-noticeable as the subtlest feeling of wrongness-proves the most unsettling.",

			"",
			"***Extrapolation:*** A purely thematic or otherwise harmless haunt probably shouldn't grant experience points and so shouldn't have a CR.",

GMs don't need to explain every thematic effect or unnerving embellishment, especially when these exist in the space between supernatural manifestations and the PCs' own uncertain observations. If a situation doesn't require hard-and-fast rules, a GM doesn't need to complicate things."
