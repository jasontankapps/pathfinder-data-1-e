			"One of the most beloved and common adventuring sites in the game is the dungeon. In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the word \"dungeon\" has a much wider definition than merely an underground prison cell; instead, \"dungeon\" in this section refers to a connected series of rooms and hallways within which are scattered numerous encounters with monsters, traps, and other challenges. A dungeon, under this definition, could be the underground levels of a fortress, the fortress itself, a series of caverns, a basement under a house, the house itself, a lonely tower in the woods, a shipwreck, a treasure vault, an abandoned crypt, or any other location that has a series of hard boundaries to limit exploration. Generally, these boundaries are represented by solid walls, but in some cases they can be dense vegetation (such as in a hedge maze), treacherous cliffs (for a series of mountain ledges), or even a fence enclosing a large area (like a graveyard). The key defining feature of a dungeon is simply that the encounter areas are connected and self-contained.",
			"",
			"There's a reason that dungeons are so common in the game: they represent the simplest method of constructing an adventure, since a dungeon map really is nothing more than a flow chart. At their most basic, the chambers of a dungeon represent decision points and the hallways represent paths between those points. The layout of a dungeon removes many variables from the game, allowing the GM to focus on a limited number of areas that he knows the PCs are likely to visit. Since you know what rooms and what routes are available before the game even begins, you can prepare for encounters much more easily than you can for an adventure set in a city or the wilderness, where the flow chart concept is no longer literally represented by the solid stone walls and becomes more of an abstract guide for plotting purposes."

			"Just because dungeons are some of the simplest adventure sites to build and run doesn't mean that they need to be simplistic. A dungeon can be quite complex, filled with intrigue and dynamic elements. The first thing to do when creating a dungeon for your players to explore is to decide on the dungeon's basic concept: what kind of dungeon it is. Are you building an underground complex of chambers below a ruined castle occupied by a tribe of goblins? Is the dungeon a series of caves burrowing through a volcanic mountain ruled by fire giants? Is it an immense shipwreck at the bottom of the sea? A wizard's tower that has sunk into a swamp? A haunted mine? A partially collapsed manor? A dragon's lair? Choosing a basic concept for your dungeon at the beginning helps guide the creative process of mapping and populating it."

			"For the same reasons it's good to outline a story before writing it, it's good to create the map of your dungeon before populating it with encounters. The map is the outline of the dungeon adventure, after all; in drawing the map, you set the boundaries of what your adventure will contain. You should certainly have a general idea of the types of encounters your dungeon will need when you start, but don't be afraid to let the dungeon drawing itself inspire you as well.",
			"",
			"One important thing to realize at the outset is that your dungeon map doesn't have to be pretty - it merely has to be legible and understandable to you or whoever will be using the map. Nonetheless, cultivating some skill at cartography can really help you keep yourself organized; it's easier to come back to a legible map you drew years ago than it is to one that's barely more than chicken scratchings.",
			"",
			"A good way to build skill at mapping dungeons is to copy them from published products. Get yourself a big pad or notebook filled with graph paper. Whenever you see a nice map in one of those products, pick up a pen or pencil and try to duplicate that map. Before long, you'll be drawing your own maps - and it can't hurt to keep drawing maps even when you aren't preparing for a specific game."

		"description": [
			"{SOURCE GameMastery Guide/174}",
			"",
			"Using a pencil, sketch out the basic shape of your map. You can indicate the position and relative size of rooms by simply drawing rough shapes and circles and then labeling each \"kitchen,\" \"library,\" \"owlbear lair,\" and so on. If your dungeon is in an aboveground structure or other location with a definite border, draw this in to constrain your design. Once you're happy with the basic shape, go ahead and start drawing rooms and hallways, then drop in symbols for dungeon features. Make notes in the margins or in rooms to remind you of ideas for the rooms' contents as you create them.",
			"",
			"Here are several things to keep in mind while you're creating your map:",
			"",
			"***Map Symbols:*** Use symbols to represent common features found in most dungeons: doors, stairs, traps, pillars, and more. Using standardized map symbols keeps your maps from becoming too cluttered with written notes and tags.",
			"",
			"***Avoid Empty Rooms:*** Unless you're specifically designing a dungeon that is partially abandoned or you're trying to lull your PCs into a false sense of security, don't add too many empty rooms, as they can clutter your map.",
			"",
			"***Don't Overdraw:*** If you have an idea of how many encounters you want or how long you want a session of dungeon exploration to run, don't build a dungeon that's too small or too big. Take note of how long it generally takes your group to play through an average encounter (whether 10 minutes, a half-hour, an hour, or whatever) and design with that timeframe in mind. If your group generally clears one room an hour and you want the dungeon to take up two 5-hour sessions, make sure the dungeon contains only about 10 rooms.",
			"",
			"***Leave Room for Expansion:*** Unless you're certain you don't want to return to your dungeon later or want it to serve as a truly enclosed area, it's usually a good idea to include some sort of concession toward future expansion. A tunnel running off the edge of the map, a river or large underground pool, or a large pit can all lead the way to new areas just beyond the boundaries of your creation.",
			"",
			"***Avoid Symmetry:*** Refrain from creating symmetrical dungeons in which one half is an exact mirror image of the other - not only is this somewhat unrealistic, but it robs the players of the thrill of exploration once they realize that they only have to explore half of a dungeon to see it all.",
			"",
			"***Vary Room Shapes:*** Just as symmetry is bad, so is over-reliance on square or rectangular rooms. By including strangely shaped rooms, alcoves, multilevel rooms, irregular caverns, and other variations in room size and shape, you not only provide each room's combat encounters with different tactical elements, but your map becomes a more interesting location to draw, look at, and play in.",
			"",
			"***Wide Corridors:*** Remember that combat in the Pathfinder RPG is based on 5-foot squares. If you fill your dungeon with 5-foot-wide hallways, you're not only forcing many prospective battles to narrow down to one-on-one conflicts between one monster and one player, you're also making it more difficult for monsters of Large size or bigger to live in or move about in your dungeon. Also keep the size of the dungeon's inhabitants in mind; if your dungeon is a cloud giant's floating castle, for example, the rooms and corridors should be giant-sized, not human-sized."

			"Once you're happy with your map sketch, grab your pens and start inking it. You can use different pens to denote different features on your map; a wide felt-tip pen works well for thick walls, for example, while a fine-tipped pen works better for details like doors and map symbols. Once you've inked the map, erase extraneous pencil lines (keeping any notes you want to save, of course). Next, get your coloring supplies and add color as necessary: blue for water, green for vegetation, or whatever works best. If you color in nothing else, use black to fill in areas of solid stone to help define the actual parts of the map your players can explore.",
			"",
			"You can scan your map at this stage as well and use a paint program to color larger areas. Scanning a map and using image manipulation software is also a great way to correct errors you made during the inking process."

Details such as furniture (tables, chairs, beds, and chests are all good examples), light sources (fireplaces or firepits, windows, skylights, and so on), and architectural features add a touch of realism to inhabited dungeons. Be careful not to add too many extra details to the map, however - not only can they clutter your map and obscure important information, but they can have a detrimental effect on combat as well. Remember that characters and monsters need room to fight and maneuver, and a room filled with superfluous furniture can make combat overly complex."

			"Once you've created your dungeon map, you're ready to populate it. If you're building a static dungeon, you can simply fill it with traps and guardians and other challenges as you wish, with little concern as to how each area interacts with the others.",
			"",
			"But if you're building a living dungeon, there are more considerations you'll want to address. In particular, if your dungeon is the lair for a number of living creatures, keep in mind that they don't just sit in their rooms in stasis waiting for a group of heroes to blunder into their clutches - at least, dungeon denizens don't always behave this way. Usually, you'll want to design your dungeon with its ecology in mind.",
			"",
			"***Food and Water:*** If there's not a constant source of food in or nearby your dungeon, your monsters will need storerooms in which to stockpile their food. Even if there is a handy supply of food, monsters whose territories are blocked from access to these ready supplies will need some sort of concession toward food and water. A river running through a dungeon is a handy way to supply both of these necessities, as are magic items like [decanters of endless water](magic-wondrous/decanter_of_endless_water), [rings of sustenance](magic-ring/ring_of_sustenance), and [sustaining spoons](magic-wondrous/sustaining_spoon). Finally, including a cleric of at least 5th level in a group gives that group access to {spell/create food and water} spells.",
			"",
			"***Shelter and Access:*** All of your dungeon denizens need somewhere to live. The main thing to keep in mind here is that a monster's lair should be sized appropriately for the monster. The larger the monster, the larger its lair needs to be. As a general rule, it's good to give a monster living space that's at least nine times its own space. And unless you want your monster to be trapped in its lair, make sure it can access other parts of the dungeon, including an exit (by squeezing, at minimum)."

			"Most dungeons feature a variety of encounter archetypes. By including encounters from as many of these archetypes as possible, you can keep your dungeon from feeling repetitive and give different characters the opportunity to shine. Even better, it's a lot easier to keep your players' attention if they're not sure how the next room around the corner will challenge them. Listed here are seven different encounter archetypes.",
			"",
			"***Combat:*** In a combat encounter, the PCs are faced with a foe or foes that bar progress: in order to complete the encounter, the PCs must defeat the foes in combat. A combat encounter can be with a single opponent or a group of foes. In most dungeons, combat encounters are the rule.",
			"",
			"***Hazard/Obstacle:*** This kind of encounter presents the characters with a dangerous condition they need to navigate in order to proceed. A room filled with [yellow mold](rule/slimes_molds_and_fungi), a chasm with a rotten rope bridge, a pool of lava, an unstable chamber with a crumbling ceiling, or even something as simple as a barricaded door can serve as a hazard or obstacle. Generally, a hazard or obstacle is an encounter that is solved not through combat but through a combination of skill checks, saving throws, attack rolls, and the application of magic spells.",
			"",
			"***Puzzle:*** A puzzle encounter presents the players, not the characters, with a challenge. These can be riddles, shifting tiles, mazes, word puzzles, or anything else that must be solved by brain power, logic, or experimentation. Often a puzzle encounter can be enhanced by giving the players a handout or prop that lets them directly manipulate or study the puzzle. A puzzle generally can't be solved with die rolls, but if your group gets stuck on a puzzle, you should consider letting them make appropriate skill checks to learn clues (or even the solution) from you.",
			"",
			"***Random Encounter:*** A random encounter is an unusual encounter that isn't tied to a specific location in your dungeon. The classic method of building random encounters is to create an encounter table of possible encounters (see {rule/Dungeon Toolbox} for several sample dungeon encounter tables). Then, when a random encounter is called for, you can simply roll the dice and let fate determine what the PCs run into.",
			"",
			"Traditionally, checks for wandering monsters from a random encounter table are made every so often (either once per hour, four times a day, every time the PCs rest, or whatever works best for you) by rolling d100. A heavily populated area with lots of potential encounters might have a 20% or higher chance of a random encounter occurring at each check, while a remote or relatively empty area might have only a 2% chance per check.",
			"",
			"It's important not to let random encounters become the adventure, though - an endless parade of wandering monsters can quickly turn into a dull slog through forgettable combats, and a poorly timed or unlucky roll can impose a powerful foe on a party when they're in no shape to cope with it. Random encounters should be used as sparingly as possible; they're a great tool to use when play bogs down (such as if the PCs insist on resting after every encounter or exhaustively searching a huge, empty room), but they shouldn't become the dungeon's defining theme.",
			"",
			"***Story Encounter:*** Since story encounters rarely involve any actual danger or impediment to physical progress through a dungeon, they are often forgotten during the design process. Yet in some ways, story encounters are the most important encounter type of them all, for they allow the players to learn about your dungeon and world. There's no point in creating a multi-page history for a dungeon if there's no way for your players to learn about it! A story encounter can come in the form of a roleplayed conversation with a friendly dungeon denizen or talkative ghost, a carving on a wall, an old journal, or even just an opportunity for a player to make a Knowledge check when faced with a particularly unusual scene in a dungeon to learn more about the dungeon's story.",
			"",
			"***Trap:*** These classic encounters are similar to hazards and obstacles in that they are generally dangerous and can be defeated with a combination of skill checks, saving throws, attack rolls, and the application of magic spells. Their primary difference from hazards is that traps are hidden from view and, unless the player characters are careful, can strike without warning. As a general rule, you should use traps sparingly, since randomly springing traps on a group only serves to slow down the course of play as increasingly paranoid players check every 5-foot square and every doorknob for hidden perils. Often, it's a simple matter of giving the players some kind of warning beforehand that they're heading into a trapped area; story encounters are great for this purpose.",
			"",
			"***Special Encounters:*** Finally, you can include special encounters. The easiest way to make a special encounter is to combine two or more of the archetypes listed above into a single encounter; a battle against fire elementals in a burning building is a combination combat and hazard encounter. A riddling sphinx that attacks any group that can't answer her riddle within 24 seconds is a combination puzzle and combat encounter. A [chase](rule/chases) can serve as a special encounter, as can purely roleplaying encounters. One particularly important special encounter that every dungeon should have is the \"climactic\" encounter, where the PCs confront one of the dungeon's rulers or reach the goal of their delve. A climactic encounter should usually be a deadly or epic encounter (typically with a CR of 3 or 4 above the average party level), and often combines three or more of the above archetypes (usually combat, hazard, and story)."

			"It happens to every adventuring party - you power through half dozen or so encounters and suddenly the prospect of facing the tougher encounters at the end of the dungeon with your depleted resources seems foolish.

			"",

When a group of PCs decides to rest in a dungeon, decide if the threats that remain will challenge the adventurers - if you know that they need to recover their strength, you should let them rest (but only after instilling a little bit of paranoia by getting a schedule of watches and details on how they fortify their campsite). But if you know that the group still has the resources to forge ahead, feel free to have wandering monsters come by to harass the characters while they relax.",
			"",
			"If your PCs are habitual dungeon relaxers who rest after every encounter, the dungeon's inhabitants should catch on after a few naps and set up some ambushes or assaults on the characters' campsite.

			"A called shot is an attack aimed at a particular part of the body, in the hope of gaining some extra effect from the attack. The smaller or better guarded the area, the more difficult the called shot. A called shot is a single attack made as a full-round action, and thus can't be combined with a charge, feats like {feat/Vital Strike}, or multiple attacks with a full-attack action.",
			"",
			"Called shots are divided into three basic difficulty groups: easy, tricky, and challenging. Easy called shots represent large areas of the body, and are made at a -2 penalty. They have relatively minor effects unless a critical hit is scored or massive damage is dealt. Tricky called shots represent either smaller areas, like a hand, or areas a creature protects well, like its head. Tricky shots receive a -5 penalty, and inflict more serious consequences. Challenging called shots represent very small areas like eyes, fingers, or creatures' necks. They receive a -10 penalty, and successful hits cause significant short-term impairment. Beyond these challenging ratings lie almost impossible called shots that receive a -20 penalty. For called shots against non-humanoid creatures, use common sense and the categories above as guidelines. For example, a flying creature's wings are treated as arms.",

From a story perspective, this is because the effect cannot distinguish between a hit in general and a hit in a particular area, but it's also necessary to keep the power of such abilities in line with their original intended effects.

The Constitution bleed damage caused by a debilitating blow to the vitals can only be stopped by {spell/regenerate} (spell or [special ability](umr/regeneration)), magical healing that heals as many points of damage (from one or more sources) as the original blow dealt, or a DC 20 Heal check that takes 1d4 rounds to complete."

Does the sly rogue avoid detection as she sneaks into the giant chieftain's lair? Does the pious cleric finish casting her healing spell before the rain of arrows ends the life of her companions? Just a few die rolls decide each of these critical moments, and while failure is always a possibility, true heroes find a way to succeed, despite the odds. Hero points represent this potential for greatness. They give heroes the chance to succeed even when the dice turn against them.",

Aside from these basic rules, awarding additional hero points is up to the GM. The following options are just some of the ways that a GM might award additional hero points.",
			"",
			"***Character Story:*** GMs can award a hero point for the completion of a written character backstory. This reward encourages players to take an active role in the history of the game. In addition, the GM can use this backstory to generate a pivotal moment for your character concerning his past. When this key event is resolved, the GM can reward another hero point. Alternatively, the GM might award a hero point for painting a miniature or drawing a character portrait in the likeness of your character, helping the rest of the group visualize your hero.",
			"",
			"***Completing Plot Arcs:*** The GM might award a hero point to each of the PCs who were involved in completing a major chapter or arc in the campaign story. These hero points are awarded at the conclusion of the arc if the PCs were successful or advanced the story in a meaningful way.",
			"",
			"***Faith:*** In a campaign where the gods play an important role in every character's life, hero points might represent their favor. In such a setting, the GM can award hero points to characters whenever they uphold the tenets of their faith in a grand way, or whenever they take on one of the faith's major enemies. Such hero points might be temporary, and if not spent on the task at hand, they fade away.",
			"",
			"***Group Service:*** The GM can award hero points for acts outside the game as well. Buying pizza for the group, helping to clean up afterwards, or even hosting the game for a night might be worth a hero point. This sort of hero point should be given out of generosity, not as a payment.",
			"",
			"***Heroic Acts:*** Whenever a character performs an exceptionally heroic act, she can be awarded a hero point. This might include anything from slaying an evil dragon when the rest of the group has fled to rescuing townsfolk from a burning building despite being terribly wounded. It does not have to be related to combat. Convincing the reticent king to send troops to help with a bandit problem or successfully jumping a wide chasm might earn a character a hero point, depending on the circumstances. Note that a hero point should only be awarded if the PC involved did not spend a hero point to accomplish the task.",
			"",
			"***Return from the Dead:*** When a character dies, she does not lose any hero points she has accumulated. If she died with no hero points remaining, she gains 1 hero point when she is brought back from the dead through powerful magic, such as {spell/raise dead} or {spell/resurrection}.",
			"",

You can use a hero point to grant this bonus to another character, as long as you are in the same location and your character can reasonably affect the outcome of the roll (such as distracting a monster, shouting words of encouragement, or otherwise aiding another with the check). Hero points spent to aid another character grant only half the listed bonus (+4 before the roll, +2 after the roll).",

			"",
			"**Special:** You can petition the GM to allow a hero point to be used to attempt nearly anything that would normally be almost impossible. Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the GM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spellcaster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use Diplomacy to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional hero points may be spent on such an attempt, either by the character or her allies.",
			"",
			"***Cheat Death:*** A character can spend 2 hero points to cheat death. How this plays out is up to the GM, but generally the character is left alive, with negative hit points but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 hero points, the GM decides that the arrow pierced the character's holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. Cheating death is the only way for a character to spend more than 1 hero point in a turn. The character can spend hero points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC."

Used in this way, they can help create very memorable sessions for both you and your players.",

A number of spells and magic items, as well as the Hero's Fortune feat, grant hero points to a character.

If you use them too much, the players will begin to resent the system, making it more of a problem than an opportunity to enhance the game."

To take most advanced actions, you must commit all of their requisite acts consecutively. If you stop committing acts toward such an advanced action, it never comes to completion, and it must be started all over again in order to have a chance of success. Other advanced actions can be completed after committing the total requisite number of acts, which can be split up over time. In both cases, any roll attempted to determine whether an advanced action is successful is attempted after the appropriate number of acts are committed to that advanced action by the creature committing the final act.

Actions with the move subtype provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt to either leave a square in an enemy's threatened area or stand up from a prone position in a space that has at least 1 square in a foe's threatened area. Not all actions that allow you to move have the move subtype. For example, a step is a very slow and careful movement that doesn't have this subtype, and thus doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when you take that action to leave a square in a threatened area.",

			"***Mount or Dismount a Steed (Move):*** You mount or dismount a steed. You can do this as a free action by attempting a DC 20 Ride check; failure means you provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Open or Close a Door:*** You open or close a door that is within your reach (not counting expanded reach from reach weapons). You must have at least one hand free to take this action.",
			"",
			"***Overrun (Attack):*** You move up to your speed, and over the course of this action you attempt to move through the space of a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you.

If you cast the spell defensively, you can subtract your Intelligence bonus from the result of the attack roll to add the same value as a circumstance bonus on the concentration check. You must have the [spell combat class feature](class/magus) to take this action, and can take this action only once per turn. To take this action, you must have one hand free.

Damage that exceeds the item's hardness is subtracted from its hit points. If an object has less than or equal to half its total hit points remaining, it gains the broken condition. If the damage you deal reduces the object to 0 or fewer hit points, you can choose to destroy the object. If you choose not to destroy it, the object is left with only 1 hit point.",

If you cast the entire spell in 1 turn, you can choose to have the spell's effects manifest at the end of that turn or at the start of your next turn.

			"",
			"***Charge (Move; 2 Acts):*** You move twice your speed directly toward a designated foe within your line of sight, ending the move in the closest space from which you can attack that foe. You must have a clear path to your foe. If anything hinders or blocks your movement along the path of a charge, you can't take the charge action. As long as you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can draw a weapon as a free action at any point during the charge. At the end of the charge, you gain a +2 bonus on any melee attacks, bull rush combat maneuver checks, or overrun combat maneuver checks you attempt until the end of your turn, as long as those attacks or combat maneuver checks are made against the creature you designated when you charged.",
			"",

			"",
			"***Continue a Grapple (2 Acts):*** You continue a grapple. If you initiated the grapple, you must either take this action at the start of each subsequent turn or end the grapple as a free action.

Alternatively, you can attempt to tie up the creature with a rope.",

At the end of that move action, you can place your target in any space adjacent to you. If you attempt to place your foe in a hazardous location, the target can attempt to free itself from the grapple as a reaction, and gains a +4 bonus on that attempt.",

			"",
			"***Deliver a Coup de Grace (Complex; 3 Acts):*** You use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe that isn't immune to critical hits.

If the foe survives the damage, it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + the damage dealt) or die.",
			"",
			"***Detect Forgery (3 Acts):*** You use Linguistics to examine a single page to detect a forgery.",
			"",
			"***Dirty Trick (Combat; 2 Acts):*** You attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check. If you're successful, the target gains one of the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, entangled, shaken, or sickened. This condition lasts for 1 round. For every 5 by which your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD, the condition lasts for 1 additional round. The target or an ally adjacent to the target can remove the condition by committing 1 act. Removing a condition applied by a dirty trick does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"***Disable Device (Complex; At Least 3 Acts):*** You attempt to unlock a lock or disable another device. For every round the action takes, you must commit 3 acts. These acts may or may not need to be consecutive based on the nature of the device. For example, acts committed to open a lock or disable a trap must nearly always be consecutive. The GM may rule that some complex devices take more than 3 acts to disable; for example, a complex arcane machine that will cause a devastating calamity in 1 minute could take 10 acts to disable, though the acts may not need to be consecutive.",
			"",
			"***Drag (Combat; 2 Acts):*** You try to drag a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you 5 or more feet in a straight line. Attempt a drag combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you move 5 feet in one direction, and your opponent moves with you, staying adjacent to you. For every 5 by which your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD, you can move 5 additional feet in the same direction.

			"***Lock or Unlock a Weapon in a Locked Gauntlet (Complex; 2 Acts):*** You either lock a weapon into a locked gauntlet or unlock a weapon already fastened to a locked gauntlet.",
			"",
			"***Make All Natural Attacks (Attack; 3 Acts):*** A creature that is using only its natural attacks can make all its natural attacks with this action instead of making separate attacks with attack simple actions.",
			"",
			"***Prepare a Flask of Oil as a Splash Weapon (Complex; 2 Acts):*** You prepare a flask of oil with a fuse so that you can throw it as a splash weapon.",
			"",
			"***Provide First Aid, Treat a Wound, or Treat Poison (Complex; 2 Acts):*** You provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison using the Heal skill.",
			"",
			"***Push an Animal (3 Acts):*** You attempt a Handle Animal check to get an animal to perform a trick it doesn't know but is physically capable of doing, or to push the animal to its limits. If the animal has taken hit point damage, nonlethal damage, or ability score damage, the DC of this check increases by 2. Characters with animal companions, such as druids or rangers, can push their companions as simple actions instead.",
			"",
			"***Reposition (Combat; 2 Acts):*** You attempt a reposition combat maneuver check against a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you. If you succeed, you force that foe to move 5 feet. For every 5 by which your check exceeds the target's Combat Maneuver Defense, you can move that target an additional 5 feet. When you reposition the target, it must stay within your threatened area during all but the last 5 feet of the reposition movement, which can be to a space adjacent to your threatened area.",
			"",
			"***Run (Move; 3 Acts):*** You move four times your speed in a straight line. When you do, you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.",
			"",
			"You can run for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution score; each round after that, you must succeed at a Constitution check to continue running (DC = 10 + 1 per previous check). If you fail, you stop running and are staggered for a number of minutes equal to 10 - your Constitution bonus (minimum 1).",
			"",
			"***Sleight of Hand (Complex; 2 Acts):*** You use Sleight of Hand to palm an object or perform some feat of legerdemain. You can attempt this as a simple action by taking a -20 penalty on the check. In either case, if your check fails by 5 or more, you provoke an attack of opportunity from any creature from which you are trying to take an object with this action.",
			"",
			"***Spellstrike (Complex; 2 Acts):*** You cast a spell from the magus spell list with a range of touch, but instead of making a touch attack, you make a melee attack with a weapon you are wielding. If the attack hits, the attack deals its normal damage as well as any effects of the spell. You must have the [spellstrike class feature](class/magus) to take this action.",
			"",
			"***Steal (Combat; 2 Acts):*** You attempt a steal combat maneuver check against a foe within your melee reach (not counting expanded reach from reach weapons). You must have at least one hand free, and must select the item to be stolen before attempting the check. Items fastened to a foe grant the foe a +5 (or higher) bonus to its CMD against this attempt, and items securely worn can't be stolen in this way. If you're successful, you take the item you chose from the opponent.",
			"",
			"***Total Defense (2 Acts):*** You concentrate on defense rather than attacking. Until the start of your next turn, you can't take actions with the attack subtype, and you gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC. If you already took an attack action earlier in the turn, you gain only a +2 dodge bonus to AC. If you have at least 3 ranks in Acrobatics, these bonuses increase to +6 and +3, respectively.",

If you provoke attacks of opportunity when casting the spell, you don't provoke further attacks when making the ranged attack roll.",
			"",
			"***Use a Spell Trigger Item (2 Acts):*** You cast a spell from a spell trigger item. This isn't an attack action, even if the spell requires a ranged attack roll. If you provoke attacks of opportunity when casting the spell, you don't provoke further attacks when making the ranged attack roll.",
			"",
			"***Use a Standard-Action Supernatural Ability (2 Acts):*** You use a supernatural ability that can be used as a standard action in the default action economy.",
			"",
			"***Use a Touch Spell on up to Six Allies (Complex; 3 Acts):*** If you cast a spell that allows you to touch targets over multiple rounds, this action allows you to touch up to six willing creatures within your melee reach (not counting expanded reach from reach weapons)."

The 3 highest spell levels in the row each have a listed number indicating spells per day. Prepare these spells each day as you normally would; you still gain bonus spells per day for those levels if you have a high enough ability score. The letter \"P\" appears in the columns of all other available spell levels (except level 0) to indicate lower-level spells that are cast using your class's spell pool.",

The level of spell doesn't matter (as long as it's one of the levels that uses your pool), so if you could cast five spells from your pool per day, it wouldn't matter if you cast five 1st-level spells, five 2nd-level spells, or a mix of the two. A spell cast using slots from your spell pool must still be on your spell list or in your spellbook, just as it would need to be if you were preparing the spell. It also must meet any other restrictions imposed by your class or other abilities, such as restrictions on casting spells of an opposing alignment. The slots in your spell pool refresh after 8 hours of rest, and any effect that prevents you from preparing spells also prevents you from refreshing your spell pool. Your pool increases if you have a high spellcasting ability modifier, similar to how you gain bonus spells in slots you prepare.

			"When casting a spell or using a magical effect that allows a saving throw, the caster makes a spell attack roll, rolling 1d20 with a bonus equal to her spellcasting ability modifier plus the spell's level. Any bonuses that would normally make the spell more difficult to avoid (such as the {feat/Spell Focus} feat) also apply. The DC of this roll is equal to 11 + the target's relevant save bonus. If the caster succeeds, treat the spell or effect as if the target had failed its save. Otherwise, treat it as if the target succeeded at its save. Just like an ordinary attack roll, a natural 1 is an automatic failure, while a natural 20 is an automatic success. This rule does not change the chances of success; it just changes who is rolling the die.",

Since the orc's Will save modifier is -1, he has to roll a 16 to succeed, and thus will fail his save 80% of the time. Under the spell attack roll rules, rather than the orc attempting a Will save, the wizard makes a spell attack roll with a +5 bonus (the spell's DC of 15 - 10) against a DC of 10 (11 + the orc's -1 Will save modifier). The wizard has to roll at least a 5 to succeed, so he still affects his target 80% of the time.",

A GM who wants to speed up play (at the expense of making the game more prone to extremes and not matching the core rules as closely) can instead require only a single roll and apply it against the defenses of all the targets."

			"Under the core rules, multiclassing can lead to a wide disparity in character ability. With this system, each character can choose a secondary class at 1st level that she trains in throughout her career, without giving up levels in her primary class. Once selected, this choice is permanent (though if using the [retraining rules](rule/retraining), the secondary class can be retrained by paying half the cost of retraining all her class levels). A character who selects this option doesn't gain feats at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, but instead gains class features from her secondary class as described on Table 2-8: Multiclass Character Advancement. It is probably a good idea to use either this variant system or normal multiclassing, but it's possible for the two systems to be used together. In a game using both systems, a character can't take levels in the secondary class she gains from this variant.",

Each location has a discovery score equal to the number of Discovery Points required to find the location.",
			"",
			"***Territory:*** Territories are discrete geographic areas with defined boundaries. These can be political borders or geographical transitions. If you're using the [exploration rules](rule/exploration_ucp), a single hex constitutes a territory. Alternately, a territory can be a much larger region; in this case, the PCs' exploration of the territory is a much more abstract concept and doesn't involve tracking exact locations on a map. In either case, each territory has its own Challenge Rating, which determines the danger of wandering monsters in the territory as well as the DC for exploration checks to earn Discovery Points.",
			"",
			"***Way Sign:*** Way signs are events, objects, or terrain features that give a hint to find a location. Discovering a way sign, either by stumbling across one in the wild (such as by reaching a vantage point that gives an excellent view of the lay of the land, or by stumbling across an old road sign) or by researching a region beforehand (such as by consulting gazetteers, maps, or the rumor mill), can grant bonus Discovery Points or reveal the existence of previously unknown locations-but some way signs may be inaccurate or misleading."

			"At the start of each day, each character must decide if she will spend the day documenting the territory, exploring, seeking a location, or taking another action (such as crafting magic items, guarding a campsite, resting, or the like). Only the first three options-documenting, exploring, and seeking a location-directly contribute to the exploration process. Uncovering way signs can also contribute to the process, but the actions required to earn Discovery Points via way signs vary widely and depend on the way signs in question.",
			"",
			"***Documenting:*** The character spends the day mapping the territory or recording its features in a gazetteer and can attempt one skill check for each day spent documenting. Creating a map requires one or more successful Profession (cartographer) checks, while creating a gazetteer requires one or more successful Linguistics checks (at the GM's discretion, other skill checks can be used in place of these). The number of checks needed equals the territory's CR, and the DC equals the territory's exploration check DC. Once the character has succeeded at the required checks, she has created a detailed map or gazetteer of the region, which grants a +5 circumstance bonus on future exploration checks in that territory (bonuses from multiple maps or gazetteers don't stack).",
			"",
			"***Exploring:*** The character spends the day exploring the territory. At the end of the day, the character attempts an exploration check against the territory's DC. An exploration check is usually a Survival check, but in some unusual regions or circumstances, it could require another skill check. A character can always attempt an exploration check using the Perception skill, but doing so is more difficult since this represents a more generalized method of exploration, and the player attempting a Perception-based exploration check takes a -5 penalty on the roll as a result.",
			"",
			"If the character succeeds at the exploration check, she earns 1 Discovery Point for the group, plus 1 additional point for every 5 points by which the result of the check exceeds the DC. Failing the check by 5 or more reduces the group's Discovery Point total by 1, plus 1 additional point for every additional 5 points by which she failed the check. Unless every character in the group is skilled at the territory's exploration skill, it's often prudent for one character to attempt the primary exploration check and for others to engage in other tasks or use the aid another action to improve the primary check's result.",
			"",
			"***Seeking a Location:*** If the PCs wish to seek out a location, they can do so by spending Discovery Points at the start of the day. If they are seeking a specific location that they know exists in the territory (typically having found clues to it in the form of way signs), they must spend a number of Discovery Points equal to the location's discovery score-a number that determines how difficult that location is to find (with higher values representing locations that are more difficult to discover). If the PCs want to attempt to uncover an unknown location at random, they choose how many Discovery Points from their total that they want to spend. Once the points are spent, divide the total spent in half, then compare that result to the discovery scores of all the locations in the territory. If any of those locations have a discovery score lower than that total, the PCs discover one of those locations (chosen at random if more than one location is a potential discovery). If none of the locations have a discovery score lower than that total, the group recovers half the Discovery Points they spent, but the other half is lost. Once the party discovers a location, travel time to the site varies according to the GM's discretion and the overall size of the territory.",
			"",
			"***Uncovering Way Signs:*** Every way sign the characters uncover has an associated skill check with a DC determined by the complexity of the way sign. The amount of time necessary to interpret a given way sign varies; some checks can be attempted with an insignificant time expenditure (such as recalling information about a territory using a Knowledge skill), while some require significant time to complete (like translating ancient texts or visiting a nearby settlement to gather information), which takes away from time spent documenting, exploring, or seeking a location. On a successful skill check, the PCs earn Discovery Points for the territory to which the way sign is linked. A simple way sign grants 1 Discovery Point, a moderately complex way sign grants 3 Discovery Points, and a complex way sign grants 5 Discovery Points. However, misinterpreting a way sign can complicate exploration; if a PC fails a check to interpret a way sign by 5 or more, the misinformation he obtains reduces the PCs' current Discovery Point total for that territory by 1d4 points. This can result in negative values. The PCs can attempt to interpret a way sign multiple times, but once they have successfully interpreted it, further attempts do not grant additional Discovery Points."

			"",
			"***Careful Exploration:*** Some groups might choose to explore more slowly and methodically in order to make a more careful search. This allows the group to attempt one extra exploration check for each day spent in careful exploration, but it limits the total number of Discovery Points that can be gained to 1 (a character using careful exploration cannot earn additional Discovery Points by exceeding the DC by 5 or more). Typically, careful exploration can be performed only if the terrain is relatively clear and free of obstructions. The GM is free to limit this option if she believes that a slow search would not garner much benefit due to the terrain.",
			"",
			"***Darkness:*** Unless the explorer has darkvision or another ability to see in darkness, he takes a -4 penalty on exploration checks he attempts when some but at most half of the hours spent exploring that day occur after nightfall. Explorers take a -8 penalty on checks attempted when more than half of the hours spent exploring occur after nightfall.",
			"",
			"***Extending the Day:*** A day of exploration typically takes 8 hours; the rest of each day is assumed to be split between 8 hours of rest and 8 hours spent eating, making and breaking camp, relaxing, and the like. It's possible to increase the amount of time in a day used for exploring by spending an additional 8-hour session exploring, but for every additional stretch of time up to 8 hours by which the PCs extend their time spent exploring, they take a cumulative -4 penalty on exploration checks to earn Discovery Points until they next rest for 8 hours. At the GM's discretion, fatigue and exhaustion can also set in if the PCs don't rest enough.",
			"",
			"***Weather:*** Inclement weather hampers exploration checks if it is the predominant weather of a given exploration period. For example, the PCs would take a -1 penalty in the case of light fog or light rain, but a -10 penalty in the case of a blizzard or hurricane."

Mountains are taller, oceans are deeper, and forests grow at unusual angles. Colors are more vibrant, flavors more potent; everything is amplified to oversaturated extremes, the cause of which is the First World's proximity to the Positive Energy Plane.

The demigods who call the First World home are some of the oldest beings in creation, and many have resided on this plane since before the Material Plane was woven into existence. Known collectively as the Eldest, they are as reclusive and secretive as they are ancient. The Eldest have relatively little interaction with the gods who dwell elsewhere in the Great Beyond, but like those divinities, they maintain cults and sects on countless Material Plane worlds. The religions of the Eldest are most commonly found in regions where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the First World grow thin. Fey often worship members of the Eldest, and many gnomes look back to their ancient roots in the First World and venerate the Eldest as well. Though the Eldest have nothing against cities or civilization, their worship tends to be less popular in heavily populated areas. Barbarians, druids, hunters, and others who live in the wild often venerate a member of the Eldest or the pantheon as a whole.",

Unlike those on the Material Plane, ley lines found in the First World do not stay in one place for long and typically wander vast distances, writhing through the world like disquieted snakes. Where these ley lines penetrate the barrier between the First World and the Material Plane, thin spots known as breaches form, allowing passage between the First World and the Material Plane without the aid of magic. These breaches typically manifest as circles of mushrooms, puddles of water with a rainbow-hued surface, trees in a peculiar arch, or other seemingly innocuous patterns. Simply stepping through one of these portals is often enough to travel from one plane to the other, but breaches are not always two-sided. Some doorways to the Material Plane are one-way, stranding extraplanar travelers in a seemingly dull and lifeless world, while Material visitors to the First World could be stranded for decades or more as they try to find a way back home. Other means of traveling to and from the First World include powerful spells such as {spell/fey gate}, {spell/gate}, and {spell/plane shift}."

A character entering a phantom ring must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be drawn into a gap in reality between the Material Plane and the First World, caught in a fragmented shard of the Ethereal Plane where she is unable to fully pass into the First World or return to the Material Plane. The character is invisible and ethereal, and she can see a dim and warped image of the Material Plane she just left, but she is unable to move more than 30 feet away from the phantom ring, which remains the only thing that appears solid and real in this ethereal pocket dimension. The character is trapped within this realm as if she had been called with a {spell/planar binding} spell.",

The animus shade might be friendly and talkative, or it might be cold, aloof, and demanding. The trapped character can attempt to bargain with the shade for her release, either into the First World or back into the Material Plane, but she must succeed at an opposed Charisma check to successfully persuade her captor. If the trapped character succeeds at this check, she can return to the Material Plane or enter the First World, but if she fails the check, the shade immediately attacks her. If the shade manages to kill the trapped character, it can manifest in the Material Plane, whereupon it is free to spread mayhem and its phantom ring dissolves away into sludge.",

			"A trapped character can bolster her chances of success when bargaining with the animus shade by offering a bribe of magic items or performing a service. Each animus shade's desires for bribes or service should vary, generally representing strange distortions of the trapped character's personality. For example, a trapped bard might be required to perform a humiliating display of self-mockery, or a barbarian might be required to undertake a diplomatic mission without resorting to combat. Services rendered to an animus shade take place in a [mindscape](rule/mindscapes) and typically require three out of five successful skill checks to complete. Bribes must be in the form of a valued magical item worth at least 500 gp per character level of the trapped character. If the service or bribe is successful, the trapped character can roll her opposed Charisma check twice (applying a +4 bonus on each roll) and use the better of the two rolls as her actual result when resolving the opposed Charisma check against the animus shade.",
			"",
			"A trapped creature can always opt to simply fight the animus shade, as both are on the Ethereal Plane, though neither can move more than 30 feet from the phantom ring. If the animus shade is slain, the trapped character reappears in the Material Plane and the phantom ring becomes inert for 2d4 days before becoming active again.",

Non-humanoids gain a +4 bonus on this Will save. Creatures that fail this save are driven to melancholy and are affected as if by {spell/crushing despair}, which persists until either the nonlethal damage is removed or the affected creature spends 24 hours outside of the weeping waste, whichever comes first; if no save is allowed to avoid nonlethal damage, no save is allowed against this {spell/crushing despair} either. In addition to the spell's usual effects, affected creatures cannot benefit from morale effects.",

They become blindly trusting, taking a -5 penalty on Sense Motive checks and a -2 penalty on saves against charm effects, and they take a -5 penalty on initiative checks if combat begins directly after they converse with an intelligent creature. This lonely desperation persists for 1d4 days after leaving the weeping waste."

			"While some think of poison as an assassin's tool, the herbalists and naturalists of the world know that poison carries in it no more inherent evil than fire or water. Indeed, in the wildlands of the world, harvesting poison to give a hunter an edge or to aid in the production of antivenom is a time-honored practice.",
			"",
			"While Craft (alchemy) is necessary to brew long-lasting poisons, there are many natural sources of poison in the world, and poison crafters who wish to avoid the expense of purchasing raw ingredients may seek to harvest poison from natural sources instead. The following section presents rules for harvesting poisons from the wild.",
			"",
			"Unless a dose of harvested poison is preserved (see Preserving Harvested Poison), it remains potent for 24 hours after it is harvested.",
			"",
			"***Harvesting from Dead Creatures:*** Once a venomous creature is slain, its venom sacs can be removed, allowing 1 or more doses of its venom to be harvested for later use. In order to harvest venom, the creature must have been dead for less than 24 hours. Every hour the source creature has been dead reduces the lifespan of the harvested poison by an hour. Removing venom sacs is a messy and time-consuming process, requiring 10 minutes of work, access to surgical tools, and a container to store the venom in. If proper surgical tools are not available, a dagger or other light slashing weapon can be used, although this imposes a -2 penalty on checks to harvest the venom. The harvester must succeed at a Survival check (DC = 15 + the dead creature's CR) in order to successfully harvest poison. On a success, the harvester acquires a single dose of the creature's venom, plus 1 additional dose for every 5 by which the result of this check exceeded the DC (to a maximum number of doses equal to the creature's Constitution modifier, minimum 1). Failing the check causes all of the venom to be lost. Failure by 5 or more exposes the harvester to 1d3 doses of the creature's venom unless she has the poison use class feature.",
			"",
			"***Harvesting Poison from Hazards:*** Some hazards, such as poison oak and spider vines, feature poisons that can be harvested by those who know how to do so. This process requires 1 hour and an alchemist's lab or alchemy crafting kit. If the harvester succeeds at a Survival check (DC = 15 + the hazard's CR), she collects 1 dose of poison. Harvesting poison from a hazard in this way requires getting close enough to it to touch it, which may expose the harvester to the hazard's effects.",
			"",
			"***Milking Venom:*** Venom can be harvested from a living creature without harming the creature, although the process is dangerous unless the creature has been trained for that specific purpose (see the {skill/Handle Animal} skill). For most venomous creatures, this involves stretching a thin canvas over a jar or vial and then coaxing the creature to bite into the canvas before massaging its venom glands, causing the venom to drip from its fangs into the container. Similar methods are used for creatures that deliver venom in other ways, such as with a stinger.",
			"",
			"Milking a single dose of poison from a creature takes 10 minutes of work and requires a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 10 + the donor's Hit Dice + the donor's Wisdom modifier). Failure by less than 5 indicates that the venom is not collected, but the handler suffers no other ill effect. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the creature bites, stings, or otherwise injects the handler with its venom. It automatically hits the handler with one of its natural attacks that delivers its poison, and it applies the effects of the attack normally. The creature might continue to attack the handler after doing so, possibly initiating combat. Milking venom from a cooperative intelligent creature doesn't require a Handle Animal check but presents a 5% chance of exposure to the venom.",
			"",
			"A creature can produce a number of doses of venom in this way each day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). A creature that is milked of venom this many times in one day (whether or not the attempts are successful) loses its poison special ability until the next time it rests.",
			"",
			"***Preserving Harvested Poison:*** Poison harvested from a creature or hazard remains potent for 24 hours. If a character wishes to preserve harvested poison for a longer period, she must treat it alchemically, as if crafting the poison with Craft (alchemy) but using the poison dose as the raw ingredients normally needed to brew a dose of the poison and thus avoiding the gp cost to craft the poison."

			"While {equipment-misc/antitoxin}, as presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, presents a generalized tool for protecting oneself from poison, more specialized antivenoms can provide even greater protection against specific poisons. Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.",
			"",
			"***Antivenom Effects:*** A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.",
			"",
			"***Crafting Antivenom:*** To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested.",
			"",
			"Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom.",
			"",
			"Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.",
			"",
			"***Purchasing Antivenom:*** Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison."

Additional rules for [cave-ins and collapses](rule/cave-ins_and_collapses_cr_8) appear in the Core Rulebook.",
			"",
			"***Falling Debris:*** Even creatures not in a structure are still at risk of falling debris, whether from a collapsing building nearby or a natural structure such as a cliff or mountain. Any creature caught in the area of falling debris suffers the collapse effects, but it takes 4d6 points of damage at the time of collapse instead of 8d6.",

Additionally, each creature standing in the area when a fissure opens must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or fall prone if it avoids falling into the fissure. Fissures are typically 1d4+1 &times; 10 feet deep, and creatures falling into one take the appropriate falling damage. There is also a 25% chance that surrounding debris also falls into the fissure. Creatures in the fissure when debris falls on them take additional damage from the falling debris. Surviving creatures that are not pinned can attempt to climb their way out.",
			"",
			"***Impaired Actions:*** The tremors of an earthquake impose a -8 penalty on Dexterity-based skill checks for creatures on the ground. Spellcasters on the ground must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) to cast a spell. To move, a creature must succeed at an Acrobatics check; the base DC of this Acrobatics check is 10, but particularly powerful earthquakes and any resulting difficult terrain can increase this DC.",
			"",
			"***Structures:*** Most wood or masonry buildings collapse during an earthquake. Structures built of stone or reinforced masonry take 100 points of damage that is not reduced by hardness. Large structures such as castles might not collapse outright, but certain features such as towers or entire sections of a wall might. Creatures caught in a structure that is destroyed suffer collapse effects."

Exposure to low concentrations of the foul vapors in the swamp causes a mildly uncomfortable burning sensation on exposed skin. Higher concentrations of the miasma are more deadly, usually appearing in pockets 1d6+1 &times; 10 feet in radius. Upon entering the area of a highly concentrated acidic miasma, a creature must immediately succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or become sickened for 1d4 minutes. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more become nauseated instead. These effects last even if the creature leaves the area of the miasma. Additionally, each round a creature starts its turn in a highly concentrated area of miasma, it takes 1d6 points of acid damage. Highly concentrated miasmas can be identified from 10 feet away by their distinctive stench with a successful a DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check.",
			"",
			"***Acidic Plants (CR 3):*** Acidic plants-usually bushes, mosses, vines, and other undergrowth-are found in clusters with a radius of 1d6+1 &times; 10 feet. They become active when they are disturbed by creatures moving through their squares. Acidic plants gain a reflexive ability to grab at intruders, and they attempt to grapple creatures moving through their square. The plants have a CMB of +10, and their grapple attempts do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Creatures grappled by acidic plants take 1d6 points of acid damage each round and can't move without first breaking the grapple (the acidic plants' CMD is 20). The acidic plants receive a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents they are already grappling, but they can't move or pin foes. Each round that acidic plants succeed at their grapple combat maneuver check, they deal an additional 1d6 points of acid damage. A cluster of acidic plants has AC 10 and 10 hit points. Acidic plants have acid immunity and vulnerability to cold. Burning a square of acid plants causes them to release an acidic gas that spreads in a 10-foot radius; any creature in this gas takes 1d4 points of acid damage. The cloud dissipates in 2d4 rounds unless dispersed earlier by a strong wind or a {spell/gust of wind} spell. Acidic plants secrete a nearly transparent layer of acid that can be identified with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check.",

In addition to the effects of a [duststorm](rule/storms), arcs of electricity crackle throughout it. Each round a creature is caught in the storm, it must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of electricity damage. The onslaught of an electrified duststorm is presaged by a sudden crackle of harmless sparks across the ground 1 minute before it starts and can be identified with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check.",
			"",
			"***Fire Storm (CR 5):*** Occurring in mountainous areas, fire storms rage with strong winds, raining ash and flame across the landscape. A fire storm usually forms somewhere near a mountain peak and travels downward, but it persists for only 1d6+1 rounds. A creature caught in a fire storm takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or any flammable items that it has catch on fire. Additionally, the ash mixed in with the fire makes the ground difficult terrain and reduces visibility by half, imposing a -6 penalty on Perception checks. Fire storms move quickly, at a rate of 60 feet per round, and have a radius of 1d4&times;100 feet. A fire storm can be identified as it begins forming over the course of 1d4+1 rounds with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check to detect the telltale increase in heat and gently falling ash.",
			"",
			"***Freezing Eruption (CR 5):*** Freezing gouts of super-chilled air erupt from small vents in the ground, blasting a 5-foot square with subzero temperatures. A creature occupying the square must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid the freezing eruption. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 points of cold damage and becomes entangled, as it is encrusted with ice. A creature can break free from the encrusting ice with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist or Strength check, but it takes 1d4 points of cold damage at the start of each turn it remains encrusted. The encrusting ice melts away in 1d6 rounds in regions where the ambient temperature is above freezing. Freezing eruptions occur from the same vent every 1d4 minutes. A square containing a freezing eruption can be identified by the shards of ice around it with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (nature) or Survival check."

Mud pots range widely in size and depth, with many found in clusters. Gases from within the earth can cause mud pots to boil over or shoot mud a short distance into the air. Exposure to a mud pot deals 1d3 points of acid damage and 1d3 points of fire damage per round of exposure. Total immersion in a mud pot deals 1d6 points of acid damage and 1d6 points of fire damage per round; damage continues for 1 round after total immersion, but this additional damage is only 1d3 points of acid damage and 1d3 points of fire damage.

			"Glittering fields of fresh snow can pose a danger to unprepared travelers during the daylight hours, as the sun reflecting from the fields of white can be dazzling or even blinding. Travelers through such areas risk having their eyes become sunburned-a condition known as snow blindness. A creature in an area of reflective snow is automatically dazzled, and for each hour it spends in such an area, it must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or succumb to snow blindness, becoming blind for 24 hours. Wearing protective eye gear that reduces the amount of sunlight hitting the eyes negates the dazzled condition and the chance of developing snow blindness. A character can reduce the duration of snow blindness to 1d6 hours with a successful DC 20 Heal check as long as she keeps her eyes covered or wears protective eye gear. Spells such as [remove blindness/deafness](spell/remove_blindness_deafness) heal snow blindness immediately. Creatures that are particularly susceptible to bright light take a -4 penalty on saves to resist snow blindness. To a lesser extent, staring out over vast stretches of sunlit water or desert can have the same effects as staring at reflective snow, but the save to avoid blindness in this case is only DC 10."

			"{spell/Meld into Stone} and {spell/Tree Shape}: Hiding in blocks of stone or taking the form of a shrub allows for both intrigue and tense moments of avoiding a threat. PCs and NPCs can use these spells to perform highly effective spying on their enemies, with very few effects or spells being able to reveal the presence of a melded or shaped creature. {spell/True seeing} or a similar effect could spell disaster for a stone-melded creature, and the destruction of the melded stone has immediate-not to mention mortal-repercussions. Be sure to reward the creative use of these spells when used by the PCs, but also make them aware of the dangers of using them, should the PCs come to rely on these spells as a guaranteed means for avoiding detection and spying on foes.",
			"",
			"{spell/Pass without Trace}: This basic 1st-level spell can defeat even the most dedicated of trackers. {spell/Pass without trace} prevents being tracked by a Survival check or any other nonmagical means. Only spells such as {spell/locate creature} are suitable for tracking creatures that have obfuscated themselves with {spell/pass without trace}, and such spells aren't readily accessible until later levels. Due to the difficulty in countering this spell at lower levels, the best point to take advantage of {spell/pass without trace} is in the 4th- to 6th-level range, when the spell can affect all members of the average party and rangers gain access to the spell. At levels above that, the foes can use magical countermeasures to overcome {spell/pass without trace}.",
			"",
			"{spell/Plant Growth} and {spell/Spike Growth}: Control of the battlefield is essential when fighting in a wilderness environment. As many such environments lack manufactured cover and traps, it falls to magic to create such hazards. {spell/Plant growth} can drastically cut down on targets' maneuverability on a battlefield, allowing spellcasters to target enemies from afar, or even enhancing the effectiveness of spells such as {spell/entangle}. Similarly, {spell/spike growth} creates areas of damaging terrain that are difficult to bypass without some means of flight or levitation. In wilderness-heavy campaigns, these spells can be on par with other control-based magic, while in campaigns with only a smattering of wilderness, these spells operate best when taken in the form of one or more backup scrolls.",
			"",
			"{spell/Quench}: Often forgotten due to its specialized nature, {spell/quench} can swiftly extinguish fire-based creatures, effects, and spells. The typical use of the spell is to put out nonmagical fires in its considerable area of effect (a minimum of 5 20-foot cubes at minimum caster level). A more potent use of the spell is to act as a dispelling effect on fire-based spells in its area. This allows the spell to be reserved and used to counter potent spells such as {spell/fireball} or {spell/wall of fire}, though only if a character expects such spells to be used. Using the spell on magic items that create or control flame can change the combat dynamic, especially if the effect is considerable (such as disabling the {magic-enhancement/flaming burst} ability from an enemy's weapon). Creatures with the fire subtype are particularly vulnerable to {spell/quench}, taking anywhere from 5d6 to 10d6 points of damage without any sort of save-a [wand of quench](spell/quench) is a potent weapon against such foes.",
			"",
			"{spell/Stone Shape} and {spell/Wood Shape}: Building a bridge, creating a door, or manufacturing a barricade are all immediate uses for shaping magic such as {spell/stone shape} and {spell/wood shape}. The wording of these spells is very open to interpretation, granting a lot of leeway in adjudicating their effects. Unexpected barriers can change the dynamic of combat or wilderness exploration, so be sure to have a basic understanding of the consequences of using these spells in areas primarily made of stone or wood. Just as PCs can use these spells to upturn encounters, their adversaries can use these spells to surprise them in dynamic ways. The PCs might explore a chamber with one entrance only to be ambushed from a stone-shaped wall during their inspection of the area, or an NPC villain might allow half the party to go through an exit door before cutting it off with a well-timed casting of {spell/wood shape}.",
			"",
			"{spell/Water Breathing} and {spell/Water Walk}: Both of these spells accomplish different things, but they are similar in that they overcome an incredibly common wilderness impediment: water. Watery barriers can include a lake in the middle of a forest, rivers running between mountains, a series of flooded chambers in a cavern, treacherous swamps, and underground oceans. {spell/Water breathing} can be split among numerous creatures effectively, allowing for long or quick treks underwater. Similar magic, such as {spell/aboleth's lung} or {spell/air bubble}, can function in similar roles to {spell/water breathing} at a lower spell level, albeit at reduced efficiency. Player characters often come to rely on these spells to traverse difficult environments, sometimes believing in a simple \"cast and forget\" mantra. Be sure to occasionally remind the PCs of their reliance on these spells, such as directing a casting of {spell/dispel magic} in their direction. It's best to give this kind of reminder in a situation where it's possible to recover so that the potential for a more disastrous situation can loom large in the mind. Dispelling {spell/water breathing} when the PCs are deep underwater and have no way to escape and no more ways to cast the spell can mean certain death, so you shouldn't spring this tactic on players often-if ever!",
			"",
			"{spell/Whispering Wind}: While {spell/sending} requires 10 minutes to cast, {spell/whispering wind} takes only a standard action. Use of this spell doesn't guarantee a successful transmission though, as it requires the caster to be knowledgeable of a specific location within range, but even then, there's no guarantee that the intended recipient is at the designated location. It's also entirely possible that if the PCs find themselves camping at an easily identifiable landmark, they might become the unintended recipients of a {spell/whispering wind} message. Mistakenly receiving a message in this manner could spark a new adventure or entire campaign, especially when you consider that {spell/whispering wind} often revolves around the need to get a message out in a quick and urgent manner."

While spell resistance offers a means of defense against these spells, such an ability is almost non-existent among plant creatures. Despite the lengthy 1-round casting time, successfully casting {spell/antilife shell} can buy precious rounds of protection to cast other spells. {spell/Antiplant shell} has a shorter casting time and a lower spell level, making it more useful when dealing with plant threats.",
			"",
			"**Repel Vermin:** {spell/Repel vermin} is similar to {spell/antilife shell}, but it takes up a lower-level spell slot and requires less time to cast. While the field created by this spell can be bypassed with a successful Will save, it still deals damage to vermin managing to traverse it-a particularly powerful effect against large numbers of enemies with few hit points. Perhaps the most enticing use of {spell/repel vermin} is its ability to diminish the effectiveness of vermin swarms."

			"",
			"{spell/Heroes' Feast}: Those partaking in a {spell/heroes' feast} receive powerful bonuses in addition to the normal benefits of eating and drinking. The combination of {spell/neutralize poison} and {spell/remove disease} in this spell is a particularly useful given the number of long-onset diseases and poisons in the wilderness. The spell does require a long casting time and consumption period to be effective; casting and consuming a {spell/heroes' feast} takes at least 70 minutes. The flaws of this spell become apparent when the PCs ambush enemies partaking in this spell or are attacked while consuming their own feast.",
			"",
			"{spell/Transport via Plants} and {spell/Tree Stride}: A dependable means of transportation within a forested environment, {spell/tree stride} combines the best of several spells, with temporary protection and stealth akin to {spell/meld into stone} or {spell/tree shape}. It also offers a wide array of travel distance, with even coniferous trees allowing for transportation range in excess of {spell/dimension door}, assuming a suitable tree is within range. {spell/Transport via plants} is similar to an upgraded {spell/tree stride}, as it allows for theoretically limitless traveling distance on the same world, and it requires only a suitably sized plant with a matching species at the destination.",
			"",
			"{spell/Wall of Stone} and {spell/Wall of Thorns}: Both of these spells allow for the creation of walls to divide a battlefield. Walls made of stone have the benefit of adjoining to existing stone-a plentiful terrain feature in most wilderness environs. Since this spell has a duration of instantaneous, {spell/wall of stone} creates long-lasting defenses. Such walls can cut off tight-knit groups in confined areas, though creatures in the path of a forming wall can attempt a Reflex save to avoid entrapment. {spell/Wall of thorns} creates a temporary effect, and while it doesn't block off terrain as dependably as {spell/wall of stone}, it covers twice the space of a stone wall and doesn't allow a Reflex save. {spell/Wall of thorns} can be used to deadly effect when sculpted to cover larger area. These walls can be combined with area effects, such as {spell/cloudkill} or {spell/insect plague}, to devastate foes."

			"",
			"Mid-level transmutation spells produce a variety of effects. Many augment the capabilities of their casters, allowing for otherwise impossible physical feats. Some transmutation spells control nature and, by extension, operate as mind-affecting effects against plants while bypassing plants' natural immunities to such effects. Other transmutation spells change vast swaths of terrain, allowing their casters to manipulate the wilderness in ways that range from battlefield needs to agricultural changes taking place over thousands of square feet of space.",
			"",
			"{spell/Air Walk} and {spell/Wind Walk}: {spell/Air walk} is an effective method of bypassing treacherous terrain. When a caster typically gains access to this spell, the duration of {spell/air walk} is about only an hour, making it an effective tool for combat encounters but diminishing its utility for long-term travel. Another hindrance of {spell/air walk} is that it affects only a single target, making it difficult to apply to an entire group without expending several spell slots. {spell/Wind walk}, however, can grant a group the ability to traverse long distances over open air. As this spell allows for travel of 600 feet per round, it's over 10 times as effective as spells such as {spell/fly} and {spell/overland flight} as a means of long-distance travel. However, wind walkers are particularly vulnerable to attack along the way if their movement can be curtailed with an obstruction. The caster must either dismiss the spell entirely or have everyone in the group to go through lengthy transformations back into their normal forms while being pummeled by attacks.",
			"",
			"{spell/Command Plants}: Similar in many respects to {spell/charm person}, this spell entreats plant creatures to obey the spellcaster. As plants are normally immune to mind-affecting effects, this spell falls under the transmutation school of magic, meaning that feats such as [Spell Focus (transmutation)](feat/spell_focus) apply to it. Two important differences between this spell and {spell/charm person}, aside from the spell level and ability to affect plants, are the increased number of targets and no requirement that the caster has to know a language understood by the target.",
			"",
			"{spell/Control Water} and {spell/Control Winds}: These spells are both broad in their effect, with uses beyond combat. The ability to control the speed of winds is a useful tool in hampering foes that rely on flight or ranged attacks. Remember that wind speeds can impose penalties on creatures' Fly checks, with hurricane speed winds inflicting a massive -12 penalty. Manipulating water allows for access to otherwise inaccessible spaces and reveals secrets hidden in exceptionally deep areas of water. Aquatic creatures that rely on water for breathing and maneuverability can be significantly disabled by this magic. As a body of water can be lowered to as little as 2 inches deep, this spell can be a major threat to aquatic foes that don't have base speeds.",
			"",
			"{spell/Move Earth}: This spell allows for the movement of various sorts of natural terrain, with the express purpose of digging or filling in dips in the earth. While it's relatively useless once combat has begun, because of its long casting time, this spell is exceptionally handy for flattening terrain or otherwise adjusting it in preparation of combat. A common use for {spell/move earth} is in the creation or deconstruction of natural cover as part of an ongoing siege.",
			"",
			"{spell/Passwall}: The bane of intrepid dungeon designers everywhere, {spell/passwall} allows for the disruption of the expected path through a complex structure. Allowing the spell to assist in navigating hazardous terrain is important, but it should not come at the expense of storytelling or allow the characters to bypass important areas of exploration. When designing encounter areas, consider insulating critical areas with stretches of solid matter that extend 20 feet or farther, effectively inhibiting {spell/passwall} from creating its passage into or out of key locations. Furthermore, as {spell/passwall} is susceptible to {spell/dispel magic}, a perfectly timed dispel effect can separate a party, potentially over several (possibly as-of-yet-unexplored) areas of a dungeon.",
			"",
			"{spell/Reincarnate}: The ability to reincarnate a deceased companion is often a mixed affair. Many adventurers see the use of {spell/reincarnate} as a means of bypassing the costly {spell/raise dead} (a 5th-level spell). Some even view the ability to return as a different race as a boon, especially in cases where the new race has powerful physical ability modifiers. It's important to reinforce the monumental changes that a creature undergoes after being reincarnated, though. Former acquaintances and allies won't recognize the reincarnated person, and depending on the nature of the new race, the reincarnated creature might find itself the subject of discrimination or even attacked on sight.",
			"",
			"{spell/Repel Wood}: This spell is particularly powerful in tight corridors. Wooden objects in the path of the spell are hurled away, moving 40 feet back from their current position. This includes items such as wooden armor, wooden shields, and wood-hafted weapons; these items often carry the wielder along with them. Creatures can opt to drop shields and weapons, but a creature wearing wooden armor (especially darkwood or ironwood-enhanced equipment) doesn't have the ability to quickly remove the armor and is thus forced back with no saving throw or spell resistance. Note that the spell has no effect on most plants, since they are rooted to the ground, but it can be used to clear wooden blockages such as deadfalls.",
			"",
			"{spell/Transmute Rock to Mud}: Transforming large areas of unworked rock into mud creates effectively impassable terrain. Most creatures trapped in a transmuted area of mud reduce their base speed to 5 feet. Considering the vast area that even a minimum caster can affect, this mud acts as a slowing effect on all creatures without a means of flying or levitating. The most effective, and oftentimes unexpected, use of this spell is when it's used on the ceiling of a cavern. Along with creating an area of mobility-restricting terrain, the collapsing mud deals a hefty sum of damage to creatures caught underneath the falling deluge. Keep in mind that transmuted mud can be dispelled, with effects similar to a casting of {spell/transmute mud to rock}."

			"{spell/Animate Plants}: From the lowest level that a druid gains access to this spell, she can animate four Large plants or a single Gargantuan plant. Animated plants are simple to command and act as allies and distractions in combat. The alternative entangle effect of this spell is particularly useful, as it not only bypasses spell resistance but also acts as a 7th-level spell version of {spell/entangle} that lasts for hours.",
			"",
			"{spell/Changestaff}: While {spell/animate plants} creates a potential host of animated plants, {spell/changestaff} creates a single powerful {monster/treant}-like ally that, barring misadventure, lasts for hours. The treant created by this spell is particularly useful in demolishing objects and structures. The transformed treant's innate rock throwing ability, teamed with its ability to ignore the hardness of structures, makes it particularly effective in laying siege to fortifications in all manner of terrains.",
			"",
			"{spell/Control Plants}: As this is a transmutation spell, it bypasses a plant's normal immunity to mind-affecting effects. A plant creature can attempt a Will save to avoid being controlled, but the spell is not subject to spell resistance and has no shared-language requirement. As this spell lasts only a few minutes and doesn't allow for self-destructive commands, it's best employed as an equalizer when fighting multiple plant foes, enemies that have animated plants of their own, or foes that are plants (such as high-level [ghorans](monster/ghoran) or [leshys](family/leshy)).",
			"",
			"{spell/Earthquake}: Numerous different environment-dependent effects make {spell/earthquake} an appropriate spell for wilderness-themed campaigns. The effect of this spell in caves is a true killer, as the rules for being trapped in rubble are exceptionally deadly to creatures that do not have high Strength scores or teleportation magic. Many of the aboveground effects have the potential to create rents in the earth that can trap opponents or seal away disarmed objects and other items. Regardless of its application, {spell/earthquake} is often about sending a message to a foe-the dramatic sights created by this spell capable of awing even those familiar with magic.",
			"",
			"{spell/Storm of Vengeance}: A supernatural representation of nature's ire, {spell/storm of vengeance} is a powerful evocation that blankets a wide area in a growing tempest. Though the effects of the storm are potent, there are many things to consider when employing the spell. First, it requires concentration over several rounds to build up its power, which can be difficult to maintain while the caster is engaged in combat, especially since several of the effects of the storm cause damage, such as acid rain and hailstorm. As a result, the ideal application of {spell/storm of vengeance} is from long range, with the caster far outside the storm's effects.",
			"",
			"{spell/Transmute Metal to Wood}: An instantaneous effect, {spell/transmute metal to wood} affects all metal items within a large radius. While the spell doesn't allow any sort of saving throw, it does treat magic items affected by the spell as if they had significant spell resistance, meaning {feat/Spell Penetration} and {feat/Greater Spell Penetration} increase the effectiveness of the spell by a wide margin. This spell also specifies that it affects only objects-so no using it against [iron golems](monster/iron_golem)! {spell/Transmute metal to wood} is at its best when employed by [druids](class/druid), as a druid often has few (if any) metal items in her possession, allowing the caster to center the spell on herself if threatened by numerous metal-clad foes. Teaming this spell with the {spell/repel wood} is a powerful combo that keeps metal-wielding foes on the defensive."

Light precipitation is the lowest level of intensity and generally consists of fog, a faint drizzle of rain or a few isolated flakes of snow. Medium precipitation represents a noticeable but not distracting fall of rain or snow. Heavy precipitation typically consists of a driving rainstorm or significant snowfall. Torrential precipitation is the highest level of intensity and consists of a deluge of rain or snow with conditions that can approach whiteout levels.

At other times, certain types of precipitation combined with higher wind strengths can generate these severe events.",
			"",
			"***Blizzard:*** A combination of severe or stronger winds with heavy snow can create blizzard conditions. Blizzards reduce range of vision to no more than 20 feet, and even then, creatures takes a -8 penalty on Perception checks within that range. In a blizzard, the snowfall increases to 4 inches of snow each hour, and travel in more than 3 feet of snow is usually impossible without {equipment-misc/snowshoes} or an ability such as {spell/water walk}.

With winds of 75-174 miles per hour, a hurricane renders ranged attacks impossible, and siege weapons take a -8 penalty on attack rolls. Large or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check or they are unable to move forward against the strength of the wind. Medium or smaller creatures on the ground must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check or they are knocked prone and roll 1d6&times;10 feet, taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

Every hour during the storm, a bolt of lightning strikes an unsheltered creature at random (though this can strike wildlife as easily as PCs). A creature struck by this lightning must succeed a DC 18 Reflex saving throw or take 10d8 points of electricity damage (a successful saving throw halves the damage). Creatures in metal armor take a -4 penalty on the Reflex saving throw.",

			"***Tornado:*** With winds with speeds of 174-300 miles per hour, tornados are deadly terrors. The smallest tornados occupy a 20-foot-radius burst, with winds of windstorm strength swirling up to 100 feet beyond that burst. The largest tornados can be 100-foot-radius bursts, with a windstorm whose radius extends 500 feet beyond that burst. Ranged attacks, including normal, siege, and even those produced by evocation spells, are impossible in the core burst of a tornado. Huge or smaller creatures must succeed a DC 20 Strength check or be sucked up by the funnel of the tornado; this deals 8d8 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing lethal damage to the creatures. This damage ignores all but DR/epic, DR/-, and hardness. Once it deals this damage, the tornado flings the creature it has sucked up 1d20&times;10 feet up and away from the tornado, dealing 1d6 points of falling damage per 10 feet that the creature is flung. Gargantuan and larger creatures take the 8d8 points of damage but are not moved by the tornado. A tornado moves at a speed of 40 feet, though the direction it moves is entirely unpredictable-you can determine the direction randomly each round. Tornados typically last for 3d6 minutes, but some can swirl for up to an hour.z",
			"",
			"While most tornados are created by thunderstorms, some smaller tornados (typically with a 5- to 10-foot-burst radius, with no outer radius) can be created in areas of wildfire (firenados), snow (snownados), or sand (dust devils). They deal a similar amount of damage, but firenados deal fire damage, snownados deal cold damage, and dust devils deal bludgeoning damage only, and these types of tornados do not fling their targets.",
			"",
			"***Wildfire:*** While wildfires can be sparked a number of ways, for these rules, they are usually created by a lightning strike in a particularly dry area of forest or other vegetation. Use the rules for [forest fires](rule/forest_fires_cr_6), but add a 10% chance of the fire producing 1d6 firenados (see Tornado above)."
