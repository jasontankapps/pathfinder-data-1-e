			"**Effect** The classic \"clam clamp\" trap utilizes the heavy shell of a giant clam, but any similarly large bivalve mollusk or even flotsam can work. A clam clamp is typically set with a lure, such as a piece of shiny treasure. When a creature walks over a clam clamp or attempts to take the treasure, the clamp snaps shut and attempts a grapple with a +15 bonus on the combat maneuver check. The weight of the clam clamp is enough to hold a creature in place until the grappled creature can escape. A clam clamp located in an underwater area is more difficult to craft but also more dangerous to air-breathing creatures due to the fact that it can hold a creature underwater until it drowns; an underwater clam clamp's CR is 5.",

			"**Effect** The faceless statue trap targets a creature with a [flesh to stone](spell:flesh_to_stone) effect (DC 19, single target), followed immediately by a [stone shape](spell:stone_shape) effect, which completely smooths the face of the target, making it appear to be faceless. If the creature is returned to flesh, this transformation persists, rendering the target permanently blind, deaf, mute, and unable to breathe. Unless the change is reversed via [regenerate](spell:regenerate) or other magic capable of restoring the target's mouth or nose, or unless the target is able to survive without breathing, the creature begins to suffocate immediately. Using [stone shape](spell:stone_shape) on the creature while it is still petrified can restore its face, preventing this, but only if the caster succeeds at a DC 25 Craft (sculpture) check. Otherwise, the spell creates a grotesque parody of a face, formed entirely of flesh and without function. Other variants of this trap exist that perform similarly grotesque alterations to a creature via [stone shape](spell:stone_shape)."

			"**Effect** This trap activates similarly to a [pit trap](trap:pit_trap), but the pit is actually a metal coffin concealed under the floor that drops into a body of water under the floor once a creature falls inside. The pitlike opening is 5 feet across, leading into a hollow metal coffin that's 10 feet deep. A creature that steps onto the opening and fails a DC 20 Reflex save falls in, taking 1d6 points of falling damage. The top of the metal box then automatically shuts and locks (Disable Device DC 30, accessible from either side), and the fastenings holding the box to the floor release, causing it and anyone still inside or standing on top of it to plummet into a body of water, typically either fast-flowing or at least 200 feet deep. The box sinks at a rate of 60 feet per round, and could be carried by the current. The box is airtight, and contains enough air for a single Medium creature to breathe for 10 minutes before being at risk of [suffocation](rule:suffocation). If the box is successfully opened while underwater, the water takes 1 round to fill it, during which time any creature inside the box must succeed at a DC 15 Strength check to escape the box against the power of the rushing water."

			"**Effect** A metal cage drops to seal creatures in a 10-foot-square area (no saving throw), and the ceiling of this cage begins to slowly lower to crush those within it , descending at a rate of 1 foot per round from a height of 10 feet. Creatures inside and outside the trapped area can attempt to open the cage's single locked door (Disable Device DC 30), but the lock is electrified, automatically dealing 6d6 points of electricity damage with each attempt, and imposing a -1 penalty on the check f or every 5 points of damage dealt in this way. Creatures inside the cage can attempt to hold up the ceiling of the cage as a ful l-round action with a successful DC 25 Strength check. Success prevents the cage from lowering that round, though it doesn't reverse the progress or allow egress. Once the height of the cage's ceiling is 3 feet, Medium creatures take 10d10 points of bludgeoning damage each round the cage's ceiling is not successfully held up. Once the height of the cage's ceiling is 1 foot, Small creatures take 10d10 points of bludgeoning damage each round that the ceiling is not successfully held up. Tiny creatures can attempt a DC 30 Escape Artist check to flee through the holes in the cage, Diminutive creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Escape Artist check, and Fine creatures can leave automatically. These traps are often employed in conjunction with an effect that prevents dimensional travel, such as [dimensional lock](spell:dimensional_lock). This addition doesn't change the trap's CR, but it does make the trap a combination of mechanical and magical."
