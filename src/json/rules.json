			"The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures. Helping them tell this story is the Game Master (or GM), who decides what threats the player characters (or PCs) face and what sorts of rewards they earn for succeeding at their quest. Think of it as a cooperative storytelling game, where the players play the protagonists and the Game Master acts as the narrator, controlling the rest of the world.",
			"",
			"If you are a player, you make all of the decisions for your character, from what abilities your character has to the type of weapon he carries. Playing a character, however, is more than just following the rules. You also decide your character's personality. Is he a noble knight, set on vanquishing a powerful evil, or is he a conniving rogue who cares more about gold than glory? The choice is up to you.",
			"",
			"If you are a Game Master, you control the world that the players explore. Your job is to bring the setting to life and to present the characters with challenges that are both fair and exciting. From the local merchant prince to the rampaging dragon, you control all of the characters that are not being played by the players. Paizo's Pathfinder Adventure Path series, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder Chronicles world guides provide everything you need to run a game, or you can invent your own, using the rules presented herein as well as the monsters found in the various bestiaries.",
			"",
			"***What You Need:*** In addition to these rules, you will need a number of special dice to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dice that come with most board games have six sides, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game uses dice with four sides, six sides, eight sides, ten sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides. Dice of this sort can be found at your local game store or online at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"In addition to dice, if you are a player, you will need a character sheet [found in the back of the physical book] and, if the Game Master uses a map to represent the adventure, a small figurine to represent your character. These figurines, or miniatures, can also be found at most game stores. They come in a wide variety of styles, so you can probably find a miniature that relatively accurately depicts your character.",
			"",
			"If you are the Game Master, you will need a copy of the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, which contains the rules for a whole spectrum of monsters, from the mighty dragon to the lowly goblin. While many of these monsters can be used to fight against the players, others might provide useful information or become powerful allies. Some might even join the group, with one of the players taking on the role of a monstrous character. In addition, you should have your own set of dice and some sort of screen you can use to hide your notes, maps, and dice rolls behind. (Although you should be honest about the results of your dice rolls, sometimes the results are not evident, and openly rolling the dice might give away too much information.) Combat in the Pathfinder RPG can be resolved in one of two ways: you can describe the situation to the characters and allow them to interact based on the description you provide, or you can draw the situation on a piece of paper or a specially made battle mat and allow the characters to move their miniatures around to more accurately represent their position during the battle. While both ways have their advantages, if you choose the latter, you will need a mat to draw on, such as Paizo's line of GameMastery Flip-Mats, as well as miniatures to represent the monsters or other adversaries. These can also be found at your local game shop, or at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"***Playing the Game:*** While playing the Pathfinder RPG, the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.",
			"",
			"Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as \"d#,\" with the **#** representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the \"d.\" For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or - after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character's skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a 4 and the other d10 rolls a 2, then you've generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with 10, 20, 30 and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you must round a number, always round down.",
			"",
			"As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges. While a 1st-level character might be up to saving a farmer's daughter from rampaging goblins, defeating a terrifying red dragon might require the powers of a 20th-level hero. It is the Game Master's duty to provide challenges for your character that are engaging, but not so deadly as to leave you with no hope of success.",
			"",
			"Above all, have fun. Playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be exciting and rewarding for both the Game Master and the players. Adventure awaits!",
			"",
			"### The Most Important Rule",
			"",
			"The rules are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of \"house rules\" that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the Pathfinder RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt."

			"",
			"The Pathfinder RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.",
			"",
			"***Ability Score:*** Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature's most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.",
			"",
			"***Action:*** An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of [different kinds of actions](rule/actions_in_combat), such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action.",
			"",
			"***Alignment:*** Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single \"N.\"",
			"",
			"***Armor Class (AC):*** All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.",
			"",
			"***Base Attack Bonus (BAB):*** Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature's base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of [full-round action](rule/full-round_actions)).",
			"",
			"***Bonus:*** Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not \"stack\")-only the greater bonus granted applies.",
			"",
			"***Caster Level (CL):*** Caster level represents a creature's power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster's level.",
			"",
			"***Class:*** {main/Classes} represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the core classes or prestige classes, since these are the most powerful. Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful.",
			"",
			"***Check:*** A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver:*** This is [an action taken in combat](rule/combat_maneuvers) that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB):*** This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character's d20 roll.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD):*** This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature's CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.",
			"",
			"***Concentration Check:*** When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a [concentration check](rule/concentration) or fail to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"***Creature:*** A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.",
			"",
			"***Damage Reduction (DR):*** Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a number followed by the type, such as \"10/cold iron.\" Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted with a dash instead of a type, e.g. \"5/-.\"",
			"",
			"***Difficulty Class (DC):*** Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.",
			"",
			"***Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):*** Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.",
			"",
			"***Experience Points (XP):*** As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.",
			"",
			"***Feat:*** A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.",
			"",
			"***Game Master (GM):*** A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM's duty is to provide a fair and fun game.",
			"",
			"***Hit Dice (HD):*** Hit Dice represent a creature's general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster's general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as \"3d8.\" This value is used to determine a creature's total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature's hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.",
			"",
			"***Hit Points (hp):*** Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature's hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score, it dies.",
			"",
			"***Initiative:*** Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.",
			"",
			"***Level:*** A character's level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.",
			"",
			"***Monster:*** Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.",
			"",
			"***Multiplying:*** When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.",
			"",
			"***Non-Player Character (NPC):*** These are characters controlled by the GM.",
			"",
			"***Penalty:*** Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.",
			"",
			"***Player Character (Character, PC):*** These are the characters portrayed by the players.",
			"",
			"***Round:*** Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.",
			"",
			"***Rounding:*** Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.",
			"",
			"***Saving Throw:*** When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a [saving throw](rule/saving_throws) to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw-they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), Reflex (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as fireball), and Will (used to resist mental attacks and spells).",
			"",
			"***Skill:*** A [skill](main/skills) represents a creature's ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.",
			"",
			"***Spell:*** Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.",
			"",
			"***Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):*** Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).",
			"",
			"***Spell Resistance (SR):*** Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature's SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).",
			"",
			"***Stacking:*** Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.",
			"",
			"***Supernatural Abilities (Su):*** Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability's description includes information on how it is used and its effects.",
			"",
			"***Turn:*** In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see {rule/Actions in Combat} for more details."

			"From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the Pathfinder RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character's concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.",
			"",
			"Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your Pathfinder RPG character sheet, which can be found at the back of [the physical book] and photocopied for your convenience.",
			"",
			"***Step 1-Determine Ability Scores:*** Start by generating your character's {rule/ability scores}. These six scores determine your character's most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.",
			"",
			"***Step 2-Pick Your Race:*** Next, pick your character's [race](rule/races), noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits. There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. [A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.](rule/intelligence)",
			"",
			"***Step 3-Pick Your Class:*** A character's [class](rule/classes) represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.",
			"",
			"***Step 4-Pick Skills and Select Feats:*** Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on {rule/skills}, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many {rule/feats} your character receives, based on his class and level.",
			"",
			"***Step 5-Buy Equipment:*** Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of {rule/equipment} and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy {rule/magic items} without the consent of your GM.",
			"",
			"***Step 6-Finishing Details:*** Finally, you need to determine all of a character's details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps. A level 1 character begins with maximum hit points for its Hit Die roll. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character's name, {rule/alignment}, and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game."

			"",
			"***Dice Pool:*** Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.",
			"",
			"***Purchase:*** Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his ability scores. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. See Table 1-1 on the next page for the costs of each score.

Unfortunately, many outsiders see half-orcs as hopeless abominations devoid of civility, if not monsters unworthy of pity or parley.",

			"***Dhampir:*** The accursed spawn of vampires, {race/dhampir/s} are living creatures tainted with the curse of undeath, which causes them to take damage from positive energy and gain healing from negative energy.

			"",
			"***Orcs:*** Savage, brutish, and hard to kill, {race/orc/s} are often the scourge of far-flung wildernesses and cavern deeps. Many orcs become fearsome barbarians, as they are muscular and prone to bloody rages. Those few who can control their bloodlust make excellent adventurers.",

Often stubborn and steadfast, their unyielding nature makes it hard for them to get along with most races other than dwarves. Oreads make excellent warriors and sorcerers who can manipulate the raw power of stone and earth.",

			"***Ratfolk:*** These small, ratlike humanoids are clannish and nomadic masters of trade. Often tinkers and traders, they are more concerned with accumulating interesting trinkets than amassing wealth. {race/Ratfolk} often adventure to find new and interesting curiosities rather than coin.",

			"***Sylphs:*** Ethereal folk of elemental air, {race/sylph/s} are the result of human blood mixed with that of airy elemental folk. Like ifrits, oreads, and undines, they can become powerful elemental sorcerers with command over their particular elemental dominion.

A select few see the struggle to smother such dark desires as motivation for grand heroism.",

			"Some races are so uncommon that their very existence may be the subject of debate. Living on the fringes of the wilderness, in hidden grottos deep beneath the surface, under the ocean waves, or among the clouds of the night sky, few members of these races hear the call of adventure.",
			"",
			"The 14 races presented here are all suitable to be played as PCs, but their rarity or isolation often sets them apart. While all are exotic, the reasons for their rarity are as diverse as their forms. The changeling, an offspring of a hag and a mortal lover, is an uncommon player race because of the improbability of such a foul union. Other races, like the kitsune, nagaji, samsarans, and wayangs, are often more common in certain far-flung lands but are rarely seen in most others. Still other races, like the gillmen, gripplis, merfolk, strix, and svirfneblin, typically distrust outsiders and keep to their own remote and insular communities.",
			"",
			"While these races are rare, the same can be said of anyone willing to become an adventurer. Such an activity is not for those who crave a normal life, and these races also produce the rare spirit who strikes out into the wild places of the world in search of excitement and exploration. With your GM's permission, you can select any of the following uncommon races for your player character. Each racial section provides all the information you need to create a character along with a number of new options available to characters of that race. This chapter details the following uncommon races.",
			"",
			"***Changelings:*** The offspring of hags and their mortal lovers, {race/changeling/s} are abandoned and raised by foster parents. Always female, changelings all hear a spiritual call during puberty to find their true origins. Tall and slender, with dark hair and eyes mismatched in color, changelings are eerily attractive.",
			"",
			"***Duergar:*** Gray skinned, deep-dwelling dwarves who hate their lighter skinned cousins, {race/duergar} view life as constant toil ending only in death. Though these dwarves are typically evil, honor and keeping one's word means everything to them, and a rare few make loyal adventuring companions.",
			"",
			"***Gillmen:*** Survivors of a land-dwelling culture whose homeland was destroyed, [gillmen](race/gillman) were saved and transformed into an amphibious race by the aboleths. Though in many ways they appear nearly human, gillmen's bright purple eyes and gills set them apart from humanity. Reclusive and suspicious, gillmen know that one day the aboleths will call in the debt owed to them.",
			"",
			"***Gripplis:*** Furtive frogfolk with the ability to camouflage themselves among fens and swamps, {race/grippli/s} typically keep to their wetland homes, only rarely interacting with the outside world. Their chief motivation for leaving their marshy environs is to trade in metal and gems.",
			"",
			"***Kitsune:*** These shapeshifting, foxlike folk share a love of mischief, art, and the finer things in life. They can appear as a single human as well as their true form, that of a foxlike humanoid. {race/Kitsune} are quick-witted, nimble, and gregarious, and because of this, a fair number of them become adventurers.",
			"",
			"***Merfolk:*** These creatures have the upper torso of a well-built and attractive humanoid and a lower half consisting of a finned tail. Though they are amphibious and extremely strong swimmers, their lower bodies make it difficult for them to move on land. {race/Merfolk} can be shy and reclusive. Typically keeping to themselves, they are distrustful of land-dwelling strangers.",
			"",
			"***Nagaji:*** It is believed that nagas created the nagaji as a race of servants and that the {race/nagaji} worship their creators as living gods. Due to their reptilian nature and strange mannerisms, these strange, scaly folk inspire fear and wonder in others not of their kind. They are resistant to both poison and mind-affecting magic.",
			"",
			"***Samsarans:*** Ghostly servants of karma, {race/samsaran/s} are creatures reincarnated hundreds if not thousands of times in the hope of reaching true enlightenment. Unlike humans and other races, these humanoids remember much of their past lives.",
			"",
			"***Strix:*** Hunted to dwindling numbers by humans, who see them as winged devils, {race/strix} are black-skinned masters of the nighttime sky. Their territorial conflicts have fueled their hatred for humans. This longstanding feud means that these nocturnal creatures often attack humans on sight.",
			"",
			"***Sulis:*** Also called suli-jann, these humanoids are the descendants of mortals and jann. These strong and charismatic individuals manifest mastery over elemental power in their adolescence, giving them the ability to manipulate earth, fire, ice, or electricity. This elemental power tends to be reflected in the {race/suli/'s} personality as well.",
			"",
			"***Svirfneblin:*** Gnomes who guard their hidden enclaves within dark tunnels and caverns deep under the earth, {race/svirfneblin} are as serious as their surface cousins are whimsical. They are resistant to the magic of the foul creatures that share their subterranean environs, and wield powerful protective magic. Svirfneblin are distrustful of outsiders and often hide at their approach.",
			"",
			"***Vanaras:*** These mischievous, monkeylike humanoids dwell in jungles and warm forests. Covered in soft fur and sporting prehensile tails and handlike feet, {race/vanara/s} are strong climbers. These creatures are at home both on the ground and among the treetops.",
			"",
			"***Vishkanyas:*** Strangely beautiful on the outside and poisonous on the inside, {race/vishkanya/s} see the world through slitted serpent eyes. Vishkanyas possess a serpent's grace and ability to writhe out of their enemies' grasp with ease. Vishkanyas have a reputation for being both seductive and manipulative. They can use their saliva or blood to poison their weapons.",
			"",
			"***Wayangs:*** The small {race/wayang/s} are creatures of the Plane of Shadow. They are so attuned to shadow that it even shapes their philosophy, believing that upon death they merely merge back into darkness. The mysteries of their shadowy existence grant them the ability to gain healing from negative energy as well as positive energy."

In the right light, though, androids' alien nature is revealed by the metallic sheen in their eyes and the biological, tattoo-like circuitry that riddles their skin.

The answer they arrived at was the creation of a new form of life - a melding of their own perfection of order with the unpredictable and fragile bodies and minds of mortal humanoids. Thus, the first {race/aphorite/s} came to be. Originally, they were created with nearly uniform physical appearances, but they have diversified as a result of generations spent on the Material Plane. Today, an aphorite always appears humanoid in form with golden skin that flickers and periodically coruscates with sparkling crystalline dust, and eyes and hair that tend toward metallic hues. Beyond this, they can appear similar to dwarves, elves, and humans, or any other Medium humanoid race.",

Instead, they rely on their powerful minds to sense the world around them, and subsist on nutrients absorbed from the air. This can turn against them, however, as powerful smells and inhaled poisons can render an {race/astomoi} helpless.

A living {race/being of Ib} is not a very dangerous creature, but those who gain levels in spellcasting classes can become quite formidable.",

Untold generations ago, these subterranean dwellers aspired to grand destinies, and might have achieved them if not for the planned degeneration meted out by their controllers, the {monster/owb/s}. Yet even today, dark folk are sometimes born bearing an uncanny likeness to the ancients that dark stalkers still imitate.

[Drow nobles](race/drow_noble) are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their communities. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid.",

They manifest directly on the Material Plane, incarnating from souls that have earned the honor of a second life. The souls that become {race/duskwalker/s} have often distinguished themselves in the eyes of {family/psychopomp/s} as guardians of the cycle of birth and death. Other than their gray skin, their physical features bear some resemblance to those they held in their previous lives.

Gathlains grow from the seeds of an enormous magical tree - seeds that often drift for hundreds of miles before developing into adolescent gathlains, with the tree's mistletoe grown into their flesh to form their strange wings. Despite being born with a basic understanding of their world, gathlains are inquisitive to a fault. They are known to be invaluable guides and knowledgeable explorers, if one can put up with their numerous questions and strange japes.",

These plants, named \"ghorans\" after their maker, swiftly developed the ability to move on their own, searching out the most nourishing soil and continuously adapting themselves to survive in more and more dangerous environments. As they grew in intelligence, ghorans evolved humanlike forms as a defense mechanism to induce sympathy and prevent further butchery. When he died, their maker took the secrets of creating new ghorans to his grave, and from that point forward the number of ghorans in the world became fixed.",

			"***Primitive Humans:*** Early humans were far more primitive than their modern descendants. While they still had the capacity to create great works of art and solve complex problems, the reality of their existence meant that most had to fight for survival on a daily basis. As a result, [primitive humans](race/primitive_human) devoted more of their time to honing the basic skills of to avoid predators and gather food than to higher-minded pursuits.

The {race/kasatha/s} of Golarion have a cultural tradition of exploration, and when they come of age, they leave their clan, usually for one year, then return to their people with any riches or knowledge acquired during their journeys. This ritual \"tempering\" allows young adults to undergo a period of self-discovery before they assume their adult responsibilities.",

The most obvious similarity the two sexes have is a pair of thin, twitching antennae that sprout from just below their hairlines. Beyond that, male lashunta are compact, muscular, and hirsute, whereas female lashunta are tall, lithe, and majestic. Their personalities also differ somewhat; females are generally charismatic and commanding, and males are brusque and war-like. However, both sexes are equally intelligent, civilized, and competent on the battlefield. Most lashunta prize magical, mental, and psychic potential over common physical prowess.",

Unlike many aquatic denizens, locathahs have no inherent distrust of surfacers. In fact, most locathahs enjoy conversing with surface races and often hail passing ships to exchange goods or simply pass along news. Locathahs are slender humanoids who have feathery fins running along the backs of their arms and legs, along the crown of their skulls, and down their spines.

Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur, they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance. Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related.",

Disguised as members of others races, the reptoids seek positions of power in order to secretly prepare for an invasion from their homeworld. Even those who are aware of reptoids in their midst can never be truly sure who is real and who is an alien, as these creatures are often adept at enchantment and psychic magic, which they use to cover the tracks of their deceptions and to ensure the complacency or even collusion of their soon-to-be thralls.",

Many rulers obsess over their mortality, the most brazen turning to the mystical arts, pouring their fears into splendid vessels, fashioning simulacra of themselves to bear the scourge of {faith/Pharasma}'s judgment. In the mortal world, these icons are nothing but gold with a ruler's face and name, but in death, they are {race/shabti}.

Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen by nature or the gods to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth may lie somewhere between these two ideas. For indeed, skinwalkers are those with a lycanthrope crouching somewhere in the branches of their family tree.

Erudite and aloof, the owl-like scholars embrace art, philosophy, and nebulous faiths, seeking to distance themselves from a history of barbarism and ruin.

			"***Triaxians:*** [Triaxians](race/triaxian), the race of humanoids native to Triaxus, have developed an amazing physiological adaptation to their planet's centuries-long seasons. The average Triaxian lives for only 80 years, so entire generations experience nothing but endless summer or winter throughout their lifetimes. Curiously, Triaxians born on other worlds exhibit Summerborn, Winterborn, or Transitional traits that follow the same pattern as their home world, indicating that their physiological adaptations to the Triaxian environment function according to an internal biological clock rather than in response to external stimuli.",

			"***Tritons:*** [Tritons](race/triton) first came to Golarion centuries ago from the Plane of Water, but most of them now consider the Material Plane their home. They live in many of the oceans, seas, and even rivers of Golarion, though they dislike settling in lightless oceanic depths. They are kind and good-natured creatures who maintain distant but cordial relations with others. Tritons have a reputation for fairness and honesty that endears them to coastal communities and undersea settlements of aquatic elves, locathahs, and merfolk.",

			"***Trox:*** {race/Trox} were once members of a much smaller and more docile race of subterranean burrowers, but were long ago enslaved by the {monster/duergar} and bred into useful brutes. Eventually, several clans of trox were able to escape their slavers and reach the surface world, though they found the creatures above were just as eager to enslave them.

The nature spirit that answers the call for a vine leshy creation ritual is always one that has keenly felt the influence of mortal beings.

Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and created minions with free will, and these first {race/wyrwood/s} began to question why they were involved in their masters' petty intrigues.

In other cases, you may have to exchange more than one racial trait to take one of these alternate racial traits. For example, a {race/gnome} may eschew the militant path and exchange *defensive training* and *hatred* for *the gift of tongues*, while other magic-using gnomes might forgo the traditional gnome specialty of *illusion magic* to become a *magical linguist* or even a *pyromaniac*.",

However, she could choose one of those as an alternate racial trait while also exchanging her *bonus feat* racial trait to gain an *eye for talent*.",

Some feats, rage powers, rogue talents, and other rules might not work with the unchained classes, and such rules should be reviewed before being used with the new versions.

The {class/unchained barbarian} significantly simplifies the rage bonus calculations, and she gains temporary hit points instead of raising and later decreasing her current and maximum hit points.

			"",

The {class/unchained rogue} can debilitate her enemies to dramatically alter her ability to hit or dodge them, gains a unique edge when using her favorite skills, and enjoys a significant boost to her rogue talents.",

			"From the noble paladin to the skillful rogue, each core class draws upon a central archetype. Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player's choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again.",

So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players' freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.",

When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features or those listed in one of the archetypes presented with the class. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the *elemental fist* class feature of the {archetype-monk/monk of the four winds} replaces the *stunning fist* class feature of the {class/monk}. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them - often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.",
			"",
			"A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a {class/paladin} could not be both a {archetype-paladin/hospitaler} and an {archetype-paladin/undead scourge} since they both modify the *smite evil* class feature and both replace the *aura of justice* class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an *undead scourge* and a {archetype-paladin/warrior of the holy light}, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.",
			"",
			"### Adapting Existing Characters",
			"",
			"Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn't be gaining any special advantage over other party members. As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.",
			"",
			"While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn't have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn't feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment. Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn't feel like they're being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what's best for the campaign."

			"Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character's race or class. They can enhance your character's skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn't just another kind of power you can add on to your character - it's a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as \"story seeds\" for your background; after you pick your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.",
			"",
			"Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a \"trait\" bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack - they're intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character's traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It's certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a \"Courageous\" trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn't mean you're any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.",

Player characters are special; they're the stars of the game, after all, and it makes sense that they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way.",

			"There are five original types of character traits to choose from: basic (split among four categories: Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social), campaign, race, regional, and religion.",
			"",
			"***Basic Traits:*** The original traits were split among the categories of [Combat](main/traits_combat), [Faith](main/traits_faith), [Magic](main/traits_magic), and [Social](main/traits_social). Each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren't tied to specific classes. It's perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are \"generic,\" and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.",
			"",
			"***Campaign Traits:*** These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. [Campaign traits](main/traits_campaign) tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path's Player's Guide. When playing an adventure path, a PC will usually be required to take a campaign trait as one of their two traits.",
			"",
			"***Race Traits:*** [Race traits](main/traits_race) are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a [reincarnation](spell/reincarnate) spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist; only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.",
			"",
			"***Regional Traits:*** [Regional traits](main/traits_regional) are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character's place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character's background.",
			"",
			"***Religion Traits:*** [Religion traits](main/traits_religion) indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed under {rule/Restrictions on Trait Selection}.",
			"",
			"***Drawbacks:*** [Drawbacks](main/traits_drawback) are traits in reverse. Instead of granting you a boon, they grant you a negative effect, typically in particular circumstances. If you choose to take a drawback, you get to offset this penalty by selecting an additional trait (following the same [restrictions](restrictions_on_trait_selection) on trait selections). For example, you can take a campaign trait and a magic trait, then take a drawback and a combat trait, for a total of three traits and one drawback.",
			"",

The symbiosis between adventurers and their gear is varied and complex. [Equipment traits](main/traits_equipment) are keyed to specific types of equipment. They represent an unusual knack for a particular kind of equipment (such as splash weapons) or for a specific item (such as a family heirloom sword).",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Wilderness Origins}  ",
			"***Mount Traits:*** Each of these [mount traits](main/traits_mount) detail a specific breed of riding animal and grant an additional boon to the mount or its rider. The trait granted to a mount counts against a character's total maximum number of traits. If a character replaces his mount, he effectively loses the old trait and gains the new mount's trait.",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Occult Mysteries}  ",
			"***Cosmic Traits:*** In Avistan and Garund, the Cosmic Caravan is the astrological tool of choice for most diviners. Though some cultures grant the Caravan religious connotations, it is an inherently secular system, available for use by characters of all cultures, alignments, and faiths. Players who know their characters' birth dates could incorporate the appropriate [cosmic traits](main/traits_cosmic). Each sign also features a percentage range, which allows a player who doesn't know his character's birth date to determine it with a d% roll.",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Cohorts and Companions}  ",
			"***Family Traits:*** This [trait type](main/traits_family) allows you to inject a mechanical edge into the dynamics of your family. Unlike other trait types, **you are not limited to a single family trait per character.** Many of these traits work only on a member of your family, or require another character with the same trait to be nearby for the benefits to apply. For a character to count as having the same trait, they must be your family member. At the GM's discretion, the \"family\" for some of these traits could in fact be another group with strong interpersonal ties and common interests, such as a martial arts school, army unit, mutual protection society, or criminal gang. In this case, however, they become Social traits, which limits the character to one trait.",
			"",
			"{SOURCE Chronicle of Legends}  ",
			"***Exemplar Traits:*** A character can have only one [exemplar trait](main/traits_exemplar), and selecting an exemplar trait takes the place of two regular traits. Each exemplar trait is tied to a trait category, such as combat traits or regional traits; a character with an exemplar trait is no longer restricted to a single trait of that category and can select any number of such traits when gaining further traits. In addition, a character with an exemplar trait can select the {feat/Additional Traits} feat any number of times and use the feat to gain an exemplar trait of a valid trait category for which she qualifies."

Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.",
			"",
			"Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character's development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the {feat/Additional Traits} feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he'll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits - since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait."

Adding a level generally gives you new abilities, additional skill points to spend, more hit points, possibly a permanent +1 increase to one ability score of your choice, or an additional feat (see [Table 3-1](rule/character_advancement)).

You must be able to qualify for this level before any of the following adjustments are made. Second, apply any ability score increases due to gaining a level. Third, integrate all of the level's class abilities and then roll for additional hit points. Finally, add new skills and feats.

The choice of favored class cannot be changed once the character is created, and the choice of gaining a hit point or a skill rank each time a character gains a level (including his first level) cannot be changed once made for a particular level. {rule/Prestige classes} can never be a favored class.",

The normal benefit of having a favored class is simple and effective: your character gains one extra hit point or one extra skill rank each time she gains a level in that class (or in either of two classes, if she is a half-elf). The alternate favored class abilities listed here may not have as broad an appeal as the standard choices. They are designed to reflect flavorful options that might be less useful in general but prove handy in the right situations or for a character with the right focus. Most of them play off racial archetypes, like a half-orc's toughness and proclivity for breaking things or elven grace and finesse.",
			"",
			"In most cases, these benefits are gained on a level-by-level basis: your character gains the specified incremental benefit each time she gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves. For example, a human with paladin as a favored class may choose to gain 1 point of energy resistance each time she gains a level; choosing this benefit twice increases this resistance bonus to 2, 10 times raises it to 10, and so on.",

Of course, you can still select the bonus hit point or skill rank as your favored class benefit, so there is always a reward for sticking with a favored class.",

For example, a dwarf with rogue as his favored class adds +1/2 to his trap sense ability regarding stone traps each time he selects the alternate rogue favored class benefit; though this means the net effect is +0 after selecting it once (because +1/2 rounds down to +0), after 20 levels this benefit gives the dwarf a +10 bonus to his trap sense (in addition to the base value from being a 20th-level rogue).",
			"",
			"What is presented here is a set of alternative benefits that characters of each race may choose instead of the normal benefits for their favored class. Thus, rather than taking an extra hit point or an extra skill rank, players may choose for their characters to gain the benefit listed here. This is not a permanent or irrevocable choice; just as characters could alternate between taking skill ranks and hit points when they gain levels in their favored class, these benefits provide a third option, and characters may freely alternate between them.",

The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level.

Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.",

Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See {rule/Magic Item Creation} for more details on which Craft and Profession checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item. See Magic Items for more details.",

Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to [metamagic feats](main/feats_metamagic) (86 feats), is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic feats do not affect spell-like abilities.",

			"",
			"**Sorcerers and Bards:** Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by the {feat/Quicken Spell} metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the feat.",
			"",
			"For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats:** A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a summon nature's ally spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:** With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.",

The initiator is the one activating the feat (also referred to as \"you\") and the abettor is an ally who also has the feat and whose presence and (perhaps unwilling) sacrifice allows the feat to take effect. Choosing one of these feats effectively grants consent for an ally with the same feat to harm you in combat, and vice versa, but evil characters are often willing to take big risks to get the upper hand. Some recruit devoted minions specifically to use in this way. Characters with class abilities granting allies access to teamwork feats (such as cavaliers or inquisitors) can select these teamwork feats normally, but allies who are granted these feats can use the feats only as initiators, not as abettors. An inquisitor could not grant an ally the Ally Shield feat and then use the ally as a shield, for example, but he could allow that ally to use him as a shield.",

For example, if you're at 6th level, an appropriate number of creatures have CRs that add up to 30. This calculation is based on your current character level, not the level at which you selected the story feat. Overly easy challenges (encounters with CRs of 3 or more below your character level) don't count unless circumstances make them much more difficult to handle.",
			"",
			"***Challenging Foe:*** This is a foe or group of foes with a total CR of 10 or a CR of 3 plus your character level, whichever is higher. If this refers to a distinct individual, the foe's CR is set when the feat is taken, but the foe advances in power as you do. Otherwise, it refers to your current level. A typical recurring foe advances in CR by 1 for every 1-2 levels you gain.",
			"",
			"***Character's Level:*** Normally, this is your actual character level. If you're a creature best represented by CR rather than character level (such as most monsters with more than 1 HD), use your calculated CR instead of your character level.",
			"",
			"***Decisively Defeat:*** You overcome a foe in some way, such as by killing the creature, knocking it unconscious, or causing it to be taken prisoner. You must be a significant participant in the conflict to defeat the opponent, even if another strikes the final blow. Whether or not merely causing the enemy to flee qualifies is up to the GM. Generally, driving off an enemy while causing little actual harm does not qualify as a decisive defeat.",
			"",
			"***Slay:*** Slaying a foe includes killing it, destroying it, turning it to stone, banishing it to the Abyss, or otherwise eliminating it in a fashion reversible only by powerful magic. Unless otherwise noted, you must deal the final blow yourself to slay a creature.",
			"",
			"***Thwart:*** Distinct from defeating a foe, thwarting a foe involves disrupting its plans in a substantial and essentially permanent fashion. Deposing a lord, bringing down a priest's temple, or banishing a sorcerer to the depths of Hell all qualify as thwarting. You keep any benefits gained by thwarting a foe even if it survives defeat and returns more powerful than before. You must be a significant participant in the events that lead to your foe being thwarted for your actions to count toward fulfilling a story requirement.",
			"",
			"#### Stacking",
			"",
			"Most story feat bonuses are untyped, and stack with almost any other bonus. However, if you have multiple story feats, their untyped bonuses do not stack with each other. For example, if two story feats gave you a bonus on saving throws, you would add only the higher bonus."

Trade goods are the exception to the rule that you can sell an item for half its price; they're valuable enough to be exchanged almost as if they were cash itself. Trade goods are usually transported and sold in larger quantities than the amount listed. A farmer may have 10- and 20-pound sacks of potatoes to sell to a large family or restaurant, and be resistant to tearing open a bag just to sell a few individual potatoes.",
			"",

			"",
			"***Food:*** Food items includes staples such as wheat, nuts, or cheese, plus more exotic foods or ingredients such as chilies, coffee beans, or honey. Note that some of the food items here have different prices than in the section on food, because purchasing that item as something ready to eat includes the cost (in money or labor) of preparing and cooking the food. For example, turnips as a trade good are 2 cp per pound, but a poor meal (which primarily consists of turnips) is 1 sp per day. You can buy a 10-pound bag of turnips for 2 sp, but you'd have to cut and boil them to turn them into a meal.",
			"",
			"***Raw Materials:*** Raw materials have little use as-is but can be made into other useful or valuable items. Iron, stone, darkwood, leather, cloth, and fur pelts are raw materials. Metals are usually sold as ingots or rough nuggets, but can be transported or sold as ore.",
			"",
			"The value of metal ore depends on its grade: how much of it is valuable metal out of the total volume of common rock. For a typical fantasy campaign, an ore's grade may be as high as 60% (for some particularly rich iron deposits) or as low as 5% (any less than this and it's not cost-effective to mine it). For convenience, assume that typical ore is 25% grade. Multiply the pure metal's price per pound by this grade percentage to determine the best value of the ore. For example, gold is 50 gp per pound, so a 25% grade ore is worth about 50 gp &times; 25% = 12-1/2 gp per pound. Given the cost of smelting, ore is usually worth one-half to three-quarters this value (so the 25% grade gold ore is actually bought and sold for about 6 gp to 9 gp per pound).",
			"",
			"***Spices:*** Spices such as garlic, cumin, fennel, salt, and ginger are used to flavor other foods. They are usually sold in jars, bottles, or waxed-cloth packets.",

Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons possessed by their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls.",

A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.",
			"",
			"***Double Weapons:*** Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaves, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see {rule/two-weapon fighting}).",
			"",

			"",
			"***Thrown Weapons:*** Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range column), and a character who does so takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.",
			"",
			"***Projectile Weapons:*** Blowguns, light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, halfling sling staves, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he uses a bow or a sling.",
			"",
			"***Ammunition:*** Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), darts (for blowguns), or sling bullets (for slings and halfling sling staves). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.",

If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon, a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.",

For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon's designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.",
			"",
			"***Improvised Weapons:*** Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet."

When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone.

Note that charging an item from a generator is more efficient, as any charges drained from a battery in excess of the number of charges an item can store are lost.",

			"The technology found in the hands of Numeria's denizens isn't usually pristine. Between languishing in forgotten ruins open to the elements, being used by those ignorant of the nature of this technology, and having no one skilled at building, maintaining, or repairing such devices, most technological items are \"timeworn\" - damaged and malfunctioning (when not completely non-functional). These malfunctions manifest in two ways: limited charges and glitches.",
			"",
			"Only technological items that consume charges (including nanite canisters) or are pharmaceutical items can be affected by these timeworn rules, though any technological item can still become broken or non-functional just as any other item.",
			"",
			"A piece of timeworn technology may have additional aesthetic and functional differences from a new piece of the same equipment. Many of these effects are purely cosmetic, such as cracks in the casing of an arc grenade or primitive etchings on a suit of technological armor placed there by a barbarian millennia ago. Pieces of timeworn technology may also have minor mechanical effects beyond glitches (at the GM's discretion). A timeworn laser pistol might constantly hum at a low but noticeable frequency, imparting a -1 penalty on Stealth checks. A timeworn plasma grenade could be caked in a strange viscous fluid that has a pungent odor, making its wielder more easily tracked via scent. Timeworn technological items should clearly evoke a sense of age and danger, and even the most standard piece of Androffan gear can be made unique based on individual deteriorations.",
			"",
			"Note that not every technological item in Numeria is timeworn, but most technology that PCs encounter outside of the deepest and most remote of Numerian ruins will be (though the Technic League jealously guards a significant number of pristine technological artifacts). These items function as presented, can be recharged, and do not suffer glitches.",
			"",
			"A timeworn technological item that is still somewhat functioning is worth half of its normal listed price, though one drained of its charges is worth 1% of its normal value, as a curiosity to collectors. Timeworn technology also has the following properties.",

			"***Glitches:*** Timeworn technology sometimes doesn't work the way it was originally intended to. When an item glitches, its effect is hampered or enhanced, as determined by a d% roll. See the inside front cover for a complete list of glitch effects for armor, weapons, pharmaceuticals, and other technological equipment. Not all glitches are catastrophic; they represent unpredictable effects, for good and ill.",
			"",
			"When a timeworn technological item is first used after a month or more of inactivity, there's a 50% chance that it will glitch. Additionally, when using an item in a way that would drain its last charge, there's a 50% chance it will glitch. If an item requires a d20 roll (such as a skill check or an attack roll) to activate or use, it has a 50% chance to glitch on a natural 1."

Every robot has a dedicated power generator within it that provides enough energy to run that robot and nothing more. Generators that are free-standing devices or built into complexes can be used to charge technological items capable of being recharged. A device hooked directly to a functioning power generator uses the generator's energy rather than its own stored energy.",

Most of the generators have long since fallen into disrepair, and those few that still function are jealously defended. Some wonder if portable generators exist, but no one has found evidence of any.",
			"",
			"The total amount of energy a generator can provide is known as it's yield-the number of charges it generates per hour. A portion of this yield may be dedicated to devices directly wired into it, such as keeping infrastructure running in a complex-this is referred to as dedicated yield. Dedicated yield isn't available for other purposes while it's providing power to those devices. A generator's available yield is what's left over, and can be used to power or recharge devices that can be removed.",
			"",
			"Two items can be used to draw power from a generator: a power cable and a power receiver. A generator's integrated power transmitter can broadcast power to a receiver within 1,000 feet unless otherwise noted. This distance is halved for every 5 feet of metal or 20 feet of solid stone between the generator and the receiver.",
			"",
			"An item that uses a set number of charges per hour reduces a generator's available yield by that amount, making the yield dedicated while the item is attached, as if the item is hard-wired into the generator. An item that uses 1 or more charges each time it's activated (such as most weapons) reduces the generator's yield by that amount each time it is activated. For example, a laser pistol would consume 1 charge from the yield each time it's fired. A nuclear resonator, on the other hand, consumes 5 charges each time it's fired-thus, when attached to a generator, it consumes 5 charges from the generator's yield each time it's used.",
			"",
			"A generator can be forced to exceed its yield, but this can result in disaster. Whenever charges are drawn from a generator in excess of its yield, the generator must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1 per charge over that hour's yield + 5 per incidence of exceeded yield in the past hour). Success indicates that the generator outputs the additional charges (with a 5% chance that the item glitches as though it were timeworn). Failure indicates that the generator doesn't deliver the additional charges and the item doesn't activate. If it fails by 5 or more, the generator shuts down, cutting off all power to all items using it, and cannot be restarted for 1 hour. (Restarting a generator that's shut down in this way requires a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, but other actions may be necessary as well at the GM's discretion.) If a generator fails this Fortitude save by 10 or more, it explodes-the details of this explosion vary by generator type. (Other circumstances may cause a generator to explode, with the DC at the GM's discretion.)",
			"",
			"All generators have hardness and hit points. An active generator that is reduced to 0 hit points must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or explode. All generators are Colossal objects, and thus have an AC of -5. Most generators emit a lot of noise, steam, and other distracting elements, penalizing Perception checks attempted to perceive anything within 60 feet (other than the generator) by the indicated amount."

When determining the required time, ignore any fixed costs such as the weapon portion of implanted weaponry.",

In order to craft a technological item, one must secure a laboratory for use.

Each increment up to an equal length beyond that radius degrades the radiation strength by one level. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation 21 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation from 41 to 60 feet.",
