			"The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures. Helping them tell this story is the Game Master (or GM), who decides what threats the player characters (or PCs) face and what sorts of rewards they earn for succeeding at their quest. Think of it as a cooperative storytelling game, where the players play the protagonists and the Game Master acts as the narrator, controlling the rest of the world.",
			"",
			"If you are a player, you make all of the decisions for your character, from what abilities your character has to the type of weapon he carries. Playing a character, however, is more than just following the rules in this book. You also decide your character's personality. Is he a noble knight, set on vanquishing a powerful evil, or is he a conniving rogue who cares more about gold than glory? The choice is up to you.",
			"",
			"If you are a Game Master, you control the world that the players explore. Your job is to bring the setting to life and to present the characters with challenges that are both fair and exciting. From the local merchant prince to the rampaging dragon, you control all of the characters that are not being played by the players. Paizo's Pathfinder Adventure Path series, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder Chronicles world guides provide everything you need to run a game, or you can invent your own, using the rules in this book as well as the monsters found in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.",
			"",
			"**What You Need:** In addition to this book, you will need a number of special dice to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dice that come with most board games have six sides, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game uses dice with four sides, six sides, eight sides, ten sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides. Dice of this sort can be found at your local game store or online at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"In addition to dice, if you are a player, you will need a character sheet (which can be photocopied from the back of this book) and, if the Game Master uses a map to represent the adventure, a small figurine to represent your character. These figurines, or miniatures, can also be found at most game stores. They come in a wide variety of styles, so you can probably find a miniature that relatively accurately depicts your character.",
			"",
			"If you are the Game Master, you will need a copy of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, which contains the rules for a whole spectrum of monsters, from the mighty dragon to the lowly goblin. While many of these monsters can be used to fight against the players, others might provide useful information or become powerful allies. Some might even join the group, with one of the players taking on the role of a monstrous character. In addition, you should have your own set of dice and some sort of screen you can use to hide your notes, maps, and dice rolls behind. (Although you should be honest about the results of your dice rolls, sometimes the results are not evident, and openly rolling the dice might give away too much information.) Combat in the Pathfinder RPG can be resolved in one of two ways: you can describe the situation to the characters and allow them to interact based on the description you provide, or you can draw the situation on a piece of paper or a specially made battle mat and allow the characters to move their miniatures around to more accurately represent their position during the battle. While both ways have their advantages, if you choose the latter, you will need a mat to draw on, such as Paizo's line of GameMastery Flip-Mats, as well as miniatures to represent the monsters or other adversaries. These can also be found at your local game shop, or at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"**Playing the Game:** While playing the Pathfinder RPG, the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.",
			"",
			"Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as \"d#,\" with the -#- representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the \"d.\" For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or - after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character's skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a -4- and the other d10 rolls a -2,- then you've generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with -10,- -20,- -30,- and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you must round a number, always round down.",
			"",
			"As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges. While a 1st-level character might be up to saving a farmer's daughter from rampaging goblins, defeating a terrifying red dragon might require the powers of a 20th-level hero. It is the Game Master's duty to provide challenges for your character that are engaging, but not so deadly as to leave you with no hope of success.",
			"",
			"Above all, have fun. Playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be exciting and rewarding for both the Game Master and the players. Adventure awaits!",
			"",
			"### The Most Important Rule",
			"",
			"The rules in this book are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of \"house rules\" that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the Pathfinder RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt."

			"The Pathfinder RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.",
			"",
			"**Ability Score:** Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature's most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.",
			"",
			"**Action:** An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of [different kinds of actions](rule/actions_in_combat), such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action.",
			"",
			"**Alignment:** Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single \"N.\"",
			"",
			"**Armor Class (AC):** All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.",
			"",
			"**Base Attack Bonus (BAB):** Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature's base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of [full-round action](rule/full-round_actions)).",
			"",
			"**Bonus:** Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not \"stack\")-only the greater bonus granted applies.",
			"",
			"**Caster Level (CL):** Caster level represents a creature's power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster's level.",
			"",
			"**Class:** [Classes](classes) represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the core classes or prestige classes, since these are the most powerful. Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful.",
			"",
			"**Check:** A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws.",
			"",
			"**Combat Maneuver:** This is [an action taken in combat](rule/combat_maneuvers) that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him.",
			"",
			"**Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB):** This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character's d20 roll.",
			"",
			"**Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD):** This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature's CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.",
			"",
			"**Concentration Check:** When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a [concentration check](rule/concentration) or fail to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"**Creature:** A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.",
			"",
			"**Damage Reduction (DR):** Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a -/- followed by the type, such as -10/cold iron.- Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted by the --- symbol. See Appendix 1 for more information.",
			"",
			"**Difficulty Class (DC):** Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.",
			"",
			"**Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):** Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.",
			"",
			"**Experience Points (XP):** As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.",
			"",
			"**Feat:** A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.",
			"",
			"**Game Master (GM):** A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM's duty is to provide a fair and fun game.",
			"",
			"**Hit Dice (HD):** Hit Dice represent a creature's general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster's general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as -3d8.- This value is used to determine a creature's total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature's hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.",
			"",
			"**Hit Points (hp):** Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature's hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score, it dies.",
			"",
			"**Initiative:** Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.",
			"",
			"**Level:** A character's level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.",
			"",
			"**Monster:** Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.",
			"",
			"**Multiplying:** When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.",
			"",
			"**Nonplayer Character (NPC):** These are characters controlled by the GM.",
			"",
			"**Penalty:** Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.",
			"",
			"**Player Character (Character, PC):** These are the characters portrayed by the players.",
			"",
			"**Round:** Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.",
			"",
			"**Rounding:** Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.",
			"",
			"**Saving Throw:** When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a saving throw to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw-they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), Reflex (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as fireball), and Will (used to resist mental attacks and spells).",
			"",
			"**Skill:** A skill represents a creature's ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.",
			"",
			"**Spell:** Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.",
			"",
			"**Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):** Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).",
			"",
			"**Spell Resistance (SR):** Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature's SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).",
			"",
			"**Stacking:** Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.",
			"",
			"**Supernatural Abilities (Su):** Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability's description includes information on how it is used and its effects.",
			"",
			"**Turn:** In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see [Actions in Combat](rule/actions_in_combat) for more details."

			"From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the Pathfinder RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character's concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.",

			"",
			"**Step 1-Determine Ability Scores:** Start by generating your character's [ability scores](rule/ability_scores). These six scores determine your character's most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.",
			"",
			"**Step 2-Pick Your Race:** Next, pick your character's [race](races), noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits. There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. [A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.](rule/intelligence)",
			"",
			"**Step 3-Pick Your Class:** A character's [class](classes) represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.",
			"",
			"**Step 4-Pick Skills and Select Feats:** Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on [skills](skills), but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many [feats](feats) your character receives, based on his class and level.",
			"",
			"**Step 5-Buy Equipment:** Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without the consent of your GM.",
			"",
			"**Step 6-Finishing Details:** Finally, you need to determine all of a character's details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps. A level 1 character begins with maximum hit points for its Hit Die roll. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character's name, alignment, and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game."

			"The following race discussions also describe alternate racial traits for each character race. It is important to note that these racial traits are not the same as the trait rules. Those traits are effectively half-feats, intended to tie characters to the specific nations, cultures, regions, and races of the Golarion campaign world. Racial traits, on the other hand, are those racial abilities described at the bottom of each race's descriptive page. Some races have few racial traits, like half-orcs and humans. Others, like dwarves and gnomes, have many. All of these racial traits represent typical members of the race and the kinds of special abilities they gain from their heritage, whether from biology, racial attitudes, or otherwise.",
			"",
			"This chapter also contains a list of alternate class features for each race. Some of them play on racial archetypes not reflected in the standard racial traits, like a gnome's love of languages or tinkering or a half ling's mastery of thrown items or of slipping through a battlefield under the feet of larger races. In order to choose one of these racial traits, you must exchange one or more of the existing racial traits available to your character. These racial traits replace a character's normal racial traits; they are not abilities gained in addition to them. In many cases, racial abilities are exchanged on a one-to-one basis; you give up one racial ability from the Core Rulebook to gain one presented in this book. In other cases, you may have to exchange more than one racial trait to take one of these alternate racial traits. For example, a gnome may eschew the militant path and exchange defensive training and hatred for the gift of tongues, while other magic-using gnomes might forgo the traditional gnome specialty of illusion magic to become a magical linguist or even a pyromaniac.",
			"",
			"You can exchange one or several of your character's normal racial traits, but of course you cannot exchange the same racial trait more than once. If a human exchanges the skilled trait to become either a child of the fields or a child of the street, she cannot exchange it twice to take both new traits. However, she could choose one of those as an alternate racial trait while also exchanging her bonus feat racial trait to gain an eye for talent.",
			"",
			"As with any alternate or optional rule, you must first get the permission of your GM to exchange any of your character's normal racial traits for those in this chapter."

			"From the noble paladin to the skillful rogue, each core class in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game draws upon a central archetype. Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player's choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, the following pages explore new rules, options, and alternate class features for each core class. So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players' freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.",
			"",
			"# Alternate Class Features",
			"",
			"Most of the options presented on the following pages include a host of alternate class features. When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found in the Core Rulebook or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them-often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.",
			"",
			"A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.",
			"",
			"# Adapting Existing Characters",
			"",
			"Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn't be gaining any special advantage over other party members. As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.",
			"",
			"While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn't have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn't feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment. Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn't feel like they're being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what's best for the campaign."

			"A character background details the significant events, people, and life experiences that make up the origin story of a character prior to his or her role in the saga of a campaign. Some characters are born under extraordinary circumstances, heralded by prophecy and omen; others live completely ordinary lives until some dramatic event casts them onto the dangerous roads traveled by heroes and monsters. A character's background forms the basis for complex motivations and emotional vulnerabilities, and these past experiences guide the way the character responds to circumstances in his or her present life. As the child of a goddess and a mortal, do you view ordinary creatures as inferior beings? Having grown up in abject poverty, how do you react when someone steals from you? If a militant theocracy burned your siblings as heretics, how do you respond to clerics of other religions? When playing a new character, the details in your background give you a quick handle on your past, making it easier to slip into the character's skin and embrace this mind-set in play. As the campaign proceeds, your early adventures gradually become part of that background-a seamless chain of events that make up your life and contribute to your constantly changing and evolving persona."

			"There are several ways you can approach character background using Ultimate Campaign. One approach is an organic method-brainstorming character details, guided by the questions in the following sections of this chapter. Alternatively, you might use the [background generator](rule/background_generator), to compile your history randomly. You can also use the charts and tables in the background generator as a springboard for your imagination, deliberately selecting background elements that inspire you or fit the direction you wish to explore.",
			"",
			"For published Pathfinder Adventure Paths, you often have the option of selecting campaign traits that tie your character thematically into a specific storyline relevant to that Adventure Path. Check with your GM to see if she can point you to official campaign traits or other traits that may help link your character to the campaign or adventure she's running. Such traits provide a good foundation upon which you can add details from this book, either by rolling randomly or by manually selecting background details that mesh well with your campaign's themes.",
			"",
			"No matter how you go about developing your character's background, the next step is to quantify that background in terms of game mechanics. Select two traits (or three traits and a drawback) that capture the background you imagined. [Traits and drawbacks are listed here](unknown/traits_and_drawbacks_are_listed_here). These traits provide small bonuses that reflect skills and knowledge gained from your life experiences. The drawback, if you choose to take one, represents an emotional vulnerability or character flaw that should not only provide a slight mechanical disadvantage, but also (more importantly) serve as a roleplaying tool for making interesting choices. After all, nobody's perfect!"

			"**Source** [Ultimate Campaign pg. 8](source/ultimate_campaign)",
			"",
			"Sometimes, creating a character that feels original and stands out from others of the same class and race can seem like a challenge. It's easy to fall into playing the stereotype of a race or class-the ale-swilling dwarven fighter with the battleaxe, the quick and wise elven ranger roaming the woodlands with a longbow, the sneaky and childlike halfling rogue, and so on. While there's nothing wrong with these, and they can be a lot of fun-after all, there's a reason they became cultural archetypes in the first place- sometimes you want to try something new. Presented here are some techniques you can use to help you break away from stereotypes.",
			"",
			"**Originality:** If you strive too hard to be original, you'll likely be disappointed when you discover that someone else has already implemented your idea in a book, film, game, or other kind of media. Yet, while original ideas are hard to come by, every person you meet is unique, shaped by his or her individual experiences. Rather than strive for an original concept, try focusing on the experiences that define your character's life and give him his personality and point of view. Specific experiences will help move you away from the stereotypical and cliche.",
			"",
			"**The Third Idea:** When you're brainstorming ideas, it sometimes helps to reject the first and second ideas that leap to mind, and instead consider the third, fourth, and fifth ideas you come up with. This way, you're challenging yourself to explore wider, more interesting possibilities full of unexplored story potential. The easy ideas that spring to mind first probably do so because you've seen them before.",
			"",
			"**Opposites:** When you're stuck on an characteristic that strikes you as boring, plain, or stereotypical, decide that the opposite is instead true of yourself. For instance, if you're playing the aforementioned dwarven fighter, perhaps one of the following holds:",
			"",
			"- You have taken a vow against drinking, can't hold your liquor, or act in a peculiar, eccentric way when drunk.",
			"- You can't grow a beard.",
			"- You favor a weapon that is not a hammer, axe, crossbow, or other typical dwarven weapon.",
			"- You live in a forest or on an island rather than in the hills and mountains favored by most dwarves.",
			"- You are a pacifist who loathes violence.",
			"- You deeply pity or love orcs and goblins.",
			"",
			"Any one of these character quirks can prove ripe for character development and story hooks in the campaign.",
			"",
			"**Steal Shamelessly:** Sometimes when starting a new character, you just need a good template or foundation from which to build. Characters from literature, comics, history, real life, or television and film can provide that foundation in an instant. The key is to alter various aspects of the model character until you have changed enough to have an altogether different concept.",
			"",
			"How would Count Dracula be different as an elven wizard? What about as a halfling cleric? Are you obsessed with feasting on blood, or are you simply ancient, creepy, solitary, and mysterious?",
			"",
			"What about reinterpreting Julius Caesar as a human rogue or a gnome illusionist? Is this human rogue one of three mobsters scheming to eliminate the competition and rule a city the way Caesar eliminated his competitors to rule Rome? Has your gnome illusionist received a prophetic message predicting his own death, as Caesar did from the soothsayer?",
			"",
			"Building on the foundations of established characters or people gives you a framework, at which point you just need to give yourself different circumstances in order to inspire a new idea, one that will grow on its own as you continue to play. The initial inspiration or model you choose helps you come to grips with your character quickly without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel.",
			"",
			"Another way to accomplish this is to combine notable traits of two disparate characters from media or history. For instance, how would you play a character with Sherlock Holmes' skill at deduction and Hamlet's indecision? Achilles' battle prowess paired with Nikola Tesla's inventive mind? Merlin's magic with Marie Curie's search for scientific truth? Joan of Arc's faithful conviction and Napoleon's overwhelming ambition?"

These shouldn't be commonplace or mundane. \"Tall\" is a poor one, but \"too big for my body\" could be great. \"Charismatic\" is weak, but \"flirts with nearly everybody I meet\" is specific and actionable. \"Homebody\" is not as good a quirk as \"Tall\"",

Think of each element on the background generator's tables as a piece of story material that you can link together with other random pieces to create a story you otherwise might now have imagined. Use this tool to inspire creativity rather than as hard-and-fast rules to mandate rigid and seamless character backgrounds. Though the generator provides many foundational details of a character's background, it takes some creative thought to massage the specifics together.

Like the background questions presented earlier in this chapter, the ideas on these tables are simply suggestions designed to channel and focus your imagination.",

At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you've gained access to. If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection). When you gain access to a story feat, it means you've met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation."

You gain access to the Alchemical Intuition magic trait. |",

You gain access to the Focused Burn magic trait. |",

You gain access to the Enduring Mutagen magic trait. |",

You gain access to the Precise Treatment magic trait. |",

Though others in your craft come up with ways to substitute certain ingredients when making bombs or mutagens, you disdain such practices, deeming them pollutions. To you, there is always a perfect ingredient and its addition makes your alchemy more potent. You gain access to the Meticulous Concoction magic trait. |",

Perhaps you watched someone get swallowed by a storm-tossed sea or witnessed a summer forest fire destroy your home and all of your possessions. No matter the impetus, the unpredictability of nature made you feel small and helpless.

You gain access to the Reckless combat trait and the Foeslayer story feat. |",

Your rage is fueled by self-loathing, or by projecting this part of yourself onto a foe you wish to destroy. You gain access to the Axe to Grind combat trait. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Hatred of Civilization:** When you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you.

You gain access to the Savage social trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Persecution:** You grew up under the persecution of another power-perhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors. You gain access to the Bullied combat trait. |",

In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you rage, a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you're going down, you're taking everyone with you. You gain access to the Reactionary combat trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Chaos Embraced:** You grew up in wild lands where there were no laws except for those of nature-the laws of the predator and the prey. You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that's how you like it. You gain access to the Unpredictable social trait. |",

Most likely, you pick your own race as your dominant favored enemy, and you excel as a spy or assassin paid to capture enemies of your organization. You gain access to the Cold and Calculating combat trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Divine Purpose:** Not all those who hear the voices of the gods can distill that echo into magical power like clerics or oracles. These whispers of belief encouraged you to track and hunt those creatures who pose the greatest threat to your faith. Perhaps you're a good ranger who hunts the undead or devotes effort to slaying fiends, or you could choose to target good fey and celestials, emboldened by divine invective. You gain access to the Faith's Hunter combat trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Nightmare Slayer:** From an early age, you stood up against some of the most terrifying creatures imaginable, facing off against creatures most mortals only dream of in their wildest nightmares. Possibly hailing from lands besieged by dragons or plagued by the living dead, you are not only resistent to the fear such creatures normally engender, but you live to show your enemies the face of the unafraid. You gain access to the Fearless Defiance faith trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Opportunist:** You are an expert in creatures both common and exotic, particularly in terms of what valuable items you can harvest from their remains. The natural world exists for the benefit of those who know what to take, and you have learned how to scavenge pelts, toxins, and even rare spell components from your defeated foes. You might pick animals, magical beasts, or dragons as your dominant favored enemy-or humanoids if you're a particularly grisly trophy collector. You gain access to the Harvester social trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Survivalist:** You were orphaned at a young age and left to fend for yourself in the wilds, or simply lived a life at the edge of society that required a constant scrabble for basic existence.

			"| 31-40 | **Spy:** You've always had an innocent expression and a silver tongue, so naturally you were recruited as a spy during your childhood. You could have come from any social class; you might have gathered information as an urchin on the streets or acted as servant to one lord while you reported to another. You gain access to the Fast Talker social trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **The Kill:** You killed someone when you were relatively young. You might have done it in self- defense, in anger, or as part of an initiation ritual.

You gain access to the Killer combat trait and the Innocent Blood story feat. |",
			"| 51-60 | **The Trained:** Your early talent for feats of agility and acrobatics garnered you an experienced mentor.

What slumbered in your blood has never quieted, and you frequently draw upon the inspiration of your awakening. You gain access to the Ascendant Recollection magic trait. |",

As these episodes increased in both frequency and clarity, they unlocked a power in your blood you didn't know you had. You gain access to the Strength Foretold magic trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Failed Wizard:** Although your arcane aptitude was evident at an early age, you were pushed toward wizardry as the conduit for your magic. While you never mastered magic in this fashion, your time spent studying arcane tomes gave you obscure but often pertinent knowledge. You gain access to the Reluctant Apprentice magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **One of a Kind:** You know that sorcerous power comes from the blood, but as far as you know, none of your ancestors possessed your gift. You keep searching for the reason for your magical powers, which has led you to greater proficiency with divinations and a keen interest in the workings of your bloodline. You gain access to the Knowledgeable Caster magic trait. |",

			"| 51-60 | **Proud Heritage:** You hail from a long line of prominent sorcerers with even more prominent ancestral features. Your acceptance of your bloodline brings with it a pride and imposing mien that becomes amplified among others. You gain access to the Imposing Scion social trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Shameful Heritage:** The obvious hints of your heritage were a source of shame to your family. No matter the manifestation of your differences, being a pariah taught you to practice your arts in secret. You gain access to the Unseen But Not Undone magic trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Too Lucky:** You've always had a knack for getting out of trouble. This sense of preternatural good fortune led to your inquiries into magic and the discovery of your own sorcerous powers. You gain access to the Fate's Favored faith trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Unharmed:** At some point in your early life, you were exposed to something dangerous like a fall into stormy waters or a spell cast your way. But instead of dying, you survived entirely unscathed. This experience either first hinted at or confirmed that you were different, marking the first step on your path to sorcery. You gain access to the Unscathed magic trait. |",
			"| 91-100 | **Wild Talent:** The magic in your blood was always as uncontrollable as it has powerful. You were forced to learn control at an early age, either out of fear that your powers might hurt someone or out of remorse once they had. This relentless vigilance and self-control gave you tremendous focus and arm you with strategic methods to redirect those wild energies coursing through you. You gain access to the Volatile Conduit magic trait. |",

			"| 11-20 | **Caretaker:** You met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this panicked, otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, outsider or not. You gain access to the Destined Diplomat social trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Forced to Confront Your Own Limits:** The bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your eidolon-whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. You gain access to the Desperate Speed magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Imaginary Friends:** As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of outsiders trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to summon your eidolon and other outsiders, these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of outsiders. You gain access to the Unintentional Linguist social trait. |",
			"| 41-50 | **Monophobic:** You were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your eidolon that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your eidolon is not with you, you know it's never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. You gain access to the Perpetual Companion faith trait. |",
			"| 51-60 | **Outsider's Lineage:** You have the blood of outsiders in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. You gain access to the Planar Savant faith trait. |",
			"| 61-70 | **Pick On Someone Your Own Size:** When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your eidolon trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. You gain access to the Twinned Presence magic trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Raising Gone Wrong:** You lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the dead, but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occur... at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kin's soul bonded with a powerful outsider on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your eidolon. Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. You gain access to the Loyalty across Lifetimes faith trait. |",
			"| 81-90 | **Saved by Another:** Someone or something saved you from great danger.

			"| 91-100 | **Stranger in Your Own Skin:** You have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasn't truly yours. Your quest to become what you've always felt you should be led you to your eidolon, in which you found what you see as your own idealized form.

Only when you turned your eye to ancient tomes and ruins and experimented with strange powers beyond your comprehension were you able to get what you wanted. You gain access to the Dangerously Curious magic trait. |",

			"| 61-70 | **Initiated:** When you came of age, a coven of witches initiated you into their circle because you showed great promise. After your initiation ritual, you changed on a fundamental level. You gain access to the Mentored social trait. |",
			"| 71-80 | **Invocation:** When you reached adolescence, you wanted power and you wanted it immediately. You didn't have the patience or tolerance to endure endless years of boring theory and formal magical training, so you offered up your body and soul in an invocation to an entity that would grant your desire. You gain access to the Oathbound faith trait. |",

			"| 11-20 | **Dangerous Intellect:** At a young age, those around you, whether family or friends, realized that your intellect was more than mere precociousness. As your sense of curiosity became dangerous, those responsible for you pushed you into studying magic in the hopes that you would find infinite puzzles to solve. You gain access to the Tireless Logic social trait. |",
			"| 21-30 | **Fitting In:** You hail from a long line of sorcerers or from a community known for its natural affinity for magic. Your manifestation of wizardly talent, as opposed to blood-based sorcery, caused you to hide those talents at a young age, and then to disguise them as sorcery to the best of your ability later. You still retain some tricks from this early misdirection. You gain access to the Shrouded Casting magic trait. |",
			"| 31-40 | **Gifted Pride:** Your affinity for magic has made you somewhat crass and arrogant, though some find your blunt disposition charming or worthy of respect. The air of superiority surrounding you is palpable and allows you to use you intellect to cow others at times when lesser individuals might barely get a word in. You gain access to the Bruising Intellect social trait. |",

You were burdened by the knowledge that magic- perhaps even a spell as simple as [feather fall](spell/feather_fall) - could have changed the course of lives. You've dedicated yourself to magic in an effort to make sure that you are never subject to the capricious whims of fate again. You gain access to the Desperate Resolve magic trait. |",

Magic was your destined path before you were even born, and both your family and those who know of your lineage have supported this notion your entire life, granting you an unwavering confidence in your talents.

Position 1 on the track represents the first CP added. Each point on the first track represents you turning away from what is good and heading down a path of evil. Each point on the second track represents a disregard for law as you grow more chaotic. This determines how the conflict ultimately affected your alignment and to what extent.

			"Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character's race or class. They can enhance your character's skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn't just another kind of power you can add on to your character-it's a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as \"story seeds\" for your background; after you pick your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.",
			"",
			"**Many traits grant a new type of bonus:** a \"trait\" bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack-they're intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character's traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It's certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a \"Courageous\" trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn't mean you're any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.",

			"",
			"**Basic Traits:** There are a total of 40 basic traits, which are split evenly among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren't tied to specific classes. It's perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are \"generic,\" and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.",
			"",
			"**Campaign Traits:** These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path's Player's Guide.",
			"",
			"**Race Traits:** Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a [reincarnation](spell/reincarnation) spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist-only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.",
			"",
			"**Regional Traits:** Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character's place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character's background.",
			"",
			"**Religion Traits:** Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions on Trait Selection.",
			"",
			"**Drawbacks:** Drawbacks are traits in reverse. Instead of granting you a boon, they grant you a negative effect, typically in particular circumstances. If you choose to take a drawback, you can take a third trait that you have access to. You don't have to take a drawback."

			"There are a few rules governing trait selection. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits (the four basic traits each count as a separate list for this purpose). Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.",
			"",
			"Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character's development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the Additional Traits feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he'll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits-since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait."

Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts, as their scores might not support given classes or personalities, and instead are best designed around their ability scores.",

			"",
			"**Dice Pool:** Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.",
			"",
			"**Purchase:** Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his ability scores. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. See Table 1-1 on the next page for the costs of each score. After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.",
			"",

Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are typically built using as few as 3 points. See Table 1-2 on the next page for a number of possible point values depending on the style of campaign.

For example, a dwarf with rogue as his favored class adds +1/2 to his trap sense ability regarding stone traps each time he selects the alternate rogue favored class benefit; though this means the net effect is +0 after selecting it once (because +1/2 rounds down to +0), after 20 levels this benefit gives the dwarf a +10 bonus to his trap sense (in addition to the base value from being a 20th-level rogue).",

With the GM's permission, a player may assign an evil alignment to his PC, but such characters are often a source of disruption and conflict with good and neutral party members. GMs are encouraged to carefully consider how evil PCs might affect the campaign before allowing them.",
			"",
			"**Lawful Good:** A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.",

			"",
			"Neutral good means doing what is good and right without bias for or against order.",
			"",
			"**Chaotic Good:** A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.",
			"",
			"Chaotic good combines a good heart with a free spirit.",
			"",
			"**Lawful Neutral:** A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and organization are paramount. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.",
			"",
			"Lawful neutral means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.",
			"",
			"**Neutral:** A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos (and thus neutral is sometimes called \"true neutral\"). Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character probably thinks of good as better than evil-after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.",

			"",
			"Neutral means you act naturally in any situation, without prejudice or compulsion.",
			"",
			"**Chaotic Neutral:** A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those others suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as he is to cross it.",
			"",
			"Chaotic neutral represents freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.",
			"",
			"**Lawful Evil:** A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition,loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises. This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.",
			"",
			"Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.",
			"",
			"Lawful evil represents methodical, intentional, and organized evil.",
			"",
			"**Neutral Evil:** A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is out for herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She has no love of order and holds no illusions that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or more noble. On the other hand, she doesn't have the restless nature or love of conflict that a chaotic evil villain has.",
			"",
			"Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies. Neutral evil represents pure evil without honor and without variation.",
			"",
			"**Chaotic Evil:** A chaotic evil character does what his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He is vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are likely to be poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.",

If a character wants to change his alignment, let him-in most cases, this should amount to little more than a change of personality, or in some cases, no change at all if the alignment change was more of an adjustment to more accurately summarize how a player, in your opinion, is portraying his character. In some cases, changing alignments can impact a character's abilities-see the class write-ups for details. An [atonement](spell/stonement) spell may be necessary to repair damage done by alignment changes arising from involuntary sources or momentary lapses in personality.",

Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10.

			"The Bluff skill is an extremely versatile, though sometimes misunderstood, social skill. Unlike Diplomacy and Intimidate, which can directly push their target toward a course of action, Bluff feeds the target misinformation. A skilled user of the Bluff skill needs to understand how the target's mind works, in order to deliver just the right misinformation to achieve the desired results. The disadvantage is that such manipulation is less predictable and more difficult to pull off, but the advantage is that the target is not aware that he is being manipulated, whereas even the most successful Diplomacy or Intimidate attempt leaves the target realizing who has convinced him to take action.

			"",
			"Deceiving people is the most prominent use of the Bluff skill, making it one of the trickiest skills to adjudicate.",
			"",
			"**Bluff Doesn't Define a Response:** Even the most successful lie told using Bluff doesn't determine the course of action the deceived person takes-it just primes the target with misinformation. This means attempts to trick a creature into a course of action might need to also include Diplomacy or Intimidate after the Bluff check. For example, suppose there was a guard with the following orders from the guard captain: \"Don't let anyone into the restricted area without clearance papers, even if it seems to be me or someone of higher rank.\" After this, a sneaky rogue attempts the following ruse: \"I am the king's general on a mission of utmost importance for national security. I need you to let me in now, or you're fired!\" Assuming the rogue succeeds at her Bluff check, the guard now believes her to be the general, but this doesn't mean he will let her through. His orders still require him to keep everyone out without papers. The last part of the rogue's demand is an attempt to Intimidate the guard, and the successful Bluff check was a necessary prerequisite to even attempt the Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"**Circumstances:** When using Bluff to tell a lie, the Core Rulebook table on possible circumstance modifiers takes into account several levels of plausibility, targets who want to believe or are impaired, and possession of convincing proof, but there are also plenty of other circumstances that might affect the result of a Bluff check. For instance, many people strongly don't want to believe a bluff that would lead to cognitive dissonance, such as attempting to convince a true believer that their religion is fake, and such a lie imposes a -5 penalty on the attempt (the opposite of a target who wants to believe the falsehood). On the other hand, a target who is afraid that the deceit is actually correct might grant a +2 bonus or more on the skill check, depending on the level of anxiety about the fabrication. For instance, a bigoted assassin who is afraid that half-orcs are cannibals might be more likely to believe a half-orc's bluff that she ate the target he was supposed to kill.",
			"",
			"There are a variety of other circumstances, all of which might alter the odds in different directions. A character with a widespread reputation of being a compulsive liar might take a large penalty on his skill check, but a character with a reputation for always telling the truth, such as a paladin, would gain a large bonus on her skill check. Similarly, a hostile creature is much less likely to believe a deception, whereas a helpful creature is much more likely to believe one.",
			"",
			"**Tricking Someone:** Bluff can be used to cleverly trip a target up and get him to reveal something or make a mistake. In these cases, he realizes his mistake soon after, but by then it is too late, and the falsehood has done its damage. This is similar to using Bluff to feint or create a distraction, but has broader applications in social situations. For instance, suppose a swashbuckler suspected that an assassin works for the queen. The swashbuckler might be able to trick the assassin into revealing more information by pretending to be a fellow agent of the queen in an attempt to gauge the assassin's response. Of course, if the assassin doesn't work for the queen and sees through the ruse, he might attempt his own Bluff check to pretend that he works for the queen and fell for the trick, thus causing the swashbuckler to investigate the innocent queen.",
			"",
			"**Conspirators and the Spokesperson:** Sometimes, a group of individuals has a single spokesperson tell a convincing lie while the others just pray that the target doesn't notice them chuckling in the background with their inability to pull off a successful bluff. Though this tactic might succeed against a complacent target, a competent target cognizant of the possibility of being deceived should attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check of at least a few of the other individuals, perhaps directing specific follow-up questions their way, or even just try to get a hunch about the others.",
			"",
			"**Plausibility:** The Core Rulebook mentions that some lies are implausible enough that no matter how high a character's Bluff check, a PC can't convince a target that they are true. However, the same page also presents a table that says that \"impossible\" lies impart a -20 penalty on the skill check. This table's entry might actually be better described as \"particularly implausible.\" For example, an older human woman telling a very similar-looking human girl that she is herself from the future might take the -20 penalty, whereas a 10-year-old half-elf telling a 40-year-old orc the same lie would automatically fail the Bluff check.",
			"",
			"**Frequency of Bluff Checks:** When a PC is attempting to con someone for an extended period of time rather than telling just one lie, how often should the GM call for new Bluff checks? This is important, since every new Bluff check is an opportunity for the opposition to attempt new Sense Motive checks and uncover the lie. The frequency of checks can be highly variable, and the GM is the ultimate arbiter, but some guidelines can be helpful. Requiring a new check for every individual statement that is a lie would bog down the game. In general, one Bluff check per new topic makes sense. If a new statement has different circumstances (particularly if it is less believable than the previous ones), it calls for a new Bluff check.",
			"",
			"For example, a character might claim to have been to an ancient dungeon. If his Bluff check succeeds, the opposition takes it for granted that the character went there, and basic details such as when the character went or how she got there don't require a new check. However, if she says she found a famous, long-lost artifact within the dungeon or traveled to the dungeon on the back of a roc, she will need to make a new check for the new topic or greater exaggeration. Maintaining a facade once a lie has been established usually doesn't require a new check. If a character is pretending to be a tax inspector and has succeeded at the initial attempt to Bluff, it isn't necessary to make him roll a Bluff check every time he says anything that is true for a tax inspector but a lie for the real character.",
			"",
			"**You're Not Lying, You're Just Wrong:** Sometimes a character is a convincing enough liar that targets can't tell the character is lying, even when the targets possess incontrovertible proof that what the character is saying isn't true, or the lie is otherwise too unbelievable to be possible. In this case, one way to resolve the situation is for the bluffing character to take a -20 penalty on the skill check, and if she beats the target's Sense Motive, then the target believes that the bluffing character isn't lying, but is simply mistaken. This could also be the result of other situations in which the target of the Bluff attempt has strong reasons to believe that the falsehood, despite being plausible, isn't factually correct. Even this result can be useful to the bluffing character, as it doesn't mark her as a liar, and it allows her to gather information about what her target knows and expects.",
			"",
			"**True Lies and Implausible Truths:** Bluff is the skill that convinces someone that something is true. However, there are a few potential cases when the situation isn't as straightforward as a bluffing character telling a lie to a target. For instance, suppose that the bluffing character makes up a believable lie to tell the target, and the lie turns out to be true, unbeknown to the bluffing character. If the Bluff check succeeded, the target is convinced, and might later verify the truth and trust the bluffing character more. However, what if the bluffing character fails? In this case, the target can tell that the bluffing character is lying, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the target is forced to conclude that the information is false. For instance, suppose a popular king has fallen into a magical, unbreakable sleep. A charlatan, noticing the king's lack of public appearances, makes up a story about the king being placed under a sleeping curse and spreads it around the tavern, but his Bluff check is terrible, and everyone can tell he's making it up. If one of the king's advisors is present in the tavern, this doesn't mean that the advisor now thinks the king isn't in a coma; it just means that she can tell the charlatan doesn't believe his own story. The reverse side of true lies is implausible truths. These are situations in which someone is telling the truth (either saying something that is actually true, or spreading a lie that they believe to be true), but that truth is extremely implausible to the listener. Though the bluffing character isn't lying, the same skill set that makes an excellent and convincing liar could potentially help characters attempting to spread an implausible truth. In these cases, even if the target succeeds at the Sense Motive check, he can tell that the bluffing character truly believes what she is saying, and he might simply conclude that she isn't lying, but simply mistaken. The target might later be swayed if presented with evidence or through a [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels). If a bluffing character successfully convinces a target of a lie and the target attempts to spread that information, this leads to a classic example of an implausible truth.",
			"",
			"**Aftermath:** While most of the Bluff rules focus on the scene between the bluffing character and the target, it is important to consider what happens afterward- especially in an intrigue-based campaign. Though true masters of deception might be able to pull off a bluff such that no one is ever the wiser, in the case of most successful bluffs, the targets eventually discover new information that allows them to realize the truth of the matter. In this case, their attitude toward the bluffing character generally decreases by one step (or simply becomes unfriendly), depending on the previous attitude and the severity of the bluff's consequences. Furthermore, if the bluffing character attempts to lie to such a target again, her Bluff check takes a similar penalty as if she had failed to deceive the target (either a -10 penalty, or the skill check might be impossible, at the GM's discretion).",
			"",
			"**Lies upon Lies:** The aftermath of a Bluff becomes even more complicated if someone else attempts to make a contradictory lie, either in the same scene as the original prevarication or afterwards. If the bluffing characters are present together, it might be a good time to have them enter a verbal duel, with the target as the audience. However, this isn't possible when the second Bluff attempt happens after the first deceiving character is gone but before the target discovers the ruse. In this case, the second bluffing character has an advantage. She might be able to show proof that the first character was lying in order to build up the credibility of her own lie. If the second bluffing character beats the target's Sense Motive, but does not debunk the original lie or beat the first bluffing character's original Bluff check, then the target will likely be confused and unlikely to act on either piece of information. Or, the target might conclude that the second bluffer believes what she said but is misinformed."

			"",
			"**Creating a Diversion:** You can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion to allow you to use Stealth, even a misdirection as simple as saying, \"What's that behind you\"? In the Core Rulebook, this usage is only mentioned off-handedly in the Stealth skill description, with no reference to its action type. Creating a distraction is a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Secret Messages and Intrigue:** Don't underestimate the benefit of using Bluff to send messages through innuendo. Since the DC to send a message is static (15 or 20 depending on the message's complexity), you can quickly reach the point that the message itself is reliable, and thus the only risk is being intercepted, which would have happened anyway if you didn't make the attempt.",
			"",
			"**Surprise:** Not every surprise round begins with an ambush from unseen assailants. If a character or several characters unexpectedly attack in the midst of a conversation or other normal activity, their victims might be surprised. To determine if a victim is surprised, he should attempt a Sense Motive check opposed by the assailant's Bluff check rather than a Perception opposed by the assailant's Stealth check. This is also a good way to adjudicate several abilities, including several vigilante talents that trigger when the target thinks the vigilante is an ally.",
			"",
			"**Maintaining a Disguise:** When maintaining a disguise, the Bluff skill isn't necessary to correctly portray things such as mannerisms or facial expressions, but it will almost certainly come up when the disguised character makes statements in his assumed persona as he talks about events he didn't actually experience. Of course, a well-prepared character has thoroughly researched his disguise, so he is unlikely to take any penalties to his Bluff attempts."

			"The most consequential use of the Diplomacy skill is to change the attitudes of other creatures and to get them to comply with requests you make.",
			"",
			"**Attitude Adjustments, Personality, and Goals:** One major trap in understanding the Diplomacy skill is the mistaken idea that attitude adjustments achieved using Diplomacy change a character's underlying personality and goals. In fact, attitude adjustments are minor good impressions (or bad impressions, in the case of a disastrously failed check) that, per the Core Rulebook, last only a few hours by default. At the GM's discretion, the adjustments may last for shorter or longer periods, depending on the circumstances. As such, a Diplomacy check to change someone's attitude is mainly useful as a prelude to a follow-up request. It doesn't alter the creature's personality or goals.",
			"",
			"For instance, if a cunning bard managed to convince the evil necromancer queen to become friendly with him, that doesn't mean she will give up plans of world domination or change her deity from the goddess of undead to the goddess of beauty and love, but it does mean that she likes the bard now. Even without further requests, she would probably spare him if he pledges loyalty to her and if she thinks she can trust him. Even if she feels she can't trust him, she might at least be fond enough of him to transform him into a loyal undead servant so she can keep him around. Attempting to convince the necromancer queen to give up her evil ways and cease her plans for world conquest involves much more than a Diplomacy check to change her attitude toward the bard. The bard would then need to use the [influence system](rule/influence) or the [relationship system](unknown/relationship_system) to become closer to the necromancer queen, perhaps engaging in a [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels) with her or even focusing an entire series of social adventures around changing her perspective (see [Social Conflicts](rule/social_conflicts)).",
			"",
			"**Requests Are Not Mind Control:** This is the biggest potential trap in understanding the Diplomacy skill in a typical game. Diplomacy's main strength is the ability to make requests without angering the target, but that doesn't mean that it works like mind control. As the Core Rulebook says, some requests automatically fail if they go against a creature's values or nature. In this vein, it is important to remember that no matter how high a Diplomacy roll may be, the target still has free will and won't accept certain requests. Even so, a character who declines a very high Diplomacy result should do so respectfully, as the high result means that the diplomat made her argument effectively and convincingly. For instance, a paladin who swore an oath to never unseal the inner catacombs of her faith's central cathedral might apologize and explain that though the argument to do so was convincing, she unfortunately can't violate this vow. A target who must refuse a request might try to honor the request in spirit, offering an alternative that might advance the same greater goal or doing a significant but still lesser favor for the requester.",
			"",
			"**Roleplaying and Skills:** As you can see from the sections above, as well as the table of potential circumstances in the Core Rulebook, the nature of a request is crucial to determining its success or failure. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the request in order to attempt a Diplomacy check. A diplomat's player can't just say \"I Diplomacy the guard.\" The player must provide a specific request along with any rationale supporting that desire, even if the player or GM doesn't want to roleplay the whole interaction in character. On the other hand, using Diplomacy to improve a target's attitude is both more open-ended and less fraught with circumstance modifiers, so when strapped for time or out of ideas, it is fine to omit a description of how a diplomat manages to do so. Using the previous example of the bard and the necromancer queen, the bard's request to spare a peasant so that she may spread word of the queen's mighty army and cause other villages to surrender without a fight is quite a different situation than him saying, \"Spare this peasant woman because killing her is evil and makes my goddess sad,\" or even \"Spare this peasant woman for me. Please\"?",
			"",
			"**Gathering Information:** The Diplomacy skill allows a character to canvass locations for information. Because this use of Diplomacy often produces similar results to those of a high Knowledge (local) check, adventurers might be able to attempt either one to gain the same information. In fact, adventures occasionally present a table of facts that either skill can uncover. Gathering information with Diplomacy actually involves spending 1d4 hours actively seeking the information and allows the character to retry the attempt to pick up additional information. When a PC fails at a Knowledge (local) check, the GM can give the character a second chance by having him spend time attempting to gather that information from others.",
			"",
			"As per the Core Rulebook, some information is simply impossible to find via gathering information. The information that people know is typically limited to the area where they live, and is filtered through their biases. In a city on the brink of a race war between elves and humans, the information available among the upperclass human nobility will have a significantly different spin and tone to it than the information available in the elven ghetto, and the checks to gather information in those places would meet with circumstance bonuses or penalties depending on who was asking where. Thus, it is important to decide where a character is gathering information before determining what information they receive. Filtering the information through the biases of the community adds flavor and nuance to the world around the characters.",
			"",
			"Finally, remember that gathering information is itself a conspicuous act, so others who are gathering information can usually notice it in turn. A typical DC for hearing about someone else gathering information should start at 15, and a character wishing to gather information clandestinely can choose to take a penalty on her Diplomacy check to increase that DC by the same amount.",
			"",
			"**Calling for a Cease-Fire:** One of the first things that a potential diplomat might try in a combat is to call for a temporary cease-fire. The description of the Diplomacy skill in the Core Rulebook indicates that requests take 1 round or longer, and that shifting attitudes takes 1 minute. Since a cease-fire is a type of request, this would work fine, with the diplomat making the request over the course of a full round of combat and completing it just before her next turn. However, a character can usually only make requests of a target that feels at least indifferent toward that character, and the vast majority of battles involve characters that are unfriendly or hostile toward each other.",
			"",
			"In this case, and in other instances of requests made to unfriendly or hostile characters, the GM should consider only allowing such requests that are couched in such a way that they seem to be in the target's best interests. An unfriendly or hostile character certainly isn't going to be doing the would-be diplomat any favors, but that doesn't mean they will ignore an idea that is better for them than facing the consequences of the combat. Even if adversaries agree to a brief cease-fire to listen to the diplomat's terms, they won't let their guard down. Generally, they will also require the side calling for the cease-fire to make a show of their intentions by laying down or sheathing their weapons, dropping spell component pouches, or the like, while attempting Sense Motive checks to determine if the cease-fire is a ruse. Creatures that feel themselves to be at an advantage in the combat by virtue of a short-duration spell or other effect that would expire during a cease-fire almost never agree to a cease-fire, as it isn't in their best interest to do so."

			"The uses of the Disguise skill are far more specific than those of Bluff and Diplomacy. The Disguise skill exists to allow characters to conceal their identity and to potentially pose as other characters.",
			"",
			"**Not Always Opposed:** The most important thing to note about the Disguise skill is that characters do not automatically get a Perception check to oppose it. Per the Core Rulebook, an opponent receives a Perception check only if the disguised character is actively drawing attention, if the perceiving character is actively suspicious of everyone, or if the disguised character is attempting to impersonate a particular person that the perceiving character recognizes. Under one of these circumstances, a perceiving character can attempt one Perception check right away and then another check each hour.",
			"",
			"**A Single Disguise Check:** Unlike most other skills, a character typically attempts a Disguise check only once when creating a physical disguise. Further Disguise checks might be necessary for things such as altering one's voice or using appropriate mannerisms or phrasing, but the basic disguise doesn't require further checks. The check result is supposed to be a secret that is revealed only the first time the disguise is truly tested, which can be tricky in the face of disguising characters who want their friends to tell them how good the disguise is. One way to handle this is to roll the Disguise check secretly only the first time it truly comes into opposition (see above), since the skill doesn't indicate when the check first occurs.",
			"",
			"**Disguise Is More Than Visual:** Though the skill as presented in the Core Rulebook focuses on the visual aspects of disguise that a character prepares, later rules (such as the [vocal alteration](spell/vocal_alteration) spell) have made it clear that there are other aspects, including voice, mannerisms, and phrasing. The trick is to distinguish between the use of the Bluff and the Disguise skills. Generally, Bluff checks cover telling actual lies to support a disguise, whereas Disguise checks cover the other aspects, such as imitating mannerisms and speech.",
			"",
			"**Saw Through the Illusion:** It is very tempting to use illusion or transmutation magic to augment a disguise, since the bonus is so high. As per the Core Rulebook, magic that penetrates an illusion or transmutation doesn't automatically see through a mundane disguise, but it negates the magical components of the costume. Thus, a true master of disguise uses both types of trickery, and she also ensures that the person who notices her use of magic has a way to explain the fact that disguise magic was involved at all. For instance, a rogue might disguise herself as a noble with mundane means and then use [disguise self](spell/disguise_self) to cloak herself in a glamer of that same noble, but more beautiful. Then, if someone sees through the illusion but not the mundane disguise, he would just think she was a vain noble instead of becoming suspicious due to the use of illusion magic and demanding a more thorough inspection.",
			"",
			"**Simulacrum and Disguise:** The caster of the simulacrum spell uses the Disguise skill to shape the form created. However, it is important to note that the Sense Motive check to detect a simulacrum is very easy at the level that simulacrum becomes available, so unless the simulacrum has a high Bluff modifier, it is still challenging to use a simulacrum as an impostor for long."

			"",
			"**Scaring Them into Submission:** Other than demoralizing foes in combat, the main use of the Intimidate skill is to force someone to capitulate to your requests by scaring them into doing so. This is similar to improving someone's attitude to friendly with Diplomacy and then making a request, but it doesn't require multiple rolls. Instead, the requests are restricted to those that provide limited assistance and actions that don't endanger the creature, including giving information. This means that an intimidated creature doesn't necessarily do what the intimidating character wants if it would be dangerous. After the Intimidate check, the target becomes unfriendly and might take actions such as reporting the intimidating character to the authorities. Thus, Diplomacy is often more likely to be successful in the long term in campaigns with interweaving plot lines and recurring characters. Since intimidation is based on fear, creatures immune to fear are also generally immune to attempts to use Intimidate against them.",
			"",
			"**Posturing and Bluster:** The rules for the Intimidate skill specify that a check's DC is based on the target's HD and Wisdom modifier. That generally works when one person is attempting to Intimidate the other, but sometimes both parties are actively participating in acts of posturing and bluster. Since this DC is usually low, the two characters would end up intimidating each other, which isn't quite realistic. Instead, consider opposed Intimidate checks, or if the situation warrants it, a full-fledged [verbal duel](rule/verbal_duels).",
			"",
			"**Explaining Negative Consequences:** Sometimes a character wants to calmly explain negative consequences to someone in a way that merely relies on logic, not fear. This is particularly important when attempting to convince someone immune to fear, such as a paladin or vampire, to back down in the face of negative consequences. This is different than improving a creature's attitude or making a request (particularly since a character might try it with an unfriendly creature), so it doesn't fall under Diplomacy. One good way to handle this is to use the rules for [influence](rule/influence) or verbal duels instead, since those both allow for logic and knowledge to help impact the situation. If only a skill check is possible, consider allowing an Intimidate check that doesn't apply any modifiers tied to frightening the target (such as the [Intimidating Prowess](feat/intimidating_prowess) feat, size modifiers, an [inquisitor's stern gaze](class/inquisitor), and so on) and then having the result not be a fear effect."

			"",
			"Since Perception is the skill that determines what a character sees, hears, and senses in the game world, it is no wonder that it's often considered the most important skill in the game. Stealth and Perception often oppose one another, and the two of them together can be difficult to adjudicate.",
			"",
			"**Active and Automatic Perception:** There are two ways Perception checks happen in the game. The first way is automatic and reactive. Certain stimuli automatically call for a Perception check, such as a creature using Stealth (which calls for an opposed Perception check), or the sounds of combat or talking in the distance. The flip side is when a player actively calls for a Perception check because her PC is intentionally searching for something. This always takes at least a move action, but often takes significantly longer. The Core Rulebook doesn't specify what area a PC can actively search, but for a given Perception check it should be no larger than a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and often a smaller space if that area is cluttered. For instance, in an intrigue-based game, it is fairly common to look through a filing cabinet full of files. Though the cabinet itself might fill only a 5-foot-by-5-foot area, the number of files present could cause a search to take a particularly long time.",
			"",
			"**Precise and Imprecise Senses:** Since Perception covers all senses, it is important to distinguish which of those senses count as observing a creature that is using Stealth. Some senses are more precise than others. Imprecise senses allow a creature to pinpoint the location of another creature, but they don't allow for the use of targeted effects, and attacks against those creatures are subject to miss chances from concealment. A few examples of imprecise senses are hearing, scent, blindsense, and tremorsense. A sense is precise if it allows the creature to use targeted effects on creatures and objects it senses, and to attack enemies without suffering a miss chance from concealment. This includes vision, touch, blindsight, and lifesense. Precise senses allow the creature to pinpoint an enemy's location. When a creature uses a precise sense to observe an enemy, that enemy is unable to use Stealth against the observer unless it creates a distraction first, or has a special ability allowing it to do so. Senses other than the listed ones count as precise or imprecise at the GM's discretion. A creature might have a limited form of a sense that makes it too weak to count as precise, such as a beast with primitive eyes that has difficulty seeing a creature that isn't moving.",
			"",
			"**Cover and Concealment for Stealth:** The reason a character usually needs cover or concealment to use Stealth is tied to the fact that characters can't use Stealth while being observed. A sneaking character needs to avoid all of an opponent's precise senses in order to use Stealth, and for most creatures, that means vision. Effects such as [blur](spell/blur) and [displacement](spell/displacement), which leave a clear visual of the character within the perceiving character's vision, aren't sufficient to use Stealth, but a shadowy area or a curtain work nicely, for example. The hide in plain sight class ability allows a creature to use Stealth while being observed and thus avoids this whole situation. As the Core Rulebook mentions, a sneaking character can come out of cover or concealment during her turn, as long as she doesn't end her turn where other characters are directly observing her.",
			"",
			"**States of Awareness:** In general, there are four states of awareness that a creature can have with regard to another creature using Stealth.",
			"",
			"**Unaware:** On one end of the spectrum, a sneaking creature can succeed at Stealth well enough that the other creature isn't even aware that the creature is present. This state allows the sneaking creature to use abilities such as the [vigilante's startling appearance](class/vigilante). The Stealth skill description in the Core Rulebook says that perceiving creatures that fail to beat a sneaking character's Stealth check result are not aware of the sneaking character, but that is different from being totally unaware. This is also true of a creature that has previously been made aware of the creature's presence or location (see below) but is currently unable to observe the sneaking creature. In those cases, the sneaking creature can't use abilities such as startling presence.",
			"",
			"**Aware of Presence:** The next state is when the perceiving creature is aware of the sneaking creature's presence, though not of anything beyond that. This is the state that happens when an invisible creature attacks someone and then successfully uses Stealth so the perceiving creature doesn't know where the attacker moved, or when a sniper succeeds at her Stealth check to snipe. A perceiving creature that becomes aware of a hidden creature's presence will still be aware of its presence at least until the danger of the situation continues, if not longer (though memory-altering magic can change this).",
			"",
			"**Aware of Location:** The next state is awareness of location. This happens when a perceiving character uses an imprecise sense, such as hearing or tremorsense, to discover what square a hidden or invisible creature inhabits.",
			"",
			"**Observing:** The final state is when the perceiving character is able to directly observe the sneaking character with a precise sense, such as vision. This is generally the result when the perceiving character rolls higher on its opposed Perception check than the sneaking character's Stealth result while also having line of sight to the sneaking character and the ability to see through any sort of invisibility or other tricks the sneaking character might be using."

		"description": [
			"**Source** [Ultimate Intrigue pg. 188](source/ultimate_intrigue)",
			"",
			"The Sense Motive skill allows a character to analyze the way another character is acting and figure out if something is off. It also opposes Bluff to determine whether someone is lying, making it an important social defensive skill in an intrigue-based game.",
			"",
			"**Active and Automatic Sense Motive:** Most uses of Sense Motive are active and require a character to spend a minute or more interacting with someone with the intent of using Sense Motive for a particular purpose. The only time that Sense Motive happens automatically is when it opposes [Bluff](skill/bluff), as a character attempts a Sense Motive check for every Bluff check attempted against him.",
			"",
			"**Noticing Enchantments:** Sense Motive allows a character to notice someone whose behavior is being influenced by an enchantment, though as an active check, this takes at least 1 minute of interaction and the intention to sense enchantments. This doesn't notice enchantments that aren't actually causing a difference in behavior at the time. For instance, if a creature is under [charm person](spell/charm_person) but the caster isn't around and doesn't come up in conversation, a Sense Motive check won't reveal the enchantment.",
			"",
			"**Hunches:** The use of Sense Motive to \"get a hunch\" mentions getting a feeling that someone is trustworthy or is an impostor, and it lists a static DC. This doesn't mean to say that anyone who can succeed at a DC 20 Sense Motive check can automatically find an impostor with high Bluff and Disguise modifiers. The DC 20 check assumes that the other character is not opposing the Sense Motive check with Bluff. This is particularly useful in situations with a group of impostors, one of whom is silver-tongued and does all the talking while the others aren't saying anything but aren't skilled at Bluff. For instance, a hunch might help against a group of quiet assassins dressed as servants and trickling into the grand hall. The information gained from a hunch is general, not specific, and usually results in an ambiguous inkling. You can get a vague feeling that something is wrong or that someone seems trustworthy, but no more specific information than that. In the example above, a character who received a hunch wouldn't know that the servants are specifically assassins, but would get a sense that something was off about the servants.",
			"",
			"**Sense Motive Is Not Mind Reading:** Though Sense Motive can help ferret out lies and gain hunches about odd situations, it doesn't let a character read opponents' minds and know exactly what they're thinking or planning. It is a verification tool that works well in conjunction with other skills, rather than a skill that allows a character to ascertain information."

		"sources": [ "Ultimate Intrigue" ],
		"description": [
			"**Source** [Ultimate Intrigue pg. 189](source/ultimate_intrigue)",
			"",
			"Especially in intrigue-based games, there are situations in which many different creatures might normally need to roll an opposed skill check against a PC. For instance, if the rogue sneaks into a camp of 50 orcs, it would technically require rolling 50 Perception checks. This slows down the game, and it makes it almost certain that one of those orcs will roll a natural 20. This variant rule replaces opposed rolls to reduce this sheer number of rolls and the likelihood for a skilled PC to be defeated by math alone.",
			"",
			"With this variant, when a character attempts a skill check that would normally be opposed, he attempts the check as normal, comparing the result against the DC presented by each foe (DC = 11 + the foe's total skill bonus with the opposed skill). If the initiating character fails this check, he simply fails and immediately experiences the consequences of failure. If he succeeds, however, he does so only against the rank-and-file opponents (such as most of the warriors in an orc camp, or most of the hangers-on at a royal court). Select foes (such as major NPCs or dedicated scouts and guards) can attempt a check with the opposing skill (DC = 11 + the initiating character's total skill bonus with skill he originally used). This resembles the way the Disguise skill works, where only those who pay attention to the character and are suspicious of her can attempt a Perception check.",
			"",
			"For example, if a hunter is sneaking through a camp of 50 orcs and succeeds at her initial Stealth check against a DC of 11 + each orc's Perception modifier, she slips into the camp. Meanwhile, the two orcs posted as sentries scan for trouble, so each of those orcs (but not the other 48) rolls a Perception check to see if they notice the hunter. Similarly, a bard might succeed at a Bluff check to convince the minor nobles of the court of his exaggerated exploits, but three key aristocrats' suspicious of the bard to begin with-try to poke holes in the story and find contradictions by grilling the bard for details, each of them rolling Sense Motive checks against a DC of 11 + the bard's Bluff modifier.",
			"",
			"**Multiple Bonuses:** If the opposing group possesses a mix of bonuses, use the highest value to determine the DC. In the example of the orc camp, if 40 of the orc warriors have a -1 Perception modifier and 10 scouts have a +10 Perception modifier, the hunter would be attempting a DC 21 Stealth check. Note that because this variant doesn't specify which opponents beat the check, it is up to the GM to decide how the consequences of the failed check manifest.",
			"",
			"**The Odds:** This variant increases the odds of success dramatically for highly skilled characters. For instance, if the hunter in the example above has a modifier on Stealth checks at least 9 higher than the orcs' Perception modifiers, in the default system, she would have a 50% chance of succeeding. But with this variant, her chance increases to 85%. When the character has less of an advantage against her adversaries, this variant still increases the rate of success dramatically with many adversaries, and it decreases the rate slightly with a few determined adversaries. For instance, with the default system, if the hunter's Stealth matched the orcs' Perception, she would have essentially a 0% chance of sneaking past the 50 orcs. With this variant, her chance is 1 in 8. However, if the other 48 orcs weren't present, her chance of sneaking past just the two sentries in the default system is roughly 1 in 4, whereas with this variant, it is 1 in 8, since only the determined adversaries make their own rolls and thus affect her odds."

For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon.

Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet."

To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can't already cast the spell, there's a chance he'll make a mistake.

The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.",

If the item's activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use, activation is not an action at all.",

			"",
			"A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Unlike wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is of a certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 10 charges when created.",
			"",
			"**Physical Description:** A typical staff measures anywhere from 4 feet to 7 feet long and is 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staves are wood, but an exotic few are bone, metal, or even glass. A staff often has a gem or some device at its tip or is shod in metal at one or both ends. Staves are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.",
			"",
			"**Activation:** Staves use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to cast the spell from a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures).",
			"",
			"**Special Qualities:** Roll d%. A 01-30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff's function, and 31-100 indicates no special qualities.",
			"",
			"**Using Staves:** Staves use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of a staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff.",
			"",
			"This means that staves are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the save DC for the spell, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than those from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependent on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are also harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming a target's spell resistance.",
			"",
			"Staves hold a maximum of 10 charges. Each spell cast from a staff consumes one or more charges. When a staff runs out of charges, it cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning, when a spellcaster prepares spells or regains spell slots, he can also imbue one staff with a portion of his power so long as one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on his spell list and he is capable of casting at least one of the spells. Imbuing a staff with this power restores one charge to the staff, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the highest-level spell cast by the staff. For example, a 9th-level wizard with a staff of fire could imbue the staff with one charge per day by using up one of his 4th-level spells. A staff cannot gain more than one charge per day and a caster cannot imbue more than one staff per day.",
			"",
			"Furthermore, a staff can hold a spell of any level, unlike a wand, which is limited to spells of 4th level or lower. The minimum caster level of a staff is 8th."

An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably.

Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizards' cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorcererqueen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of \"defend elves\" doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help the wielder. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders.

			"While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.",
			"",
			"Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp. For many items, the market price equals the base price. Armor, shields, weapons, and items with value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies), but it does increase the final market price.",
			"",
			"In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.",
			"",
			"The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires 8 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item's base price (or fraction thereof), with a minimum of at least 8 hours. Potions and scrolls are an exception to this rule; they can take as little as 2 hours to create (if their base price is 250 gp or less). Scrolls and potions whose base price is more than 250 gp, but less than 1,000 gp, take 8 hours to create, just like any other magic item. The character must spend the gold at the beginning of the construction process. Regardless of the time needed for construction, a caster can create no more than one magic item per day. This process can be accelerated to 4 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item's base price (or fraction thereof) by increasing the DC to create the item by +5.",
			"",
			"The caster can work for up to 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day, but the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit. If the caster is out adventuring, he can devote 4 hours each day to item creation, although he nets only 2 hours' worth of work. This time is not spent in one continuous period, but rather during lunch, morning preparation, and during watches at night. If time is dedicated to creation, it must be spent in uninterrupted 4-hour blocks. This work is generally done in a controlled environment, where distractions are at a minimum, such as a laboratory or shrine. Work that is performed in a distracting or dangerous environment nets only half the amount of progress (just as with the adventuring caster).",
			"",
			"A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used on the under-construction item are wasted."

			"",
			"Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item's slot) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item. Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of the lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.",

			"Not all items adhere to these formulas. First and foremost, these few formulas aren't enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it.

			"",
			"- Drivers: Drivers control vehicles. A driver is a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 who is physically able to manipulate a vehicle's driving device and who is both within the driving spaces of a vehicle and actively manipulating the driving device.",
			"- Occupants: Any creature riding, driving, serving as crew on, or providing propulsion for a vehicle is considered its occupant.",
			"- Facing: Unlike characters, vehicles have a forward facing. A vehicle moves best when it moves in the direction of its forward facing.",
			"- Acceleration/Deceleration: Vehicles must accelerate to reach their maximum speed. Each round, with the proper driving action and a successful check, the driver can increase the vehicle's movement by its rate of acceleration, as long that value is no greater than the vehicle's maximum speed. Vehicles must decelerate to slow down and are hard to stop at an exact point.",
			"- Initiative: A vehicle moves at the start of its driver's turn. If a vehicle has no driver, it moves on the turn of the last creature that was its driver, or on a turn determined by the GM.",
			"- Controlling a Vehicle: If a vehicle has a driver, before the driver does anything else on her turn, she must determine what drive action she is taking, and take that action. If the driver takes no action, takes some other action instead of driving the vehicle, or delays or readies an action-or if there is no driver-the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action. A driver can only take one action each turn to control a vehicle. Once the driver has selected the action, or takes some other action forcing the vehicle to become uncontrolled, the vehicle moves.",
			"- Driving Check: When a driver takes a driving action, she must make a driving check to determine the maneuverability and speed of the vehicle that round. The vehicle's propulsion determines what skill is used for the driving check. A driver can always make a Wisdom check in place of a driving check. The base DCs for all driving checks are DC 5 and DC 20. Use the lower DC when the driver is not in combat and the higher DC when the driver is in combat.",
			"- In Combat: Vehicles, creatures used as propulsion, and crew members do not threaten any area around them, but their drivers and their non-crew occupants do. Vehicles can enter the spaces of objects and creatures smaller than themselves. Vehicles do not have attacks, but they can-and may be required to- make vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, and ramming combat maneuvers."

			"Every vehicle has a method of propulsion. Creatures pull chariots and wagons. Boats and ships are propelled by water currents, wind, muscle, or all three forces. Fantastical airships are held aloft by a variety of propulsion sources, both magical and mundane. The method of propulsion typically affects the speed and maneuverability of a vehicle, but more importantly, a vehicle's propulsion determines the required skill needed to control a vehicle. The following are the general methods of vehicle propulsion, along with what skills are typically needed to drive such vehicles.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical:** Rarely, an alchemical engine may propel a vehicle. Powered by steam or more volatile gases and reagents, a vehicle with an alchemical engine requires either a Knowledge (arcana) or Craft (alchemy) check to be driven. The base DC to drive an alchemical vehicle is 10 higher than normal. Alchemical engines can be extremely powerful, with the ability to propel vehicles hundreds of times their size. They can also be very fickle when driven by creatures uninitiated in the secrets of alchemy.",
			"",
			"When a driver makes a driving check to control an alchemically propelled vehicle with a Wisdom check or a skill she is not trained in and rolls a natural 1, the vehicle's alchemical engine gains the broken condition. When it gains the broken condition, the vehicle's maximum speed and acceleration are both halved, and if the vehicle is currently moving at a rate faster than its new maximum speed, it immediately slows to that speed.",
			"",
			"**Current:** From canoes and large ships to winged gliders, vehicles propelled by currents typically manipulate an already existing power source within or outside of nature- an air current, a water current, or more exotic currents, like conduits of magical energy. Usually, manipulating a current-propelled vehicle requires a skill like Fly, Knowledge (nature), Profession (sailor), Survival, or even Acrobatics or Knowledge (arcana), depending on the nature or makeup of the vehicle and the current the vehicle is manipulating.",
			"",
			"**Water Current:** Vehicles that only rely on currents of water for their propulsion are somewhat limited. These vehicles can only move in the direction and at the speed of a current unless they also employ some other means of propulsion or manipulation, and thus often have an additional form of propulsion, such as muscle in the case of a canoe, and wind in the case of a galley. A current-driven ship such as a river barge with a crew of two or more creatures requires either a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check for the driving check, as ships require precision, discipline, and knowledge of the natural world. Smaller water-current vehicles, like canoes, use the Survival skill as the drive skill, as reading the terrain is a very important aspect of maintaining control over those types of vehicles.",
			"",
			"If it moves with the current, a water-current vehicle's maximum speed depends on the speed of the current (often as high as 120 feet). The acceleration of a water-current vehicle is 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Air Current:** Air-current vehicles are rather diverse. They can be sailing ships, airships, land ships, or even gliders. A vehicle propelled by air with a crew of two or more creatures requires a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check as its driving check. Because of their complexity, air-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10. Smaller air-current vehicles, such as gliders and wind sleds, use Acrobatics or Fly instead. Much of their control depends on knowledge of flight or proper movements of the body to control the vehicle.",
			"",
			"Smaller vehicles (size Large or smaller) can move at a speed of 60 feet, can move at twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet. Larger vehicles can move at a speed of 90 feet, or twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Weird Current:** Navigating currents of magical energy, burning magma, or the murky rivers of the Shadow Plane could use a number of skills, but likely use skills similar to those needed to operate water-current and air-current vehicles. Weird-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10, and sometimes by 15 in more exotic locales and conditions.",
			"",
			"Weird-current vehicles typically move at the speed of water or air currents, depending on their nature, but have been known to move twice or even triple those speeds.",
			"",
			"**Magic:** Magic provides some of the most powerful and easy-to-use methods of propelling a vehicle, such as an elemental-powered juggernaut or an airship with an arcane device at its heart. Often simply identifying the properties of the magic item providing propulsion gives a creature the ability to use it, but sometimes more complicated magical devices require Spellcraft or Use Magic Device to drive properly.",
			"",
			"**Muscle:** From a chariot to a slave ship filled with captive rowers, moving a vehicle powered by muscle is all about getting a creature or creatures to push, pull, or otherwise propel the vehicle. Based on the type and intelligence of the creatures moving the vehicle, checks for driving muscle-propelled vehicles can use a diverse number of skills, including, but not limited to, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Profession (driver).",
			"",
			"**Muscle-propelled vehicles come in two forms:** pulled and pushed.",
			"",
			"**Pulled:** This type of propulsion involves one or more creature pulling a vehicle. Unless the creature pulling the vehicle is intelligent (Intelligence score of 3 or higher), either Handle Animal or Profession (driver) is used for the driving check (driver's choice). Intelligent creatures must be convinced with a Diplomacy check (decrease the driving check by 5 if the creature or creatures have the helpful attitude), or forced with an Intimidate check. Forcing an intelligent creature to pull a vehicle increases the DC by 20.",
			"",
			"A creature can pull a number of vehicle squares equal to the number of squares in the creature's space to a top speed equal to twice the creature's speed. It can accelerate its space in vehicle squares up to its speed. For instance, a single horse takes up 4 squares, and can pull a 4-square cart 100 feet each round with an acceleration of 50 feet.",
			"",
			"**Pushed:** Pushed vehicles are the exact opposite of pulled vehicles-vehicles that are pushed by muscle, usually using some form of device manipulated by crew members. Aquatic vehicles are the most likely to be pushed. Lines of rowers use their oars to push the vehicle forward, or a pair of cloud giants may churn a propeller at the aft end of a dirigible. Driving checks for pushed vehicles tend to be Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal, depending on the intelligence and attitude of the creatures supplying the muscle for the propulsion.",
			"",
			"For intelligent creatures, use Diplomacy if the creatures providing the propulsion have an attitude of indifferent, friendly, or helpful. Decrease the Diplomacy driving check by 5 if the creatures providing the propulsion are friendly. Intimidate is used for intelligent creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile. Handle Animal is used if the creatures providing the propulsion are not intelligent.",
			"",
			"A creature that is pushing a vehicle with the proper mechanical help can push between 5 times to 20 times its space in vehicle squares.",
			"",
			"The maximum speed and acceleration of a muscle-propelled vehicle depends on the mechanism used to assist the pushing-see the sample vehicle statistics for examples.",
			"",
			"**Mixed Methods of Propulsion:** Large and complicated vehicles, such as large sailing ships, often use multiple forms of propulsion. Sometimes multiple methods add flexibility, but often they work in concert to create faster movement. A vehicle with multiple methods of propulsion often requires a large crew to get it going and keep it moving. If a vehicle has two methods of propulsion, it uses its fastest speed and acceleration and then adds half the speed and acceleration of the secondfastest propulsion. Nothing is added for a third form of propulsion, except for the flexibility of having a back-up form of propulsion."

			"Vehicles have sizes and spaces different from creature sizes and spaces. Many vehicles are long and thin rather than taking up a space of an equal number of squares per side like creatures do. A wagon, for instance, may take up a 10-by-10-foot square, or may be 10 feet wide and 15 feet or more long. Often one of the shorter sides of the vehicle serves as a vehicle's forward facing.",
			"",
			"**Size Conversion:** Often it is important to know the size category of a vehicle. Use Table 4-1 to determine the size of a vehicle or its propulsion based on the number of squares it occupies.",
			"",
			"**Driving Space:** At least one 5-foot-by-5-foot square on each vehicle must be designated as its driving space- often such an area encompasses multiple squares. In order to drive a vehicle, an intelligent creature must be within at least one square of the driving space and able to manipulate its driving device. The typical sizes and locations of driving spaces are detailed in the individual vehicle descriptions.",

			"Vehicles do not move like creatures, even when they use creatures as propulsion. They tend to move in the direction of their forward facing, and do so quickly.",
			"",
			"**Facing:** Unlike creatures, most vehicles have a forward facing. The facing of the vehicle determines its best path of propulsion. Vehicles are very good at moving in the direction of their forward facing, but it takes time and skill to move them in other directions. A horse-pulled wagon moves forward quickly and with ease, but turning a corner requires proper timing and a crack of the whip. A ship propelled by an air current can take a great deal of effort to stop, especially once it has reached top speed. Vehicle facing represents the effect of inertia on vehicles.",
			"",
			"When driven correctly, vehicles can move straight ahead, diagonally, or a mix of both within the same movement. Skilled drivers can make a vehicle zigzag in a forward direction with ease.",
			"",
			"**Movement:** Vehicles have a maximum speed and an acceleration listing. The speed is the fastest rate the vehicle can travel. When a creature or creatures pull a vehicle, the vehicle's maximum speed is equal to twice the speed of the creature providing the propulsion, and its acceleration is the creature's speed. (Teams of mixed creature types use the slowest creature's speed.) A vehicle cannot start at its maximum speed, unless it has some form of high-level magic propulsion. Each round, the driver can attempt to accelerate the vehicle or decelerate it by a rate equal to its acceleration (see Driving Vehicles below). The rate at which a vehicle is currently moving is called its current speed."

			"Controlling a vehicle takes common sense, awareness, intuition, and often some amount of skill in its method of propulsion. In the case of muscle propulsion, it is about guiding the creatures to move the vehicle. In the case of current propulsion, it is about using the current and tools like sails, oars, or a rudder to move the vehicle. With magic, it is typically about understanding the magic device that powers the propulsion and using the device properly.",
			"",
			"**Driving Actions:** A driver can, at the start of her turn, before taking any other action, take any of the following actions (except the \"uncontrolled\" action) to control a vehicle. If the driver does not take an action, takes another action, or delays or readies an action, she loses control of the vehicle and the vehicle takes the \"uncontrolled\" action.",
			"",
			"**Accelerate (standard action):** With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed increases up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet), but no higher than its maximum speed. The vehicle can move forward or forward diagonally. In other words, each time a vehicle enters a new 5-foot square, it can choose any of its forward-facing squares-the ones directly in front or either of the squares directly forward and diagonal. This allows the vehicle to swerve. A driver who fails her driving check can only move into squares directly in front of the vehicle's forward facing.",
			"",
			"**Decelerate (standard action):** With a successful driving check, the vehicle's current speed decreases by a rate up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet). On a failed check, the vehicle does not decelerate. Either way, the vehicle can move forward diagonally. If deceleration reduces a vehicle's speed to 0, some amount of inertia will continue to move the vehicle forward. The vehicle moves forward (either directly forward or forward diagonally) 1d4 &times; 5 feet before coming to a complete stop. Having the [Expert Driver](feat/exper_driver) feat reduces this distance by 10 feet (minimum 0 feet).",
			"",
			"**Keep It Going (move action):** With a successful driving check, the driver can move the vehicle forward on its current facing at its current speed, and it can move forward diagonally. Failing the check keeps the speed constant, but you cannot move the vehicle forward diagonally.",
			"",
			"**Reverse (standard action):** A vehicle may only be moved in reverse if it is at a full stop (movement of 0 feet). On a successful driving check, a vehicle can move backward at half its acceleration, moving either directly backward (the reverse of its forward facing) or backward diagonally. On a failed check, it does not move backward.",
			"",
			"**Turn (standard action):** The driver takes this action to turn a vehicle's forward facing 90 degrees. The vehicle moves its current speed. If a vehicle's current speed is twice its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 5. If a vehicle's movement is three times its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 10. If it is four or more times its acceleration, the DC increases by 20. With a successful driving check, the vehicle changes its facing either left or right by 90 degrees at any point during its movement. Do this by pivoting the vehicle so that the left rear or right rear side of the vehicle takes the place of the vehicle's former forward facing side. On a failed check, the vehicle does not turn, but can be moved forward diagonally during its movement.",
			"",
			"**Uncontrolled (no action):** When the driver does nothing or there is no driver, the vehicle is uncontrolled. An uncontrolled vehicle moves forward only (it cannot move forward diagonally). If a vehicle has muscle propulsion, it decelerates at a rate equal to its acceleration. If a vehicle is powered by an air current, water current, or some form of weird current, it slows by 10 feet. These decelerations are cumulative. If a vehicle does nothing, it cannot perform vehicular bull rushes, but can still perform a vehicular overrun or a ramming maneuver (see Vehicle Combat Maneuvers).",
			"",
			"**Driving a Vehicle Outside of Combat:** Since driving a vehicle outside of combat is easily accomplished by taking 10 on the skill check, driving checks are not normally needed. Almost every character can do it with relative ease; the DCs are given only to adjudicate special situations that may come up in your game.",
			"",
			"**Driving a Vehicle with Magic Propulsion:** Typically, a vehicle with magic propulsion requires actions but no driving checks in order to drive it. When driving a vehicle with magic propulsion, treat every action as though the driver succeeded at the driving check.",
			"",
			"**Driving a Vehicle without the Proper Skill:** If a driver lacks the proper skill to drive a vehicle, the driver can always make a Wisdom ability check instead of the appropriate skill check. The driver can even take 10 or gain the benefits of aid another when using Wisdom instead of the vehicle's normal driving skill.",
			"",
			"**Vehicle Crews:** Some vehicles require a crew. A vehicle with a full crew complement is as easy to control as any other vehicle. A vehicle without a full crew complement, but with at least half its crew, increases all driving check DCs by 10. A vehicle needs at least half its crew complement in order to be driven at all. Crew members can take no action while the vehicle is in motion except to aid in that vehicle's movement. A crew member does not threaten an area."

			"The rules for turning a vehicle are a simple way of getting vehicles to turn on a grid, but when a vehicle turns, it doesn't do so sharply, even when powered by magic; vehicles rarely make turns evenly. If this simple system involves too much abstraction, you can have vehicles make wide turns.",
			"",
			"Have the driver make a driving check as usual. If she succeeds at the check, she can turn the vehicle. When a vehicle makes a turn, it has a chance to make a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver on any creature within the turning area, which is a square with sides equal to the vehicle's length, with one vertex touching the front facing of the vehicle on the side opposite to the direction of the turn. In other words, put the square with one side running along the vehicle's front, perpendicular to its forward facing, and another running the direction of its current forward facing. Place the square so its far corner is within the desired destination of the vehicle. If the turn is successful, the vehicle ends this movement in that area, facing toward the direction of the turn.",
			"",
			"The vehicle then makes either vehicular overruns or vehicular bull rushes (if the driver makes the required swift action) on all creatures and objects within the square that are smaller than it, and makes ramming maneuvers on all creatures and objects that are larger than it, including solid objects. It takes a -10 penalty on the vehicular bull rush and vehicular overrun maneuvers. The driver can choose to make these in any order she likes. She makes them one at a time (even after the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop), and all effects are cumulative. If the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop, the GM decides the final resting location within the turning area, picking the most plausible location given the effects.",
			"",
			"For instance, if the square has two objects larger than the vehicle and three creatures smaller than it, and the driver decides to make the ramming maneuver on the objects first, and then is wrecked during the ramming maneuver on the second object, the vehicle still makes the vehicular overruns on the other two creatures. It ends in a location of the GM's choosing."

			"",

			"**Threatening:** Vehicles cannot threaten areas, but their non-crew occupants can. A character driving a vehicle still threatens the squares around her, though she may have limited options for attack depending on the requirements of the device used to drive the vehicle. Creatures used as propulsion do not threaten areas, and are treated as part of the vehicle for purposes of vehicular combat maneuvers.",
			"",
			"**Line of Sight and Cover:** Vehicles typically grant their occupants partial cover (+2 to AC and +1 on Reflex saving throws) against those outside the vehicle, and may grant partial cover against opponents within the vehicles as well. Vehicles with more protection or internal chambers can offer greater cover and can even block line of sight.",
			"",
			"**Jumping On or Off a Vehicle:** Jumping on a vehicle is a normal jump of its distance assuming the vehicle has a deck or handholds within the character's height from the ground. Increase the DC of the Acrobatics check by 5 for every 30 feet of the vehicle's current speed. If the jumping creature is on a moving vehicle, calculate the increase in the Acrobatics skill check DC by calculating the difference between the current speeds of the two vehicles. For every difference of 30 feet (round up), the DC increases by 5.",
			"",
			"For example, jumping onto a vehicle with a current speed of 90 feet increases the DC by 15 if the jumper is not also on a moving vehicle. If the jumper is on a moving vehicle, and that vehicle is moving at the same current speed as the vehicle the jumper wants to jump to, there is no increase to the DC. If the difference between their speeds is less than 30 feet, the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 5. If it's between 30 and 60, it increases by 10, and so on.",
			"",
			"Jumping off a vehicle onto the ground is considered a fall, and treated as if the fall were an additional 10 feet farther for every 30 feet of the vehicle's movement for the purposes of determining damage. Acrobatics can be used to soften this fall, and magic abilities such as [feather fall](spell/feather_fall) can be used to negate the effects of jumping off a vehicle.",
			"",
			"**Taking Control of a Vehicle:** If a vehicle has no driver, any creature can take control of the vehicle as long as the creature is within the driving space of the vehicle and makes a driving check as a free action. The vehicle's driver can always give over control to another adjacent creature that is within the driving space of the vehicle as a free action. When a new creature becomes the driver, the vehicle moves on the new driver's turn, but not on the new driver's first turn after taking control of the vehicle.",
			"",
			"If a creature wants to take control of a vehicle from another forcefully, it must pull the driver off the controls as part of a grapple and take over the driving device as part of a pin. When a creature successfully pins a vehicle's driver, it can choose to end the grapple immediately. When it does, the creature moves the current driver 5 feet to any unoccupied space within the vehicle (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and becomes the vehicle's new driver.",
			"",
			"**Attacks against Vehicles:** A vehicle has a base Armor Class based on its size and other defenses the vehicle has. To calculate the vehicle's actual AC, add the current driver's driving skill modifier (or Wisdom modifier, if it is using that ability to drive the vehicle) to the vehicle's base AC. Touch attacks against a vehicle ignore its driver's driving skill or ability modifier; thus a vehicle's base AC is its touch AC. A vehicle is never considered flat-footed.",

A vehicle is immune to effects that require a Will saving throw (though drivers, crew members, passengers, and creatures providing muscle propulsion typically are not). To determine the vehicle's actual Fortitude and Reflex saving throws, add half the driver's driving skill modifier (or half the driver's Wisdom modifier) to the vehicle's base saving throw.",

			"Vehicles have hit points, but do not have ability scores, and are immune to ability score damage or drain. They are also immune to bleed damage. A vehicle that takes damage in excess of half its total hit points gains the broken condition. When a vehicle reaches 0 or fewer hit points, but has not yet reached negative hit points equal to the number of squares of its space, it is wrecked. When a vehicle reaches a negative number of hit points equal to the number of squares it takes up, it is destroyed (see Damaging a Vehicle).",

			"",
			"**Attacking Propulsion:** Propulsion often has its own set of statistics, while creatures propelling a vehicle use their own statistics. Other types of propulsion have hit points and hardness determined by multiplying the values listed in the Propulsion Devices sidebar by the vehicle's total number of squares of that type. Individual vehicle stat blocks also detail their propulsion.",

			"**Attacking the Driving Device:** A driving device is its own object with its own statistics. When a driving device gains the broken condition or is disabled, all driving checks are increased by 10. When a driving device is destroyed, the vehicle can no longer be driven. Driving devices are typically objects with object immunities and resistances. Attacking Conveyance: An attack against wheels, rudders, or similar forms of conveyance takes a -10 penalty on the attack roll, but does maximum damage to the vehicle (no roll necessary). If the attack is a critical hit, multiply this maximum damage by the critical multiplier of the attack. Conveyances are typically objects with object immunities and resistances.",

When a vehicle hits a creature or a vehicle that is its size or larger, or it hits a solid object (a wall or structure that is immobile and has a hardness of 5 or more), it makes a ramming maneuver.",
			"",
			"**Vehicular Overrun:** Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle smaller than it, the driver must make a vehicular overrun combat maneuver against the creature or vehicle. This may require the driver to make vehicular overrun checks against the same creature numerous times as new parts of the vehicle enter its square.",
			"",

If the driver has feats that improve her CMB when overrunning, like the [Improved Overrun](spell/improved_overrun) feat, she may also add those modifiers and benefits to the vehicular overrun. Like a normal overrun, this action provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being overrun, unless the driver has the [Improved Overrun](spell/improved_overrun) feat. The creature being overrun can make this attack of opportunity on any part of the vehicle that is within reach.",
			"",
			"When a vehicular overrun is attempted, the target of the overrun may choose to avoid the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to pass through its space without requiring a vehicular overrun maneuver check. The creature or vehicle cannot avoid a maneuver check if the driver has the Improved Overrun feat, the vehicle is two or more size categories larger than the target, or the target creature is confused, dazed, entangled, flat-footed, helpless, paralyzed, prone, or stunned. If the target does not avoid the vehicle, make the combat maneuver check as normal. If the maneuver is successful, the vehicle moves through the target's space, and the target of the overrun takes the vehicle's ramming damage (see Table 4-3 for base ramming damage by size, and individual vehicle stat blocks for their own ramming damage). If the driver's combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD by 5 or more, the target takes twice the vehicle's ramming damage. If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, it gets a +2 bonus to its CMD for each additional leg it has. Vehicles that are overrun are knocked prone if the opposing driver's combat maneuver check result exceeds the vehicle's CMD by 10 or more. A vehicle that is knocked prone makes a sudden stop (see Sudden Stops).",
			"",
			"It takes at least 5 full-round actions and a DC 25 Strength check from creatures adjacent to the vehicle to push a Large land or water vehicle up from being prone. For every size category that the vehicle is larger than size Large, increase the number of full-round actions by three and the Strength check DC by 5.",

			"**Vehicular Bull Rush:** As a swift action, taken when the driver takes all but the \"uncontrolled\" action while driving the vehicle, a driver can choose to substitute all or some of her vehicular overruns with vehicular bull rush maneuvers until the end of the vehicle's movement that turn. A vehicular bull rush pushes a creature or a vehicle away without doing harm. If the driver does not have the Improved Bull Rush feat or a similar ability, initiating a vehicular bull rush provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being bull rushed with the vehicle.",
			"",
			"If the bull rush is successful, the target of the bull rush is pushed 5 feet away from the vehicle. If you succeed at the check for the vehicular bull rush by 5 or more, you can deal the vehicle's ramming damage to the creature. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent's CMD, you push the target an additional 5 feet away. A creature being moved by a vehicular bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the driver possesses the [Greater Bull Rush](feat/greater_bull_rush) feat. You cannot bull rush a creature or vehicle into a square that is occupied by an object (including a vehicle). If there is another creature in the way of a bull rush, the driver must immediately make a combat maneuver check to bull rush that creature, taking a -4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If successful, the driver can continue to push the creature or vehicle a distance equal to the lesser result.",
			"",
			"**Ramming:** Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle of its size or larger, or the space of a solid sturdy object (like a wall or a building) no matter the size of that object, it makes a ramming maneuver against that creature or object. There is no maneuver check for a ramming maneuver; its effects happen automatically. When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a creature or an object, the vehicle deals its ramming damage to the creature or object, and the vehicle takes half that damage. The base amount of damage that a ramming vehicle does and takes is determined by its size (see Table 4-3).",

			"",
			"A vehicle can have a ram or similar ramming device on its forward facing. If it does, it ignores the damage for the first square it enters of a solid object, and all squares for other objects and creatures. A ram can be added to a Large vehicle for 50 gp, a Huge vehicle for 100 gp, a Gargantuan vehicle for 200 gp, and a Colossal vehicle for 400 gp. A vehicle cannot have a ram if it uses muscle propulsion (pulled).",
			"",
			"If a vehicle is being pulled by a creature or creatures when the vehicle takes damage due to a ramming maneuver, the creatures that are pulling it are damaged as well, and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for every 10 feet of the speed the vehicle was moving when it hit the vehicle, structure, or creature) halves the damage and the creatures pulling it are not knocked prone.",
			"",
			"If the vehicle making the ramming maneuver is a muscle-propelled (pulled) vehicle, the creatures pulling the vehicle attempt to avoid making a ramming maneuver. If a ramming maneuver is imminent, those creatures decelerate at a rate of up to twice their acceleration as an immediate action or attempt to swerve out of the way (automatically moving diagonally to avoid the vehicle or structure even if they were not driven to do so), avoiding the vehicle or structure if possible. The driver chooses which of these options occurs. A skilled driver can attempt to force the creature to continue the ramming maneuver, but doing so requires a DC 30 Handle Animal, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, depending on the type and intelligence of the creature.

If the vehicle is in motion, and is traveling faster than its new maximum speed, it automatically decelerates to its new maximum speed.",

For a water vehicle, this condition ends when a vehicle is brought to 1 or more hit points, but other vehicles must be removed from the water. A sinking ship fully sinks and is destroyed 10 rounds after gaining the sinking condition. Each additional hit on a sinking ship reduces the remaining time for it to sink by 1 round.

			"",
			"**Sudden Stops:** When a vehicle comes to a sudden stop-its movement is reduced to 0 in some way other than the driver using a drive action to slow the vehicle-both creatures and items on the vehicle are violently pushed toward the vehicle's forward facing a number of squares equal to 1/2 the vehicle's current speed before it came to the sudden stop. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the end of this movement, creatures and objects take 1d6 points of damage, and creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone. If the movement pushes creatures or objects into solid objects, that creature or object takes an additional 1d6 points of damage for each 5-foot square the push was reduced by the solid object.",
			"",
			"For instance, if a vehicle with a movement of 60 feet makes a sudden stop due to hitting a brick wall, its driver is thrown 30 feet toward the brick wall. If the brick wall was only 5 feet away from the driver at the point of impact, the driver moves forward 5 feet, hits the wall, and takes 5d6 points of damage. She then takes the original 1d6 points of damage, after which she makes a Reflex saving throw to see if she falls prone for the sudden stop.",

			"**Repairing a Vehicle:** The fastest and easiest way to repair a vehicle is with the [mending](spell/mending) and [make whole](spell/make_whole) spells, but more mundane methods can also be used. Craft (carpentry) can be used to repair most vehicles made of wood; because of their specialized construction, water vehicles require Craft (ships) to repair. Depending on the nature of the damage, such skills like Craft (cloth), Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (engineering), and even various professions can be used to repair vehicles, if the GM approves. In general, a day's worth of work by a single person using the appropriate skill to repair a vehicle requires 10 gp of raw material and a DC 10 skill check, and repairs 10 points of damage on a success, or 5 hit points on a failure."

			"Smashing a weapon or shield with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon is accomplished with the [sunder](rule/sunder) combat maneuver. Smashing an object is like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your combat maneuver check is opposed by the object's AC. Generally, you can smash an object only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.",

An object's Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier (see Table 7-11) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty to AC), but also an additional -2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.",

For example, fire might do full damage against parchment, cloth, and other objects that burn easily. Sonic might do full damage against glass and crystal objects.",

These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity. See the Attacks of Opportunity diagram for an example of how they work.",
			"",
			"**Threatened Squares:** You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you're unarmed, you don't normally threaten any squares and thus can't make attacks of opportunity.",

			"**Reach Weapons:** Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.",

			"**Moving:** Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack-the 5-foot step and the withdraw action. Performing a Distracting Act: Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table 8-2 notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.",

You don't have to make an attack of opportunity if you don't want to. You make your attack of opportunity at your normal attack bonus, even if you've already attacked in the round.",
			"",
			"An attack of opportunity \"interrupts\" the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character's turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character's turn).",
			"",
			"**Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity:** If you have the Combat Reflexes feat, you can add your Dexterity bonus to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn't count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus."

You can score critical hits with either type of attack as long as the spell deals damage.

You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action.

Bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or through the application of any spell that cures hit point damage (even if the bleed is ability damage). Some bleed effects cause [ability damage or even ability drain](rule/ability_score_damage,_penalty,_and_drain). Bleed effects do not stack with each other unless they deal different kinds of damage. When two or more bleed effects deal the same kind of damage, take the worse effect. In this case, ability drain is worse than ability damage.",

It takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any), and takes a -4 penalty on most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks and on opposed Perception skill checks. All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and Perception checks based on sight) automatically fail. All opponents are considered to have total concealment (50% miss chance) against the blinded character. Blind creatures must make a DC 10 Acrobatics skill check to move faster than half speed. Creatures that fail this check fall prone. Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.",

If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with a mending or make whole spell cast by a character with a caster level equal to or higher than the item's. Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original hit points or higher. Non-magical items can be repaired in a similar fashion, or through the Craft skill used to create it. Generally speaking, this requires a DC 20 Craft check and 1 hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Most craftsmen charge one-tenth the item's total cost to repair such damage (more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).",
			"",
			"**Confused:** A confused creature is mentally befuddled and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot tell the difference between ally and foe, treating all creatures as enemies. Allies wishing to cast a beneficial spell that requires a touch on a confused creature must succeed on a melee touch attack. If a confused creature is attacked, it attacks the creature that last attacked it until that creature is dead or out of sight.",

Any confused creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against anything that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).",
			"",
			"**Cowering:** The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class and loses his Dexterity bonus (if any).",
			"",
			"**Dazed:** The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC. A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Dazzled:** The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks.",
			"",
			"**Dead:** The character's hit points are reduced to a negative amount equal to his Constitution score, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character's soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.",
			"",
			"**Deafened:** A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a -4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails Perception checks based on sound, takes a -4 penalty on opposed Perception checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.",
			"",
			"**Disabled:** A character with 0 hit points, or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions, but he can still take swift, immediate, and free actions). He moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn't risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character's hit points, he is now in negative hit points and dying.",
			"",
			"A disabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if he is being helped. Otherwise, each day he can attempt a DC 10 Constitution check after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing hit points naturally.",
			"",
			"**Dying:** A dying creature is unconscious and near death. Creatures that have negative hit points and have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions. On the character's next turn, after being reduced to negative hit points (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check to become stable. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is stable does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature has an amount of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, it dies.",
			"",
			"**Energy Drained:** The character gains one or more negative levels, which might become permanent. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. See [Energy Drain and Negative levels](rule/energy_drain_and_negative_levels) more information.",
			"",
			"**Entangled:** The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.",
			"",
			"**Exhausted:** An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.",
			"",
			"**Fascinated:** A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Fatigued:** A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.",
			"",
			"**Flat-Footed:** A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, unable to react normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Fragile**: Fragile weapons and armor cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead.",
			"",
			"Armor with the fragile quality falls apart when hit with heavy blows. If an attacker hits a creature wearing fragile armor with an attack roll of a natural 20 and confirms the critical hit (even if the creature is immune to critical hits), the armor gains the broken condition. If already broken, the armor is destroyed instead. Fragile armor is not broken or destroyed by critical threats that are not generated by natural 20s, so if a creature wielding a weapon with a 19-20 or 18-20 critical range scores a critical hit on the wearer of this armor with a roll of less than a natural 20, that critical hit has no chance to break or destroy the armor.",
			"",
			"Masterwork and magical fragile weapons and armor lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description or the special material description.",
			"",
			"**Frightened:** A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.",
			"",
			"Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.",
			"",
			"**Grappled:** A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a -4 penalty to Dexterity. A grappled creature takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler's CMB + spell level, see [Concentration](rule/concentration)), or lose the spell. Grappled creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"A grappled creature cannot use Stealth to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so. If a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its CMD to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.",
			"",
			"**Helpless:** A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent's mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (-5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.",
			"",
			"As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A rogue also gets his sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make Fortitude saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.",
			"",
			"**Incorporeal:** Creatures with the incorporeal condition do not have a physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Incorporeal creatures take half damage (50%) from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Incorporeal creatures take full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as all force effects.",
			"",
			"**Invisible:** Invisible creatures are visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a sighted opponent, and ignores its opponent's Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). See Invisibility, under Special Abilities.",
			"",
			"**Nauseated:** Creatures with the nauseated condition experience stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move actions per turn.",
			"",
			"**Panicked:** A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can't take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.",
			"",
			"Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.",
			"",
			"**Paralyzed:** A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature flying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can't swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature-ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares to move through.",
			"",
			"**Petrified:** A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character's petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.",
			"",
			"**Pinned:** A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus. A pinned character also takes an additional -4 penalty to his Armor Class. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler's CMB + spell level) or lose the spell. Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.",
			"",
			"**Prone:** The character is lying on the ground. A prone attacker has a -4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a -4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.",
			"",
			"Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Shaken:** A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.",
			"",
			"**Sickened:** The character takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.",
			"",
			"**Stable:** A character who was dying but who has stopped losing hit points each round and still has negative hit points is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses hit points. The character can make a DC 10 Constitution check each hour to become conscious and disabled (even though his hit points are still negative). The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total.",
			"",
			"If a character has become stable on his own and hasn't had help, he is still at risk of losing hit points. Each hour he can make a Constitution check to become stable (as a character that has received aid), but each failed check causes him to lose 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Staggered:** A staggered creature may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions). A staggered creature can still take free, swift, and immediate actions. A creature with nonlethal damage exactly equal to its current hit points gains the staggered condition.",
			"",
			"**Stunned:** A stunned creature drops everything held, can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).",
			"",
			"**Unconscious:** Unconscious creatures are knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having negative hit points (but not more than the creature's Constitution score), or from nonlethal damage in excess of current hit points."

			"From curses to poisons to diseases, there are a number of afflictions that can affect a creature. While each of these afflictions has a different effect, they all function using the same basic system. All afflictions grant a saving throw when they are contracted. If successful, the creature does not suffer from the affliction and does not need to make any further rolls. If the saving throw is Table must deal with its effects.",
			"",
			"Afflictions require a creature to make a saving throw after a period of time to avoid taking certain penalties. With most afflictions, if a number of saving throws are made consecutively, the affliction is removed and no further saves are necessary. Some afflictions, usually supernatural ones, cannot be cured through saving throws alone and require the aid of powerful magic to remove.",
			"",

			"**Type:** This is the type of the affliction, such as curse, disease, or poison. It might also include the means by which it is contracted, such as contact, ingestion, inhalation, injury, spell, or trap.",
			"",
			"**Save:** This gives the type of save necessary to avoid contracting the affliction, as well as the DC of that save. Unless otherwise noted, this is also the save to avoid the affliction's effects once it is contracted, as well as the DC of any caster level checks needed to end the affliction through magic, such as remove curse or neutralize poison.",
			"",
			"**Onset:** Some afflictions have a variable amount of time before they set in. Creatures that come in contact with an affliction with an onset time must make a saving throw immediately. Success means that the affliction is avoided and no further saving throws must be made. Failure means that the creature has contracted the affliction and must begin making additional saves after the onset period has elapsed. The affliction's effect does not occur until after the onset period has elapsed and then only if further saving throws are failed.",
			"",
			"**Frequency:** This is how often the periodic saving throw must be attempted after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of -1/ day- lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of -1/ round for 6 rounds' ends after 6 rounds have passed.",
			"",
			"Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time if one is listed).",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This is the effect that the character suffers each time if he fails his saving throw against the affliction. Most afflictions cause [ability damage](rule/ability_score_damage,_penalty,_and_drain) or hit point damage. These effects are cumulative, but they can be cured normally. Other afflictions cause the creature to take penalties or other effects. These effects are sometimes cumulative, with the rest only affecting the creature if it failed its most recent save. Some afflictions have different effects after the first save is failed. These afflictions have an initial effect, which occurs when the first save is failed, and a secondary effect, when additional saves are failed, as noted in the text. Hit point and ability score damage caused by an affliction cannot be healed naturally while the affliction persists.",
			"",
			"**Cure:** This tells you how the affliction is cured. Commonly, this is a number of saving throws that must be made consecutively. Even if the affliction has a limited frequency, it might be cured prematurely if enough saving throws are made. Hit point damage and ability score damage is not removed when an affliction is cured. Such damage must be healed normally. Afflictions without a cure entry can only be cured through powerful spells, such as neutralize poison and remove curse. No matter how many saving throws are made, these afflictions continue to affect the target.",
			"",

He failed a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid contracting it, so after the onset period of 1d3 days has passed, he must make another DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. From this point onward, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save each day (according to the disease's frequency) to avoid further Strength damage. If, on two consecutive days, he makes his Fortitude saves, he is cured of the disease and any damage it caused begins to heal as normal."

			"No other affliction is so prevalent as poison. From the fangs of a viper to the ichor-stained assassin's blade, poison is a constant threat. Poisons can be cured by successful saving throws and spells such as neutralize poison.",
			"",
			"Contact poisons are contracted the moment someone touches the poison with his bare skin. Such poisons can be used as injury poisons. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 minute and a frequency of 1 minute. Ingested poisons are contracted when a creature eats or drinks the poison. Ingested poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes and a frequency of 1 minute. Injury poisons are primarily contracted through the attacks of certain creatures and through weapons coated in the toxin. Injury poisons do not usually have an onset time and have a frequency of 1 round. Inhaled poisons are contracted the moment a creature enters an area containing such poisons. Most inhaled poisons fill a volume equal to a 10-foot cube per dose. Creatures can attempt to [hold their breaths](rule/suffocation) while inside to avoid inhaling the toxin. Creatures holding their breaths receive a 50% chance of not having to make a Fortitude save each round. Note that a character that would normally suffocate while attempting to hold its breath instead begins to breathe normally again.",
			"",
			"Unlike other afflictions, multiple doses of the same poison stack. Poisons delivered by injury and contact cannot inflict more than one dose of poison at a time, but inhaled and ingested poisons can inflict multiple doses at once. Each additional dose extends the total duration of the poison (as noted under frequency) by half its total duration. In addition, each dose of poison increases the DC to resist the poison by +2. This increase is cumulative. Multiple doses do not alter the cure conditions of the poison, and meeting these conditions ends the affliction for all the doses. For example, a character is bit three times in the same round by a trio of Medium monstrous spiders, injecting him with three doses of Medium spider venom. The unfortunate character must make a DC 18 Fortitude save for the next 8 rounds. Fortunately, just one successful save cures the character of all three doses of the poison.",
			"",
			"Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action. Whenever a character applies or readies a poison for use there is a 5% chance that he exposes himself to the poison and must save against the poison as normal. This does not consume the dose of poison. Whenever a character attacks with a poisoned weapon, if the attack roll results in a natural 1, he exposes himself to the poison. This poison is consumed when the weapon strikes a creature or is touched by the wielder. Characters with the poison use class feature do not risk accidentally poisoning themselves.",
			"",
			"Poisons can be made using Craft (alchemy). The DC to make a poison is equal to its Fortitude save DC. Rolling a natural 1 on a Craft skill check while making a poison exposes the crafter to the poison. Crafters with the poison use class feature do not risk poisoning themselves when using Craft to make poison."

Any opponent that cannot be seen has total concealment (50% miss chance) against a creature with blindsense, and the blindsensing creature still has the normal miss chance when attacking foes that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of a creature with blindsense. A creature with blindsense is still denied its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class against attacks from creatures it cannot see."

To some, it is a means to an end, a regrettable necessity when all other options have failed, and a tool that is to be set down the moment it's not absolutely needed. To others, it is a panacea and a way of life-a means of solving any problem, and of proving one's worth by standing tall against one's fellows and the harsh denizens of an uncaring universe. In the hands of a skilled warrior, a sword is no longer simply a sharpened length of steel, and even a club is more than just a broken branch. These objects become instruments of a serious and sometimes brutal art, one whose practitioners are every bit as skilled in their artistry as the greatest bards. Many such acolytes of battle might say that theirs is the only art worth pursuing, as it's the sole one by which the artist not only inspires respect, but commands it. Combat is civilization's oldest trade and form of expression, and no matter how far we've come since the first days of stones and sticks, it continues to shape the events that define us. A civilized society may claim to abhor bloodshed, but it's that same bloodshed-or its threat-that watches over us and gives us the freedom to maintain such ideals.",

The baseline gunslinger rules and the prices for ammunition given in this chapter are for this type of campaign. Early firearms are available, but are relatively rare. Adventurers who want to use guns must take the [Gunsmithing](feat/gunsmithing) feat just to make them feasible weapons. Advanced firearms may exist, but only as rare and wondrous items-the stuff of high-level treasure troves.",
			"",
			"**Commonplace Guns:** While still expensive and tricky to wield, early firearms are readily available. Instead of requiring the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feat/exotic_weapon_proficiency) feat, all firearms are martial weapons. Early firearms and their ammunition cost 25% of the amounts listed in this book, but advanced firearms and their ammunition are still rare and cost the full price to purchase or craft.",
			"",
			"**Guns Everywhere:** Guns are commonplace. Early firearms are seen as antiques, and advanced firearms are widespread. Firearms are simple weapons, and early firearms, advanced guns, and their ammunition are bought or crafted for 10% of the cost listed in this chapter. The gunslinger loses the gunsmith class feature and instead gains the gun training class feature at 1st level."

			"",
			"**Firearm Proficiency:** The [Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms)](feat/exotic_weapon_proficiency_firearms) feat allows you to use all firearms without penalty. A nonproficient character takes the standard -4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.",
			"",
			"Even though the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms)](feat/exotic_weapon_proficiency_firearms) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as [Weapon Focus](feat/weapon_focus) or [Rapid Reload](feat/rapid_reload)), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.",
			"",
			"All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter's weapon training class feature.",
			"",
			"**Capacity:** A firearm's capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.",
			"",
			"**Range and Penetration:** Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.",
			"",
			"**Early Firearms:** When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as [Deadly Aim](feat/deadly_aim). At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.",
			"",
			"**Advanced Firearms:** Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as [Deadly Aim](feat/deadly_aim). At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative -2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.",
			"",
			"**Loading a Firearm:** You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other-you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm. Loading siege firearms requires both hands, and one hand usually manipulates a large ramrod (which can be wielded as a club in combat).",
			"",
			"The [Rapid Reload](feat/rapid_reload) feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms, but this feat does not reduce the time it takes to load siege firearms.",
			"",
			"Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.",
			"",
			"**Early Firearms:** Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm. It takes three full-round actions by one person to load a siege firearm. This can be reduced to two full-round actions if more than one person is loading the cannon.",
			"",
			"**Advanced Firearms:** Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity. The [Rapid Reload](feat/rapid_reload) feat reduces this to a free action.",
			"",
			"**Misfires:** If the natural result of your attack roll falls within a firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm (see the gunslinger class). In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.",
			"",
			"**Early Firearms:** If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the [Gunsmithing](feat/gunsmithing) feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square-the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon-a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.",
			"",
			"**Advanced Firearms:** Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A further misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.",
			"",
			"**Ammunition:** Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Unlike other types of ammunition, firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used, and has no chance of being retrieved on a miss. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.",
			"",
			"**Concealing Firearms:** Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.",
			"",
			"**Inappropriately Sized Firearms:** You cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for you. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between your size and the size of the firearm. If you are not proficient with the firearm, a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands you need to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a -4 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness.",
			"",
			"**Bucklers:** You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.",
			"",
			"**Fire while Prone:** Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.",
			"",
			"**Firearms, Black Powder, and Water:** Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.",
			"",
			"**Deflecting and Snatching Bullets:** The [Deflect Arrows](feat/deflect_arrows) feat and the [Snatch Arrows](feat/snatch_arrows) feat can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon. Neither of these feats can be used to deflect siege firearm attacks."

Siege weapons are typically mounted on some sort of platform, movable or otherwise, and have greater power but a much slower rate of fire."

			"",
			"The rules for a duel are usually quite simple, but might vary if all of the participants are of a particular class or if all of the participants agree on specific restrictions or guidelines. Such discussions typically happen before the duel, allowing both sides to properly prepare, but as with all elements of a duel, this is not always the case. Most duels utilize the following simple rules.",

If the duel consists of more than one participant on a side, those fighting alongside one another are free to aid each other.",
			"- The types of weapons that can be used in the duel are agreed upon before the duel begins. Typical restrictions include only using melee weapons, ranged weapons, unarmed (or natural) weapons, magic, or any combination of these. The rules of a duel may require all duel participants to use the same weapon or types of attacks. This is especially the case in duels that require swords, spells, or firearms. Absent any such rules, any type of weapon is permissible.",
			"- The duel usually lasts until one of the combatants has been knocked unconscious or otherwise prevented from continuing. Spells such as [hold person](spell/hold_person) do not end duels, but [flesh to stone](spell/flesh_to_stone) certainly does, assuming the target fails her saving throw. Some duels go to the death and are only ended when one duelist or team is cut to pieces or reduced to a pile of smoking ashes. Other duels last until first blood, first strike, or a number of successful attacks. These latter types of duels are usually intended to settle disputes where a creature's death is not the required end result.",
			"- In the case of duels that exclusively use magic, additional rules might prohibit the use of summoned or conjured creatures, unless the duel is performed by such creatures at the behest of the spellcasters involved (as is common among druids and summoners).",
			"- In the case of duels exclusively among warriors, additional rules typically prohibit the use of poison or even entire types of attacks (such as prohibiting ranged attacks, or requiring the use of firearms). In addition, most such duels prohibit the use of magic that affects other participants, although spells that enhance the caster are sometimes allowed."

Alternatively, some duels start off with each side facing off, waiting for the other to flinch or break resolve.

The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell's caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success. The caster attempting the counterspell receives a bonus or penalty on her check depending upon the level of the spell slot being expended and the exact spell used, as noted in Table 3-10.

That is not to say that accidents don't happen, and more than one student has lost a limb or even her life while within such \"safe\" fields.",
			"",
			"Fighters, paladins, cavaliers, and other characters that primarily rely on weapon attacks usually engage in duels to settle points of honor, but can also be rather particular in choosing their dueling space.",
			"",
			"Regardless of the conditions, most duels are serious affairs, with each side putting pride, honor, treasure, and even their lives on the line to win the day. While villains might try to cheat the rules and exploit every advantage, nobler duelists see the competition as a chance to prove their superiority on the field of battle using only their skills and wits, rather than chance or superior numbers."

Whether a bar brawl with the goal of rousing the local populace to rise up against a band of bullies or a sun-drenched and bloody gladiatorial contest where life and death actually hinge on the favor of the crowd, performance combats are fights in which showmanship and flair can be more important than ruthless fighting efficiency.",

			"When creating a performance combat, it is important to determine the goals and rules of that combat. The following are the major examples of performance combat, but you should feel free to mix and match some of these general categories to create a performance combat that fits the story of your campaign.",
			"",
			"**Knockout Bout:** Frequently as brutal but not as bloody as battles to the death, a knockout bout does not end in the death of one side, but still requires a clear and crushing victory. As long as both sides in the performance combat remain standing, the fight continues. Many knockout bout combats require that their participants deal nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"**Staged Combats:** Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the [Stage Combatant](feat/stage_combatant) feat). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a -6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.",
			"",
			"**To a Number of Wounds:** Not all blood sports end in death. It is often costly to train warriors for arenas big and small, and those who finance such enterprises are protective of their investments. In societies that value life but still love the spectacle of a good fracas, fighting to a number of wounds is an excellent compromise. A fight to first blood or to a certain number of wounds is often enough to appease a crowd.",
			"",
			"**To the Death:** Only the death of one side ends these bouts. Sometimes the crowd's reaction is secondary to the desperate battle on display, but other times the crowd's reaction can have an effect on the actual outcome of the fight. Some blood sports demand that combatants hold off on the killing blow until the crowd gets a chance to voice its pleasure or displeasure, usually with a roar of applause or with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. A thumbs-up gesture allows the vanquished combatant to live and fight another day; a thumbs-down gesture ends the melee with a grotesque spray of blood.",
			"",
			"**Toward a Goal:** Often these are elaborate affairs that may reproduce a historical battle, or just pit combatants against terrain and challenges that feature a variety of hazards and traps. These types of battles can be races (maybe mixing them with [the rules for vehicular combat](rule/vehicles_in_combat)), or may present capture-the-flag-like objectives, but all test the ability of the combatants to achieve a predetermined goal."

			"",
			"A crowd's attitude is similar to a nonplayer character's attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd's starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.",
			"",
			"During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd's attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.",

This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating in serialized performance combats.",
			"",
			"**Unfriendly:** While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a -1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Indifferent:** The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.",
			"",
			"**Friendly:** The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Helpful:** The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.",

Victory points should be split as evenly as possible among the combatants within a team, with the remainder going to combatants in any way the team chooses (but with no individual player receiving more than 1 point from the remainder). For instance, if a team is made up of four combatants, but at the end of a bout there are 6 victory points, all four combatants gain at least 1 victory point, and two members of the team each receive 1 additional point, as chosen by the members of the team in any way the members deem fair."

			"",
			"All siege engines are at least size Large devices and often much larger. Unless stated otherwise in an individual siege engine description, all siege engines use the following rules.",
			"",
			"**Proficiency:** Siege engines are exotic weapons. A creature with the [Siege Engineer](feat/siege_engineer) feat is proficient with all siege engines, including siege firearms. A creature that is proficient in firearms is also proficient in siege firearms, but not other siege engines.",
			"",
			"**Crew:** The sheer size of a siege engine often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the movement of a siege engine; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege engine to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege engine to function.",
			"",
			"The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A ram can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a Gargantuan creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a Colossal creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.",
			"",
			"**Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines:** Siege engines can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege engine can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege engine applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege engines), and in the case of magical siege engines, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.",
			"",
			"**Defense and Hit Points:** All siege engines are objects. A siege engine has a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege engine has its own hardness and hit points. Siege engines can be armored-treat the siege engine as a creature of its size to determine the cost of the armor. Masterwork siege engine armor can be enchanted for twice the normal cost to enchant armor. Armored siege engines have an armor bonus equal to that normally granted by the specific armor (shields have no effect on a siege engine), a hardness and hit points equal to that of the armor, and bonus hit points equal to the armor bonus &times; 5.",
			"",
			"**Moving Siege Engines:** Siege engines have a speed. The speed of a siege engine is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege engines have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the engine must be dissembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege engines that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Attacks:** Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines do not deal half damage when attacking objects.",
			"",
			"**Critical Hits:** When a direct-fire siege engine or a close assault siege engine scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire ranged siege engine rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege engine multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier. Unlike normal attacks, siege engines attacks can deal critical hit damage to objects. Siege engines do not gain the benefit of critical feats the crew or the crew leader may have.",
			"",
			"**Mishaps and Misfires:** Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll or a targeting check made by an indirect-fire ranged siege engine produces a mishap. Usually a mishap applies the broken condition. A non-firearm siege engine with the broken condition takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, targeting checks, and damage rolls. It also moves at half its normal speed.",
			"",
			"If the creature that serves as crew leader has the Siege Engineer feat, that creature does not generate a mishap on a natural 1 when firing the siege engine.",
			"",
			"Firearm siege weapons do not gain a mishap on a natural 1, but instead have a misfire value, like other firearms do. An attack roll or targeting check that falls within the misfire range causes the firearm siege engine to misfire. A misfire always misses, and applies the broken condition to the siege engine firearm. A firearm siege weapon with the broken condition takes all of the penalties and limitations that non-firearm siege engines do, and the misfire range of the firearm siege engine is increased by 4. If the firearm siege engine already has the broken condition when it misfires, it explodes. When a firearm siege engine explodes, it deals its damage to all creatures within a blast range (those within the blast can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage). The normal misfire range of a firearm siege engine and its blast range are given in the individual firearm siege engine description. Crew leaders with the [Siege Engineer](feat/siege_engineer) feat do not lower the misfire value of firearm siege engines.",
			"",
			"**Constructing and Repairing Siege Engines:** A siege engine is a complex device requiring a DC 20 Craft (siege engine) skill check to build or repair.",
			"",
			"**Disabling Siege Engines:** A siege engine is considered a difficult device to disable, requiring 2d4 rounds of effort and a DC 20 Disable Device check to do so. When a siege engine is disabled, it either doesn't work or is sabotaged and stops working 1d4 minutes after use. Fixing a disabled siege engine requires a DC 20 Craft (siege engine), Disable Device, or Knowledge (engineering) check. It takes 10 minutes to fix the device, and the check can be retried if the fix fails.",
			"",
			"**Assembling Siege Engines:** Siege engines are broken down for transport and can be reassembled on the battlefield, requiring the time and number of workers noted below. Each assembly worker must make a DC 10 Craft (siege engine) check; if untrained, they may not take 10. Assembly can be performed with at least half the required number of workers by doubling the time required. If fewer than half are available, the weapon cannot be assembled.",

			"",
			"**Range:** Any attack at more than the distance listed in this entry is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack or targeting check takes a cumulative -2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof ) of distance to the target.

In those cases, the type of energy damage is listed instead.",

Loading ammunition takes a number of full-round actions depending on the siege engine (this time can be reduced to move actions if the crew leader has the [Master Siege Engineer](feat/master_siege_engineer) feat).",
			"",
			"**Aiming a Siege Engine:** Ranged siege engines must be aimed in order to attack a desired target (in the case of direct-fire siege engines) or square (in the case of indirect-fire siege engines). Aiming takes a number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the [Master Siege Engineer](feat/master_siege_engineer) feat), with the number depending on the specific siege engine. Aiming a siege engine with a diminished crew doubles the amount of time it takes to aim the siege engine. Each time a new target or square is chosen as the target of a siege engine's attack, that engine must be aimed anew.",
			"",
			"**Direct-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:** Direct-fire weapons launch their projectiles on a relatively flat trajectory, allowing them to more easily target creatures or pummel barriers directly in front of them.",
			"",
			"A direct-fire weapon uses a normal attack roll, with the normal penalty for nonproficient use. In addition, a direct-fire weapon takes a -2 attack roll penalty per size category that the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. Creatures that have ranks in Knowledge (engineering) are not adversely affected by their size when firing direct-fire ranged siege engines.",
			"",
			"Sheer manpower can also reduce the penalties for size. Increasing the crew of these weapons by 1 or more can reduce the attack roll penalty for creature size: as long as an extra crew member is no smaller than three size categories smaller than the direct-fire weapon, it can reduce the penalty due to the aiming creature's size by 2. For example, a Huge ballista fired by a Medium creature that is part of a crew of two (the creature aiming the ballista and someone to help position it) takes only a -2 penalty on attack rolls.",
			"",
			"**Indirect-Fire Ranged Siege Engines:** Indirect-fire weapons launch projectiles in high arcs toward their targets. They typically lob heavier missiles and payloads than direct-fire weapons, but they are harder to aim accurately. Indirect weapons can bypass many forms of fortification, delivering their payloads of solid shot, scatter shot, or even disease-ridden offal to targets beyond the walls of castles. They can also be used to batter fortifications where they are most vulnerable, arcing down on towers and walls, crushing them with the weight of stone or raining down smaller projectiles on a wall's defenders.",
			"",
			"Indirect-fire weapons use a targeting mechanic similar to that described for catapults in the Core Rulebook, hereafter referred to as an indirect attack. The following is an update to those rules.",
			"",
			"**Indirect Attack:** To fire an indirect-fire ranged siege engine, the crew leader makes a targeting check against the DC of the siege engine. This check uses his base attack bonus, his Intelligence modifier (if not trained in Knowledge [engineering]) or Knowledge (engineering) skill modifier (if trained in that skill), any penalty for not being proficient in the siege engine, and the appropriate modifiers from Table 3-12. If the check succeeds, the ammunition of the indirect attack hits the square the siege engine was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage or effect to any object or creature within the area of its attack. Creatures may get a saving throw to limit the effect of the attack; this is typically based on the type of ammunition used.",
			"",
			"If the attack misses the intended square, roll 1d8 to determine in what direction the shot veers. A roll of 1 indicates the ammunition falls short (toward the siege engine), with rolls of 2 through 8 counting squares clockwise around the target square. Roll 1d4 for every range increment at which the attack was made (1d4 if the target square is within the engine's first range increment, 2d4 if the target square is within the second range increment, and so on). The total is the number of squares by which the attack misses, with the direction in which the squares are counted determined by the d8 roll.

			"From creating a wisp of light to causing the ground itself to shatter and break, spells are a source of immense power. A spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and experienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.",

The wizard does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest in order to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing his spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing any spells.",

He cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because he has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard prepares more than one-quarter of his spells.",

Psychic spells are purely mental actions, and they can be cast even while the caster is pinned or paralyzed. Focus components work the same way with psychic spells as they do with other spells.",

If a spell's components line lists a somatic component, that spell instead requires an emotion component when cast by psychic spellcasters, and if it has a verbal component, it instead requires a thought component when cast by psychic spellcasters. Psychic spells cast by non-psychic arcane and divine casters use any listed somatic and verbal components as normal.",

A psychic spellcaster marshals her desire in order to focus and release the spell's energy. It is impossible to cast a spell with an emotion component while the spellcaster is under the influence of a non-harmless effect with the emotion or fear descriptors. Even if the effect's emotion matches the necessary emotion to cast the psychic spell, the spellcaster is not in control of her own desires and animal impulses, which is a necessary part of providing an emotion component.",
			"",
			"**Thought Components:** Thought components represent mental constructs necessary for the spell's function, such as picturing a wolf in vivid detail-down to the saliva dripping from its jaws-in order to cast [beast shape](spell/beast_shape) to transform into a wolf. Thought components are so mentally demanding that they make interruptions and distractions extremely challenging. The DC for any concentration check for a spell with a thought component increases by 10. A psychic spellcaster casting a spell with a thought component can take a move action before beginning to cast the spell to center herself; she can then use the normal DC instead of the increased DC.",

A psychic spellcaster can replace verbal and somatic components with thought and emotion components only for the purposes of the spell components themselves, not for the purposes of any other rules elements that relate to verbal and somatic components. She can't use [Silent Spell](feat/silent_spell) to ignore the thought component of a spell, for example. The new feats [Intuitive Spell](feat/intuitive_spell) and [Logical Spell](feat/logical_spell) serve a similar function for these new components."

When a spellcaster undercasts a spell, it is treated exactly like the lower-level version, including when determining its effect, saving throw, and other variables. For example, a psychic spellcaster who adds [ego whip III](spell/ego_whip_3) to his list of spells known can cast it as [ego whip I](spell/ego_whip_1), [II](spell/ii), or [III](spell/iii). If he casts it as [ego whip I](spell/ego_whip_1), it is treated in all ways as that spell; it uses the text and the saving throw DC for that spell, and requires him to expend a 3rd-level spell slot.",

			"",
			"**Caster Blank:** A spellcaster with caster blank has a hard time focusing her spells or spell-like abilities on the same creature more than once. After targeting a creature with a spell, the caster cannot target that creature again with a spell until caster blank is removed or suppressed. To suppress caster blank, the afflicted spell caster must spend a standard action concentrating, which shakes off all effects of the caster blank until she casts a targeted spell again. Caster blank only affects spells that target creatures, and a spellcaster can still affect the creature with area spells.",
			"",
			"Caster blank can be cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"**Caster Croak:** The afflicted spellcaster's throat or mouth is magically constricted. The spellcaster can barely make her words heard, and then only with great effort. A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4. Spell-like abilities are not affected by this spellblight because they lack verbal components. Shouting and screaming is impossible while the creature is affected by this spellblight.",
			"",
			"A [heal](spell/heal) spell or similar effect cures this spellblight, as does casting the [shout](spell/shout) spell, though doing so is still affected by the spellblight's effects.",
			"",
			"**Confounded Casting:** A spellcaster with confounded casting has a mental disconnect between the spells she intends to cast and the spells she actually casts. The first time on her turn that she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she makes a concentration check with a DC of 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast. If the concentration check fails, the caster must pick another spell or spell-like ability of the same level or lower to cast with the same casting time. If the spellcaster has no other spell or spell-like ability, the action is lost. The spell or spell-like ability she originally picked is not spent and she can attempt to cast that spell again later.",
			"",
			"Confounded casting is cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"**Disassociation:** A spellcaster with disassociation lapses into a mild insanity in which she dissociates her identity and starts to perceive herself as someone else. While subject to disassociation, a spellcaster is incapable of using spells or effects with a range of personal or of targeting herself with a spell effect. A spell with an area that includes her but does not need targeted individual creatures functions normally.",
			"",
			"Disassociation can by cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"**Ebon Eyes:** A spellcaster with ebon eyes develops a jet-black film over her eyes, which inverts her capacity to perceive light and darkness. The creature treats darkness as bright light, dim light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and bright light as darkness. The ebon eyes protect against blinding, dazzling, patterns, or other visual effects, granting a +2 bonus on all saving throws against those effects.",
			"",
			"Ebon eyes can be removed with an effect that removes blindness.",
			"",
			"**Eldritch Ague:** Eldritch ague manifests itself as a sickness that is debilitating to spellcasters. A spellcaster with this spellblight is sickened until the curse is removed. When the subject of the curse casts a spell, she is overcome with shaking for 1 round, requiring any spellcasting or the use of a spell-like ability during that time to succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the save, the spell and the action to cast it is lost.",
			"",
			"While a curse, eldritch ague acts much like a disease, and creatures with immunity to disease are also immune to eldritch ague. [Remove disease](spell/remove_disease) cures eldritch ague; unlike with most spellblights, using this spell to remove the spellblight does not impose a -5 caster level check penalty.",
			"",
			"**Hemoculysis:** A spellcaster with hemoculysis bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell. While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided it's greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster's eyes bleeding is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a -4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.",
			"",
			"Hemoculysis can be cured by [heal](spell/heal) or [regenerate](spell/regenerate).",
			"",
			"**Lassitude:** Whenever a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the check, the spellcaster takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level (or 1 point of nonlethal damage when casting a 0-level spell or 1 point per 2 caster levels if using a spell-like ability). This nonlethal damage cannot be reduced in any way so long as the spellcaster suffers from lassitude.",
			"",
			"Lassitude can be cured by [lesser restoration](spell/lesser_restoration), [restoration](spell/restoration), or any effect that completely removes exhaustion. Simply resting has no effect. Creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this spellblight.",
			"",
			"**Ritualistic Obsession:** A spellcaster afflicted with ritualistic obsession adds unnecessary gestures to her spellcasting activities. Any spell without a somatic component (even a spell cast with the [Still Spell](feat/still_spell) feat) now requires one, and any spell that already has a somatic component requires two free hands rather than one. Spell-like abilities now require a somatic component. The extra complexity increases swift action casting times to a standard action, standard action casting times to 1 round, and 1 round casting times to 2 rounds. Other casting times are not increased. The extra focus does serve to increase the efficacy of the caster's spells. All save DCs for spells and spell-like abilities that have their casting time increased with ritualistic obsession are increased by 1.",
			"",
			"Ritualistic obsession is cured by any effect that removes insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to ritualistic obsession.",
			"",
			"**Spell Addiction:** A spell addict feeds off the elation of wielding magic, but suffers rapid withdrawal once spellcasting ends. After successfully casting a spell, the addict gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws until her next turn. On any round the spell addict does not cast a spell on her turn, however, she goes into withdrawal, and is sickened until her next turn.",

			"",
			"**Eldritch Cataracts:** Each time a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, her vision becomes fuzzier and fuzzier until eventually she is blinded. Each time the spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 15 + the spell's level. If she fails, she takes a -1 penalty on vision-based Perception checks until the spellblight is removed. Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a -4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead.",
			"",
			"Eldritch cataracts is a difficult spellblight to cure. Any effect that cures blindness reduces the penalty by 1. If the penalty is reduced to -3 or lower, any blindness is relieved until the caster fails the Fortitude saving throw enough times to bring the penalty back to -4. Reducing the penalty to 0 cures the spellblight.",
			"",
			"Blind creatures and creatures that don't use sight are immune to eldritch cataracts.",
			"",
			"**Nameless Dread:** A caster with nameless dread believes strange beings from far dimensions or the blackness between the stars are hounding her and sapping her sanity. Every time the caster uses a spell or a spell-like ability, she sees a glimpse of her nameless pursuers. She must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level), or become shaken for 1 round per level of the spell. If already shaken, the spellcaster becomes frightened for the duration of the original effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. If she is already frightened, she becomes panicked (and cannot cast) for the duration of the current effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. Each time a spellcaster becomes panicked, there is a 5% chance she will become permanently insane (as the [insanity](spell/insanity) spell, or the GM may choose [a form of insanity](rule/types_of_insanity).",
			"",
			"A spellcaster suffering from nameless dread is particularly adept at wielding spells with the fear or chaos descriptor. When she casts a spell with that descriptor, the save DC for that spell is increased by 1, and she gains a +1 competence bonus on all caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance.",
			"",
			"Spells that suppress fear work on nameless dread. Those that remove fear effects suppress the effects of nameless dread (and its benefits to spellcasting) for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Negated:** A negated spellcaster has his ability to manipulate magical energies disrupted. He gains spell resistance equal to 10 plus twice the highest spell level he can cast. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. In addition, anytime he casts a spell, he must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against this spell resistance. On a successful check, the spell is completed and the spellcaster's spell resistance is removed until the start of his next turn. Failure indicates he failed to muster up enough magical energy to cast the spell, but the spell is not lost and may be attempted again. Any feats or abilities that aid in bypassing spell resistance help with this check.",
			"",
			"[Restoration](spell/restoration) suppresses the negated spellblight for one day.",
			"",
			"**Obsessive Fixation:** A spellcaster with an obsessive fixation develops a tendency toward repetition. This manifests itself differently depending on whether the spellcaster prepares spells, is a spontaneous caster, or uses spell-like abilities. When preparing spells, an afflicted spellcaster must attempt to prepare as many duplicate spells as she can, meaning she prepares two copies of each spell she picks, but cannot exceed her normal number of spell slots to do so. This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect. If the spellcaster is a spontaneous caster or uses spell-like abilities, when that spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must cast that spell again on her next turn, or becomes dazed for 1 round at the end of her turn. Once she casts two copies of the same spell in a row or becomes dazed, the obsessive fixation resets, and she can cast any spell she knows, starting the cycle again.",
			"",
			"Obsessive fixation can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"**Phase Blight:** A spellcaster afflicted with spellblight fades in and out of existence. Each time she casts a spell, she phases in and out of reality for 1 round per level of the spell cast. While phasing, any physical attacks made against the spellcaster have a 50% miss chance, any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail to affect the caster, and the spellcaster takes only half damage from area attacks. In addition, while actively phasing, all of a spellcaster's physical attacks have a 50% miss chance, all of the caster's spells that target creatures have a 50% chance of affecting the target, and all of the caster's area attacks do 50% of their normal damage. Unlike when casting the [blink](spell/blink) spell, the spellcaster does not become ethereal; she blinks in and out of reality altogether.",
			"",
			"Effects that block planar travel, like [dimensional anchor](spell/dimensional_anchor), stabilize a phasing creature for the duration of the effect.",
			"",
			"**Spell Burn:** Each time a spellcaster afflicted with this spellblight casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin feels like it burns, as if she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level cast), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she is staggered for a round. While the caster is staggered by this spellblight, any spell with the fire descriptor that she casts has its saving throw DC increased by 1.",
			"",
			"The burning sensation is a figment of the caster's imagination. Spellcasters that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight, and don't gain the beneficial effect when casting spells with the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Spell Sap:** A spellcaster with spell sap is subject to blackouts when casting spells. She may become mentally locked, distant, or catatonic, or may even slip into unconsciousness. Each time the afflicted spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14 + caster level) or become dazed until the end of her next turn. If she fails the save by 10 or more, she instead falls prone and lapses into unconsciousness for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"Spell sap can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.",
			"",
			"**Transference Block:** A spellcaster with transference block has difficulty targeting allies with spell effects. Anytime she casts a spell on an ally, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell's level) or the spell is lost.",
			"",
			"Transference block can be cured by spending 1 hour in an [antimagic field](spell/antimagic_field).",
			"",
			"**Vertigo:** A spellcaster with vertigo becomes dizzy and lightheaded when she casts a spell. Each time she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, the world spins and shifts around her. She must succeed at a concentration check (with a DC equal to the 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast). If the spellcaster fails the check, she falls prone, and for 1d4 rounds takes a penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim checks equal to 1 + the level of the spell. While the afflicted spellcaster takes those penalties, she must also succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check in order to stand up from prone.",

If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the blinded condition.",
			"",
			"**Confused:** While confused (either temporarily, or permanently by way of an [insanity](spell/insanity) spell or effect), a spellcaster can tap into that confusion during periods of lucidity.

If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the deafened condition.",

Once per day, while disabled due to damage taken, a spellcaster can choose to treat a single conjuration (healing) spell she casts on herself as having a caster level two levels higher than her actual caster level. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.",
			"",
			"**Grappled:** While being grappled, a spellcaster can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a touch attack spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the attack roll against the creature grappling her.",

			"**Nauseated:** A nauseated spellcaster can use some of the energy of a conjuration (healing) spell to try to counteract the nauseated condition. When a nauseated spellcaster casts a conjuration (healing) spell, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell.

When she does so, the spell DC of that spell is increased by 1. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.",

When reaching for knowledge and forces from other planes, a spellcaster must have control over the strengths and weaknesses of their targets, or face doom far worse than any that might be visited upon them in the Material Plane. A spellcaster wishing to bind such creatures who cannot play to the desires of his summoned captive will surely lose control, and may find himself torn from his reality as a plaything of the multiverse's cruelest tormentors."

			"The arcane method for binding outsiders is more difficult. First, a binder must create a trap, a [magic circle](spell/magic_circle) focused inward. Typically the circle is outlined in a substance that is anathema to the outsider he wishes to summon. He must protect this circle against any sort of disruption, for even the smallest variation in its energies opens the circle and allows the escape of the creature he has summoned. It is for this reason that most binders' lairs are in high towers or deep dungeons, far from wind or pests.",
			"",
			"When an arcane caster speaks the words of the [planar binding](spell/planar_binding) spell, the outsider can resist via a Will saving throw, with no aid from its spell resistance. If it fails the save, the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle) draws it inexorably into the trap. Once there, the outsider can pit its spell resistance as a check against the caster's level, attempt to flee via dimensional travel, or attempt to overcome the spell by imposing its spiritual presence with a Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier). Succeeding at any of these checks breaks the binding, and a fortunate binder suffers no additional harm from such a breach; the annoyed outsider just leaves. This is not always the case, however.",
			"",
			"Some outsiders lash out at their failed binders. Because of this, many binders take additional precautions: a second [magic circle](spell/magic_circle) in which they can stand, and [dimensional anchor](spell/dimensional_anchor) cast within the [magic circle](spell/magic_circle) to prevent the conjured outsider from fleeing instantly. A tremendously powerful wizard or sorcerer might even use [trap the soul](spell/trap_the_soul) on his victim, forcing it into a prepared vessel until it agrees to the binder's strictures.",
			"",
			"Smart arcane binders often make deals with the creatures they call. Like clerics using [planar ally](spell/planar_ally), they bargain and shower the outsider with gifts in exchange for their services. While it is always good for an arcane spellcaster to make these deals from a position of strength, it is much better to get the outsider to come to mutually agreed upon terms for the service, rather than forcing it to commit actions against its nature or desires."

			"There is one method of outsider coercion that helps guarantee that a binder can bargain from a position of relative security. Many spellcasters believe that a true name is inscribed on the essence of every creature, a secret word that describes it so perfectly and utterly that to speak the name is to define the being. For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders' true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated. It is said that some outsiders have assumed names and that they use the aliases to lure foolish mortals into using for summoning; the outsider pretends to be under the control of the binder, but merely bides its time before it strikes.",

			"To discover a single outsider's true name, a spellcaster must spend at least a month in a library or on a quest of discovery to uncover occult mysteries and riddles hidden in the pages of books, scrolls, and glyphs written millennia ago, buried in ancient temples or found among the ravings of madmen's spellbooks. At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature's Hit Dice. The GM can increase the DC by +2, +5, or even +10, based on the power of the outsider or the circumstances of the true name search. A failure by 5 or more turns up false information that may expose researchers to unexpected dangers.",

In summoning, if the name is spoken correctly (requiring knowledge of at least one of the outsider's languages, or a Linguistics skill check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature's Hit Dice), the target takes a -5 penalty on the Will save to resist being conjured, and if its name is inscribed in the protective [magic circle](spell/magic_circle), the outsider takes a -5 penalty on all checks to escape or breach that circle.",

However, if the caster speaks the true name of the elemental, the elemental will most likely be intrigued enough to listen-a wizard with power and cunning enough to find an elemental's true name is a wizard with guile and strength, and elementals treasure these qualities.",

Each elemental type is uniquely suited to adapting to conditions on its particular plane, and is arrogant about its powers when surrounded by its element... and uniquely frightened and cowed when shown a greater power or encased in an element not its own. Most elementals do not bargain for favors-they respect only strength. Genies are the more human-like denizens of the elemental planes, both in shape and mentality.

Efreet also appreciate attractive humanoid slaves, which give a +1 bonus on the binder's Charisma check for every 10 slaves offered.",
			"",
			"**Fire Elementals:** When summoning a fire elemental, enclose the casting chamber with stone, remove flammable materials from the room, and prepare a magic circle and spells to protect against fire. Keeping large blocks of ice in the room saps the elemental's power and cows it into submission more quickly, giving the caster a +4 bonus on the Charisma check to trap the elemental.",

Using air spells and petrification spells as punishments for noncompliance usually makes these elementals more willing to take direction and enter into negotiations for appropriate gifts for services rendered.",

Those wishing to bind a thoqqua frequently use mephit intermediaries, as those creatures seem to understand thoqquas enough to calm them.",

			"**Water Elemental:** When summoning a water elemental, remove sources of water from the room and prepare a bonfire. A ring of fire around the magic circle exposes the elemental to its hated enemy the instant it appears on the Material Plane, distracting it long enough for the binder to seize control. This is an opposed Will check, granting a +1 bonus to the caster for each large fire in the room; success grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check."

Each construct has a purchase price and a crafting cost, along with a list of requirements and the skills used to create them. Some require special materials in addition to the cost for basic crafting supplies, generally for the construct's body. Special material costs increase both the purchase price and the crafting cost of the construct. The DC to craft a construct is 5 + the default caster level of the construct, just like for a magic item. Like when crafting magic items, a creator with a sufficiently high skill bonus may ignore these requirements. Each missing requirement increases the Craft DC by 5. Regardless, the creator must meet all item creation feats and minimum caster level requirements. Crafting a construct takes 1 day per 1,000 gp in the item's base price, excluding any special material costs.

			"This section provides guidelines for those seeking to calculate the costs of crafting their own constructs. As a rough guideline, a construct's price is equal to its challenge rating squared, then multiplied by 500 gp. Constructs with a fractional CR rating base their price on that fraction of 500 gp. For example, a CR 1/2 construct has a price of 250 gp. The cost of magical supplies for the [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat is half this price, with the construct taking 1 day to create per 1,000 gp of the construct's base price. Some constructs, particularly golems, have additional raw material costs that must be paid in full, regardless of whether the creator possesses the [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) feat. Raw materials typically cost somewhere between 5% and 10% of the construct's base price.",
			"",
			"Constructs with multiple special abilities cost more to create. The first special ability is included in the construct's base cost. The next two special abilities increase the calculated price by +1/2 CR per ability. Thereafter, any additional special abilities add +1 CR per ability. Examples of special abilities include having a higher DR value than a typical construct of its CR (above DR 5 for CRs 1-8, above DR 10 for CR 9+), monster statistics that exceed those recommended for the [construct's CR](rule/step_2_target_statistics), the standard golem immunity to magic, DR or hardness that can't be overcome by all adamantine weapons, ability to be fully healed by a single spell, and most special attacks and special qualities.",
			"",
			"Particularly powerful special abilities, such as an iron golem's exceptionally high attack bonus, count as two lesser abilities. Animated objects are a special case- their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points (see the [Animated Object monster entry](monster/animated_object_monster_entry)), since these abilities are already factored into an animated object's CR. In addition, golems and homunculi created with extra Hit Dice, the advanced template, or shield guardian abilities should all be priced as described in the Bestiary, rather than by adjusting pricing for their new CR.",
			"",
			"Abilities that weaken or potentially place a construct at a disadvantage rarely reduce the construct's price. An exception is the berserk ability. Constructs that have a chance of going berserk receive -1 CR adjustment to their calculated price if control can be reestablished (like a flesh golem) or -2 CR adjustment for permanent loss of control (like a clay golem).",
			"",
			"The following is an example of the calculated costs for creating a stone golem (CR 11). A stone golem's special abilities are golem immunity to magic, full healing from [transmute mud to rock](spell/transmute_mud_to_rock), a high to-hit bonus (+22 vs. the +19 typical for CR 11), and the ability to slow its foes. Further, since its spell vulnerabilities are not tied to common spells or effects, its immunity to magic cost is doubled, giving the stone golem a total of 5 special abilities. The first special ability doesn't affect the cost, the next two increase the cost by +1/2 CR each, and the final two each increase the cost by +1 CR individually, making its effective CR for pricing equal to 14. This produces a calculated price of 98,000 gp, rounded up to an even 100,000 gp.",
			"",
			"When designing a new construct, keep in mind that the above pricing formula only serves as a guideline. As with magic items, construct pricing remains more art than science, and like magic items, compare new constructs to existing ones for guidance.

You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after [burning hands](spell/burning_hands), except dealing sonic damage instead of fire-perhaps you'd call it sonic screech. However, there's a reason there aren't as many sonic spells in the game: \"sonic\" as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before \"sonic\" was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, sonic screech will almost always be a better spell than [burning hands](spell/burning_hands). That means if you introduce sonic screech into your game, you'll see savvy players selecting it instead of burning hands. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it's better than the other available choices-and if it's so good that it's obviously the best spell choice, it's probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this."

			"The game rules for what a caster must do to create a new spell are very vague (see [Independent Research from the Core Rulebook](unknown/independent_research_from_the_core_rulebook)). This is because, like the details of creating magic items, the nitty-gritty of what the caster is doing for this research isn't important for the progress of the campaign. Just as it's not necessary to know whether a wizard is using squid ink or ink from a rare plant when crafting a [scroll of burning hands](spell/scroll_of_burning_hands), it's not necessary to know whether he's modifying gestures described in Irulark's Incunabulum or altering the pronunciation of words detailed in Murlost's Great Grimoire to create a new 1st-level attack spell. While it's fine to include these elements for flavor, particularly in a high-narrative campaign, they don't affect the outcome of the item crafting or spell research, both of which largely take place outside of game time. Therefore, this chapter is about the game mechanics of a player or GM designing a new spell, not the in-world requirements of a character researching a new spell."

Technically, a spell that only affects the caster (with a range of \"personal\" and target of \"you\") is slightly weaker than one with a target of \"one creature,\" because being able to cast the spell on anyone makes it more versatile and thus more powerful. However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell \"caster-only\" should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they've always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.",
			"",
			"**Example:** [Shield](spell/shield) and [true strike](spell/true_strike) are both 1st-level spells that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells on others, they'd still be at the right power level for 1st-level spells-they aren't 2nd-level spells that you knocked down a level because you designed them as caster-only. [Shield](spell/shield) has always been a spell that only affects the caster, and there's a game-balance reason to keep it that way: because [shield](spell/shield) grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee character means the fighter could drop his actual shield and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra damage. [True strike](spell/true_strike) was deliberately designed as a caster-only spell so a sorcerer couldn't just cast it every round on the fighter, who'd be guaranteed a hit against a difficult monster even if he used [Combat Expertise](feat/combat_expertise) (for extra AC) and [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) (for extra damage). Making those spells caster-only doesn't really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.",
			"",
			"A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like [fireball](spell/fireball)), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like [slow](spell/slow)). A burst effect like [fireball](spell/fireball) can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your- targets spell like [slow](spell/slow), but you never risk hitting your friends when you use [slow](spell/slow). Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many)."

[Magic missile](spell/magic_missile) can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. [Burning hands](spell/burning_hands) initially looks like it doesn't obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.",

Thus, [searing light](spell/searing_light) is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell.

Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat, and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster-even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.",

Even outdoors, a spell with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by 30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat-longer than many tables used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in abstract situations like launching a [fireball](spell/fireball) at enemies across a large prairie, using [dimension door](spell/dimension_door) to return to an earlier (and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.",
			"",
			"Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for most purposes. Given that the [Enlarge Spell](feat/enlarge_spell) feat doubles a spell's range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the [Reach Spell](feat/reach_spell) feat increases the range by one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it's reasonable to balance a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell that works like [cure light wounds](spell/cure_light_wounds) (normally 1st level) at close range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell."

In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect.

Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes them completely immune to any effect that allows spell resistance.

Making combat spells with faster casting times devalues the [Quicken Spell](feat/quicken_spell) feat; even if you design the spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4 level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that feat, and your spell would become a common combo for high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level.

If casters decide they'd rather prepare a silent [magic missile](spell/magic_missile) instead of [acid arrow](spell/acid_arrow), or a silent [acid arrow](spell/acid_arrow) instead of [fireball](spell/fireball), they've deliberately chosen weaker options, and that's fine.",
			"",
			"The advantage of spells that don't require somatic components is they can be cast when bound, grappled, or when both hands are full or occupied, and arcane spell failure doesn't apply. Just as creating silent versions of spells devalues [Silent Spell](feat/silent_spell), making non-somatic spells devalues the [Still Spell](feat/still_spell) feat. The premise of the game is that most spells require words and gestures, and new spells should stick with that unless the theme of the spell suggests it wouldn't require a somatic component, or it was specifically designed to escape bindings or grapples.",
			"",
			"The advantage of spells that don't require material components is they don't require a spell component pouch (and in the rare circumstance in which if you're grappled, you needn't already have your material components in hand to cast the spell). Most material components are part of a spell for flavor rather than to satisfy rules. The guano and sulfur material components of [fireball](spell/fireball) are there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material components of [lightning bolt](spell/lightning_bolt) come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the \"it has whatever I need\" spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat)-they're just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.",
			"",
			"Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as [stoneskin](spell/stoneskin)), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as [augury](spell/augury), [divination](spell/divination), and [commune](spell/commune)), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) and [restoration](spell/restoration)). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like [augury](spell/augury), as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it's free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as [glyph of warding](spell/glyph_of_warding) also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving [glyph of warding](spell/glyph_of_warding) a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring-otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).",
			"",
			"Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components-in most cases they're just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it's a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once they've crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it's essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component."

Remember that players are going to refer to the spell description in a hurry during their turn of combat, and if they have to fight their way through flowery language to figure out the details, the resulting delay will annoy other players and the GM. If the spell has several complex effects, put each effect into its own paragraph. If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see [binding](spell/binding) for an example).",
			"",
			"Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn't need to appear again in the spell description-it's redundant. For example, the [fireball](spell/fireball) description doesn't say, \"The spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.\" Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player to sift through when looking up the spell's effects in the middle of combat.",
			"",
			"Avoid using language that implies something that the game mechanics of the spell don't back up. For example, a spell's description shouldn't say \"using the foul powers of necromancy\" if the spell doesn't actually have some sort of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as [astral projection](spell/astral_projection), [gentle repose](spell/gentle_repose), and [undeath to death](spell/undeath_to_death)). People who read your spell description may not know your intent, and using flavorful language can trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.",

			"Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a particular character or class in mind, most spells are going to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form-you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.",

			"",
			"When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets affected, and so on) are equal.",
			"",
			"**Control:** A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it's completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are [charm monster](spell/charm_monster), [charm person](spell/charm_person), [confusion](spell/confusion), [dominate monster](spell/dominate_monster), and [dominate person](spell/dominate_person).",
			"",
			"**Kill:** A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target's depletable statistics, typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don't wear off and there's no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic)). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are [disintegrate](spell/disintegrate), [finger of death](spell/finger_of_death), [phantasmal killer](spell/phantasmal_killer), [power word kill](spell/power_word_kill), [slay living](spell/slay_living), and [wail of the banshee](spell/wail_of_the_banshee).",
			"",
			"**Incapacitate:** An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target's condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target's depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are [fear](spell/fear), [flesh to stone](spell/flesh_to_stone), [hold monster](spell/hold_monster), [hold person](spell/hold_person), [power word stun](spell/power_word_stun), and [sleep](spell/sleep).",
			"",
			"**Damage:** A damage spell reduces the target's depletable statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster's fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they'll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it's possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are [cone of cold](spell/cone_of_cold), [fireball](spell/fireball), [lightning bolt](spell/lightning_bolt), [magic missile](spell/magic_missile), [poison](spell/poison), and [sound burst](spell/sound_burst).",
			"",
			"**Penalize:** A penalize spell gives the target some penalty not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can't kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don't stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are [bane](spell/bane), [blindness/deafness](spell/blindness_deafness), [ray of enfeeblement](spell/ray_of_enfeeblement), and [slow](spell/slow).",
			"",
			"There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster's allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster's allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than [speak with dead](spell/speak_with_dead)).",
			"",
			"Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results-a [confusion](spell/confusion) spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it's a control spell. Likewise, a [summon monster](spell/summon_monster) spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it's just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage."

			"Depletable statistics are any values in a creature or object's stat block that can be reduced by some form of attack and that can neutralize, kill, or destroy the creature or object when they reach a low value (typically 0). Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics-a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target's depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target.",
			"",
			"However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a spell that gives a target a -10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting fireball, as would a spell that gave her a -10 penalty on her Will saving throws; despite her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are -10 or -100. Similarly, a fighter with a -10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a -10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties.",
			"",
			"\"Depletable statistic\" isn't an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells-attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties."

			"**Acid:** Acid effects deal damage with chemical reactions rather than cold, electricity, heat, or vibration. This descriptor includes both actual acids and their chemical opposites, called bases or alkalines (such as ammonia and lye).",
			"",
			"**Air:** Spells that create air, manipulate air, or conjure creatures from air-dominant planes or with the air subtype should have the air descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Chaotic:** Spells that draw upon the power of true chaos or conjure creatures from chaos-aligned planes or with the chaotic subtype should have the chaos descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Cold:** Cold effects deal damage by making the target colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled matter or energy. Cold effects also include those that create ice, sleet, or snow out of nothing. They can cause frostbite, numbness, coordination problems, slowed movement and reactions, stupor, and death.",
			"",
			"**Curse:** Curses are often permanent effects, and usually cannot be dispelled, but can be removed with a [break enchantment](spell/break_enchantment), [limited wish](spell/limited_wish), [miracle](spell/miracle), [remove curse](spell/remove_curse), or [wish](spell/wish).",
			"",
			"**Darkness:** Spells that create darkness or reduce the amount of light should have the darkness descriptor. Giving a spell the darkness descriptor indicates whether a spell like daylight is high enough level to counter or dispel it.",
			"",
			"**Death:** Spells with the death descriptor directly attack a creature's life force to cause immediate death, or to draw on the power of a dead or dying creature. The [death ward](spell/death_ward) spell protects against death effects, and some creature types are immune to death effects.",
			"",
			"**Disease:** Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of disease spells.",
			"",
			"**Earth:** Spells that manipulate earth or conjure creatures from earth-dominant planes or with the earth subtype should have the earth descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Electricity:** Electricity effects involve the presence and flow of electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.",
			"",
			"**Emotion:** Spells with this descriptor create emotions or manipulate the target's existing emotions. Most emotion spells are enchantments, except for fear spells, which are usually necromancy.",
			"",
			"**Evil:** Spells that draw upon evil powers or conjure creatures from evil-aligned planes or with the evil subtype should have the evil descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Fear:** Spells with the fear descriptor create, enhance, or manipulate fear. Most fear spells are necromancy spells, though some are enchantment spells.",
			"",
			"**Fire:** Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire, directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava, steam, and boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Force:** Spells with the force descriptor create or manipulate magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal creatures normally (as if they were corporeal creatures).",
			"",
			"**Good:** Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness or conjure creatures from good-aligned planes or with the good subtype should have the good descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Language-Dependent:** A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or hear what the caster of a language-dependent spell says, the spell has no effect, even if the target fails its saving throw.",
			"",
			"**Lawful:** Spells that draw upon the power of true law or conjure creatures from law-aligned planes or with the lawful subtype should have the law descriptor.",
			"",
			"**Light:** Spells that create significant amounts of light or attack darkness effects should have the light descriptor. Giving a spell the light descriptor indicates whether a spell like darkness is high enough level counter or dispel it.",
			"",
			"**Mind-Affecting:** Mindless creatures (those with an Intelligence score of ---) and undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Pain:** Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to pain effects.",
			"",
			"**Poison:** Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).",
			"",
			"**Shadow:** Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the Shadow Plane, or allow transport to or from that plane.",
			"",
			"**Sonic:** Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.",
			"",
			"**Water:** Spells that manipulate water or conjure creatures from water-dominant planes or with the water subtype should have the water descriptor."

			"The process of building technological items has much in common with magic item creation, though it uses different feats, skills, and facilities. As with magic items, the creator invests time and money in the creation process and at the end attempts a single skill check to complete construction. Since technological items do not have caster levels, the DC of this check is defined in the description of each technological item. Failing this check means that the item does not function and the materials are wasted. Failing this check by 5 or more may result in a catastrophic failure, such as electrocution or an explosion, at the GM's discretion.",
			"",
			"Unlike magic items, which often require spells as prerequisites for construction, high-tech items require a specialized laboratory with the necessary tools for fabrication. Using a crafting lab to build a high-tech item consumes an amount of power each day. Days when the crafting lab is without power effectively delay continued construction of a high-tech item, but time already spent building the item is not lost. In addition, crafting an item requires an expenditure of time (from a character with the appropriate crafting feat) and an expenditure of money used to secure the technological components and expendable resources needed for the work.",
			"",
			"Creating a technological item requires 8 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item's base price (or fraction thereof). The creator must spend the gold at the beginning of the construction process. The process can be accelerated to 4 hours of work per 1,000 gp by increasing the DC to create the item by 5. When determining the required time, ignore any fixed costs such as the weapon portion of implanted weaponry.",
			"",
			"The creator can work for a maximum of 8 hours per day, even if she doesn't require sleep or rest. These days need not be consecutive. Ideally, the creator can work for at least 4 hours at a time uninterrupted, but if this is not possible (such as while adventuring), the creator can devote 4 hours of work broken up over the day, accomplishing a net of 2 hours of progress. Work under distracting or dangerous conditions nets only half the progress as well. If the creator can't dedicate at least 4 hours of work during a day (even if broken up or under distracting conditions), any work performed that day is wasted.",

In theory, a magic item creator could even infuse a technological item with magical intelligence. To create a magical high-tech item like this, one must first secure the high-tech item itself, either via purchase, discovery, or crafting. All high-tech weapons and armor are considered masterwork for the purposes of adding magical enhancements to them (though they do not gain the other typical benefits for masterwork items). At the GM's discretion, some magical special abilities might simply not be appropriate for application to certain technological items. When a character crafts an existing technological item into a magic item in this manner, he does not need to meet the base item's crafting requirements-a wizard with [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feat/craft_magic_arms_and_armor) can create a +1 arc pistol from a normal [arc pistol](tech/weapon/arc_pistol) without having [Craft Technological Arms and Armor](feat/craft_technological_arms_and_armor) and without having access to a [military laboratory](rule/crafting_laboritories). In a situation where a character wishes to craft the entire item from scratch, the nonmagical technological item must be fully crafted and completed before work on magically enhancing it can begin."

A new item may resemble an existing magic item, such as how [jet packs](tech/misc/jet_pack) function like [winged boots](magic/wondrous/winged_boots), but there should be differences beyond just battery power to keep technology distinct. When pricing a new technological item, use the [existing guidelines](rule/magic_item_gold_piece_values) for estimating magic item value. There's no extra cost associated with technological items since they have extra weaknesses to go along with their advantages. Items that use charges should be priced as if they were use-activated, not as if they were charged in the way a wand or ring of the ram is charged, unless the item is disposable and has 50 or fewer charges, as the assumption is that a newly crafted technological item can be recharged with relative ease."

			"To set a technological campaign apart from a standard fantasy adventure, you need a variety of unusual futuristic items. But be it a laser gun in the hands of a terrible enemy or a set of strange gravity armor found in the treasure trove of an oddly uniform metal dungeon, technology from the future (or even the present-day real world) in a fantasy setting should be handled in a manner similar to magic items elsewhere in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.",
			"",
			"Many technological items replicate specific spells or magical effects. However, they do not use magic in any way, and thus function normally in areas of antimagic or primal magic, and are otherwise unaffected by any effects that target or affect magic items.",
			"",
			"This section collects dozens of new items in the following categories.",
			"",
			"**Weapons:** The majority of technological weapons are ranged weapons, although some high-tech melee weapons can be found in dungeons as well.",
			"",
			"**Armor:** Technological armor works in a similar manner to standard armor, but often requires a power source to fully function.",
			"",
			"**Pharmaceuticals:** Pharmaceuticals include drugs, poisons, and medicines. They can be ingested or injected, and generally have relatively minor or temporary effects.",
			"",
			"**Cybertech:** Cybertech is a form of technology that must be implanted in a body before it can function. Cybertech typically augments a character's abilities and statistics.",
			"",
			"**Technological Gear:** This catchall category includes a wide range of devices, from relatively minor gizmos like zipsticks to technological wonders like clonepods.",
			"",
			"### Color Code",
			"",
			"Many technological items follow a color code that organizes similar items (such as nanite hypoguns, force fields, or gravity clips) according to their overall power. The power level for each color is listed below. Note that there are nine colors in the scale-the effects of an item of any individual color should roughly correspond to the power level of a spell of the associated level. Seven of these colors are associated with the seven skymetals. The least of the colors, brown, is associated with base ores, while the greatest of the colors, prismatic, is associated with all of the skymetals. In some technological items, actual skymetals of the appropriate color are used in the creation of the object, but in most, synthetic plastics and metals are used in place of the more valuable skymetals.",
			"",
			"*Brown:* Roughly equivalent to a 1st-level spell. This color is not associated with skymetal.",

			"",
			"### Power Sources",
			"",
			"Most of the technological wonders presented here require energy to function. These items each have a capacity score, which indicates the maximum number of charges the item can store at any one time. The number of charges an item consumes when it is used varies from item to item. An item's capacity can be filled from any power source-like a battery or a generator-as a standard action. When an item is charged, it always takes as many charges from the attached power source as it can hold, filling as close to its capacity as possible. Note that charging an item from a generator is more efficient, as any charges drained from a battery in excess of the number of charges an item can store are lost.",

			"### Timeworn Technology",
			"",
			"The equipment presented in this section is described in full working condition and priced as such. While a high-technology setting may have many fully functional technological devices in it, that isn't the case in the campaign setting. Equipment that has been damaged or degraded over time works less consistently and is worth less money than new technological items. Such equipment is called [\"timeworn.\"](rule/timeworn_technology)"

			"The technology found in the hands of Numeria's denizens isn't usually pristine. Between languishing in forgotten ruins open to the elements, being used by those ignorant of the nature of this technology, and having no one skilled at building, maintaining, or repairing such devices, most technological items are \"timeworn\"-damaged and malfunctioning (when not completely nonfunctional). These malfunctions manifest in two ways: limited charges and glitches.",
			"",
			"Only technological items that consume charges (including nanite canisters) or are pharmaceutical items can be affected by these timeworn rules, though any technological item can still become broken or nonfunctional just as any other item.",
			"",
			"A piece of timeworn technology may have additional aesthetic and functional differences from a new piece of the same equipment. Many of these effects are purely cosmetic, such as cracks in the casing of an arc grenade or primitive etchings on a suit of technological armor placed there by a barbarian millennia ago. Pieces of timeworn technology may also have minor mechanical effects beyond glitches (at the GM's discretion). A timeworn laser pistol might constantly hum at a low but noticeable frequency, imparting a -1 penalty on Stealth checks. A timeworn plasma grenade could be caked in a strange viscous fluid that has a pungent odor, making its wielder more easily tracked via scent. Timeworn technological items should clearly evoke a sense of age and danger, and even the most standard piece of Androffan gear can be made unique based on individual deteriorations.",
			"",
			"Note that not every technological item in Numeria is timeworn, but most technology that PCs encounter outside of the deepest and most remote of Numerian ruins will be (though the Technic League jealously guards a significant number of pristine technological artifacts). These items function as presented in the previous chapter, can be recharged, and do not suffer glitches.",
			"",
			"A timeworn technological item that is still somewhat functioning is worth half of its normal listed price, though one drained of its charges is worth 1% of its normal value, as a curiosity to collectors. Timeworn technology also has the following properties.",
			"",
			"**Non-Rechargable:** Timeworn technological items can't be recharged. When a timeworn technological item is properly identified or first used, roll randomly to determine how many charges it has left before it becomes useless.",
			"",
			"**Glitches:** Timeworn technology sometimes doesn't work the way it was originally intended to. When an item glitches, its effect is hampered or enhanced, as determined by a d% roll. See the inside front cover for a complete list of glitch effects for armor, weapons, pharmaceuticals, and other technological equipment. Not all glitches are catastrophic; they represent unpredictable effects, for good and ill.",
			"",
			"When a timeworn technological item is first used after a month or more of inactivity, there's a 50% chance that it will glitch. Additionally, when using an item in a way that would drain its last charge, there's a 50% chance it will glitch. If an item requires a d20 roll (such as a skill check or an attack roll) to activate or use, it has a 50% chance to glitch on a natural 1."

The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. Each increment up to an equal length beyond that radius degrades the radiation strength by one level. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation 21 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation from 41 to 60 feet.",
			"",
			"**Initial Effect:** Radiation initially deals Constitution drain unless the affected character succeeds at a Fortitude save. A new saving throw must be attempted to resist radiation's initial damage each round a victim remains exposed to it.",

This secondary effect ends only after a character succeeds at two consecutive Fortitude saving throws to resist secondary radiation damage. If a character has Strength damage equal to his current Strength score, further damage dealt by a secondary effect is instead Constitution damage.",

The same energies that can be shaped to create explosive fireballs, raise the dead, divine the future, heal the sick, and summon demons can do that and more without the direction of skilled spellcasters. Normally, this unfocused magical potential does not exist in reality; it lies beyond reality, where it waits to be tapped. Where exactly magic comes from remains a lively debate today, but when magic is unleashed without any attempt to focus it-when it leaks into the world in its raw form-the result is known as primal magic.",
			"",
			"In some realms, particularly in planes like the Maelstrom or the Abyss in the Great Beyond, magic is left to indulge in its raw chaos as it wishes-here, primal magic is often called \"wild magic.\" On the Material Plane, the world feels the touch of primal magic when the laws of reality themselves have been damaged. Here, magic flows in unpredictable tides and currents. At one moment, a region might function normally while at another, magic won't function at all. Usually, though, primal magic holds sway.",

			"Manifestations of primal magic tend to build up potential before they explode into existence. Just as a thunderstorm doesn't constantly lance the ground below with a constant beam of lightning, these bolts manifest periodically and almost randomly. And just as lightning can be called with lightning rods, primal magic can be purposefully or accidentally drawn out by utilizing magic in areas where such energies are building.",

			"When primal magic manifests, roll on the sample Primal Magic Events table to determine what occurs. As the primal magic exerts its power, consider crossing off the effect that occurs and designing replacement events and effects. If you want primal magic to play a big role in your campaign, you should try to ensure that no two effects are ever quite the same. One easy way to achieve this is to simply substitute random spell effects with unusual descriptions in place of normal ones, such as a black fireball that smells of roses and deals acid damage.",

			"Spontaneous primal magic effects can occur as often or as infrequently as you wish, but as a general rule, try to limit the effects to one per combat encounter at most. The majority of primal magic effects should instead occur when creatures activate magic items, use spell-like abilities, or cast spells in such an area (simply carrying a magic item or gaining the benefits of a constant-use item or spell effect isn't enough-it's the actual act of activation or casting that triggers primal magic). When a creature activates a magic item, casts a spell, or uses a spell-like ability in an area infused with primal magic, there's a 50% chance that the spell effect is replaced by a primal magic effect. A spellcaster casting a spell, using a spell-like ability, or activating a spell completion or spell trigger magic item can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect.

When an event occurs naturally, you can roll 1d20 to determine the CR. Of course, you should strongly consider lowering primal magic event CRs to match or at least closely approximate the average party level of your PCs.

In most of these instances, the primal magic subsides as reality repairs itself, though it might take a matter of weeks, years, or even centuries. In the cases of extreme abuse, an area's magical cohesiveness might never recover, resulting in areas of permanent primal magic. In general, the location of existing areas of primal magic and the creation of new areas is left up to the GM, but should always be the result of magic of extraordinary force or of an arcane catastrophe of epic proportions.

			"### The Basics",
			"",
			"The basics of the [Swim skill](skill/swim) are the same in an aquatic campaign. When a creature uses a move or full-round action to swim, it attempts a Swim check against the appropriate DC based on how calm the water is and other local factors. On a success, it can move up to one quarter of its land speed with a single move, or half its land speed with a double move. On a failure, it doesn't make any progress, and on a failure by 5 or more it goes underwater. This last part, however, doesn't make any sense if the PC is already underwater. Instead, if a PC fails her check by 5 or more while underwater (or doesn't spend any actions to swim, thus not even attempting the check), she sinks or rises based on her [buoyancy](rule/buoyancy). While swimming, a PC can't normally use the run or charge actions or take a 5-foot step. Every hour of swimming requires a successful DC 20 Swim check to avoid fatigue. Even on a success, an hour of swimming is still at least as strenuous as marching for an hour, and extensive swimming eventually requires a PC to attempt checks as per [forced marches](rule/overland_movement). Similarly, continually taking a double move to swim at half land speed counts as hustling. A creature can also walk on the ocean floor, lake bed, or other solid ground underwater as long as its buoyancy is swiftly sinking. When it does so, it moves at half its land speed without needing to attempt a Swim check.",
			"",
			"**Swim Speed:** Creatures with a swim speed have a variety of advantages underwater. First of all, they can swim through normal water at their full swim speed without needing to attempt a Swim check. They can use the run and charge actions and take 5-foot steps with their swim speed. When they do need to attempt Swim checks to deal with a hazardous situation or perform a special action, they benefit from a sizable +8 racial bonus on their Swim checks. There might be an unusual circumstance where a creature has a swim speed that's actually slower than one-quarter of its land speed (for instance, a monk using the spell [monkey fish](spell/monkey_fish) to gain a swim speed of 10 feet). Such a creature can swim at one-quarter of its land speed instead, but it sacrifices the benefits of its swim speed on rounds when it isn't using its swim speed."

		"description": [
			"When a creature fails its Swim check by 5 or more, or when it doesn't spend any actions to swim (whether voluntarily or due to paralysis or similar conditions), it either sinks or rises based on its buoyancy. There are three normal states of buoyancy: sinking, rising, and neutral. If a creature's buoyancy is sinking, it naturally sinks; if its buoyancy is rising, it naturally rises to the surface; and if its buoyancy is neutral, it hangs in place unless it expends effort. Land-dwelling creatures generally have a sinking buoyancy unless they are carrying a substantial amount of low-density gear (like wooden items, at least until they become waterlogged) and little or no high-density gear (such as items made from metal or stone). [Air tanks](equipment/air_tank) in particular make it much easier to change your buoyancy to rising. It's also possible to adjust an air tank to hold just enough air to achieve a neutral buoyancy-but once a creature has done so, if it picks up other objects or uses the tank to breathe underwater, it loses its neutral buoyancy until it readjusts (which may require returning to the surface to refill the air tank). In addition to these three normal states of buoyancy, there are two extreme states: swiftly sinking and swiftly rising. If a creature is swiftly sinking, it and its gear are so dense that it can walk on the bottom of the body of water, but it also needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to swim towards the surface or to stay off the bottom. A creature carrying plenty of dense stone or metal items gains this buoyancy state. If a creature is swiftly rising, it needs to succeed at a DC 20 Swim check to submerge itself and stay submerged; a sizable air tank or other flotation device, or the help of magic, is needed to achieve this state.",
			"",
			"**Aquatic and Water Creatures:** Most naturally aquatic creatures (those with the aquatic subtype) have some form of air bladder or other organ that allows them to adjust their buoyancy on the fly, enabling them to maintain neutral buoyancy as a free action on their turn (unless they are carrying something large with particularly high or low density), and creatures with the water subtype naturally have the same buoyancy as water.",
			"",
			"**Buoyancy Speed:** A creature begins to sink or rise at the end of its turn the first time it badly fails (or does not attempt) a Swim check, moving up or down as appropriate at a speed of 10 feet; this speed increases by 10 feet each subsequent round unless the creature is stopped, to a maximum speed of 30 feet after 3 rounds. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. While sinking or rising because of its buoyancy, creatures are considered [off-balance](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater). Once per round, a creature sinking or rising because of its buoyancy can stop its momentum by succeeding at a Swim check as a move action. A creature that chooses to continue moving in the direction of its buoyancy under its own power, rather than through uncontrolled rising or sinking, can do so with a successful Swim check without needing to stop first. If a creature's buoyancy changes instantly while sinking or rising from buoyancy (such as via jettisoning something it's holding or using magic), its buoyancy speed adjusts by 10 feet in the new direction each round. A creature that fails the DC 20 Swim check to move against its buoyancy while swiftly sinking or swiftly rising moves 30 feet in the appropriate direction immediately.",
			"",
			"**Moving Against Buoyancy:** Much like flying upwards uses up twice as much of a flying creature's movement, each square of movement swimming in the opposite direction of a creature's buoyancy costs twice as much movement as normal (see [Thinking in Three Dimensions](rule/thinking_in_three_dimensions) for more details). Creatures with a neutral buoyancy ignore this hindrance.",
			"",
			"**Drag:** Sometimes, because a PC might want to alter her buoyancy (or simply because she wants to drag a particularly large piece of treasure back home), she might swim with an item that has significant surface area, like a giant treasure chest. In these cases, her speed is reduced by half (or more, at the GM's discretion). If the object is narrower in one dimension, like a pole, she can avoid drag by turning it so the narrow side faces the direction she wants to move; however, this adjustment requires a move action, so it slows her down if she needs to turn often."

			"While flying creatures can add a third dimension to land-based combat, such creatures are an exception rather than the rule. The main challenge three-dimensional adventuring presents is representing a creature's vertical position during combat. This challenge is tougher than usual because most flying in adventures still involves encounters relatively close to the ground, rather than in the open sky, but plenty of encounters in an underwater adventure may occur in open water, nowhere near the surface or bottom. Typical solutions for flying creatures like using stackable tokens or transparent dice boxes to elevate the flying creature all depend on the main map being a consistent bottom altitude, but in an underwater fight, the combatants could just as easily move farther down. One way to avoid physically representing the third dimension is to use your imagination instead of a battlemap, but given that it's even harder to keep track of all three dimensions in your head, it becomes difficult to keep accurate relative distances that way. Another simple way to handle it is to mark a creature's depth relative to its starting depth, either on a small token you move along with the creature or directly on the battle map. This solution doesn't involve as much work as creating a complicated three-dimensional representation of the battle, but it isn't always easy to judge the relative vertical position without looking at the numbers and thinking about them. In the end, use the solution that works best for you whether that's judging distances in your head or crafting elaborate physical representations.",
			"",
			"**Flanking:** All the usual rules for flanking still apply in three dimensions, but now there are far more ways for a target to potentially be flanked. It also means a larger number of weaker creatures can gang up on a stronger creature, since there are 26 valid spaces adjacent to a given square, rather than 8.",
			"",
			"**Flexible Movement:** In a normal adventure, particularly before magical flight becomes easily accessible, it's easier to predict a character's exact path. For instance, on land, to get to a cave in the woods, the characters have to walk through the woods, and they are likely to use a forest trail that allows them to move quickly, rather than heading off into the deep foliage. Particularly in a dungeon, denizens can place traps with the expectation that characters will step in very particular places, and in all likelihood, a character will do so. However, underwater, all bets are off. If the PCs need to get to a cave in a kelp forest, they can just swim over the kelp forest until they are directly above the cave and then swim down, barely spending any time in the kelp forest at all. Even in an underwater dungeon, unless both the ceiling and walls narrow to 5 feet (which could be a giveaway that the characters are being channeled into a trap), the characters have significant more leeway in where they move, which means that dungeon denizens should set proximity traps covering a wider radius, rather than depending on a particular square. The third dimension also makes it harder to blockade or patrol a perimeter, since there are so many more ways to slip past; essentially, defenders are patrolling along the surface of a sphere instead of the perimeter of a circle."

			"One of the most immediately noticeable differences when fighting underwater is that slashing and bludgeoning attacks are made with a -2 penalty and deal half damage, making piercing weapons the best bet for an underwater adventure. If you're off-balance (see [Off-Balance and Prone Underwater](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater)), your attacks with piercing weapons also take a -2 penalty and deal half damage. [Freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) can negate these penalties entirely and has [a variety of other effects](rule/freedom_of_movement). Additionally, [Aquadynamic Focus](feat/aquadynamic_focus) can specifically assist with this situation. Creatures with a natural swim speed from the aquatic or water subtype don't take these penalties with their inherent natural attacks. For instance, a kraken's bludgeoning tentacle attacks don't take penalties, but if it took the ectoplasmatist [spiritualist](class/spiritualist) archetype and gained two slashing ectoplasmic lash attacks, those would still take the penalties. Attacks that deal bludgeoning damage by pushing water, such as a [kineticist's](class/kineticist) water blast, also take no penalty and deal full damage underwater.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Attacks:** Traditional physical ranged weapon attacks underwater are much more challenging due to the increased drag from the water compared to air. Ranged attacks normally take a -2 penalty for every 5 feet of water, in addition to the normal penalty for range increments. The exceptions are the underwater light crossbow and underwater heavy crossbow, which ignore the penalty for ranged attacks underwater but have a significantly reduced range increment underwater. Thrown attacks don't usually work underwater at all, but if you can move directly above your opponent, you can throw a properly prepared piercing weapon (one made of stone, metal, or another particularly dense material) straight down, counting on its sinking buoyancy to propel it to its target. Hypothetically, you could do the reverse with a weapon of extremely low density, but achieving such a low density while still having a shape that allows for throwing and enough mass to damage would generally require an unusual material or magical assistance. At the end of a downward-thrown object's maximum range, it continues to sink, but its trajectory is far too unpredictable to hit anything with its dangerous end.",
			"",
			"**Combat Maneuvers:** Most combat maneuvers work underwater, although you take a -2 penalty on grapple combat maneuver checks if you don't have a Swim speed (a successful damage action taken as part of a maintained grapple deals full damage, even if your unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage). Even tripping is possible underwater with [special rules](rule/off-balance_and_prone_underwater).",
			"",
			"**Cover from the Surface:** Due to water's surface tension, creatures attempting to attack through water's surface count its surface as total cover (if a creature is partially submerged, it gains proportionally less cover); this applies even to spells that require attack rolls. The exception to this rule is attacks that deal piercing damage-these can penetrate the water's surface but take a -2 penalty to do so. This is a change from the rule on cover from the water's surface in the Core Rulebook, but it allows actions like spearfishing and firing harpoons from whaling ships."

			"\"Off-balance\" is a special state (though not technically a condition) that is listed in the [Combat Adjustments Underwater table](rule/underwater_combat). A creature off-balance in the water loses its Dexterity bonus to AC, its opponents gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against it, and attacks it makes with piercing weapons are made at a -2 penalty and deal half damage. A creature typically becomes off-balance by failing a Swim check, which makes it off-balance for a round, even if it has a neutral buoyancy and doesn't sink or rise.",
			"",
			"**Tripping Underwater:** While flying creatures specifically can't be tripped, the Core Rulebook doesn't specify whether the same is true of swimming creatures. Being prone doesn't mean much for a swimming creature, so instead, a successful trip against a swimming creature forces that creature to attempt a Swim check at a DC equal to the result of the combat maneuver check to trip; failing the Swim check causes the creature to become off-balance. Many aquatic creatures can't be tripped or have a high Swim bonus and thus can always take 10, so this tactic isn't always effective, but when it is, it can make dexterous foes much easier to hit. However, being off-balance doesn't affect most of the target's attack rolls, and the target can regain its balance simply by succeeding at a Swim check to move on its next turn as normal."

			"While various spells have different effects underwater, the most fundamental hindrance to spellcasting, at least at low levels, is the fact that a creature holding its breath must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + spell level) to cast a spell at all, whether or not the spell has a verbal component. If the spell has a verbal component, expelling the air needed to incant the spell reduces the creature's remaining number of rounds of breath by 3 (which stacks with the reduction from performing a standard or full-round action; see the [Drowning section](rule/drowning_aa).), and a creature can't finish the spell if it doesn't have enough breath left. Spells that have verbal components and casting times of swift or immediate actions instead decrease the caster's remaining number of rounds of breath by 1. Mundane spell components generally work fine underwater as long as they're stored in watertight containers, and aquatic-appropriate substitutions exist for any mundane component that would be inherently impossible to use underwater. The Core Rulebook describes the effect of fire spells underwater; some other spells exist that function differently.",

			"**Acid Spells:** Conjuration (creation) spells that conjure nonmagical acid, like [acid arrow](spell/acid_arrow), don't work properly underwater, as the water dilutes the acid harmlessly.

Other spells that create weather that would be appropriate only on land, like [ice storm](spell/ice_storm) and [sleet storm](spell/sleet_storm), do not function underwater at all. [Twilight haze](spell/twilight_haze), however, is an illusion and thus works underwater.",
			"",
			"**Cold Spells:** Spells that deal cold damage but don't normally conjure ice, like [cone of cold](spell/cone_of_cold), instead deal half cold damage and half piercing damage, as the cold creates jagged ice shards underwater. This has no effect on spells that already create ice, rather than just cold damage.",
			"",
			"**Electricity Spells:** While normal electricity, such as that from a natural thunderstorm, tends to disperse in all directions underwater, magical electricity spells hold their integrity enough to have normal effects underwater, with one exception: visible and audible lightning bolts and sparks are the result of combusted air, and they don't happen underwater. Because of this, creatures that fail to identify an electricity spell that requires a ranged touch attack are flat-footed against the first such ranged touch attack during a fight, as they don't realize they need to dodge the invisible projectile (unless they otherwise have reason to expect it, like a spellcaster who can cast such spells). This doesn't apply to melee touch spells like [shocking grasp](spell/shocking_grasp), since the creature can still see the spellcaster's hand moving towards it.",
			"",
			"**Fire Spells:** While normal fire (including alchemist's fire) and most supernatural fire can't burn underwater at all, fire spells have a chance to transform into steam instead. Whenever you cast a fire spell underwater, you must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 20 + the spell's level) in order to channel the heat into the water and create steam, dealing the same amount of fire damage as normal but without secondary effects of fire, like igniting combustibles. A fire spell must be either entirely steam or entirely fire, which means that if it covers an area that would normally extend beyond the water's surface, you must choose whether to affect the region above the water or below, and the surface blocks line of effect for the rest of the spell. A spell or spell-like ability with the fire descriptor that already creates steam (like a [kineticist's](class/kineticist) steam blast) doesn't require the caster level check to create steam; only spells that would normally create an actual fire require the check. The [Steam Spell](spell/steam_spell) metamagic feat makes it easier to cast fire spells underwater.",
			"",
			"**Invisibility:** Underwater, an invisible creature still displaces water, making it possible to spot and target it as if it had only concealment, as per the description of [invisibility](spell/invisibility). The [invisibility bubble](spell/invisibility_bubble) spells hide the displaced water and thus allow effective invisibility underwater.",
			"",
			"**Sonic Spells:** While sound travels four times faster and farther in water than air, it also takes more energy to do so, so in the end sonic spells have the same results underwater as they do on land. At the GM's discretion, a spellcaster can choose to instead double the range or area, halve the damage, and decrease the DC by 2 for sonic attacks."

			"Drowning is one of the most obvious dangers of underwater adventuring. As creature can typically hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to twice its Constitution score. Whenever a creature takes a standard or full-round action, it expends 1 additional round of breath, so practically speaking, if a creature wants to fight or double move each round, it can do so only for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution score. Intentionally exhaling breath expends 1 to 3 rounds for each exhaling action-generally 1 round for a small exhalation, and 3 rounds for an extended exhalation like singing a song or casting a spell. Certain magic, like the suffocation spell from the Advanced Player's Guide, can expel all of a creature's held breath.",
			"",
			"Once a creature has used up these rounds of safety, it lives on a knife's edge between life and death. Each round, the creature must succeed at a Constitution check, with a DC starting at 10 and increasing by 1 each round after the first. Once it fails this check, the creature begins to drown, falling unconscious (and dropping to 0 hit points if it currently had more), dropping to -1 hit points on the next round, and dying on the round after that. At any point, if the creature becomes able to breathe (perhaps because someone dragged it out of the water or cast a spell to assist it), it ceases drowning but doesn't regain any lost hit points. Note that if a creature holds its breath in a situation where it could normally breathe, it won't fall unconscious if it fails its Constitution check.",
			"",
			"Because of the prohibitive limitations of holding one's breath, underwater explorers from the surface use a variety of techniques to extend their ability to breathe underwater. The most common is [water breathing](spell/water_breathing), which is extremely long-lasting and can protect an entire group with one casting. A simpler, short-term solution is [air bubble](spell/air_bubble), which can protect a single creature for a few minutes-but not usually enough for an underwater adventure. The most powerful option is [life bubble](spell/life_bubble); while its duration is half that of water breathing, it also protects against many other underwater hazards such as extreme temperature and pressure. Those who prefer a mundane alternative to ephemeral (and dispellable) magic tend to use [air tanks](equipment/misc/air_tank) to store additional air, but characters hoping to stay underwater find that carrying around more than a few extra breaths of air sets their buoyancy to swiftly rising, almost like wearing a giant life preserver, so this solution is effective only for a strong swimmer or someone with access to magic to alter buoyancy."

			"The ocean is divided into four zones: the sunlight zone (from the surface to 600 feet below), the twilight zone (from 600 feet down to 3,300 feet), the midnight zone (from 3,300 feet down to 13,000 feet-which often reaches the bottom), and the Abyssal zone (from 13,000 feet to the bottom in depths greater than 13,000 feet). Some oceanographers add a fifth zone, the Abaddonian zone, which describes areas 20,000 feet and below in the deepest ocean trenches.",
			"",
			"**Pressure:** Most aquatic creatures have adapted to depths corresponding roughly to one or more of these zones in particular, and ignore pressure damage while within their native depth range unless they instantaneously transport from one depth to another, as with [dimension door](spell/dimension_door). [Pressure damage rules are found here.](rule/water_dangers) Surface creatures, on the other hand, treat depths of 0 to 100 feet as their native zone. For every minute spent below their native zone, a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of damage, plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every additional 100 feet beyond the first. The DC is initially 15, and it increases by 1 for every minute after the first. After five successful Fortitude saves (consecutive or not), the creature adapts to the pressure. If a creature is within its native depth range but experiencing pressure dangers due to instantaneous travel, this adaptation to the new pressure happens [all at once](rule/adapting_to_aquatic_adventures). If the creature is outside its native range, this adaptation adjusts its native range down or up by 100 feet, as appropriate. A surface dweller swimming downward may adapt to the new depth, but will then experience pressure hazards when it ascends back to the surface.",
			"",
			"For instance, if Valeros swims down 220 feet, he is 120 feet outside his native range of 0 to 100 feet, so he needs to attempt a Fortitude save every minute to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage. If he succeeds at five Fortitude saves, his native range shifts to 100-200 feet, and he must attempt Fortitude saves to avoid taking 1d6 points of damage each minute. After five more successful Fortitude saves, his native range is now 200-300 feet, and he takes no further damage from pressure, but if he ascends back to the surface, he must resume attempting Fortitude saves to avoid taking 2d6 points of damage from the reversing pressure. Because of the dangers of changing pressure, aquatic explorers find it safest to adjust their depth gradually unless they have special means of avoiding pressure hazards. Spells like [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) and [life bubble](spell/life_bubble) prevent pressure damage. [Pressure adaptation](spell/pressure_adaptation) and [stabilize pressure](spell/stabilize_pressure) are more focused and lower-level options.",
			"",
			"**Temperature:** Immersion in water can cause hypothermia in land-dwelling creatures at temperatures that would normally be perfectly safe on land. Generally, creatures in water that is 80&deg; F or higher are safe from hypothermia. Water from 60&deg; to 80&deg; F is equivalent to cold weather (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save each hour to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage; [see here](rule/cold_dangers) for information on determining the DC). Water from 40&deg; to 60&deg; F functions like severe cold (a creature must succeed at a Fortitude save every 10 minutes to avoid taking 1d6 points of nonlethal cold damage). Water from 32&deg; to 40&deg; F acts as extreme cold (dealing an automatic 1d6 points of lethal cold damage each minute). Water below 32&deg; F (which is generally possible only in areas with high levels of salt) deals an automatic 2d6 points of lethal cold damage per minute. Sea creatures are adapted to the water temperature in their native zones. The [endure elements](spell/endure_elements) spell protects its target from water as cold as 32&deg; F (rather than -50&deg; F in air), which is generally enough to cover temperature extremes in the ocean. By contrast, water rarely becomes warm enough to provide heat dangers except in the presence of a hazard like a hydrothermal vent, as even the most extreme temperatures in the sunlight zone tend to cap at around 104&deg; F.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Zone:** The sunlight zone contains all aquatic plants that require light for photosynthesis, so it's home to both phytoplankton and seaweed. It's also the home of most marine mammals, many sharks, some jellyfish, and most of the fish familiar to fisherfolk. The visibility estimates in the [Perception](skill/perception) rules assume sufficient light levels (or a means of seeing in the dark), which are typically present only in the sunlight zone. The water temperature in the sunlight zone varies based on the surface conditions, anywhere from over 100&deg; F to below 30&deg; F.",
			"",
			"**Twilight Zone:** In the twilight zone, only about 1% of the light from the surface remains-not enough for photosynthesis. This also isn't enough light for a creature with normal vision to see, but creatures with low-light vision can still see to a distance of around 60 feet as though in dim light. Many creatures living in this zone either have darkvision or rely on precise senses other than sight to guide them, while others are bioluminescent. Roughly 90% of Golarion's fish live in this zone. The temperature in the twilight zone ranges from about 68&deg; F at the top to around 39&deg; F at the bottom, with very few variations at any given depth.",
			"",
			"**Midnight Zone:** The midnight zone has no light whatsoever from the surface, requiring darkvision or nonvisual senses for any creature that doesn't have its own source of light. Fueled by the detritus that sinks from above, many types of squids and octopuses and some krakens live in this zone, along with some large whales and other creatures of the deep, but it's harder for fish to survive here. The temperature in the midnight zone is generally 39&deg; F throughout. The midnight zone usually extends to the bottom.",
			"",
			"**Abyssal Zone:** In regions where the ocean floor is more than 13,000 feet below the surface, the Abyssal zone lurks beneath the midnight zone, a region that's dark and cold even compared to the midnight zone, and devoid of even the falling detritus scavenged by midnight zone denizens. Named for the Abyss, this zone contains unnatural and horrific creatures mixed in with other fauna. Giant squids, krakens, and other tentacled horrors thrive in this zone, despite the 35&deg; to 39&deg; F temperature. Other creatures congregate around the warmth of the zone's hydrothermal vents, gaining nourishment from the vents' expulsions.",
			"",
			"**Abaddonian Zone:** Some scholars, particularly among deep-sea races, utter dark whispers of a fifth and final zone that exists only in the depths of the deepest ocean trenches, over 20,000 feet below the water's surface. Supposedly, pressures over 1,000 times that of the surface world, combined with low temperatures and ambient magic, create within these trenches a nightmarish tableau that hardly seems it could exist on the Material Plane. Amorphous creatures like jellyfish, sea cucumbers, and tube worms cling to life in this inhospitable environment, eking out a life amidst beings of unfathomable malevolence. While scholars have funded expeditions to gather information on the Abaddonian zone, there are few, if any, survivors to give their accounts of those expeditions, and certainly none who remained sane."

			"Currents in the ocean (or a similarly large body of water) work similarly to rivers. Each current has a particular speed (measured in feet per round), width, and direction, and at the beginning of a creature's turn, the current pushes it that distance. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity to creatures not in the same current. A creature can try to swim against the current's flow on its turn to stay in place, but it's usually a better idea to swim perpendicular to the current to reach the edge and exit the current. Fortunately, while rivers can reach speeds up to 90 feet per round, the fastest natural ocean currents are usually not much faster than 50 feet per round in the sunlight zone, and are slower the deeper one travels. This is because currents are mainly influenced by the weather near the surface and tiny discrepancies in temperature far below the surface, and the effects of the latter are not as strong. Currents always count as at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and faster currents count as at least stormy water (Swim DC 20).",
			"",
			"The majority of the ocean does not count as running water, but currents do. Thus while the spell [locate creature](spell/locate_creature) functions underwater, it rarely extends to its full range, since even an extremely slow current blocks the spell. Likewise, vampires tempt fate in the ocean by exposing themselves to the risk of an unexpected current."

		"description": [
			"When currents flowing in opposite directions meet, they create a whirlpool. Most whirlpools are harmless, but some mighty maelstroms formed by powerful tides are capable of great destruction. The most powerful whirlpools can reach a maximum current speed of around 200 feet per round, spinning in a circle and generating a centripetal force to pull nearby creatures and objects into the whirlpool and prevent those caught in the whirlpool from leaving. Whirlpool movement doesn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity, because no one caught in the current is in a position to make one. Conditions are so rough in maelstroms that Swim checks reach DC 40 or higher. Creatures caught in a whirlpool take 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per round for every 50 feet of the whirlpool's speed. Sometimes the only way to survive a whirlpool is to reach the center, since-unlike when a water elemental creates and controls a whirlpool with mischief in mind-a natural whirlpool eventually drags its captives to the bottom and out."
