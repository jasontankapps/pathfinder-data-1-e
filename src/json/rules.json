			"The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures. Helping them tell this story is the Game Master (or GM), who decides what threats the player characters (or PCs) face and what sorts of rewards they earn for succeeding at their quest. Think of it as a cooperative storytelling game, where the players play the protagonists and the Game Master acts as the narrator, controlling the rest of the world.",
			"",
			"If you are a player, you make all of the decisions for your character, from what abilities your character has to the type of weapon he carries. Playing a character, however, is more than just following the rules. You also decide your character's personality. Is he a noble knight, set on vanquishing a powerful evil, or is he a conniving rogue who cares more about gold than glory? The choice is up to you.",
			"",
			"If you are a Game Master, you control the world that the players explore. Your job is to bring the setting to life and to present the characters with challenges that are both fair and exciting. From the local merchant prince to the rampaging dragon, you control all of the characters that are not being played by the players. Paizo's Pathfinder Adventure Path series, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder Chronicles world guides provide everything you need to run a game, or you can invent your own, using the rules presented herein as well as the monsters found in the various bestiaries.",
			"",
			"***What You Need:*** In addition to these rules, you will need a number of special dice to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dice that come with most board games have six sides, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game uses dice with four sides, six sides, eight sides, ten sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides. Dice of this sort can be found at your local game store or online at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"In addition to dice, if you are a player, you will need a character sheet [found in the back of the physical book] and, if the Game Master uses a map to represent the adventure, a small figurine to represent your character. These figurines, or miniatures, can also be found at most game stores. They come in a wide variety of styles, so you can probably find a miniature that relatively accurately depicts your character.",
			"",
			"If you are the Game Master, you will need a copy of the *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, which contains the rules for a whole spectrum of monsters, from the mighty dragon to the lowly goblin. While many of these monsters can be used to fight against the players, others might provide useful information or become powerful allies. Some might even join the group, with one of the players taking on the role of a monstrous character. In addition, you should have your own set of dice and some sort of screen you can use to hide your notes, maps, and dice rolls behind. (Although you should be honest about the results of your dice rolls, sometimes the results are not evident, and openly rolling the dice might give away too much information.) Combat in the Pathfinder RPG can be resolved in one of two ways: you can describe the situation to the characters and allow them to interact based on the description you provide, or you can draw the situation on a piece of paper or a specially made battle mat and allow the characters to move their miniatures around to more accurately represent their position during the battle. While both ways have their advantages, if you choose the latter, you will need a mat to draw on, such as Paizo's line of GameMastery Flip-Mats, as well as miniatures to represent the monsters or other adversaries. These can also be found at your local game shop, or at paizo.com.",
			"",
			"***Playing the Game:*** While playing the Pathfinder RPG, the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.",
			"",
			"Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as \"d#,\" with the **#** representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the \"d.\" For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or - after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character's skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a 4 and the other d10 rolls a 2, then you've generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with 10, 20, 30 and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you must round a number, always round down.",
			"",
			"As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges. While a 1st-level character might be up to saving a farmer's daughter from rampaging goblins, defeating a terrifying red dragon might require the powers of a 20th-level hero. It is the Game Master's duty to provide challenges for your character that are engaging, but not so deadly as to leave you with no hope of success.",
			"",
			"Above all, have fun. Playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be exciting and rewarding for both the Game Master and the players. Adventure awaits!",
			"",
			"### The Most Important Rule",
			"",
			"The rules are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of \"house rules\" that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the Pathfinder RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt."

			"The Pathfinder RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.",
			"",
			"***Ability Score:*** Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature's most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.",
			"",
			"***Action:*** An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of [different kinds of actions](rule/actions_in_combat), such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action.",
			"",
			"***Alignment:*** Alignment represents a creature's basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single \"N.\"",
			"",
			"***Armor Class (AC):*** All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.",
			"",
			"***Base Attack Bonus (BAB):*** Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature's base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of [full-round action](rule/full-round_actions)).",
			"",
			"***Bonus:*** Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not \"stack\")-only the greater bonus granted applies.",
			"",
			"***Caster Level (CL):*** Caster level represents a creature's power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster's level.",
			"",
			"***Class:*** [Classes](main/classes) represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the core classes or prestige classes, since these are the most powerful. Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful.",
			"",
			"***Check:*** A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver:*** This is [an action taken in combat](rule/combat_maneuvers) that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB):*** This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character's d20 roll.",
			"",
			"***Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD):*** This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature's CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.",
			"",
			"***Concentration Check:*** When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a [concentration check](rule/concentration) or fail to cast the spell.",
			"",
			"***Creature:*** A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.",
			"",
			"***Damage Reduction (DR):*** Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a number followed by the type, such as \"10/cold iron.\" Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted with a dash instead of a type, e.g. \"5/-.\"",
			"",
			"***Difficulty Class (DC):*** Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.",
			"",
			"***Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):*** Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.",
			"",
			"***Experience Points (XP):*** As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.",
			"",
			"***Feat:*** A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.",
			"",
			"***Game Master (GM):*** A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM's duty is to provide a fair and fun game.",
			"",
			"***Hit Dice (HD):*** Hit Dice represent a creature's general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster's general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as \"3d8.\" This value is used to determine a creature's total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature's hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.",
			"",
			"***Hit Points (hp):*** Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature's hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature's hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature's hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score, it dies.",
			"",
			"***Initiative:*** Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.",
			"",
			"***Level:*** A character's level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.",
			"",
			"***Monster:*** Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.",
			"",
			"***Multiplying:*** When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.",
			"",
			"***Non-Player Character (NPC):*** These are characters controlled by the GM.",
			"",
			"***Penalty:*** Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.",
			"",
			"***Player Character (Character, PC):*** These are the characters portrayed by the players.",
			"",
			"***Round:*** Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.",
			"",
			"***Rounding:*** Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.",
			"",
			"***Saving Throw:*** When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a [saving throw](rule/saving_throws) to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw-they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), Reflex (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as fireball), and Will (used to resist mental attacks and spells).",
			"",
			"***Skill:*** A [skill](main/skills) represents a creature's ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.",
			"",
			"***Spell:*** Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.",
			"",
			"***Spell-Like Abilities (Sp):*** Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).",
			"",
			"***Spell Resistance (SR):*** Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature's SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).",
			"",
			"***Stacking:*** Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.",
			"",
			"***Supernatural Abilities (Su):*** Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability's description includes information on how it is used and its effects.",
			"",
			"***Turn:*** In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see [Actions in Combat](rule/actions_in_combat) for more details."

			"From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the Pathfinder RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character's concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.",
			"",
			"Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your Pathfinder RPG character sheet, which can be found at the back of [the physical book] and photocopied for your convenience.",
			"",
			"***Step 1-Determine Ability Scores:*** Start by generating your character's [ability scores](rule/ability_scores). These six scores determine your character's most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.",
			"",
			"***Step 2-Pick Your Race:*** Next, pick your character's [race](rule/races), noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits. There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. [A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.](rule/intelligence)",
			"",
			"***Step 3-Pick Your Class:*** A character's [class](rule/classes) represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.",
			"",
			"***Step 4-Pick Skills and Select Feats:*** Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on [skills](rule/skills), but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many [feats](rule/feats) your character receives, based on his class and level.",
			"",
			"***Step 5-Buy Equipment:*** Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of [equipment](rule/equipment) and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy [magic items](rule/magic_items) without the consent of your GM.",
			"",
			"***Step 6-Finishing Details:*** Finally, you need to determine all of a character's details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps. A level 1 character begins with maximum hit points for its Hit Die roll. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character's name, [alignment](rule/alignment), and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game."

			"",
			"***Dice Pool:*** Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.",
			"",
			"***Purchase:*** Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his ability scores. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. See Table 1-1 on the next page for the costs of each score.

Of course, each race is best suited to a specific type of role - dwarves make better fighters than they do sorcerers, while halflings aren't as good as half-orcs at being barbarians. Keep each race's advantages and disadvantages in mind when making your choice. While it can be fun to play a race against its assumed role, it's not as fun to get three levels into a character before realizing that the character you wanted to play would have been better off as a different race entirely.",

Although your race doesn't force you to choose one religion or alignment over another, the typical choices for each race are mentioned. Next is a discussion of why a member of the race in question might decide to take on the peril-filled life of an adventurer. Finally, we list a few sample names for males and females of each race.",

The alternate favored class abilities listed here may not have as broad an appeal as the standard choices. They are designed to reflect flavorful options that might be less useful in general but prove handy in the right situations or for a character with the right focus.

			"***Dwarves:*** These short and stocky defenders of mountain fortresses are often seen as stern and humorless. Known for mining the earth's treasures and crafting magnificent items from ore and gemstones, they have an unrivaled affinity for the bounties of the deep earth. [Dwarves](race/dwarf) also have a tendency toward traditionalism and isolation that sometimes manifests as xenophobia.",
			"",
			"***Elves:*** Tall, noble, and often haughty, [elves](race/elf) are long-lived and subtle masters of the wilderness. Elves excel in the arcane arts. Often they use their intrinsic link to nature to forge new spells and create wondrous items that, like their creators, seem nearly impervious to the ravages of time. A private and often introverted race, elves can give the impression they are indifferent to the plights of others.",
			"",
			"***Gnomes:*** Expatriates of the strange land of fey, these small folk have a reputation for flighty and eccentric behavior. Many [gnomes](race/gnome) are whimsical artisans and tinkers, creating strange devices powered by magic, alchemy, and their quirky imagination. Gnomes have an insatiable need for new experiences that often gets them in trouble.",
			"",
			"***Half-Elves:*** Often caught between the worlds of their progenitor races, [half-elves](race/half-elf) are a race of both grace and contradiction. Their dual heritage and natural gifts often create brilliant diplomats and peacemakers, but half-elves are often susceptible to an intense and even melancholic isolation, realizing that they are never truly part of elven or human society.",
			"",
			"***Half-Orcs:*** Often fierce and savage, sometimes noble and resolute, [half-orcs](race/half-orc) can manifest the best and worst qualities of their parent races. Many half-orcs struggle to keep their more bestial natures in check in order to epitomize the most heroic values of humanity. Unfortunately, many outsiders see half-orcs as hopeless abominations devoid of civility, if not monsters unworthy of pity or parley.",
			"",
			"***Halflings:*** Members of this diminutive race find strength in family, community, and their own innate and seemingly inexhaustible luck. While their fierce curiosity is sometimes at odds with their intrinsic common sense, [halflings](race/halfling) are eternal optimists and cunning opportunists with an incredible knack for getting out the worst situations.",
			"",
			"***Humans:*** Ambitious, sometimes heroic, and always confident, [humans](race/human) have an ability to work together toward common goals that makes them a force to be reckoned with. Though short-lived compared to other races, their boundless energy and drive allow them to accomplish much in their brief lifetimes."

Other, even stranger races help populate the world, and - with the GM's permission - also work well as player character races, creating fun and exciting new roleplaying opportunities. This chapter details the most common of such races. From the nimble catfolk to the fiery ifrits and scavenging, birdlike tengus, these races have just as much motivation to be adventurers as do elves, gnomes, and humans. And while they may not be as common in the major population hubs of the Pathfinder campaign setting, each of the races detailed in this chapter presents its own unique background and abilities.",
			"",
			"While many of these races are considered civilized, some are typically viewed as monsters, and may prove interesting challenges for roleplaying and character interaction. When playing drow, kobolds, orcs, or other such races, it is often best for party dynamics to take on the roles of characters who rebel against the norms of their races and societies - creatures who do not agree with their often brutal cultures, and instead wish to carve out a better existence for themselves among other races. When playing these races, even more so than for many other races, it is important to work with your GM to determine character motivations and backgrounds that work in the campaign.",
			"",
			"***Aasimars:*** Creatures blessed with a celestial bloodline, [aasimars](race/aasimar) seem human except for some exotic quality that betrays their otherworldly origin. While aasimars are nearly always beautiful, something simultaneously a part of and apart from humanity, not all of them are good, though very few are evil.",
			"",
			"***Catfolk:*** A race of graceful explorers, [catfolk](race/catfolk) are both clannish and curious by nature. They tend to get along with races that treat them well and respect their boundaries. They love exploration, both physical and intellectual, and tend to be natural adventurers.",
			"",
			"***Dhampir:*** The accursed spawn of vampires, [dhampirs](race/dhampir) are living creatures tainted with the curse of undeath, which causes them to take damage from positive energy and gain healing from negative energy. While many members of this race embrace their dark sides, others are powerfully driven to rebel against their taint and hunt down and destroy vampires and their ilk.",
			"",
			"***Drow:*** Dark reflections of surface elves, [drow](race/drow) are shadowy hunters who strive to snuff out the world's light. Drow are powerful magical creatures who typically serve demons, and only their chaotic nature stops them from becoming an even greater menace. A select few forsake their race's depraved and nihilistic society to walk a heroic path.",
			"",
			"***Fetchlings:*** Long ago, [fetchlings](race/fetchling) were humans exiled to the Shadow Plane, but that plane's persistent umbra has transformed them into a race apart. These creatures have developed an ability to meld into the shadows and have a natural affinity for shadow magic. Fetchlings - who call themselves kayal - often serve as emissaries between the inhabitants of the Shadow Plane and the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"***Goblins:*** Crazy pyromaniacs with a tendency to commit unspeakable violence, goblins are the smallest of the goblinoid races. While they are a fun-loving race, their humor is often cruel and hurtful. Adventuring goblins constantly wrestle with their darkly mischievous side in order to get along with others. Few are truly successful.",
			"",
			"***Hobgoblins:*** These creatures are the most disciplined and militaristic of the goblinoid races. Tall, tough as nails, and strongly built, hobgoblins would be a boon to any adventuring group, were it not for the fact that they tend to be cruel and malicious, and often keep slaves.",

A select few forsake their race's depraved and nihilistic society to walk a heroic path.",
			"",
			"***Ifrit:*** [Ifrits](race/ifrit) are a race descended from mortals and the strange inhabitants of the Plane of Fire. Their physical traits and personalities often betray their fiery origins, and they tend to be restless, independent, and imperious. Frequently driven from cities for their ability to manipulate flame, ifrits make powerful fire sorcerers and warriors who can wield flame like no other race.",
			"",
			"***Kobolds:*** Considering themselves the scions of dragons, [kobolds](race/kobold) have diminutive statures but massive egos. A select few can take on more draconic traits than their kin, and many are powerful sorcerers, canny alchemists, and cunning rogues.",
			"",
			"***Orcs:*** Savage, brutish, and hard to kill, [orcs](race/orc) are often the scourge of far-flung wildernesses and cavern deeps. Many orcs become fearsome barbarians, as they are muscular and prone to bloody rages. Those few who can control their bloodlust make excellent adventurers.",
			"",
			"***Oreads:*** Creatures of human ancestry mixed with the blood of creatures from the Plane of Earth, [oreads](race/oread) are as strong and solid as stone. Often stubborn and steadfast, their unyielding nature makes it hard for them to get along with most races other than dwarves. Oreads make excellent warriors and sorcerers who can manipulate the raw power of stone and earth.",
			"",
			"***Ratfolk:*** These small, ratlike humanoids are clannish and nomadic masters of trade. Often tinkers and traders, they are more concerned with accumulating interesting trinkets than amassing wealth. [Ratfolk](race/ratfolk) often adventure to find new and interesting curiosities rather than coin.",
			"",
			"***Sylphs:*** Ethereal folk of elemental air, [sylphs](race/sylph) are the result of human blood mixed with that of airy elemental folk. Like ifrits, oreads, and undines, they can become powerful elemental sorcerers with command over their particular elemental dominion. They tend to be beautiful and lithe, and have a knack for eavesdropping.",
			"",
			"***Tengus:*** These crowlike humanoid scavengers excel in mimicry and swordplay. Flocking into densely populated cities, [tengus](race/tengu) occasionally join adventuring groups out of curiosity or necessity. Their impulsive nature and strange habits can often be unnerving to those who are not used to them.",
			"",
			"***Tieflings:*** Diverse and often despised by humanoid society, [tieflings](race/tiefling) are mortals stained with the blood of fiends. Other races rarely trust them, and this lack of empathy usually causes tieflings to embrace the evil, depravity, and rage that seethe within their corrupt blood. A select few see the struggle to smother such dark desires as motivation for grand heroism.",
			"",
			"***Undines:*** Like their cousins, the ifrits, oreads, and sylphs, [undines](race/undine) are humans touched by planar elements. They are the scions of elemental water, equally graceful both on land and in water. Undines are adaptable and resistant to cold, and have an affinity for water magic."

			"The 14 races presented here are all suitable to be played as PCs, but their rarity or isolation often sets them apart. While all are exotic, the reasons for their rarity are as diverse as their forms. The changeling, an offspring of a hag and a mortal lover, is an uncommon player race because of the improbability of such a foul union. Other races, like the kitsune, nagaji, samsarans, and wayangs, are often more common in certain far-flung lands but are rarely seen in most others. Still other races, like the gillmen, gripplis, merfolk, strix, and svirfneblin, typically distrust outsiders and keep to their own remote and insular communities.",
			"",
			"While these races are rare, the same can be said of anyone willing to become an adventurer. Such an activity is not for those who crave a normal life, and these races also produce the rare spirit who strikes out into the wild places of the world in search of excitement and exploration. With your GM's permission, you can select any of the following uncommon races for your player character. Each racial section provides all the information you need to create a character along with a number of new options available to characters of that race. This chapter details the following uncommon races.",
			"",
			"***Changelings:*** The offspring of hags and their mortal lovers, [changelings](race/changeling) are abandoned and raised by foster parents. Always female, changelings all hear a spiritual call during puberty to find their true origins. Tall and slender, with dark hair and eyes mismatched in color, changelings are eerily attractive.",
			"",
			"***Duergar:*** Gray skinned, deep-dwelling dwarves who hate their lighter skinned cousins, [duergar](race/duergar) view life as constant toil ending only in death. Though these dwarves are typically evil, honor and keeping one's word means everything to them, and a rare few make loyal adventuring companions.",
			"",
			"***Gillmen:*** Survivors of a land-dwelling culture whose homeland was destroyed, [gillmen](race/gillman) were saved and transformed into an amphibious race by the aboleths. Though in many ways they appear nearly human, gillmen's bright purple eyes and gills set them apart from humanity. Reclusive and suspicious, gillmen know that one day the aboleths will call in the debt owed to them.",
			"",
			"***Gripplis:*** Furtive frogfolk with the ability to camouflage themselves among fens and swamps, [gripplis](race/grippli) typically keep to their wetland homes, only rarely interacting with the outside world. Their chief motivation for leaving their marshy environs is to trade in metal and gems.",
			"",
			"***Kitsune:*** These shapeshifting, foxlike folk share a love of mischief, art, and the finer things in life. They can appear as a single human as well as their true form, that of a foxlike humanoid. [Kitsune](race/kitsune) are quick-witted, nimble, and gregarious, and because of this, a fair number of them become adventurers.",
			"",
			"***Merfolk:*** These creatures have the upper torso of a well-built and attractive humanoid and a lower half consisting of a finned tail. Though they are amphibious and extremely strong swimmers, their lower bodies make it difficult for them to move on land. [Merfolk](race/merfolk) can be shy and reclusive. Typically keeping to themselves, they are distrustful of land-dwelling strangers.",
			"",
			"***Nagaji:*** It is believed that nagas created the nagaji as a race of servants and that the [nagaji](race/nagaji) worship their creators as living gods. Due to their reptilian nature and strange mannerisms, these strange, scaly folk inspire fear and wonder in others not of their kind. They are resistant to both poison and mind-affecting magic.",
			"",
			"***Samsarans:*** Ghostly servants of karma, [samsarans](race/samsaran) are creatures reincarnated hundreds if not thousands of times in the hope of reaching true enlightenment. Unlike humans and other races, these humanoids remember much of their past lives.",
			"",
			"***Strix:*** Hunted to dwindling numbers by humans, who see them as winged devils, [strix](race/strix) are black-skinned masters of the nighttime sky. Their territorial conflicts have fueled their hatred for humans. This longstanding feud means that these nocturnal creatures often attack humans on sight.",
			"",
			"***Sulis:*** Also called suli-jann, these humanoids are the descendants of mortals and jann. These strong and charismatic individuals manifest mastery over elemental power in their adolescence, giving them the ability to manipulate earth, fire, ice, or electricity. This elemental power tends to be reflected in the [suli's](race/suli) personality as well.",
			"",
			"***Svirfneblin:*** Gnomes who guard their hidden enclaves within dark tunnels and caverns deep under the earth, [svirfneblin](race/svirfneblin) are as serious as their surface cousins are whimsical. They are resistant to the magic of the foul creatures that share their subterranean environs, and wield powerful protective magic. Svirfneblin are distrustful of outsiders and often hide at their approach.",
			"",
			"***Vanaras:*** These mischievous, monkeylike humanoids dwell in jungles and warm forests. Covered in soft fur and sporting prehensile tails and handlike feet, [vanaras](race/vanara) are strong climbers. These creatures are at home both on the ground and among the treetops.",
			"",
			"***Vishkanyas:*** Strangely beautiful on the outside and poisonous on the inside, [vishkanyas](race/vishkanya) see the world through slitted serpent eyes. Vishkanyas possess a serpent's grace and ability to writhe out of their enemies' grasp with ease. Vishkanyas have a reputation for being both seductive and manipulative. They can use their saliva or blood to poison their weapons.",
			"",
			"***Wayangs:*** The small [wayangs](race/wayang) are creatures of the Plane of Shadow. They are so attuned to shadow that it even shapes their philosophy, believing that upon death they merely merge back into darkness. The mysteries of their shadowy existence grant them the ability to gain healing from negative energy as well as positive energy."

Thus, the first [aphorites](race/aphorite) came to be.

			"",
			"From the noble paladin to the skillful rogue, each core class draws upon a central archetype. Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player's choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, ***Archetypes*** were introduced. So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players' freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.",
			"",
			"### Alternate Class Features",
			"",
			"Most of the options include a host of alternate class features. When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features or those listed in one of the archetypes presented with the class. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the *elemental fist* class feature of the [monk of the four winds](archetype-monk/monk_of_the_four_winds) replaces the *stunning fist* class feature of the [monk](class/monk). When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them-often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options. All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.",
			"",
			"A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a [paladin](class/paladin) could not be both a [hospitaler](archetype-paladin/hospitaler) and an [undead scourge](archetype-paladin/undead_scourge) since they both modify the *smite evil* class feature and both replace the *aura of justice* class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an *undead scourge* and a [warrior of the holy light](archetype-paladin/warrior_of_the_holy_light), since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.",
			"",
			"### Adapting Existing Characters",
			"",
			"Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn't be gaining any special advantage over other party members. As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.",
			"",
			"While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn't have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn't feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment. Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn't feel like they're being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what's best for the campaign."

			"A character background details the significant events, people, and life experiences that make up the origin story of a character prior to his or her role in the saga of a campaign. Some characters are born under extraordinary circumstances, heralded by prophecy and omen; others live completely ordinary lives until some dramatic event casts them onto the dangerous roads traveled by heroes and monsters. A character's background forms the basis for complex motivations and emotional vulnerabilities, and these past experiences guide the way the character responds to circumstances in his or her present life. As the child of a goddess and a mortal, do you view ordinary creatures as inferior beings? Having grown up in abject poverty, how do you react when someone steals from you? If a militant theocracy burned your siblings as heretics, how do you respond to clerics of other religions? When playing a new character, the details in your background give you a quick handle on your past, making it easier to slip into the character's skin and embrace this mind-set in play. As the campaign proceeds, your early adventures gradually become part of that background-a seamless chain of events that make up your life and contribute to your constantly changing and evolving persona."

Alternatively, you might use the [background generator](rule/background_generator) to compile your history randomly. You can also use the charts and tables in the background generator as a springboard for your imagination, deliberately selecting background elements that inspire you or fit the direction you wish to explore.",
			"",
			"For published Pathfinder Adventure Paths, you often have the option of selecting campaign [traits](rule/traits) that tie your character thematically into a specific storyline relevant to that Adventure Path. Check with your GM to see if she can point you to official campaign traits or other traits that may help link your character to the campaign or adventure she's running. Such traits provide a good foundation upon which you can add details from this section, either by rolling randomly or by manually selecting background details that mesh well with your campaign's themes.",
			"",
			"No matter how you go about developing your character's background, the next step is to quantify that background in terms of game mechanics. Select two traits (or three traits and a drawback) that capture the background you imagined. [Traits and drawbacks are listed here](main/traits). These traits provide small bonuses that reflect skills and knowledge gained from your life experiences. The drawback, if you choose to take one, represents an emotional vulnerability or character flaw that should not only provide a slight mechanical disadvantage, but also (more importantly) serve as a roleplaying tool for making interesting choices. After all, nobody's perfect!"

			"Sometimes, creating a character that feels original and stands out from others of the same class and race can seem like a challenge. It's easy to fall into playing the stereotype of a race or class-the ale-swilling dwarven fighter with the battleaxe, the quick and wise elven ranger roaming the woodlands with a longbow, the sneaky and childlike halfling rogue, and so on. While there's nothing wrong with these, and they can be a lot of fun - after all, there's a reason they became cultural archetypes in the first place - sometimes you want to try something new. Presented here are some techniques you can use to help you break away from stereotypes.",
			"",
			"***Originality:*** If you strive too hard to be original, you'll likely be disappointed when you discover that someone else has already implemented your idea in a book, film, game, or other kind of media. Yet, while original ideas are hard to come by, every person you meet is unique, shaped by his or her individual experiences. Rather than strive for an original concept, try focusing on the experiences that define your character's life and give him his personality and point of view. Specific experiences will help move you away from the stereotypical and cliche.",
			"",
			"***The Third Idea:*** When you're brainstorming ideas, it sometimes helps to reject the first and second ideas that leap to mind, and instead consider the third, fourth, and fifth ideas you come up with. This way, you're challenging yourself to explore wider, more interesting possibilities full of unexplored story potential. The easy ideas that spring to mind first probably do so because you've seen them before.",
			"",
			"***Opposites:*** When you're stuck on an characteristic that strikes you as boring, plain, or stereotypical, decide that the opposite is instead true of yourself. For instance, if you're playing the aforementioned dwarven fighter, perhaps one of the following holds:",
			"",
			"- You have taken a vow against drinking, can't hold your liquor, or act in a peculiar, eccentric way when drunk.",
			"- You can't grow a beard.",
			"- You favor a weapon that is not a hammer, axe, crossbow, or other typical dwarven weapon.",
			"- You live in a forest or on an island rather than in the hills and mountains favored by most dwarves.",
			"- You are a pacifist who loathes violence.",
			"- You deeply pity or love orcs and goblins.",
			"",
			"Any one of these character quirks can prove ripe for character development and story hooks in the campaign.",
			"",
			"***Steal Shamelessly:*** Sometimes when starting a new character, you just need a good template or foundation from which to build. Characters from literature, comics, history, real life, or television and film can provide that foundation in an instant. The key is to alter various aspects of the model character until you have changed enough to have an altogether different concept.",
			"",
			"How would Count Dracula be different as an elven wizard? What about as a halfling cleric? Are you obsessed with feasting on blood, or are you simply ancient, creepy, solitary, and mysterious?",
			"",
			"What about reinterpreting Julius Caesar as a human rogue or a gnome illusionist? Is this human rogue one of three mobsters scheming to eliminate the competition and rule a city the way Caesar eliminated his competitors to rule Rome? Has your gnome illusionist received a prophetic message predicting his own death, as Caesar did from the soothsayer?",
			"",
			"Building on the foundations of established characters or people gives you a framework, at which point you just need to give yourself different circumstances in order to inspire a new idea, one that will grow on its own as you continue to play. The initial inspiration or model you choose helps you come to grips with your character quickly without feeling like you have to reinvent the wheel.",
			"",
			"Another way to accomplish this is to combine notable traits of two disparate characters from media or history. For instance, how would you play a character with Sherlock Holmes' skill at deduction and Hamlet's indecision? Achilles' battle prowess paired with Nikola Tesla's inventive mind? Merlin's magic with Marie Curie's search for scientific truth? Joan of Arc's faithful conviction and Napoleon's overwhelming ambition?"

In other instances they are social, political, or religious events such as the crowning of a king or the martyrdom of a prophet.

			"Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character's race or class. They can enhance your character's skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn't just another kind of power you can add on to your character-it's a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world. Think of character traits as \"story seeds\" for your background; after you pick your two traits, you'll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character's personality and history. Alternatively, if you've already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.",

			"",
			"***Basic Traits:*** The original traits were split among the categories of [Combat](main/traits_combat), [Faith](main/traits_faith), [Magic](main/traits_magic), and [Social](main/traits_social). Each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren't tied to specific classes. It's perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are \"generic,\" and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.",
			"",
			"***Campaign Traits:*** These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. [Campaign traits](main/traits_campaign) tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path's Player's Guide. When playing an adventure path, a PC will usually be required to take a campaign trait as one of their two traits.",
			"",
			"***Race Traits:*** [Race traits](main/traits_race) are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a [reincarnation](spell/reincarnate) spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist; only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.",
			"",
			"***Regional Traits:*** [Regional traits](main/traits_regional) are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character's place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character's background.",
			"",
			"***Religion Traits:*** [Religion traits](main/traits_religion) indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed under [Restrictions on Trait Selection](rule/restrictions_on_trait_selection).",
			"",
			"***Drawbacks:*** [Drawbacks](main/traits_drawback) are traits in reverse. Instead of granting you a boon, they grant you a negative effect, typically in particular circumstances. If you choose to take a drawback, you get to offset this penalty by selecting an additional trait (following the same [restrictions](restrictions_on_trait_selection) on trait selections). For example, you can take a campaign trait and a magic trait, then take a drawback and a combat trait, for a total of three traits and one drawback.",

When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits (the four basic traits each count as a separate list for this purpose). Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.",
			"",
			"Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character's development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the [Additional Traits](feat/additional_traits) feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he'll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits-since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions. In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait."

Third, integrate all of the level's class abilities and then roll for additional hit points. Finally, add new skills and feats.

The alternate favored class abilities listed here may not have as broad an appeal as the standard choices. They are designed to reflect flavorful options that might be less useful in general but prove handy in the right situations or for a character with the right focus.

For example, a dwarf with rogue as his favored class adds +1/2 to his trap sense ability regarding stone traps each time he selects the alternate rogue favored class benefit; though this means the net effect is +0 after selecting it once (because +1/2 rounds down to +0), after 20 levels this benefit gives the dwarf a +10 bonus to his trap sense (in addition to the base value from being a 20th-level rogue).",

Thus, rather than taking an extra hit point or an extra skill rank, players may choose for their characters to gain the benefit listed here. This is not a permanent or irrevocable choice; just as characters could alternate between taking skill ranks and hit points when they gain levels in their favored class, these benefits provide a third option, and characters may freely alternate between them.",
