For each level of spell you can now cast (including level 0), each time you channel an archmage spirit, select a single spell of that level from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to add to your medium spell list and spells known until you lose contact with the archmage. When you cast these spells, they count as arcane (though not for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites), and thus you must provide verbal and somatic components instead of thought and emotion components.",

When you do so, the caster level and DC of the spell increase by 1, and you can't apply metamagic to the spell.",

Sudden attack works as normal with full-attack options such as two-weapon fighting.",

As soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action, even if circumstances prevent you from attacking at the end of your movement.",

			"**Energy Font (Intermediate, Su):** You can channel energy a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. Choose whether you channel positive or negative energy each time you contact a hierophant spirit; this choice must match the spirit's faith.

You can still use spirit surge only once per round.",

Anyone attempting to target you with a touch range spell, even a beneficial spell, must succeed at a melee touch attack, though you need not attempt saving throws against harmless spells.

After your first attack, that target is immune to being made flat-footed by your surprise strike for 24 hours.",
