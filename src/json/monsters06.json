			"**Pain Touch (Su)** A cruciarus can attack twice per round with its incorporeal touch attack, dealing 8d6 points of damage on a hit as it causes wracking, agonizing pains to tear through the victim's body. This untyped damage penetrates all damage reduction, but does not harm undead. Whenever a creature is touched by a cruciarus (regardless of whether it takes damage or not), it must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be staggered from the pain for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to pain effects are immune to a cruciarus's pain touch. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tortured Gaze (Su)** The method by which a cruciarus was tortured to death influences not only its appearance but also the effects of its gaze attack. Regardless of the actual effects, all cruciaruses' tortured gazes have a range of 30 feet, and the effects can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Specific types of cruciaruses are listed below-those encountered in Kintargo during the events of \"Breaking the Bones of Hell\" are all starvation cruciaruses, formed from the souls of those who perished from doghousing over the course of the Adventure Path. Other forms of cruciaruses may exist beyond those detailed below, as society's capacity for torment knows few bounds.",
			"",
			"- Burning: This cruciarus was tortured to death via fire. Its incorporeal body seems to smoke and burn, and smoldering raw brands glow on its ghostly body from where red-hot coals or branding irons were used to inflict pain. The cruciarus's gaze deals 6d6 points of fire damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that takes damage from this gaze becomes outlined as if by faerie fire for 1d4 rounds as it is wreathed in ghostly flames. This type of cruciarus can rise from the application of other forms of energy used to torture-a person frozen to death would result in a cruciarus that deals cold damage, while electrocution would bring about a cruciarus that deals electricity damage.",
			"- Crushing: A cruciarus created from crushing endured incredible pressure that caused the breaking of bones or the rupturing of organs-being compressed under a slowly increasing pile of stones is one grisly example of this torment. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as its bones creak and snap and its body bruises horrifically. A creature that fails to save against this gaze effect is also treated as if grappled for 1 round.",
			"- Dislocation: This cruciarus was subjected to tortures designed to dislocate victims' joints. These methods often involve mechanical devices such the rack and the strappado, but also include death via crucifixion and via hanging. The cruciarus's arms, legs, and sometimes even neck bend in unnatural directions. Its gaze causes the victim's limbs to stiffen, affecting the victim as if by a slow spell for 1 round on a failed saving throw. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Strength drain.",
			"- Dismemberment: One, some, or all of the cruciarus's limbs were amputated during a long, drawn-out death-execution via beheading can cause a dismembered cruciarus as well. The creature's ghostly body bears the terrible wounds, with its dismembered parts obviously still in proper relation to each other but separated from the body by an inch or 2. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of slashing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as hideous wounds manifest on body parts analogous to those the undead lost. A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also takes 1d6 points of bleed damage.",
			"- Drowning: This cruciarus experienced real or simulated drowning. Variations include dunking chairs, forced ingestion, and waterboarding. A cruciarus who died this way always appears soaking wet, constantly dripping water that fades moments after running off its ghostly frame. The target of a drowned cruciarus's gaze attack experiences the panic of suffocation or drowning (even if it is normally able to breathe underwater), and on a failed Fortitude save it cannot speak and becomes nauseated for 1 round. Every time a creature fails two consecutive saving throws against this gaze effect, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain.",
			"- Impalement: One or more sharp objects perforated this cruciarus before death. The cruciarus's body still caries ghostly echoes of the spears, lances, or other weapons that impaled it. The target of this cruciarus's gaze takes 6d6 points of piercing damage (Fortitude DC 23 half) each round as ghostly blades pierce its flesh. A creature that fails to resist this effect is also staggered for 1 round from the pain.",
			"- Starvation: This cruciarus expired from a form of torture that involved starvation or dehydration. The wretched spirit seems emaciated and gaunt. A creature subjected to this cruciarus's gaze attack suffers wracking pangs of hunger or thirst and takes 6d6 points of nonlethal damage (Fortitude DC 23 half). A creature that fails its saving throw against this gaze effect also becomes fatigued-or exhausted if already fatigued.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Cruciaruses are also known as the tortured dead. These anguished, frightening creatures are the disembodied spirits of those who died while being tortured. A painful death is not enough to produce these undead; only prolonged and intentional torment, whether punitive or sadistic, gives rise to one.",
			"",
			"A cruciarus bears the unmistakable wounds of a torture victim. Curiously, the features of cruciaruses never quite match those of the creatures whose deaths spawn them. While most cruciaruses spawn from the souls of mortal humanoids, others could well arise from creatures that suffer enough torture-statistics for such cruciaruses are identical to those listed above, although changes to size (as in the case of tortured giants or dragons) may be necessary.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"The exact triggers that cause torture victims to rise as cruciaruses are not entirely clear, although sheer magnitude certainly has an influence. A single or even small number of tortured victims never seems to be enough to result in a cruciarus; these mournful undead seem more apt to manifest when large numbers of victims are tortured, either at once or over an extended period of time. Curiously, deliberate attempts to trigger the formation of a cruciarus have failed to date, causing eager necromancers no small amount of frustration. The fact that cruciaruses do not resemble specific individuals who died of torture has caused many scholars to believe they comprise a sort of amalgamation of the torment suffered by many. No cruciarus remembers specific personal events from life, although they do recall regional events of public knowledge. And, of course, they always recall the cruel mechanics of their deaths. They seem to be driven not so much out of revenge as out of pure malice, and are as eager to inflict pain on the innocent as on those who continue to torture others in life.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Cruciaruses rarely travel far from where they form, although they don't seem to be bound specifically to sites of torment and death. They often haunt torture chambers hidden in basements and dungeons, though it is very uncommon for more than one cruciarus to spawn at such a site, regardless of the total number slain. In some cases, though, particularly when such tortures were performed in public, these undead form in larger groups, as if the mere fact of their deaths having been viewed by so many eyes gives rise to greater numbers of them. Cruciaruses are particularly common in regions like Cheliax and Nidal, where torture is raised to a high art. Necromancers in Geb employ controlled cruciaruses as interrogators and assassins, but must be careful lest the tortured dead turn against them."

			"Driven by pure instinct, this monstrously sized pitcher plant is much more aggressive than its more common and harmless insect-eating kin. Though a capable hunter, the crypt flower has no qualms about scavenging for its sustenance and eagerly devours living or rotting flesh. It maintains a proclivity for growing in graveyards and cemeteries, nursing itself on a diet of carrion, corpses, and vermin. Because the crypt flower gains its nutrients from decomposing organisms, the plant is nearly rootless and moves about by extending and retracting four thick clusters of rootlike shoots.",
			"",
			"The crypt flower's central, pitcher-shaped bulb is larger than an average adult human. A single petal hovers above the opening, acting as a sort of lid above rows of jagged spines that fold inward, overlapping each other almost like shark's teeth. As soon as a victim comes near this maw, the overhanging petal slams down and the flower rapidly constricts. Its spines gnaw upon the captured prey, drawing it into the large, hollow pitcher to be dissolved in sweet-scented but acidic and toxic nectar.",
			"",
			"In certain areas, bandit gangs or criminal organizations based in rural regions have taken the somewhat dangerous tradition of using crypt flowers to dispose of unwanted bodies. Since it makes no difference to a crypt flower whether it consumes an unwanted body and otherwise, complex pens or troughs are built to contain the flowers and limit their movements so that they can be \"fed\" with relative safety.",

			"Scorpion-like crysmals originate in the deepest caverns of the Plane of Earth.

The crystalline planes of their bodies absorb and refract natural light, which some claim is the source of their supernatural powers.",
			"",
			"Singular in purpose, a crysmal seeks only to reproduce. It does so by gathering stone crystals and gemstones, fashioning them into a Tiny facsimile of its own body, and jolting the new creature to life with a burst of the crysmal's own life energy. These newly created crysmals are known as shardlings (treat as a crysmal with the young creature simple template), and grow to adulthood after a few months of gorging on crystals and gemstones.",
			"",
			"To make a single shardling, a crysmal requires 1,000 gp worth of crystals. Until it has enough material to reproduce, it stores these gems inside its body, and if slain, the gems are visible among the shards of the creature's corpse. Because of this reproductive need for gemstones, crysmals are relentless in their pursuit of the treasures, valuing them much as other living creatures value infants of their own race. Crysmals do not recognize that other creatures treat gems as wealth, and attempt to seize gems carried by others whenever the opportunity arises. A crysmal normally uses its spell-like abilities to befuddle opponents, grabbing at pouches with gems when the bearer is distracted, and normally only resorts to physical violence once all other tactics fail."

Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, while those farther away have total concealment. In non-flowing water, the muddy cloud dissipates in 2d6 rounds. In flowing water, the duration is reduced by 1 round for every 10 feet per round the water flows beyond 20 feet.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Farmers who graze their cattle near slow-moving rivers or placid lakes warn their neighbors when rumors of a cuero pass from village to village. These strange, flat creatures haunt waterways in search of large prey to satisfy their voracious appetites. When more passive, cueros lie in wait at the bottom of a lake or river for suitable prey to swim overhead. In lean times, cueros sit just beneath the water's surface near the shore and stay perfectly still until an animal comes near to drink. They sometimes even bury themselves in the muddy banks of a river to surprise passersby.",
			"",
			"When prey gets within reach of a cuero, it strikes from camouflage. It wraps its prey up in its leathery hide and begins draining its victim's blood. After feeding, the cuero discards the drained husk on the riverbank or drags it into the water to float downriver. Cueros prefer the ease of catching Small and Medium mammals, but they seem to have a special taste for Medium and Large ungulates. When their preferred prey is unavailable, cueros act as bottom feeders, sifting through the lake bed or river bottom in search of crabs, clams, and slow moving fish. Following this behavior, cueros can strip fishing areas of fauna, an act that enrages local anglers.",
			"",
			"Most cueros prowl muddy waterways alone, capitalizing on choice hunting grounds, but some cueros form small families and dig out dens in lakebeds and beneath riverbanks. These crude structures often house only a handful of these creatures. When a den reaches capacity, one or two cueros set off to form their own group instead of expanding the current den.",
			"",
			"Cueros typically keep to small family groups, but when the full moon occurs on an equinox or a solstice, these creatures crowd the bodies of water they call home. These congregations are unsettling to witness, as the creatures thrash about in the water and emit droning moans punctuated with the chittering of their rasping teeth. Many scholars believe these gatherings to be mass breeding events, and those able to speak to cueros find that the creatures believe that the strongest of their kind are conceived during these times.",
			"",
			"Cueros aren't very intelligent, but they can speak and understand Aklo. Their normal lines of conversation are often confusing, as the creatures tend to ramble on when speaking about topics such as food, water conditions, and the phases of the moon.",

The Accursed creature doesn't benefit from effects that remove ability damage. Once cursed, the target must succeed at a Will save every 24 hours or take ability damage again. Once the target's Charisma or Wisdom score is reduced to 0, the victim is transformed into a mundane animal as per baleful polymorph, and is automatically treated as if it failed the second Will save to retain its mind.

			"As the cyclopes' civilization crumbled, the focus of cyclops life shifted from intellectual and spiritual pursuits to base survival, and those who excelled at hunting, gathering, and enduring the harsh world rose to positions of power and prestige over what remained of their people. Though rarely leaders-cyclopes still revere magical acumen over martial power, even in their humbled state-manhunters occupy a position of respect among cyclops tribes, feeding their peoples' massive appetites with the flesh of beasts and sentient beings alike. Though competent archers, these hunters are rarely content to draw blood from afar, and train for close combat. Taking advantage of their size, they learn to reap foes with the same strength that their ancestors reaped wheat. Most manhunters prefer to use their archery skills only to harry and anger targets into closing with them, or to stop fleeing opponents lest their tender flesh be wasted. Familiar as they are with their tribal lands and always on the move, these towering hunters are often the first cyclopes that outsiders encounter, and just as often the last.",
			"",
			"Manhunters also enforce the law in their communities, dispensing scars and capital punishment for crimes-real or imagined-with swift brutality. Without courts or prisons, modern cyclops justice has devolved into scarification, mutilation, and execution for any crimes. The manhunters impose these cyclopean standards of justice on all they encounter, even when well beyond the lands directly under their control, as they believe the wisdom of the cyclopes is absolute.",
			"",
			"While humanoids are their favored prey, manhunters delight in tracking all manner of creatures and wearing their skulls, skins, and shiny belongings as trophies. They rarely use stealth, instead openly pursuing their victims over great distances. In a proper hunt, exhaustion is as likely to fell a manhunter's prey as her axe."

Filled with rage and a total rejection of everything their people once achieved, these massive brutes experience incredible joy in destroying the works of civilization. They tear down homes and buildings, rip out orchards, slaughter livestock, and crush forges. The ruins of their own peoples' grandeur drive them into a frenzy, and smashers may spend weeks or months ripping down the remains of cyclopean temples or cities, crushing even the bricks themselves into gravel. Their disdain for manufactured goods doesn't stop them from using weapons, armor, or other useful items, however.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The noisy, enigmatic cyphergulls are a common sight in the coastal city of Riddleport, where they often circle above the ancient rune-carved Cyphergate as if they own it. Their appearance and behavior greatly resembles those of their mundane cousins-seagulls-but they are far more intelligent, and their connection to Riddleport's ancient Thassilonian stone arch grants them many magical abilities.",
			"",
			"A cyphergull is a little over 2 feet long, has a wingspan of up to 5 feet, and weighs 3 pounds.",
			"",
			"The records of an esoteric order known as the Cyphermages indicate that a few times in the history of Riddleport, seagulls have suddenly gathered in large numbers near the Cyphergate, forming an immense spiral of feathers and flesh before crashing into the giant stone arch. Each time, the birds die by the hundreds, but the few that survive transform into something more than mere seagulls. While they retain many physical characteristics of seagulls, they are generally more robust and intelligent than their common cousins.",
			"",
			"Two cyphergull parents always produce cyphergull offspring, but interbreeding with ordinary gulls also occurs when suitable cyphergull mates are not available. The chicks of such mixed pairs are usually ordinary gulls, but mating occasionally results in a clutch of cyphergulls. Cyphergull eggs exude a soft blue glow and bear dark splotches that sometimes form patterns reminiscent of runes. After 3 or 4 weeks of incubation, loud, blue-eyed chicks hatch from the eggs. Over the first 4 years of a cyphergull's life, different runic patterns appear on its plumage until the creature reaches adulthood and the runes settle to a permanent pattern. Cyphergulls live up to 50 years in the wild and can live even longer in captivity.",
			"",
			"Cyphergulls are excellent fliers, but are also able swimmers and remarkably daring. With their mobility and intelligence, cyphergulls exhibit an exceptional variety of hunting strategies. Using their unhinging jaws, they can quickly gulp down many different kinds of prey, including crabs, fish, frogs, rodents, and even smaller birds. Cyphergulls are particularly inventive creatures, especially when it comes to finding food. For example, they sometimes use earthworms as bait to catch fish or set simple deadfall traps. When cyphergulls steal from humanoids, they often work in pairs; one of the birds creates a diversion while the other snatches the prize.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Versatile feeders, cyphergulls prefer coastal areas and islands, where they can hunt on land, on water, and in the air. The largest cyphergull populations exist in and around Riddleport, particularly on the slopes of the rocky ridges that surround the city and on the rooftops of the Wharf District and the Windward District. Several smaller populations of cyphergulls exist along the shores of the Varisian Gulf, most frequently near human settlements. In Magnimar, a careful observer may notice that some of the birds circling above the Irespan are in fact blue-eyed cyphergulls. Cyphergulls winter in southwestern Cheliax and along Rahadoum's northern coast.",
			"",
			"In late spring, cyphergulls assemble into noisy, densely packed colonies, usually returning to the same spot as the previous year. The breeding season begins a few weeks later when warm summer breezes start coming in from the Varisian Gulf. The birds build their nests on the ground, using leaves, twigs, and other plant matter as building materials. Cyphergulls are almost irrationally fond of paper and parchment, and they sometimes go to great lengths to obtain scrolls and books to use as nest-building materials.",
			"",
			"Cyphergull colonies have rigid hierarchies, where mated pairs of lower standing build their nests to form a ring around the nests of higher-ranking cyphergulls, protecting them against attacks. Cyphergulls mate for life and are very protective of their nests and the colony; if a predator isn't deterred by the gulls' warning calls, the birds cooperatively attack and harass the intruder, using their numbers against bigger creatures. The birds employ surprisingly elaborate defensive tactics, such as feint attacks and false retreats to lead enemies into ambushes.",
			"",
			"While food finding and nest building are the birds' first priorities during the breeding season, cyphergulls exhibit a range of personalities comparable to that of humans whenever survival is not at stake. For example, some are tricksters or collectors who like to annoy others or steal items just to stave off boredom, and most have favorite foods that they seek out. A surprisingly large number of cyphergulls, and nearly always the highest-ranked gulls in a colony, are philosophers who study the world around them, perform simple experiments, and understand the rudiments of logic and the scientific method. Some cyphergulls practice something akin to religious rituals, placing food and other objects on the ground to form runes and remaining motionless above them for hours at a time. Scholars speculate that the birds have a unique ability to interpret the secrets of the Cyphergate, and that studying the birds' runic writing could reveal ancient knowledge. Cyphermages in particular study cyphergulls in the wild, but clinging to guano-spattered rocks and rooftops to look at birds doesn't improve their reputation as obsessive eccentrics.",
			"",
			"Cyphergulls are curious about humanoids, often observing how they speak, what they eat, and how they live. A common superstition among the peoples of the Varisian Gulf states that killing a cyphergull brings bad luck, so the birds get away with thefts or irritations that would doom other birds. Cyphergulls are intelligent enough to learn languages that humanoid creatures speak, but they lack any speech-producing organs. Their communication sounds like the harsh wailing calls of ordinary gulls, but their system of shrieks is far more complex, and they are capable of communicating even abstract ideas like \"ambush,\" \"deal,\" \"future,\" or \"payment\" with their calls. This allows them to devise elaborate defensive and offensive tactics, or to negotiate trade deals.",
			"",
			"A 7th-level spellcaster with the [Improved Familiar](feat/improved_familiar) feat and an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a cyphergull as a familiar."

They have almost no role in corrupting mortals, as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to summon a genthodaemon.",

Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn't interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons.",
			"",

When battle grows so such a scope that the enemy becomes a faceless tide, or killing becomes casual and easy at long range, the act of waging war becomes completely dehumanized and soldiers become mere pieces in a perpetual machine. In such grim instances and the seeds are planted to send soldiers' souls to Abaddon.",
			"",

These elements are part of the daemon, not mere decorations, but any mechanical pieces merely resemble functional items and no longer work (for example, a daemon with a crossbow or rifle embedded in its arm cannot shoot it). Genthodaemons from the same band often resemble each other, including the shape of their metal parts, sometimes because their mortal selves were even in the same army and uniform.",
			"",
			"Though genthodaemons serve in the armies of all four Horsemen, they are most strongly associated with Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Her military background, strong discipline, and focus on the brutality of war resonates with the core of a genthodaemon's being. Those who (as mortals) were involved in acts of genocide have a morbid fascination with obscisidaemons and tend to follow them. Though genthodaemons were not the instigators of genocide in their mortal lives (which could have granted them higher status on Abaddon), those who participated in such acts feel a fawning admiration for the greater daemons who orchestrated such atrocities.",

			"Genthodaemons patrol the fortresses, cities, ruins, and wastelands of Abaddon looking for invaders, hostile non-daemons, and gangs of the hunted. Because they usually travel in groups, they are rarely preyed upon by other creatures and only have to face death when deployed as part of a Horseman's army. They are of low status but fulfill a necessary role as soldiers of Abaddon. Greater daemons treat them with the formal respect due their relative difference in rank, much like how a general might treat a common soldier. However, in the wars against mortal life, the Horsemen understand the value of suicidal missions and brazen sacrifice, and are not above sending countless genthodaemons to permanent destruction if it advances the cause of Abaddon. The genthodaemons accept this as their lot and never complain, as protests require effort, will, and the belief that there is a possibility of change-three things these shell-shocked creatures lost long ago.",
			"",
			"On the Material Plane, genthodaemons sometimes serve daemonic cults that are unworthy of a greater daemon's attention or lacking the power to summon a more powerful creature. As their magic is suitable for war and destruction, they have limited use to mortal cultists not intent on violence."

It \"falls\" vertically, horizontally, or diagonally and attacks any creature in its way, regardless of the number of creatures in its path. It can change directions each round to maximize the number of creatures it can slam, moving through other creatures' spaces without the need for an Acrobatics check regardless of their size, but it still provokes attacks of opportunity, and it can only attack a particular creature once per round. It can fall at its full speed while grappling a single creature without needing to succeed at a check to do so; while grappling, it can make slam attacks only against the grappled creature, and it can't use its grab ability.

Such a creature falls until it regains the ability to fly or it hits the ground, whichever comes first. This affects both natural and magical flight. This doesn't dispel magical flight effects, but instead suppresses them (functioning similar to antimagic field) for 1 round.

On the bleak plane of Abaddon, these awful creatures exist in a state of perpetual plummeting, never ceasing their movement. Even when addressed by ranking daemon lords, lapsudaemons never stop their falling motion or incessant screaming. Their lieges frequently must teleport to some great height and fall with them to maintain telepathic conversation. Lapsudaemons always shriek as they fall-a residual impulse taken from the last moment of their mortal lives. Loud cries and cold blasts of wind herald their approach as they teleport into combat mid-fall and continue their merciless assault.",
			"",
			"Lapsudaemons attack their victims by falling into them, whether they approach vertically or horizontally. They frequently employ spell-like abilities before attacking as many enemies as possible in melee, colliding for one mighty strike against each target until every foe is dead.

Its limbs protrude at awkward angles and strike out as it collides with its enemies. A lapsudaemon is between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike other daemons, lapsudaemons actively reproduce their own kind by searching out vulnerable creatures and dropping them from cruel heights. Longer gambits involve the daemons tracking down a gullible adventurer and offering the victim a deeply desired prize, high atop a mountain or spire. The desperation of the climb, combined with the hopelessness of a fatal fall, launches the dead soul to the volcanic peaks and stone towers of Abaddon. From the new lapsudaemon's perspective, the fall never ends. It slips out of the mortal realm only to land in its new, tortured afterlife, and then commences an eternity of perpetual motion.",
			"",

			"While most daemons have at least a modicum of subtlety and manipulative savvy, the average lapsudaemon falls far short of the mark in that regard, and so lapsudaemons are primarily employed by ambitious harbingers as killers for hire. Powerful mortals bring lapsudaemons to the Material Plane to engineer fatal \"accidents\" that kill their rivals while avoiding any suspicion of foul play. When a lapsudaemon finds itself without a task assigned by its liege, it typically retreats to some lofty aerie and spends its time ceaselessly falling toward the ground and teleporting high into the air just before impact. In the highest places of their home plane, storms of lapsudaemons fall from the sky like an apocalyptic rain. These screaming storms can last for months or years before enough lapsudaemons are called away to work elsewhere and the maelstrom subsides.",
			"",
			"While on other planes, lapsudaemons display an immediate grasp of local climate and geography. They naturally hide themselves far from civilization, where their constant falling and shouting goes unnoticed. They favor abandoned ruins and uninhabited wastelands that resemble their blasted home.",
			"",
			"Lapsudaemons are intelligent and cruel, but their plight allows them little opportunity to focus on studies or more advanced machinations. As such, they focus almost exclusively on tasks assigned by more powerful daemons. They frequently serve immortal harbingers such as Uaransaph or Geon, evil deities like Zyphus, or the Four Horsemen as assassins or insane heralds of an imminent military force. Where legends speak of a storm of falling daemons dropping mortals from the sky, they also speak of the ruin of entire city-states shortly thereafter."

More discerning nixudaemons assail the mortal merchant classes, driving entire firms to adopt competitive climates until the stress of achievement reveals itself in the form of failing health, or pushing lone inventors to complete magical theories with their dying breaths.

She also maintains special units of indentured prisoners under nixudaemon care, always breaking her promise to send her weary combatants home after a costly battle. The Horseman of Famine offers mere crumbs for sustenance to his legions of soldiers and slaves.

			"**Cloak of Souls (Su)** An obcisidaemon is attended by the souls it has captured-a mass often resembling a tattered, ethereal cloak or a roiling cloud of dust at its feet. When an obcisidaemon successfully captures a soul with its inherit soul ability, the soul becomes a part of its cloak of souls, taking up one soul slot. An obcisidaemon has a number of soul slots equal to its Charisma modifier (7 for the typical obcisidaemon). Destroying the daemon frees any souls in its cloak, though this does not return the deceased creatures to life. Any attempt to resurrect a creature whose soul is trapped in a cloak of souls requires a DC 28 caster level check. Failure results in the spell having no effect, while success tears the victim's soul free from the cloak and returns the creature to life as normal. If the daemon is in an unholy location, such as that created by an unhallow spell or on Abaddon, the DC of this caster level check increases by 2. Once a soul is consumed, only miracle or wish can restore the creature to life. As a swift action, an obcisidaemon can consume a soul from its cloak to achieve one of the following effects.",

			"**Inherit Soul (Su)** Whenever an obcisidaemon kills a creature with a weapon it wields, that creature must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be consumed by the daemon's cloak of souls. This is a death effect. If the cloak cannot consume this soul without exceeding its number of soul slots, the daemon can release a soul as a free action in order to make room for the new soul; otherwise, the killed creature automatically succeeds at its save and its soul is not absorbed. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Scorched Earth (Su)** A creature that dies within 60 feet of an obcisidaemon and is not drawn into the daemon's cloak of souls via its inherit soul ability must immediately succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or its body is utterly consumed in unholy fire equivalent to the effect of a destruction spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Warfare Mastery (Ex)** Although the typical obcisidaemon fights with a halberd, these daemons are proficient with all weapons. An obcisidaemon will sometimes eschew the typical +1 unholy halberd its kind favors for the favored weapon of the specific Horseman it serves.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The towering and devastating obcisidaemon personifies the darkest elements of war. Obcisidaemons strip away the veneer of honor and battlefield glory and the complexity of wartime tactics, leaving behind only the brutal and violent truth of conflict at its core, and then divest it of any humanity to reveal naught but scorched earth and genocide. Reflecting the disgraceful values of ethnic cleansing, depopulation, and all other forms of the clinical, systematic obliteration of civilian populations, obcisidaemons are among the most powerful members of daemonkind. These paragons of inhumanity arrive in the heart of great cities and leave wastelands of rubble and ashes in their wakes. Where an obcisidaemon walks, not even the ghosts of the dead remain to lament the destruction, for the daemon wipes out not only innocent individuals, but also their entire histories and bloodlines, ensuring that no future exists for its victims in any sense of the word.",
			"",
			"When a mortal commits an act of genocide in life and goes to Abaddon in death, it has a chance of forming into an obcisidaemon if it survives long enough as a member of the hunted. Such individuals rarely have trouble managing the unforgiving wastes, as they have already proven willing to destroy any and all possible allies in order to ensure their own survival, making betrayal an impossibility and solitude an inevitability. A vicious soul that eventually develops into an obcisidaemon becomes a lone, wandering mass of slaughter that acts as a harbinger of undiscriminating and unforgiving death to all who dare stand in its path. In life, the soul perhaps desired to kill only a particular chosen population; as an obcisidaemon, however, the being seeks the obliteration of all mortals.",
			"",
			"Peculiar to an obcisidaemon is the cloak of souls that seems to seep from its enormous body, a symbol of its destructive abilities providing onlookers a hint of the sheer scope of its murderous capabilities. When an obcisidaemon lays slaughter to entire populations, it does not feast on all of the souls at once, but captures victims for later use. When the fiend needs to unleash a particularly potent rampage upon a resistant population, it consumes these reserved souls in order to strengthen its powers and ensure its success in total annihilation. Some obcisidaemons have developed eldritch methods to craft and shape these soul fragments, and use them to drape themselves in the material.",
			"",
			"Devoted to the wanton, systematic slaughter of all mortal life, most obcisidaemons serve Szuriel, the Horseman of War, who shares similar ideals. In her service, obcisidaemons act as high-ranking officers at the head of armies of purrodaemons, to take advantage of their skill at the pragmatic art of organized massacres. Occasionally, an obcisidaemon instead serves Apollyon, occupying a similar role at the head of a titanic flight of leukodaemons sowing clouds of poison across miles of terrain in its passing. Sometimes, an amassed group of obcisidaemons might trail behind an invading daemonic army, guaranteeing that no trace of the butchered mortals remains among the ashes and salted earth. These obcisidaemons not only ensure that all life perishes, but that the land is thereafter uninhabitable by any living creatures.",
			"",
			"Some obcisidaemons serve no particular member of the Four Horsemen, instead choosing to function as independent agents of genocide and endless eons of wartime slaughter. These nomadic, self-serving beings wander from plane to plane, laying waste to one civilization after another. Some obcisidaemons intentionally spread their true names to the Material Plane, hoping for a foolish evil summoner to call upon them, knowing that no mere mortal could control their awesome power. Such summoners often end up among the first souls to be devoured and woven into the cloud of tormented spirits that cloaks the rampaging obcisidaemon.",

			"",
			"**Drain Soul (Su)** A creature grappled by an olethrodaemon's grab attack from its claws can be transferred to its mouth as a move action requiring no combat maneuver check. As a standard action, an olethrodaemon that begins its turn with an opponent grappled in either of its mouths can swallow the opponent by succeeding on another grapple check. If successful, the creature is swallowed into one of the olethrodaemon's many stomachs. These stomachs grind their contents and drain the life force from living creatures. Every round a creature remains in an olethrodaemon's stomach, it takes 4d8+18 points of damage and gains 1d4 negative levels. The creature can attempt to cut its way out of the olethrodaemon's stomach, but it suffers the chance of just cutting into another stomach chamber. An olethrodaemon's stomach is AC 20 and has 40 hit points. Once a creature deals enough damage to allow escape, it has a 50% chance to end up in another stomach chamber instead of escaping. Due to the multiple stomach chambers, an olethrodaemon can house and drain up to four medium creatures at one time. This ability otherwise functions as the swallow whole special attack. It is a DC 33 Fortitude save to remove negative levels gained in this fashion. This save is Constitution-based.",

Up to three times per day, but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, an olethrodaemon can expel a 120-foot line or a 60-foot cone of shrieking black smoke and wind from one of its mouths as a standard action. Any living creature in the area of this attack takes 20d10 points of damage from negative energy, or half on a successful DC 27 Reflex save. Undead creatures caught in this negative energy are healed for the same amount instead of damaged. The save DC for this effect is Charisma-based.",

These nihilistic behemoths roam the gray expanses of Abaddon, feasting on the souls of evil mortals damned to their realm. When on the Material Plane, olethrodaemons act as agents of destruction, spreading ruin and devouring mortal souls as they plow through cities and countrysides, bent on devastation. It's rare for a mortal to be able to control such a potent force, but sometimes mad spellcasters utilize effects like gate to urge an olethrodaemon to visit a devastating holocaust upon an enemy region-the olethrodaemon generally does not hold a grudge against a mortal that asks such a service from it.",

			"While not as intelligent or scheming as many other powerful daemons (or other fiends who match their power, for that matter), olethrodaemons remain dangerous foes. They do not generally wish to lead armies and gain power by control, but rather to revel in the evil purity of annihilation. Among olethrodaemons, the greatest desire is to be the one to devour the very last mortal soul. They angle and shove for this honor, often ceding a city or group of victims to a rival if they believe that, in so doing, they might gain the advantage of positioning to consume the final soul once the multiverse has been devoured.",

These creatures are known as paragons, and gain this level of power by pledging their loyalty to one of the Four Horsemen as a chosen agent of apocalypse. These advanced olethrodaemons specialize in their patron's particular method of annihilation, their abilities evolving to suit the method of ruin. An olethrodaemon paragon generally has from 4 to 8 additional Hit Dice, and is usually a CR 22 to CR 24 creature.",

			"**Dance of Death (Su)** A danse macabre is constantly surrounded by a 40-foot aura known as the dance of death, an endless gala of dancing spectral figures. Any living creature that enters the area of the dance of death must attempt a DC 27 Will save. On a failed save, the victim joins the ghostly dancers, takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain, and is affected as per [irresistible dance](spell/irresistible_dance) (CL 14th). A creature can attempt a new DC 27 Will save at the end of its turn to escape from the effects of a dance of death; otherwise, these effects persist for as long as the victim remains within the aura. The Constitution drain effect only occurs, however, after the initial failed saving throw. As victims cannot willingly move from the square in which they dance, the dance's effects end when the danse macabre moves to a point where the victim is no longer within its aura, the danse macabre is destroyed, or if the victim is physically removed from the area. A victim who succeeds at a save (whether from the original exposure or at a later point to successfully escape the effect) is immune to the dance of death of the same danse macabre for 24 hours. Dance of death is a visual, sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect, and blindness or deafness can provide protection from the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Deathless (Su)** As a manifestation of death incarnate, a danse macabre is not itself subject to permanent destruction. If reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes, only to rejuvenate at full hit points in 1d4 days. Only by destroying the creature and then casting hallow to consecrate the site it manifested upon prevents the undead monster's reappearance.",
			"",
			"**Incorporeal Scythe (Su)** A danse macabre wields an incorporeal scythe in combat that leaves deep and horrific wounds on any creature it strikes. Attacks made with this scythe are touch attacks and deal slashing damage, but are not modified by any of the monster's ability scores. A creature hit by a danse macabre's incorporeal scythe attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. Each time a danse macabre drains Constitution from a target, the danse macabre regains 5 hit points, regardless of the total number of Constitution points drained by the attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Lifesense (Su)** A danse macabre notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it had the [blindsight](umr/blindsight) ability. It also senses the strength of life forces automatically, as per [deathwatch](spell/deathwatch).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Danse macabres are the embodiment of the inevitability of death. They represent the ultimate equalizer of station, revealing in their dance of death the futility of all life. It has been said that, in the end, all mortal beings must face the fateful piper and dance to its tune. If such claims are true, then surely the danse macabre is the personification of such a dreadful doom.",
			"",
			"Danse macabres typically manifest as looming, black-cloaked skeletons, although they may appear in other sinister forms depending on personifications of death unique to the cultures near where they manifest, such as a fiery pillar, a pale child, or a man in a white mask. The crowd of dancing souls that surround these 10-foot-tall specters typically do little to dispel their ominous aura. While these ghostly images are entirely insubstantial and harmless, they also emanate faint, haunting music, as if a violin-led orchestra is playing along. When a victim succumbs to the creature's dance of death, the music becomes nearly deafening and the spectral figures appear almost real. The dancers and music cannot be interacted with, but visibly and audibly mark the boundaries of the danse macabre's dance of death aura.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"As undead creatures, danse macabres require nothing from their environments and contribute nothing in return. Their very presence typically suggests the murder of large numbers of creatures and, upon their horrifying manifestations, the deaths of others that happen too near. Yet a danse macabre will not simply form on the ruins of any battlefield or on the site of any mass murder. Instead, these malevolent spirits appear in areas where those who were slaughtered did not expect their deaths until, perhaps, the very last moment. At other times, a danse macabre (such as the one encountered in the ruins of Scarwall) manifests at a much later date in an area where revelry and sadism commingled, triggered into being long after those who died by a singularly potent pulse of necromantic energy or the vengeful thrashings of a bitter and angry god.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A danse macabre is a solitary creature that seeks nothing other than to call others to join its eternal celebration of the inevitable. It manifests only in locations tainted by untimely deaths-the sites of countless violent executions, estates overrun by deadly plagues, or battlefields where mass slaughters took place. In all of these locations, hundreds, if not thousands, of victims met their fates, often in rapid succession. None claim to know what terrible death count or measurement of psychic trauma is required to spawn a danse macabre, and indeed, some of the most gore-soaked sites on Golarion have never led to one of these beings' manifestations. An element of grim irony or communal revenge tends to inspire such hauntings, making it impossible to predict what catastrophe or massacre might cause one to appear.",
			"",
			"Some scholars of the undead suggest that danse macabres harbor no hatred for the living, but have a natural drive to bring mortals to their final state on an accelerated schedule. Witnesses of danse macabres, however, tend to disagree, and the appearance of a danse macabre can quickly depopulate a location via both its depredations and the flight of any survivors. Fortunately, these morbid shades rarely move far from the sites of their initial manifestations, leading to numerous tales of haunted halls where the dead endlessly dance in their eternal revel."

These tiny fey spend their time skulking around academies, guilds, and noble courts, stealing valuables and influencing mortal minds to create drama. When they do reveal their presence, danthiennes portray themselves as wish granters, offering to make a person's dreams come true in exchange for services and treasures. In reality, they have no special gift to grant wishes and rely on their magic, bluffs, and mundane theft to uphold their end of any bargain. Danthiennes rarely operate alone, usually enticing a desperate courtier into serving them in exchange for popularity. More rarely, they assemble lesser fey into mock courts, drafting unsuspecting mortals into their sometimes-deadly intrigues. As degenerate, urban cousins of nymphs, they have the ability to bond with mortal creatures and invest them with passion and confidence-but the bond is a deadly one, slowly draining the life force from their temporary partners and ultimately leaving them catatonic.",

Yet even today, dark folk are sometimes born bearing an uncanny likeness to the ancients that dark stalkers still imitate.

Yet it's not uncommon for a maturing caligni to threaten the caste-clans of dark folk society or offend an owb overlord; as a result, most caligni don't survive to adulthood in dark folk society, falling victim to suspicious accidents or mysterious murders. The canniest caligni foresee their people's treachery and leave, seeking homes elsewhere in the Darklands, and putting the talents they have learned among other dark folk to use in their own service, or in that of less treacherous allies.",

Caligni age at the same rate as half-elves, and don't typically breed true, instead giving birth to more common dark folk types-typically dark creepers.",

Invariably, several dark stalkers serve as leaders to dark creeper tribes, with all of the tribe's heavy work and labor falling on the diminutive shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement-to a dark creeper, a life in the servitude of a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.",

If the darkmantle misses its prey, it swoops back up and drops again until its prey is vanquished or the darkmantle is grievously injured (in which case the creature flutters back up to the roof to hide and hope its \"prey\" leaves it alone). The darkmantle's inborn ability to cloak the area around it in magical darkness gives it an additional advantage over foes that rely upon light to see.",
			"",
			"Darkmantles prefer to dwell and hunt in the caves and passageways that are closest to the surface, as these tend to possess more traffic for the monsters to feed upon. Yet they do not confine themselves to these dark caverns, and can sometimes be found dwelling in ruined fortresses or even in the sewers of bustling cities. Anywhere food is plentiful and there's a ceiling to cling to is a possible den for a darkmantle.",
			"",
			"A darkmantle's life cycle is swift-young grow to maturity in a matter of months, and most die of old age after only a few years. As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years the evolution of these creatures is similarly swift. In this manner, a cavern's ecosystem can have a significant effect on a group of darkmantles' appearance, abilities, and tactics. Aquatic caverns might develop darkmantles that can swim, while those beset with volcanism might generate darkmantles with a resistance to fire. Other darkmantle variants might develop much stonier hides, and instead of swooping down to crush prey might simply drop and pierce them through with their stalactite-like lengths. The deepest, darkest caverns are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized foes at once in their leathery folds."

			"Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the \"musicians at the dawn of Creation.\" Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes.",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them-the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadfly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and influence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily-though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships.",
			"",
			"### Dawn Piper Choirs",
			"",
			"A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World.",
			"",
			"At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag's coven possesses. They may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the First World."

Most of these two-headed pups die before reaching adulthood, but those that survive are larger, tougher, smarter, and able to speak as well as a worg can (add the advanced creature simple template). These \"death worgs\" have worms infecting their brains, driving them mad with rage.",

			"Death worgs bully their packs into submission, raid caravans and humanoid settlements, and kill more than they can eat. Most death worgs live only a year or two into adulthood, slain in needless fights for dominance or dropping dead as their worm-ravaged brains stop working."

			"Sometimes a pregnant death worm lays an especially promising egg among her brood, about twice as large as the others and with a nigh-impenetrable, brownspeckled shell. This egg requires even more warmth than the others in its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become death worm leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to fear them as well as to hold them in awe. Death worm leviathans possess powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for them to consume prey both large and small, and a single leviathan might consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated."

Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks any creative ability-it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered.",
			"",
			"These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians.",

			"The decapus is a fairly intelligent creature-an ambush predator that makes excellent use of its ability to weave magical visual illusions and to imitate the voices of other creatures it has heard speaking. Typical decapuses know only the Aklo tongue, but when they use their sound mimicry ability to imitate creatures speaking in other languages, they can typically form short (up to three words long) sentences even when imitating a language they don't actually know.",
			"",
			"The decapus's physical structure most resembles that of a bloated octopus with 10 tentacles. It lacks bones and takes its shape from its rubbery, muscular flesh. Most have sickly, olive skin patched with scraggly tangles of hair, with darker blue or purple coloration around their faces and crimson or orange tips to their tentacles. These tentacles are covered with tiny suction cups and hooks, affording them great skill at climbing or clutching prey. On the ground, though, they are slow, plodding creatures that flop and wriggle relatively inefficiently. As a result, they prefer regions like forest canopies, narrow fissures, stalactite forests, or other regions where they can use their climb speed.",
			"",
			"The decapus favors humanoid flesh over all other food; most are quite fond of gnome flesh in particular. This creature has an enormous appetite that often drives it to consume whatever food is available-the decapus is not above cannibalism when other food sources are scarce. For this reason, these monsters are largely solitary creatures, except when the urge to mate overwhelms their urge to feed. Females give birth to small litters of 2-4 live offspring. The females often need to defend them from the males, which, if left unsupervised, typically eat the newborn decapuses. The young mature rapidly, growing to full size after a mere 7 to 11 months, after which they depart to claim their own territories. Once a decapus reaches maturity, it can live to 100 years old-although their violent natures usually result in much shorter lifespans.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Much like common merfolk, deep merfolk have humanoid upper bodies and fish-like tails, but they are adapted for survival within the depths of the ocean. Their skin is both dark and transparent to help them blend with the sunless ocean depths. They sometimes adorn themselves with bioluminescent dye to create glowing spots on the skin along their tails, which they use both as a form of silent communication and to lure in prey when they hunt.",
			"",
			"Deep merfolk build villages along the sides of the deepest ocean trenches, where they hunt sea creatures and gather crustaceans from the ocean floor. They are capable hunters, and small hunting groups of deep merfolk have been known to take down sharks or other large creatures stalking the depths. When hunting, deep merfolk prefer to ambush their prey, often luring targets in with bioluminescence. They rely on their camouflage to hide within the crevices and cold sand until their traps can be sprung.",
			"",
			"Like their cousins, deep merfolk are highly protective of their tribes and homes and go to great lengths to keep strangers away. Spellcasters among their tribes often use illusions to hide deep merfolk dwellings, while rangers and hunters set up traps, ambushes, and false trails that lead interlopers into distant and dangerous areas of the deep ocean. If such misdirection and illusion fail, deep merfolk don't hesitate to launch proactive attacks against intruders-at a fair distance away from their homes if possible.",
			"",
			"While their appearance has led to legends of ties to dark powers and sinister agendas, most deep merfolk are simple folk with little interest in the world above the waves. A few secretive tribes worship the demon lord Dagon, but they view him as a dark protector they must appease, not a deity to emulate or for whom they feel any affection."

The largest deep one cities are located at places not far off shore, but nestled in vast submerged canyons unusually close to those coastlines. This proximity allows deep ones to pursue one of their favorite goals-commingling with and corrupting surface-dwelling humanoids. Unlike skum, a similar aquatic race that reproduces with surface dwellers, deep ones do so not out of a biological need but as a way to spread their blasphemous religion above the ocean waves. The hybrid children of deep ones and humans form a race of their own. These offspring typically live near others of their kind, assuming positions of leadership in their small towns.",
			"",
			"Deep ones usually worship the alien entities known as the Outer Gods or the Great Old Ones, with Cthulhu the foremost among them. Deep one settlements that contain a [deep one elder](monster/elder_deep_one) instead typically venerate that powerful deep one, who in turn serves one of the eldritch gods. Many deep ones gain levels as clerics, inciting religious fervor in their kinfolk and promoting their chosen deities as the greatest among the Outer Gods. Those few who instead choose to take up a less focused devotional path, such as that of an oracle, still venerate the Old Ones as a whole.",
			"",
			"Deep ones prefer to fight with their claws. If they do resort to manufactured weapons, they prefer piercing ones, as these function best underwater. They can also use wands and staves; deep ones who pursue the study of more powerful magic often learn to create magic items for their weaker kinfolk to wield.",
			"",
			"A deep one typically stands about 7 feet tall, but its hunched gait and lumbering stance can make it appear shorter when it shambles ashore. An average deep one weighs 300 pounds."

The deeplit makes a single Charisma check against all light sources within 20 feet (DC = 10 + the flame's spell level; nonmagical torches and lanterns have a DC of 10, while alchemical light sources have a DC of 11). Affected light sources are immediately extinguished. If the deeplit consumes a light source that is at least normal brightness, it can either immediately regurgitate or swallow the light as a free action. Regurgitating the light deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 15-foot cone, and blinds affected creatures for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage and dazzles victims instead of blinding them. Swallowing the light enhances the deeplit's palelight aura for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. Deeplit are immune to this ability, and to any damage inflicted by regurgitated light.",

Fifteen feet long and weighing several tons, they are most commonly encountered deep below ground, particularly near underground water sources.

			"As a created race, delvers have remained remarkably static in their evolution, save for a steady increase in their collective intelligence. It may be that the lack of speciation (or even cultural differences) over the millennia of their existence is the result of guidelines hard-coded into them by their former masters, or it may simply be that the delvers are correct in their assumption that theirs is the perfect form for a burrowing creature.",
			"",
			"Whatever the truth, any two delvers are remarkably similar, with only slight differences in coloration and size to tell them apart. The only exceptions to this rule are those delvers pushed to madness by their metallic intoxication. These berserk delvers gain either the ability to rage as a 1st-level barbarian once per day or the continual effects of a confusion spell, and sometimes both. The duration of this madness depends upon the delver's level of intoxication, as adjudicated by the GM."

A target can attempt a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw for half damage. Creatures that fail the saving throw are also permanently deafened. Because of the evil and extraplanar nature of this attack, a remove blindness/deafness spell can negate this deafness only if the caster succeeds at a DC 31 caster level check, but limited wish or any stronger similar magic can cure the deafness without requiring such a check. The saving throw is Constitution-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Squamous demodands were among the last of the Abyssal demodands into which the thanatotic titans breathed life. As the Abyss began to crawl with the charred, melted forms of shaggy, slimy, tarry, and other demodands, the early members of this horrific race began to sense a missing element in their masters' plans. The demodands knew that they were created as a race of worshipers meant to wreak as much destruction as possible on their progenitors' behalf, and though they wielded great and disgusting powers, the demodands knew that they needed more sheer muscle to truly become a force to be reckoned with in the multiverse. And so the idea for the squamous demodands' creation came not from their godlike creators but from these sycophantic servants that wished to see the titans' will made manifest. After the demodands came to an agreement-an uncommon occurrence for the chaotic creatures-that they needed much more powerful allies, the shaggy demodands approached their creators with the idea. Suppressing the urge to quash their upstart creations, the thanatotic titans admitted the merit of creating an enormous, mighty, monstrous type of demodand to serve in their armies as wanton destroyers that would herald the titans' vision of a godless multiverse. Thus the titans formed squamous demodands by fusing the flesh of shaggy demodands with armor-like scales pulled from the essence of the Abyss itself. Squamous demodands still stand today as the most terrible, hulking, and murderous of their kind.",
			"",
			"Because each type of demodand had already found a distinct place in the scattered hierarchy of the titans' armies' shaggy demodands as generals, slimy demodands as shock troops, and tarry demodands as grunts-the demodands worried that the new creations might supplant them all. To allay these fears and ensure that the mighty squamous demodands would actually obey orders, the titans made their new pets as dim witted as they were ferocious. Instead of serving any subtle tactical function in demodand armies, squamous demodands are pure, unadulterated muscle, and they almost always act at the behest of a higher-ranking shaggy demodand or a thanatotic titan. Towering blocks of claws, muscle, and scales, squamous demodands have four arms and a pair of wings ideal for causing maximum destruction. Squamous demodands stand over 50 feet tall and weigh around 120 tons.",
			"",
			"Because they are far less savvy than others of their race, squamous demodands are guided by their baser instincts when left to their own devices. Although they delight in crushing mountains under their fists, their hunger for ever-increasing amounts of flesh and the visceral feeling of blood running down their gaping maws drives them more than anything else. Other demodands-particularly shaggy demodands, which have spent millennia learning how to focus these killer urges' have to make sure that squamous demodands first finish destroying structures that stand in their armies' way before they are allowed to gorge on their kills.",
			"",
			"Demodand generals typically outfit their larger armies with at least one squamous demodand. Adding more of these beasts is sometimes a challenge, for they can easily view each other as rival predators, and squamous demodands turning on each other puts an army at risk. Rarely, shaggy demodands or thanatotic titans put together a battalion of squamous demodands meant to visit abject ruin upon a wide expanse or an opposing army, but such strategic overtures are usually a sign of desperation. Most demodand generals would rather risk massive losses in their ranks than potentially deal with a battalion of their squamous kin blindly raging. That said, a few shaggy demodands still gamble on squamous demodand battalions, likely due to both their sheer destructive efficiency and a well-kept demodand secret: shaggy demodands that earn the most favor from the thanatotic titans are next in line for transformation into squamous demodands.",
			"",
			"Due to their low intelligence and their animalistic focus on feeding and destruction, squamous demodands have very little society to speak of, even by Abyssal creatures' standards. They are content following the orders of shaggy demodands, as long as they are provided with sufficient food and opportunities for obliteration. Occasionally, however, shaggy demodands get caught up in internal feuds or turn on each other. In these cases, squamous demodands typically follow the lead of the general that proves itself the strongest, although a squamous demodand that has followed the orders of a single commander for long spans of time may view its superior protectively, almost as an adult child would an aging parent. These are the situations that often turn most destructive for demodands, as the squamous demodand either defends its general or exacts vengeance on its behalf, causing a massive intrademodand war either way. When this happens, only the thanatotic titans can rein in their monstrous creations, and sometimes even they have trouble doing so if multiple squamous demodands are involved.",

Their top-heavy builds mean they have difficulty standing upright and normally assume a hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all fours, like apes. An andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 450 pounds.",
			"",
			"An andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who hated women and used his or her power to oppress and demean them, such as a tyrant who selectively enforced laws against women, a priest who preached that women are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his wives and daughters for their supposed failures. For this reason andrazkus are known to scholars as -misogyny demons.- Few of these souls dared to greater crimes (which would cause their souls to become incubi or babaus), nor were they once mortals who hated women but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku only forms from a soul filled with sufficient hatred toward women to provoke action, but that is hampered by enough cowardice to prevent it from performing acts of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but an especially misogynistic evil female creature might become an andrazku in the Abyss.",
			"",
			"An andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey's fear, but becomes frustrated if the hunt lasts for too long. Despite these demons' masculine appearance and aggression, most of them are impotent and some completely lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless. Their nature is to berate, degrade, and beat; they tend to kill only when they feel an urge to eat, when their stymied passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are mocked for their shortcomings.",
			"",
			"An andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists (often contemptuously slapping foes, minions, and prey with an open hand), but a vicious one may use a scourge and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor. Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase down their prey, batter it for a while, and then release it, giving it enough of a head start that it thinks it has a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down (using locate creature and teleport) to repeat the cycle again.",
			"",
			"An andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark its minions and slaves with a scar on one side of the face indicating the demon's ownership. The demon typically uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it is cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is resistant or immune to cold, the demon uses a knife to carve its mark into one side of the creature's face.",
			"",
			"Because of their long-simmering tempers and magical abilities, andrazkus are often called \"cold demons,\" and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms such as Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their intolerance of fire (despite their demonic resistance to it) and the cowardly nature of their origin-sin make them laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus and incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and prone to take out their frustrations on weaker creatures - especially if said creatures are female.",
			"",
			"Andrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out of hard-packed snow. Some take advantage of their cold immunity and strong swimming ability to live in simple shelters on ice floes. An andrazku's hooves and huge hands allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough stone, preventing it from slipping and allowing it to use much of the vertical space in its lair to store treasure and observe intruders.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Demon](family/demon)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Andrazkus loathe associating with more powerful female demons in any way, and curse under their breath at mariliths and similar demons of great stature. Among female demons of similar power, they are quick with clever words, believable boasts, and secret confessions of desire, but these are all lies to disguise the hatred crackling beneath the surface. If given the opportunity, an andrazku would capture and torture a succubus merely because she is female (though a succubus is physically more powerful than a lone misogyny demon, and the hairy brutes have to gang up to have any chance of defeating a \"weakling\" succubus). Succubi and mariliths are aware of these simple-minded feelings held by andrazkus and they delight in tormenting the brutish creatures. Those female demons know they hold greater strength and power than andrazkus, and they enjoy lording over the creatures, even going so far as to kidnap them from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs and forcing the creatures into servitude.",
			"",
			"Andrazkus band together for strength, using their telepathy to silently coordinate their attacks. They often taunt their prey telepathically, either with words, promises of violence, or mocking laughter.",
			"",
			"When set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku usually forces itself into a position of power over a humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant tribes, especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones find better company among girallons and dire apes.",
			"",
			"### Summoning Andrazku",
			"",
			"Andrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and strength. They like offers of weapons and strengthenhancing items as payment for their services. They can be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku to undertake a mission other than these kinds of tasks takes a -2 penalty. A female summoner has a -10 penalty on all Charisma checks made to bargain unless the caster acts inferior and unworthy of the demon's aid."

With no need to eat (although most babaus relish the flavor of mortal meat on their thin, raspy tongues), a babau can wait in ambush for years or decades-their inhuman patience in anticipating a well-conceived murder also setting them apart from the other denizens of the Abyss. Babaus obsess over the act of killing and take great pride in their grisly art, often leaving behind some form of grim marker or obscure signature, whether it be a distinctive modus operandi, an unnerving token, or other profane evidence.",

The demon these folk fear is the balor, and that fear is justly placed, for few demons can match the mighty balor in strength or brutality.",
			"",
			"On the Abyss, most balors serve demon lords as generals or captains (those balors who don't are even more potent, and are known as balor lords-see below). A balor typically commands vast legions of demons, and while it often lets these slavering and eager minions fight its battles, the balor is far from a coward. If presented with an opportunity to join a fight, few balors choose to resist.",
			"",
			"In combat, a balor relies upon its spell-like abilities to fight foes wise enough to avoid melee range, favoring destructive powers like fire storm or implosion and saving dominate monster for use against the rare foe it would prefer to capture alive. A balor usually uses telekinesis to disarm ranged weapons or pull foes into melee-with the use of a quickened telekinesis, a balor can use the latter tactic and still inflict a full-round attack on a hapless foe. A balor reduced to fewer than 50 hit points almost always seeks to flee via teleportation, but if that and flight prove impossible it seeks to position itself such that, if it is slain, its death throes are as devastating as possible to the enemy host.",
			"",
			"A balor stands 14 feet in height and weighs 4,500 pounds. Only the cruelest mortal souls can fuel the creation of a balor-unlike in the cases of most other demons, it often takes multiple souls of powerful villains to trigger the birthing of a new balor.",
			"",
			"### Balor Lords",
			"",
			"Even more terrible than the typical balor are those who do not call a demon lord their master, but instead are masters themselves. A balor lord typically rules over a region no larger than half the size of the realm in which it resides (as only full demon lords can command the rule of an entire Abyssal realm), and even though most balor lords rule much smaller regions (generally areas comparable in size to a single continent), their power is vast indeed.",
			"",
			"A balor lord is typically a CR 21 to CR 25 monster (a range shared with the various unique nascent demon lords, with the range of CR 26 and above being the domain of the demon lords themselves), and as such serves quite well as the final villain in a long-running campaign. The majority of balor lords have several levels of barbarian, fighter, or ranger (although ranger balor lords never form bonds with animals), but some instead have levels of bard, rogue, sorcerer, or wizard. Cleric balor lords are unknown, as they see themselves as objects of worship, not the other way around, although rumors persist of powerful balor clerics that directly serve demon lords or even evil gods.",
			"",
			"In addition to any benefits a balor lord might gain from its class levels, all balor lords possess one additional unique ability over and above those granted by its race and class. Listed here are three sample balor lord abilities, but these samples are by no means the entirety of the strange powers a balor lord might wield.",

These conflicts often arise from border disputes between demonic realms, or when one demon lord finds an excuse to attack another. But many of these immense wars have no good reason at all, for gallus eagerly foment war for war's sake; they are master engineers of martial strife. These hateful, destructive demons arise from the souls of warmongers and war profiteers-nefarious leaders, corrupt priests, or subversive merchants who used their power to perpetuate existing wars or even to trigger new ones, all for the express purpose of personal gain or sadistic pleasure.",
			"",
			"Known to some as warmonger demons, the gallus are not as enormous as many of the other powerful demons; despite their near-human size, however, they are among the deadliest of demonkind. Standing 8 feet tall and weighing 450 pounds, these creatures have wolf like (but hairless) horned heads, batlike wings, and pale flesh. Their feet end in hooves, and their tails resemble those of lions. Gallus can assume humanoid shape as well, and typically do so when interacting with mortals, allowing them to more easily sow seeds of war among those they interact with.",
			"",
			"These demons are relatively difficult to summon- gate spells can conjure them from the Abyss, but few other mortal spells can call them forth. As a result, most gallus encountered outside the Abyss have traveled there via portals or similar methods. Gallus are innately crafty creatures; when coming to a new world, they resist their natural urges to destroy in favor of infiltration. Extraordinarily patient, they can spend decades or more in disguise as they subtly build their influence and acquire positions of power; they then use those positions to incite government officials and other powerful individuals to wage war on their neighbors. Only when the hostilities have completely devastated their host, leaving it in smoking ruins, do gallus shed their human flesh and appear in their true form to gloat and torment the conflict's few survivors before moving on to seek fresh victims.",
			"",
			"In the Worldwound, gallus serve an additional role as commanders in the numerous demonic armies. Many control multiple divisions, each led by a marilith general, and report in turn to one of the Worldwound's leaders, like Khorramzadeh, Areelu, or Aponavicius. But not all of the Worldwound's gallus command armies. Those who serve Baphomet primarily utilize their deceptive natures to infiltrate various Mendevian mercenary orders, Mammoth Lord barbarian tribes, settlements on the fringes of more civilized lands, and other factions arrayed against the Worldwound. From within those groups, they serve as advisors, urging those they've infiltrated into launching ill-timed or poorly planned attacks on their demonic foes. These gallus occasionally feed their humanoid \"allies\" legitimate intelligence about demonic fortifications or troop movements, knowing that a little truth can go a long way in encouraging mortals to act upon their more violent urges.",

Since in most cases a known zygomind is an obvious threat (thus breaking the fascinated effect), this ability mainly assists an undetected zygomind, though even creatures who know of the zygomind's threat are still exposed to the zygomind's seamless reality ability if they fail the saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Seamless Reality (Su)** Any creature that enters a zygomind's space, fails its save against the zygomind's fascinating aura, or is subjected to the zygomind's soporific spores must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or be sucked into the zygomind's mindscape. The zygomind's mindscape is veiled and harmful, and time moves quickly for creatures inside it. It otherwise acts in all ways as the plane from which the affected creature entered the mindscape. Unlike the bodies of creatures whose consciousnesses are stuck in other mindscapes, the bodies of creatures whose minds are stuck in a zygomind's mindscape are able to move; they invariably approach the zygomind at rate of 5 feet per round. Once within the zygomind's space, the victims lie prone, allowing the zygomind to slowly absorb the body's nutrients as their minds wander a false reality. A creature caught in the zygomind's fascinating aura must succeed at a saving throw to avoid entering the mindscape each round it remains fascinated. A creature is not aware that it has entered the mindscape. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Soporific Spores (Ex)** A creature that comes into physical contact with a zygomind must succeed at a DC 29 Will save or fall asleep for 1d4 days. Such creatures take a -5 penalty on saves and checks to realize they are in the zygomind's mindscape. Creatures that succeed at their saves are immune to the zygomind's soporific spores for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Spore Explosion (Su)** When a zygomind is destroyed, it explodes in a cloud of ethereal spores that typically find their way back into space, sometimes floating along the solar winds for thousands of years before gravitating back toward a new bastion of intelligent life.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Civilizations across the Material Plane fear many disasters-hurricanes, earthquakes, plagues, and more- but few things spell doom for a settlement with such insidious certainty as a flourishing zygomind. These massive fungi float through space as ethereal spores, spreading their cloying mycelia wherever creatures of intelligence thrive. The presence of a young zygomind is at first innocuous and difficult to detect, as animals and other creatures of low intelligence begin to disappear. Eventually, more intelligent creatures track their prey to the site and become lost themselves, wandering back toward civilization days or even weeks later as infected undead, dominated with the instinct to bring ever-greater intellects into the zygomind's power. Over the course of only a few months, a growing zygomind can decimate a small city, rapidly accelerating its growth into a 500-foot monstrosity.",
			"",
			"By the time a zygomind becomes visible above the treeline, it is likely too late for the intelligent life of the region; the zygomind's insidious psychic trap defeats any resistance that most such creatures can mount. Frequently, those investigating the zygomind slip seamlessly into an alternate reality without realizing that they've fallen under the power of the very thing they sought to destroy. A zygomind's mindscape only becomes more convincing as it subtly enslaves more and more minds-the fungus can reconstruct whole cities, even as the real-world inhabitants of those settlements proceed somnambulistically into the zygomind. Entire armies have marched upon mature zygominds, intent on ridding the region of the scourge, only to halt their assault mid-charge and plod calmly, rank by rank, into the zygomind's physical and psychic grasp. The cruel irony of the plant's trap is that these soldiers likely live the rest of their lives believing themselves victorious, forming memories of defeating the insidious fungus, returning home to their loving families, and eventually dying after a long and productive life, while in the real world the zygomind's mycelium sucks the nutrients from their helpless bodies and transforms them into undead minions.",
			"",
			"The wide-ranging habits of a zygomind's minions make the fungi relatively easy to track for those who know of the obscure creatures. Stories of zombies or other virulent undead can sometimes point toward a zygomind's influence, especially if the undead's victims tend to wander off in a certain direction after infection. A particularly dedicated adventurer could follow one of these enthralled creatures for the entire journey back to the fungus, though the pace the victim sets often proves excruciatingly slow to all but the most patient individuals. Subtler clues could hint at a zygomind's influence as well, such as a sudden rash of sleepwalking in a nearby town or whispered rumors about a logging camp whose workers all disappeared into the forest together without a word.",
			"",
			"Those with the wherewithal to follow the clues to the zygomind invariably encounter a horde of slowly shuffling, mindscape-bound victims on their way to offer themselves to the fungus. Attempting to shake these victims out of their torpor produces no effect, and forcibly restraining them is a temporary solution at best. Occasionally, certain brave or foolhardy adventurers submit themselves willingly to a zygomind's mindscape, hoping to free the minds of those trapped within. This is a path fraught with peril, though, for the adventurers' bodies approach the zygomind at the same rate, and the adventurers' consciousnesses face the monumental challenge of trying to prove to a city of people that their world is a false construction. Powerful psychic spellcasters have had some luck helping victims escape by using spells such as mindscape door, but such forcible egress from the zygomind's mindscape draws the attention of the zygomind itself, and it lashes out instinctively at these psychic invaders.",
			"",
			"Depending on how long a zygomind has infested an area, a creature who is able to avoid being trapped in the mindscape could find a veritable hoard of weapons, armor, and magic items within the cage of its body, discarded as the bodies that brought them withered away, then rose as undead. Of course, a canny adventurer must always be aware that the discovery of such a trove within the fungus could simply be one more illusion imposed by the zygomind's mindscape. Once a creature has had contact with a zygomind, it can never again truly be certain that the world it inhabits is the real one without the aid of powerful psychic magic or of those familiar with the logic and perils of mindscapes-yet even then, the zygomind smoothly creates the illusions of such individuals and abilities to reassure victims that they are indeed free.",
			"",
			"When fully grown, a zygomind can reach a height of 500 feet, and its mycelium can stretch for 10 miles in all directions, comprising hundreds of tons of biomass. The main cage is usually 25-40 feet in diameter and weighs around 40,000 pounds."
