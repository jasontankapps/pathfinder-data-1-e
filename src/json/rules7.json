			"There comes a point in nearly every campaign when someone - either one of the players or the GM - wants to create a new race. Sometimes the GM needs a new race to fill a story or ecological niche in her campaign world. Such races may be as simple as elves who dwell in an arctic climate or as complex as clockwork giants from another plane of existence. Perhaps a player wants to play a monstrous race, or has been inspired by some piece of fiction or flight of creative fancy and wants to create a race for a new character concept not yet seen in Pathfinder. The following rules allow GMs, or even players with GM oversight, to create new races that are balanced and mesh with the core races.",

			"In addition, these rules allow you to create powerful races meant to take on more challenging encounters than those typically faced by the core races. You can create new races, model a race after an existing monster, or even \"power up\" core races in order to play those races side-by-side with more powerful new races."

			"This race builder allows you to create a new race by buying racial qualities and racial traits with Race Points (RP). There are a number of differences between racial qualities and racial traits. The main difference is that racial qualities are mandatory (you must make a choice for each category of racial qualities provided in these rules), whereas racial traits are optional. There are six categories of racial qualities, including type, subtypes (if any), size, base speed, ability score modifiers, and languages. Racial traits present a number of interesting options for the race you are creating, from expanded modes of movement and bonuses on skill checks to even stranger powers, like a frightening croak attack or the ability to change shape. Racial traits are split up into a number of different categories, such as defense, offense, and magical traits.",
			"",
			"Before you buy racial qualities and traits, you must determine the power level of your race. The GM decides this based on the needs of her campaign. The power level of the race determines the number of RP you get to build the race, as well as the maximum number of racial traits you can choose from each racial trait category and what kinds of traits you can take from those categories.",

Calculate the party's adjusted average party level, and use that number, rather than the actual APL, when creating encounters and adventures for the group.

The first difference is that each race type assumes members of the race are roughly humanoid in shape and have two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. This is important so that a race can take advantage of all the various magic item slots available to characters and can utilize the standard weapon and armor options. The second difference is that all of these race types are 0-Hit Dice creatures, which means that their Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saving throw progression, skill points, class skills, and weapon and armor proficiencies are based on the class levels each member of a race takes.",

			"Like other racial qualities, each type has a point cost. The baseline creature type - humanoid - costs 0 RP, and offers the most flexibility when choosing other racial traits and racial abilities, while a more expensive type typically grants less flexibility. The cost of the race's type also determines which of these types you can choose from based on the power level of the race you are creating. You cannot pick a type with an RP cost equal to or higher than the maximum RP cost of the power level of the race you are building. This means you must build an advanced race if you want to make a race with the undead type, or a monstrous race if you are building a race with the construct type. If you want to make a construct- or undead-themed creature at lower power levels, see Special Subtypes for some lower-cost options.",
			"",
			"Sometimes a race type may grant racial traits as features. For instance, the construct type grants members of that race darkvision 60 feet. If this is the case, the cost of that racial trait is already paid for when you buy the type quality, and this trait does not count toward the maximum when you buy racial traits from the corresponding racial trait category. For instance, when buying other vision traits for a construct race, the darkvision 60 feet feature that race already has does not count toward the limit of five traits from the senses racial trait category for the race. Traits granted by the race type still count for meeting any other trait prerequisites.",
			"",
			"The humanoid type requires that you pick at least one subtype for your race, and the outsider (native) type allows you to make a decision about what other plane your race may have ties to. Keep track of your race's creature type, any subtypes it has, and any planes it has ties to. Sometimes a race's type, subtypes, or planar ties serve as prerequisites for some racial traits. For instance, you must have the ratfolk subtype to take the rodent empathy racial trait, and you must have ties to Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell in order to take the fiendish sorcery racial trait."

Smashing an object is like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your combat maneuver check is opposed by the object's AC. Generally, you can smash an object only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.",
			"",
			"***Armor Class:*** Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don't usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object's Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier (see Table 7-11) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (-5 penalty to AC), but also an additional -2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.",
			"",
			"***Hardness:*** Each object has hardness-a number that represents how well it resists damage. When an object is damaged, subtract its hardness from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object's hit points (see Table 7-12, Table 7-13, and Table 7-14).",

Some energy types might be particularly effective against certain objects, subject to GM discretion. For example, fire might do full damage against parchment, cloth, and other objects that burn easily. Sonic might do full damage against glass and crystal objects.",

			"***Saving Throws:*** Nonmagical, unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving throws, so they are always fully affected by spells and other attacks that allow saving throws to resist or negate. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the character's saving throw bonus).",

However, there is much more you can do in town in between adventures-your character might want to practice with a military school, start a guild, build a temple, train a new pet, and so on. Normally you and the other PCs would have to compete for the GM's attention so you can explain what your characters want to do and haggle over how much time that should take. With the rules presented here, what you can do with a day of downtime is clearly spelled out, allowing you to get on with your plans.",
			"",
			"Even if you don't want to use the rules to earn extra gold or throw your weight around in town as a business owner, there are campaign and roleplaying benefits for using the downtime system. For example, if you build or buy a house, you have a comfortable, private place to rest between adventures. By adding a few more rooms, you can easily convert a house into a base of operations for your adventuring party; it would count as \"very familiar\" for the purpose of your teleport spells, and if it includes an altar to your deity, you can use it as the destination for a [word of recall](spell/word_of_recall).",
			"",
			"Additionally, if you have a business, the GM can insert campaign events and story awards tied to it. You might earn XP as a story award when your business earns its first 1,000 gp or first 100 points of Goods. If you own a restaurant, the king might hear about your famous soup recipe and arrange a visit to sample it. If you have a tavern, it could become a hangout for young adventurers hoping your luck and success rub off on them. In either case, the GM may award you Influence instead of XP for these events.",

			"Of course, having a building or organization has its risks. Your enemies might try to burn down your tavern or attack you at your home. If you start a thieves' guild and are away for months at a time, a personable rogue might take over the guild and turn it against you. If a dragon attacks the town, it could destroy your house (and give you a perfect setup for you taking the [Nemesis](feat/nemesis) story feat). Investing yourself in a community means you're part of it-for good or ill. The GM should remember to use that investment to enrich the campaign, not just exploit it as a way to attack your character or strong-arm you into adventures.",
			"",
			"The downtime system is designed to put much of the power and decision making for non-adventuring tasks in the hands of the players. These rules assume the reader is a player making decisions about what his character does during downtime. However, the GM is still in charge of the campaign and the final judge of what is possible using this system; these rules simply take much of the burden away from busy GMs, allowing them more time to work on creating adventures and other campaign issues."

			"",
			"***Build Points:*** A build point (BP) is a unit of wealth and productivity used in the [kingdom-building rules](rule/kingdom_building). The downtime system doesn't normally use BP, but if you are using the kingdom-building rules, you may have ways to spend BP as part of your downtime. BP are a larger-scale combination of Goods, Influence, Labor, and Prestige.",
			"",
			"***Business:*** A business is a building or organization that earns you one or more kinds of capital, such as a blacksmith's shop or thieves' guild.",
			"",
			"***Capital:*** Capital is any sort of resource you can spend as part of downtime. The various types of capital are build points, gp, days, Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic. You can spend capital on various downtime activities such as constructing buildings, recruiting followers, and retraining your feats. If any situation or event causes you to lose more capital than you have, your capital is reduced to 0-you can't go into debt.",
			"",
			"***Day:*** The downtime system measures time in days rather than hours, minutes, or rounds. Most downtime activities require you to spend at least 1 day on the activity.",
			"",
			"***Followers:*** Followers are a type of Labor gained from the [Leadership](feat/leadership) feat or other methods. Followers can be used like Labor, but aren't expended like capital because they are loyal to you and don't leave as soon as an activity is completed. For more information, see [Using Followers](rule/using_followers).",
			"",
			"***Goods:*** Goods represent physical items necessary for an activity, which can be permanent fixtures or consumable items. For building an inn, Goods are the materials used to build the structure, the tables and chairs, and the food and beverages you plan to sell. Goods as capital are an abstraction so that you don't need to keep track of gathering things like stones for a building's foundation, timber for the walls, ingredients for the menu, and so on. Goods might also represent natural resources (such as fertile soil or a spring), in which case you're not literally moving these items to a specific location-instead, you're spending capital to acquire a location with those resources.",
			"",
			"***Gold Pieces:*** Gold pieces (or gp) constitute the normal money your character has, such as from looting monsters or earning a living with Craft or Profession checks. Many downtime activities require you to spend gp.",
			"",
			"***Influence:*** Influence represents your ability to get other people in the settlement to perform favors for you or use their skills to accomplish things (as opposed to Labor, which involves hard physical work). This includes getting a merchant to change the terms of a contract, or convincing a politician to do you a favor.",
			"",
			"***Labor:*** Labor represents using workers to accomplish tasks. This includes hiring carpenters to construct a building, hiring thugs to extort shopkeepers, using assistants to help you craft items or tend injuries, or hiring employees to run your business while you're away.",
			"",
			"***Magic:*** Magic represents magical power at your disposal. Some activities, such as healing sick peasants in the slums or constructing a magical library, specifically require you to spend Magic.",
			"",
			"***Organization:*** This is a group of people who do what you say (such as a cult, thieves' guild, or mercenary company). An organization may or may not have a base of operations.

These rules interface with both ends of that scale, and aren't intended to completely replace them. In many cases, they might slightly contradict what is presented in the [kingdom-building rules](rule/kingdoms_and_war). For example, the kingdom-building rules allow you to construct any type of building in 1 month, even a grand palace, which would take much longer using the downtime system. That is because the leader of a kingdom can spend build points to muster incredible amounts of resources and make things happen, far beyond what even a popular hero can do by spending gold and calling in favors. If your GM is using both the downtime system and the kingdom-building rules and there are conflicts over how to handle a situation, the GM decides which method is used, but should lean toward whichever rules seem most appropriate and efficient for the task."

			"Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic are the backbone of the downtime system. These types of capital are necessary for completing many downtime activities. You can gain such capital in one of two ways: by purchasing it or by earning it.",
			"",
			"***Purchasing Capital:*** The easiest way to gain capital is to purchase it by buying materials, bribing people, paying administrative fees, hiring workers, and so on. Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic each have a specific gp value for this method, listed in the Purchased Cost column of Table 2-1: Capital Values. If you need one of these types of capital, you can spend gp to get it, just like buying a +1 sword or hiring a spellcaster to cast remove curse costs you gp. For example, Goods have a Purchased Cost of 20 gp each; if you need to spend 5 points of Goods to repair your tavern, you can spend 100 gp (5 &times; 20 gp) to purchase the necessary Goods. Purchasing capital is fast, but expensive.",
			"",
			"***Earning Capital:*** Many downtime activities, such as doing mundane work with a Craft or Profession skill or gaining the day-to-day profits for running an inn or tavern, allow you to earn capital (see the [Earn Capital](rule/earn_capital) activity). Earning capital is like using an item crafting feat to create a magic item: You have to put in some work to make the item, but you pay only half the normal price for it. If a downtime activity's description says it generates capital, you can earn that amount of capital by spending the required amount of downtime and gp on it; the gp cost for the capital is half the normal cost, as listed in the Earned Cost column of Table 2-1. For example, Influence has an Earned Cost of 15 gp per point, so if you want to socialize in town to generate 3 points of Influence, you must use a day of downtime and spend 45 gp (3 &times; 15 gp) to earn those 3 points of Influence. Earning capital takes longer, but is much cheaper than just buying it outright. It is easier to keep track of your earned capital if you pay for it as soon as you earn it; otherwise, you also need to track earned capital you don't yet have (because you haven't paid gp for it yet).",

If you aren't using the downtime system to earn capital (and are instead awarded capital as a treasure reward, for example), or you want to purchase something quickly by spending gold pieces, remember to double the listed gp value to find the *Purchased Cost* of the item or service.",
			"",
			"Think of purchasing capital as a stranger coming to town and throwing lots of money around to make things happen. It's effective, but the locals are inclined to overcharge for their work and may resent the obvious display of wealth. Earning capital is a person working with the locals and trying to be a part of the community in order to get things done. It takes longer, but the locals give a fair price and appreciate the person's honest dealings and lack of arrogance.",
			"",
			"When you purchase or earn capital, you may either immediately apply it toward a downtime activity of your choice or save it for later (this is explained more over the rest of this section). As capital is an abstraction, the details of the work are up to you and the GM to decide; for roleplaying purposes, you should explain it however is most appropriate for your character and campaign.",
			"",
			"***Unskilled Work:*** You may spend 1 day working in a settlement to earn 5 sp. (Normally, an untrained laborer or assistant earns 1 sp per day, but the downtime system assumes your class abilities mean you are a cut above a typical unskilled laborer and are able to earn more from a day's work.) Alternatively, you can choose to instead earn 1 point of Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic. Neither approach requires any particular knowledge or skill check.",
			"",
			"**Example:** Mark's character is constructing a house, and he wants to acquire 1 point of Labor, which he plans to spend on the house's construction requirements. He decides to use 1 day of downtime and pay 10 gp to earn the point of Labor, instead of paying 20 gp to purchase it outright. He immediately spends this 1 point of Labor on the construction requirements of the house. For roleplaying purposes, Mark states that he used the day to dig a foundation for his house, and spent the 10 gp on the tools and raw materials he needed to start the foundation.",
			"",
			"**Example:** Laura's character plans to build a blacksmith's shop, and needs 1 point of Labor. She decides to use 1 day of downtime and pay 10 gp to earn the 1 point of Labor, but saves it for later use. Since construction work is out of character for him, Laura explains that her character spent the day making deliveries for a local mason, who in turn promised to help her build her blacksmith's shop. The gold cost goes toward this future construction, but for ease of tracking, Laura pays for it now. She doesn't have to keep track of this 1 point of Labor as \"1 point of Labor from a mason,\" since the exact nature of Labor matters only for roleplaying purposes. None of the downtime activities require specific kinds of labor.",
			"",
			"***Skilled Work:*** If you have ranks in a useful skill, you can spend 1 day working in a settlement to earn more capital than you would doing unskilled work. Note that this method includes both legal and illegal means of earning capital-for example, a day spent using Sleight of Hand to earn money could be a day spent performing as a street magician or a day spent pickpocketing.",

For example, Perform might earn you Influence as a musician, but it's not as useful for earning Labor. The GM should inform you of this before you attempt the skill check. In general, the appropriate skills for each type of capital are as follows.",

The GM should tell you this before you attempt the skill check, or allow you to assess the inhabitants' preferences with a successful DC 15 Knowledge (local) or Sense Motive check.",
			"",
			"***Class Abilities:*** You can use a class ability to provide a service in the settlement to earn capital. For example, a fighter could train a noble's child in swordplay, a cleric could heal townsfolk, and so on. Choose either one type of capital (Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic) or gp, and attempt a check (1d20 + your character level + your highest ability modifier - 5). You may take 10 on this check. Treat this check as your skill check result for using skilled work. Using class abilities is less efficient than performing skilled work; this represents the fact that many classes' abilities don't have much direct benefit to a community. As with skilled work, the GM may rule that your abilities are unsuitable and reduce the amount earned by half.",

Although you can't sell capital, you can use it for its listed Purchased Cost as payment toward any applicable downtime activity that requires you to spend gp. For example, if you are brewing a potion, you can spend 1 point of Magic toward the cost of the materials needed to make the potion as if that point were equal to 100 gp.",
			"",
			"Although you may have a lot of gp or other capital to throw around in a settlement, the settlement's size limits how much you can accomplish per day (see [Spending Limits](rule/spending_limits)).",
			"",
			"***Rewards:*** A GM using the downtime system might award you various types of capital as monster loot, adventure rewards, inheritance, or natural resources. For example, if your party defeats a gang of smugglers, your treasure for the final encounter could include 5 points of Goods in addition to conventional treasure. After freeing a group of peasants from a hobgoblin tribe, the GM might decide that the freed prisoners have no money to give you as a reward but instead promise you 3 points of Labor as thanks for saving them. Your character could inherit a ramshackle house from an old relative, which you can use as a base of operations or sell for gold. After clearing out a kobold warren, you might discover a vein of iron ore that (after an investment of Goods, Labor, and perhaps Influence) can generate gp or Goods for you on a monthly basis. Depending on the nature of the reward, the GM might decide that you don't need to pay the Earned Cost to get capital acquired in this way.",
			"",
			"These kinds of rewards are always decided by the GM. Keep in mind that a settlement's government usually has jurisdiction over what happens to an abandoned property. For example, just because you kill all the cultists using a building as their secret lair doesn't mean you can claim that building as your own."

			"The Craft and Profession skills in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook allow you to attempt a skill check once per week, earning an amount of gp equal to 1/2 your check result. If you were to divide that amount by 7, you'd get your earnings per day. However, that assumes you work 7 days per week, and most people take 2 days off per week for rest and worship, so that's only 5 days of actual work per week. Dividing your check result by 2 and then by 5 is the same as dividing by 10, which is why the downtime system has you divide your check result by 10 to determine gp earned per day. You can work 7 days per week (if you really need the 2 extra days for earning capital), but even mighty adventurers need a day off now and then!"

The GM decides this event happens while Laura's character is in the tavern, and gives her the opportunity to use her words or fists to put an end to the trouble. Because an event occurred, on the next day the chance of having an event resets to 20%."

Unless otherwise stated, each room includes a floor, ceiling, walls, furniture, doors, windows, and other details that are appropriate to the room's purpose in your building.",
			"",
			"Example: A Common Room is a large area designed for use by many people at once. In a Fort, a Common Room has tables and chairs and functions as a mess hall for soldiers. In a Tavern or Inn, it has tables and chairs and is the main place for socializing and drinking. In a Temple, it has chairs or pews and is used for conducting worship services. In a Bardic College, it has chairs and music stands and is used for practicing performances.",
			"",
			"Exterior doors are good wooden doors with simple locks. Interior doors are simple wooden doors with no locks. You may install different locks by paying the normal price for [locks](equipment-misc/lock_average).",
			"",
			"You don't need to construct all of a building's rooms at once. The price of constructing a two-room building is the same whether you build them together or complete the first one and add the second one later.",
			"",
			"***Broken Rooms:*** If a room takes damage in excess of half its hit points (or is otherwise rendered sufficiently damaged by a downtime event or at the GM's discretion), it gains the broken condition. A room with the broken condition generates half the normal income. In general, repairing a broken room requires spending an amount of gp or other capital equal to half the price of constructing the room from scratch. Certain building events may have alternative prices for repairing rooms with the broken condition.",
			"",
			"Entire buildings can also gain the broken condition. Treat the building as if each room in it had the condition, except you must repair the entire building at once rather than repairing rooms one at a time.",
			"",
			"***Creating Organizations from Teams:*** Unless otherwise stated, the people on a team have clothing, a small amount of personal gear appropriate to their line of work, and a place to live-in other words, lives outside of their involvement with you. You may outfit them with better gear and construct or purchase a place for them to live.",
			"",
			"You don't need to add every team to your organization at once. The price for recruiting a team of beggars and a team of burglars is the same whether you recruit them together or recruit one and add the second team later.",
			"",
			"The composition of a team is flexible and can change over time depending on the nature of your organization. For example, if your thieves' guild has Cutpurses and Robbers, some of them might get caught and jailed, but it is assumed your organization replaces them with individuals of similar skill. In the same way that you don't have to track routine maintenance on a building you own, replacing individuals who leave your organization is factored into the price of the team.",
			"",
			"You can only recruit a team if the character levels of its individual members are equal to or lower than your Leadership score. Even if you don't have the [Leadership](feat/leadership) feat, calculate your Leadership score as your character level + your Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise noted, the members of a team are not adventurers and are unwilling to accompany you into dungeons and other deadly locations.",
			"",
			"Example: An Acolyte is a low-level divine spellcaster. In a Cult, Acolytes are the lowest-ranked members of the group and handle most of the interactions with new converts. In a Thieves' Guild, they are responsible for patching up members of the guild after a robbery or gang war. In a Mercenary Company, they look after the spiritual needs and physical injuries of the soldiers.",
			"",
			"***Teams and Leadership:*** One advantage of having followers from the [Leadership](feat/leadership) feat is that they increase the effect of Influence and Labor you spend in a settlement (see [Using Followers](rule/using_followers)). As the primary component of the price of recruiting teams is Influence, having followers in a settlement makes it easier to get the word out about the organization you want to build.",
			"",
			"The people in your organization obey you because you pay them, or at least keep regular contact with them and direct their activities. Unlike with cohorts and followers gained from the [Leadership](feat/leadership) feat (who are loyal toward you because of your reputation and behavior), if you're away from your organization for a long period of time, you might lose your connection with it. In the Upkeep Phase section, see [Step 3-Determine Capital Attrition](rule/upkeep_phase).",
			"",
			"In addition to the ways to combat attrition mentioned in the Upkeep Phase section, recruiting your followers into your organization can help with this problem. You can automatically add followers to your organizations as you recruit teams. For every five of your followers who are also members of your organization, you gain a +1 bonus on the leadership check to avoid attrition. As most followers are low-level characters with NPC classes, most teams of followers aren't trained for combat and are usually recruited to be Acolytes, Bureaucrats, Craftspeople, Lackeys, and so on (see [Teams](rule/teams)).",
			"",
			"***Combining Rooms and Teams:*** This system allows you to construct a building that has no workers, create an organization that has no base of operations, or combine the two to make a fully staffed building or an organization with a headquarters. For example, if you build a Temple and recruit Acolytes in that settlement, you can have the Acolytes work at your temple. If the Temple has a place for the Acolytes to sleep, they can even live there. If you later want the Acolytes to go somewhere else or disperse, you still have the Temple and can use it for whatever purpose you see fit."

Guests need a place to eat and rooms to sleep in, so it must include a Common Room and a Lodging. To keep your guests' horses safe, it must include a Stall. By adding up all the Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic values in the Create and Time entries of the rooms' stat blocks, you get a total of 33 points of Goods, 3 points of Influence, 32 points of Labor, and 90 days. By spending that capital, after 90 days of construction time your inn is finished.",

You want people to be able to break into homes and steal valuables, so you should include a Robber team. To hide your wealth from the tax collector, you need a Bureaucrat team. By adding up all the Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic values in the Create and Time entries of the rooms' stat blocks, you get a total of 3 points of Goods, 11 points of Influence, 6 points of Labor, and 6 days. If you spend that capital, after 6 days of recruiting, your guild is ready to work.",
			"",
			"Alternatively, if you wanted to just purchase an existing guild, with the GM's approval you can add up the gp prices for those teams and pay that amount to the current guildmaster. For the Thieves' Guild described above, the total price is 510 gp."

			"",
			"***Earnings:*** This entry indicates what bonuses the room or team gives to its building's or organization's checks made to generate capital. Buildings and organizations act like characters in that they can attempt a check each day to earn capital performing skilled work (without costing you any downtime). [You must pay for capital earned in this way as normal](rule/gaining_capital).",

If the Earnings entry lists specific types of capital, it can contribute a bonus on its building's or organization's skilled work checks only for capital of those types. You can apply each room's or team's bonus to any one listed type or capital each day or divide it among multiple listed types of capital. For example, an Alchemy Lab can generate only gp, Goods, or Magic, and not Influence or Labor. One day you could use all +10 of its bonus on the building's capital check to generate gp, on the next day you could use +5 on a check for generating gp and +5 on a check for generating Goods, and so on.",
			"",
			"Most of the time, it's simplest and quickest to just apply all the gp bonuses from all the rooms in each of your buildings and take 10 on the roll. Other times, you might want to generate other types of capital to construct new rooms, recruit new teams, and make upgrades.",
			"",
			"If you have multiple buildings or organizations in a settlement and they can generate the same kind of capital, you don't have to roll for them separately; you may add all their capital modifiers together and attempt one check for that kind of capital. If you spend a downtime day earning capital on your own, you may add your building and organization bonuses to your roll instead of rolling separately for yourself and each of your businesses or organizations.",
			"",
			"For a room, the Earnings amount already subtracts the cost of having unskilled employees to do the basic work for you. For example, the Earnings listed for having a Bar already account for the wages of a bartender and servers. For a team, the Earnings amount assumes they are working at a building you own. If you don't provide a building for the team to work in or from, halve the Earnings for that team.",
			"",
			"The description section of the unit stat block might list other benefits unrelated to the downtime system.",
			"",
			"Example: The Inn example [here](rule/construction_examples) has a Bar, a Common Room, a Kitchen, a Lodging, and a Stall. The Bar gives gp or Influence +10; the Common Room gives gp or Influence +7; the Kitchen gives gp or Goods +4; the Lodging gives gp +12; and the Stall gives gp, Goods, or Labor +8. All of those rooms can earn gp, so if you want to earn gp, just add all the room bonuses together (total +41) and make a skilled work check for the Inn to see [how much gp you earn](rule/gaining_capital). If you wanted to use the Bar's bonus to contribute to generating Influence and use the rest of the rooms' bonuses on gp, you'd attempt one skilled work check for Influence with a +10 modifier (the Bar's bonus) and another skilled work check for gp with a +31 modifier (the total bonuses from the Common Room, Lodging, and Stall).",
			"",
			"***Benefit (Rooms Only):*** This entry lists what non-downtime bonuses the room provides, such skill bonuses or changes to settlement modifiers (such as Corruption, Crime, and Danger; see [Settlement Modifiers](rule/settlement_modifiers)). If a room provides a skill bonus, that bonus applies only when you're in the location specified. For example, just because you have a Ballroom in your castle doesn't mean you get its Perform bonus when you're in a dungeon.",
			"",

For example, a Bar allows you to sell drinks, a Kitchen allows you to serve food (either for your personal guests or to paying customers if the building is an Inn), and a Magical Repository allows you to research spells.",
			"",
			"***Create:*** This entry lists how much Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic are required to construct the room or recruit the team. It also includes a gp value for purchasing a completed room of that type or recruiting an existing team of that type.",
			"",
			"***Time:*** This entry indicates how long it takes to complete the room or recruit the team. You may divide the Time price for a room by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Labor price. You may divide the Time price for a team by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Influence price. You must be in the settlement at the start of the construction or recruitment period, but don't have to spend any of your downtime days to begin construction or recruitment. In effect, you have to be present only to give the order to begin.",
			"",
			"If a team doesn't have a Time price, spending capital to recruit that team doesn't count as a downtime action.",
			"",
			"Note that the Time prices for teams are for recruiting the team for long-term employment and don't reflect the availability of these kinds of NPCs for temporary work. For example, if you need to hire a 3rd-level cleric to cast [lesser restoration](spell/lesser_restoration), you don't have to spend 7 days of downtime recruiting a Priest team-you can just make the [standard spellcasting arrangements](equipment-misc/spellcasting).",
			"",
			"***Size:*** If the unit is a room, this entry indicates a range of how many 5-foot squares are needed for a standard room of its type. For example, a Kitchen is 2-6 5-foot squares. If you need a larger room of this type, construct two rooms and join them. If you need a smaller room of this size, you can make it that smaller size for free. For example, if you only need a 5-foot-square Kitchen, you can construct one at the listed price, even though the smallest size listed is 2 5-foot squares.",
			"",
			"If the unit is a team, this entry indicates how many people are needed for a standard team of its type. Typically the team is no smaller than 50% of this amount and no larger than 150% of this amount. If you need a larger team of this size, recruit two teams and combine them.",
			"",
			"***Upgrade:*** Some rooms and teams are variants of or improvements on others. You can change the room or team into the listed upgrade by spending the difference in both capital and time between the original and the new one. For example, if your building includes a Book Repository and you want to upgrade it to a Magical Repository, you can either spend 1 point of Goods, 1 point of Influence, 1 point of Labor, and 2 points of Magic, or spend 270 gp (the difference between the Create entry for a Book Repository and a Magical Repository). You must also spend 4 days (the Time difference between a Book Repository and a Magical Repository).",
			"",
			"Pay the price only for types of capital that increase. For example, if you are converting Bunks into Lodging, you spend 3 points of Goods, 3 points of Labor, and 6 days; even though a Lodging costs less Influence, you don't regain any Influence for performing this upgrade.",
			"",
			"You can't downgrade a room or team. With the GM's permission, you may repurpose any room or team into another room or team as if the change were an upgrade.",

For example, if you construct a building with a Bar, Common Room, and Kitchen, you might want to use it as a tavern or a headquarters for your adventuring party. If it's a tavern, it's open to the public and generates capital. Otherwise, it's a private building and doesn't generate capital because it's used by only you and your friends. If you start your own cult with Acolytes and Priests, you might decide they sell healing and generate income. If your thieves' guild has Acolytes, you might decide they only heal members of your guild, and therefore don't generate income.",
			"",
			"If you intend for your building or organization to generate capital, you must explain to the GM how it does so. You can change the purpose of your building or organization (for example, renovating an old military barracks into an inn or turning your greedy cult into a generous one) and in doing so change the capital it generates. You should choose one idea and stick to it, however, as a business that's open to the public on an irregular basis makes less money, as does a business that frequently changes its purpose.

If a room is enclosed on all sides (including the ceiling and floor) by dead-magic walls, the area within functions as an antimagic field. Creating a dead-magic wall requires the spell antimagic field, the expenditure of 3,000 gp for each 5-foot-wide-by-10-foot-tall section of wall, and the creator to have the [Craft Wondrous Item](feat/craft_wondrous_item) feat.",

Detection and location magic generally is blocked as long as there is an unbroken lead barrier directly between the caster and the protected creature or object, but scrying effects, [discern location](spell/discern_location), and other spells that aren't limited to straight lines of effect are blocked only if the protected creature or object is seamlessly enclosed by lead-lined walls. Because of this and the fact that they are rumored to cause insanity in anyone who dwells within long enough, these walls are rarely used in any structures other than vaults and panic rooms. The price includes adding lead lining to any doors, shutters, and other openings into the room so that the lead seal is complete when they are closed. A room sealed fast against divination from all directions by lead is also airtight, potentially suffocating anyone trapped inside. A lead-lined wall costs an extra 250 gp for each 5-foot-wide by 10-foot-tall section of wall. This augmentation cannot be applied to paper walls.",

In addition, the runes block divinations of or below a specified spell level (as indicated on the table below) from entering an area enclosed by secrecy runes on all sides (including ceilings and floors), even while portals to the area are open. See the table below for prices and the maximum level of spells each type of runes can block.

			"The following events are examples of the sort of random encounters a GM can add to the downtime system. Rolling for events occurs during the [Event phase](rule/event_phase).",
			"",
			"The first set of events consists of events that could happen to any kind of building-bad weather, a fire, a famous visitor, and so on. Following those generic events are specific events keyed to certain types of buildings-an Inn has different events than a Military Academy or Smithy. This section concludes with events for several kinds of organizations. Not every building and organization has its own event table-the GM should use the Generic Building Events table or take inspiration from this section to make tables for other buildings and organizations.",
			"",
			"If you don't own any buildings or organizations in a settlement, the GM can use these event tables to create events for buildings you are in or near. For example, the GM can use the [Tavern Events table](rule/tavern_events) to generate an event while you are at a tavern. The event descriptions assume that you are the owner, so the GM should adjust the outcome if you are merely present for an event.",
			"",
			"These tables are designed so low rolls tend to be beneficial and high rolls are harmful or dangerous. If you're using the [settlement danger value](rule/the_settlement_stat_block), add the danger value to the percentile roll. Some results have you roll on another event table. Reroll any results that don't make sense.",
			"",
			"Many events allow a skill check to affect the outcome of the event. If you're present, either attempt this skill check yourself or ask another member of the party or a manager to attempt the check for you. If you're absent, either your representative (such as a cohort or manager) attempts the check or roll 1d20 with no bonuses to determine the result. The GM can also allow methods other than those listed to end harmful events. For example, you might be able to end an ongoing rivalry event by befriending the owner of the rival business or driving him out of town."

Otherwise, the criminals rob your building, and you lose 1d8 points of Goods.",

			"",
			"***Deadly Accident:*** Someone has a dreadful accident in or near your building. Roll 1d6; on a 1-4, the victim is a random employee or building resident, and on a 5-6, the victim is a visitor or passerby. The GM determines the type of accident. The victim is hurt badly and is dying. A successful DC 15 Heal check or the application of any magical healing prevents death. If the person dies, you lose 1d3 points of Influence.",

			"***Fire:*** A fire breaks out in your building. There's a 75% chance it's just a minor fire that costs you 1d2 points of Goods, but otherwise it's a major fire and becomes a significant danger. For a major fire, unless you utilize magic like [quench](spell/quench), [pyrotechnics](spell/pyrotechnics), or other fire-suppressing tactics, you lose 2d6 points of Goods, Labor, or Magic (splitting this cost up however you wish) and your building gains the broken condition.",
			"",
			"***Good Fortune:*** You have a run of good luck. For 7 days, this building gains a +4 bonus on its first check to generate capital each day. In addition, the next time you roll a building event, you can roll twice and take either result.",
			"",
			"***Good Weather:*** The beautiful weather boosts morale and business. The building gets a +10 bonus on its next check to generate capital.",
			"",
			"***Infestation:*** You have uninvited guests-spiders in the cellar, stirges in the attic, rats in the walls, or something similarly unpleasant. As long as your building is infested, it takes a -10 penalty on checks to generate capital. Each day the infestation continues, you lose 1 point of Goods, Labor, or Magic (chosen randomly, reroll if it's a type of capital you don't have). To end an infestation, you must succeed at a DC 20 Handle Animal or Survival check; the DC increases by 1 for each day the infestation persists (maximum DC 30). Alternatively, the GM may allow you to resolve the infestation with a combat encounter.",
			"",
			"***Rivalry:*** A rival starts to work against you. At the start of each Income phase, you must succeed at a DC 20 skill check (with a skill that makes sense for the type of building) or either lose 1d2 points of Influence or give the building a -5 penalty on its checks to generate currency for 1d10 days (50% chance of either penalty). You may attempt a DC 25 Intimidate or Diplomacy check once per day to end the rivalry. Success means the rivalry ends (as does any ongoing penalty from this event). Failure means the rivalry continues. The rivalry ends automatically the next time you roll this event (this doesn't replace the old rivalry with a new one).",
			"",
			"***Rumormongering:*** People are talking about you. Attempt a DC 20 Diplomacy check. On a success, word spreads far that your presence in the region is valuable and welcomed, and you gain 1d4 points of Influence. On a failure, the rumors are not so complimentary (and perhaps even insulting), and you lose 1d3 points of Influence.",
			"",
			"***Sickness:*** Your employees have become sick, and any earnings from this building today are halved. Attempt a DC 15 Heal check at the end of each day-on a success, your employees get well enough to work. If you fail, the sickness persists to the next day. Each day sickness persists, you have a 20% chance of losing 1d2 points of Labor.",
			"",
			"***Taxes:*** You must pay some unexpected taxes. You can either pay the tax amount (1% of the total gp value of your building) or attempt a DC 20 Bluff check to talk your way out of the taxes. If you succeed, you don't have to pay these taxes. If you fail, the tax owed doubles and you can't talk your way out of it."

If you succeed at a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check, you discreetly deal with the problem and gain 1d4 points of Influence; there's a 10% chance the customer recommends you to someone with a similar problem and the building gains a +10 bonus on its next check to generate capital. If you fail, there is no effect, but this doesn't reflect poorly on you because the customer wishes to keep the problem private.",
			"",
			"***Explosion:*** Crafting goes awry or dangerous reagents are spilled, causing an explosion. You lose 1d2 points of Goods and must attempt a DC 20 Survival check. If you fail, your building catches fire, as the fire general building event, except there is a 50% chance of a minor fire and a 50% chance of a major fire.",
			"",
			"***Healing Potion Demand:*** Local temples have a healing potion shortage and ask you to help pick up the slack with alchemical remedies. Attempt a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. If you succeed, the healers praise you and you gain 1 point of Influence and 1d2 points of Magic. Otherwise, the healers badmouth your incompetence or unwillingness to help, and you lose 1d2 points of Influence.",
			"",
			"***Outbreak:*** Something in your shop is making people sick-perhaps a bad reaction created poisonous gas, a monstrous ingredient carries a lingering disease, or a rival alchemist planted something dangerous. Attempt a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check. If you succeed, you remedy the problem before it causes any permanent harm. Otherwise, treating and compensating the victims costs you 1d3 points of Goods, 1d4 points of Influence, and 1 point of Magic.",
			"",
			"***Unstable Mutation:*** A alchemical mishap causes one employee to temporarily mutate into a hideous, clumsy creature. Either you hide the employee in your business, losing 1d2 points of Goods per day for 1d3 days as the employee accidentally breaks merchandise, or you send the employee home and the building takes a -5 penalty on its next 1d3 checks to generate capital since people know about this incident."

Alternatively, the GM may allow you to track down the thieves and reclaim your stolen property as an adventure encounter.",

If it is a simple brawl, you can break it up with a successful DC 20 Diplomacy or Intimidate check or by spending 1 point of Goods on the quarrelers. If it is a violent attack and you're present when it occurs, you can attempt to intercede (the GM should determine an appropriate combat encounter). Whether or not the violent attack is successful, the perpetrator must be dealt with. If you do nothing at all, you lose 1d4 points of Influence and 1d2 points of Labor as you lose frightened customers and employees. If you want the local authorities to take care of it, attempt a DC 20 Diplomacy or Intimidate check. Success means an investigation and arrest occur without any negative repercussions. Failure means you lose 1d4 points of Influence and 1 point of Labor. If you find and punish the perpetrator yourself (or hire someone to do so), you gain 1d4 points of Influence."

The event is minor 75% of the time, causing flashing lights, strange smells, or unusual sounds. Attempt a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) check in this case.

Attempt a Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Knowledge (religion) check against a DC equal to 20 + the number of teams in the organization.
