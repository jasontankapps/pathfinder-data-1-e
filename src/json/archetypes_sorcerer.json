At 1st level, a sorcerer, bloodrager, or any other character with one of the following bloodlines can choose to gain a bloodline familiar. The character gains a familiar (as a wizard's familiar), treating her class level as her wizard level for the purposes of this ability. This familiar has an additional ability listed below based on the master's bloodline.",

This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) or until the familiar stops touching the creature, whichever comes first. At 10th level, the familiar grants fast healing 2 instead. At 20th level, the familiar grants fast healing 3 instead.",
			"",
			"**Destined-Foretold Touch (Su):** The familiar gains a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls to deliver touch spells, and the DC of touch spells delivered by the familiar increases by 1. These benefits increase by 1 at 10th level and again at 20th level.",
			"",
			"**Draconic-Dragon's Flight (Ex):** The familiar can sprout draconic wings, granting it a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability for a number of minutes per day equal to 1/2 your caster level (minimum 1). These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 10th level, the familiar's fly speed increases to 60 feet with good maneuverability. At 20th level, the familiar's fly speed increases to 90 feet.",
			"",
			"**Elemental-Dualistic Energy (Su):** When your familiar delivers a touch spell that deals energy damage of a type other than your chosen energy type, your familiar can choose to alter the spell so that half of the energy damage dealt is of the spell's original type and the other half is of your chosen energy type.",
			"",
			"**Fey-Amusing Familiar (Su):** The familiar can fascinate other creatures as the fascinate bardic performance, treating your caster level as its bard level and using your Charisma modifier for the purpose of calculating the Will save DC. The familiar cannot perform any other actions while using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Infernal-Hellish Aura (Su):** Animals don't willingly approach the familiar unless the animal's master succeeds at a DC 15 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check.

			"",
			"**Drawbacks:** A crossblooded sorcerer has one fewer spell known at each level (including cantrips) than is presented on the sorcerer spells known table. Furthermore, the conflicting urges created by the divergent nature of the crossblooded sorcerer's dual heritage forces her to constantly take some mental effort just to remain focused on her current situation and needs. This leaves her with less mental resolve to deal with external threats. A crossblooded sorcerer always takes a -2 penalty on Will saves."

			"",
			"**Diminished Spellcasting:** An umbral scion can cast one fewer spell per day of each level than normal. If this reduces the number to 0, she can cast spells of that level only if her Charisma score grants her bonus spells of that level.",
			"",
			"This ability alters the sorcerer's spellcasting.",
			"",
			"**Shrouded Spells (Su):** An umbral scion is enveloped by wisps of shadow whenever she casts a spell. The DC to identify spells cast by an umbral scion increases by 2. If the spell is being cast within an area of dim light or darkness, the DC increases by 5 instead.",
			"",
			"**Encroaching Darkness (Su):** An umbral scion is capable of influencing light around her. As a standard action, she can produce a 10-foot-radius veil centered on a creature or object within 30 feet. This veil decreases the light level by one step and remains for a number of rounds equal to the sorcerer's Charisma modifier. At 7th level, the veil increases to a 30-foot radius. At 8th level, the veil decreases the light level by two steps. If the light level is decreased past darkness, the veil is treated as deeper darkness. At 14th level, the veil increases to 60 feet and grants any creature within it cover (even against senses normally able to penetrate total darkness, such as the see in darkness ability). An umbral scion can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"This ability replaces the shadowstrike bloodline power.",
			"",
			"**Potent Shadows (Su):** At 7th level, when an umbral scion casts a spell of the shadow subschool or a spell with the darkness or shadow descriptor within an area of dim light or darkness, she treats her caster level as 1 higher. Only the sorcerer herself needs to be in dim light or darkness. This bonus increases by 1 every 4 sorcerer levels beyond 7th she has to a maximum of +4 at 19th level.",
			"",

			"**Crippling Darkness (Su):** At 13th level, when an umbral scion targets a creature within an area of dim light or darkness with a spell of the shadow subschool or a spell with the darkness or shadow descriptor, the DC for the spell increases by 1. This bonus increases by 1 at 18th level.",

			"Wishcrafters are born with a talent for manipulating reality inherited from their efreeti ancestors. However, like the genies they are descended from, wishcrafters can only draw upon this power to fulfill the desires of others. A wishcrafter has the following class features.",
			"",
			"**Wishbound Arcana (Su):** At 1st level, the wishcrafter can use the wishes of non-genie creatures other than herself in place of the normal verbal components of her spells. A creature can make a wish as a free action at any time, even during the wishcrafter's turn. The wishcrafter must be able to hear and understand a wish in order to use it as a spell component. A spell that doesn't normally have a verbal component gains one when cast using this ability. A wish doesn't need to mention the name of a specific spell, but must describe an outcome that can be accomplished by casting a spell the wishcrafter knows (for example, wishing to be bigger could supply the verbal component for enlarge person). A wishcrafter gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when using a creature's wish as a verbal component in this manner, but cannot include herself as a target of such spells. She can be affected by such a spell if it affects an area rather than a target or targets. A wishcrafter is under no compulsion to grant a creature's wish. Once the wishcrafter grants a creature's wish using this ability, she cannot use this ability to grant that creature any further wishes for 24 hours. This ability replaces bloodline arcana.",
			"",
			"**Expanded Wishcraft:** At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the wishcrafter grows more adept at altering reality to fit the whims of others. She may add an additional spell selected from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to her list of spells known. This spell must be one level lower than the highest-level spell she can cast. A wishcrafter can only use these spells in conjunction with her wishbound arcana ability. For example, if she used this ability to learn cat's grace, she can only cast it when another creature wishes for it, and can't cast it on herself because it is a targeted spell. She cannot use these spells to craft or recharge magic items. These bonus spells replace the bloodline spells gained by the sorcerer's bloodline.",
			"",
			"**Heart's Desire (Su):** At 7th level, as a swift action, a wishcrafter can force a single creature within 30 feet to confess its deepest desire. The target receives a Will save to negate this effect (DC 10 + 1/2 the wishcrafter's level + the wishcrafter's Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature must immediately wish aloud in a clear voice for something it truly desires, allowing the wishcrafter to activate her wishbound arcana ability if she knows a spell that can fulfill that wish. This is a mind-affecting effect. Regardless of whether the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of the same wishcrafter's heart's desire ability again for 24 hours. The wishcrafter can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 7th level.",
			"",
			"**Twisted Wish (Su):** At 13th level, a wishcrafter becomes adept at corrupting wishes to negatively affect the creature that wished them. When a wishcrafter affects a creature with a spell using its wish as a spell component, she may twist the wish, applying a -4 penalty to the creature's saving throws against the spell. The effects of wishes twisted this way are difficult to remove; the DC of caster level checks to dispel them increases by 5. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 13th level.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Wishcraft (Su):** At 19th level, the wishcrafter perfects her ability to manipulate reality. Once per day, she may cast any spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list as if it were on her list of spells known. Using this ability otherwise has all of the benefits and limitations of the wishbound arcana ability. This ability replaces the bloodline bonus feat gained at 19th level."
