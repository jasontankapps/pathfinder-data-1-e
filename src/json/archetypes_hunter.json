			"Urban hunters help guards track down and apprehend criminals or spies, find lost children and disaster victims, and protect animals from abuse in the city. They still draw their inspiration and strength from the natural world, marveling at how nature flourishes wherever the city allows.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Animal Companion (Ex):** Urban hunters have animal companions that are domesticated animals or animals native to a major city. The urban hunter must select her animal companion from the following list: axe beak, badger, bird, camel, dire rat, dog, horse, llama, ostrich, pony, ram, or trumpeter swan. In urban settings, an urban hunter's animal companion seems domesticated and likely harmless to anyone who has not seen it in combat (potentially reducing the DC of Diplomacy checks to convince anyone to allow it into secure areas). It draws no more attention than a friendly dog, loyal horse, or similar tame animal.",
			"",
			"Creatures who have never seen the animal companion make an attack must succeed at a Sense Motive check (opposed by the animal companion's Stealth check) to realize the animal companion is a potential threat. The hunter can calm those who witness her animal companion's attacks (so long as they were not injured) with a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 15 + the target's Will save modifier).",

At 12th level, the hunter can also select from the following feats: {feat/Combat Patrol}, {feat/Combat Reflexes}, {feat/Disarming Strike}, {feat/Greater Bull Rush}, {feat/Greater Dirty Trick}, {feat/Greater Disarm}, {feat/Greater Grapple}, {feat/Greater Trip}, and {feat/Lunge}.

They also gain a +2 insight bonus on Will saving throws against illusions and mind-affecting effects. This ability replaces woodland stride.",
