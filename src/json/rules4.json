			"While the armor and Armor Class system presented in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is tried and tested, some players may yet have a sense that it feels slightly off. That is to say, if a suit of armor is actually protecting the wearer from attacks that strike but simply fail to cause the wearer harm, why then do we say that armor reduces the chance of a hit? The abstraction has been clarified in the rules by defining what it means to be \"hit\" in combat as actually being \"hit in such a way as to effectively cause harm,\" but this explanation is still not enough for some players.",
			"",
			"The following is an alternative system that allows armor to absorb the damage of attacks, rather than a system that provides an abstract way of determining when a hit does actual harm. Like all the rules presented in this chapter, it is a variant to the base system of the Pathfinder RPG. It is for GMs who want armor to reduce damage rather than increase Armor Class, and replaces the normal rules for armor.",
			"",
			"In this system, a creatures no longer has an Armor Class. Instead it has a Defense score that a foe's attack roll must meet or exceed to hit the creature. Then any damage is reduced by damage reduction based on the creature's armor worn and any natural armor bonus the creature has. Furthermore, armor has a chance of reducing all critical hits to normal hits, by replacing the confirmation roll for critical hits with a critical defense check made by the creature threatened by the critical hit."

			"The best known and most direct form of diabolical corruption, infernal contracts form a binding tie between a devil and a mortal. Such contracts take a variety of forms, typically parodying the laws and terminology of the mortal's society. An infernal contract takes the form of an offer, usually for extravagant goods or seemingly impossible services, presented by a devil to a mortal who has summoned it for exactly such a purpose. These contracts are exceptionally powerful and can alter lives-or even reality-in diverse ways for those who agree to sign such hellish documents. In return for fulfilling the terms of the contract, the devil receives the mortal's soul when the signer dies or at whatever time the contract specifies. While a mortal's soul is nearly always the target of such contracts, oftentimes devils occlude their desires, either within confusing legalese, sub-articles, and addenda, or by tailoring their fulfillment of the contract to provide the contractee with the means to damn himself. Thus, some infernal contracts are simple accounts of a blasphemous exchange, while others are rambling documents cloaking diabolical intentions. While more complex agreements are better at hiding a devil's desires, they might offer clever mortals opportunities to escape damnation.",

			"Infernal contracts are an expression of a timeless truth: mortals always desire more. Many mortals dream of worldly wealth and otherworldly power, but in the vast planar scheme, their existences are brief and their bargaining power limited. The devils of Hell offer a way around such limitations. Banking on mortals' ignorance of how the multiverse works and the true value of their intangible souls, devils offer mortals the fulfillment of this dream for what appears to be no price at all. To seal the bargain and prove their honesty, they create officious infernal contracts-elaborate written promises no less binding than the chains of Hell.",
			"",
			"Of Hell's contract makers, [phistophiluses](monster/phistophiluses)-also called contract devils-are considered the finest authors of infernal bargains. The rulers of Hell-Asmodeus, the archdevils, the infernal dukes, and the malebranche-are also storied deal makers. But infernal contracts are not the purview of contract writers alone. The forces of Hell stand as a largely unified threat against mortal life, and most specimens among the legions of devilkind can requisition tools from a vast, treacherous arsenal. Thus, a mortal encounter with nearly any devil has the potential to end in an offer: What would you give for greatness?"

			"Before exploring the intricacies of the infernal contract, it should be noted that other fiends are often willing to enter into contracts with mortals as well. Lawful evil fiends are generally the most trustworthy in this regard. Neutral evil fiends usually honor a contract as long as they get something out of the bargain or feel like they come out ahead, while chaotic evil fiends will almost always look to cheat or blatantly disregard the wording of a contract. All contracts with non-devil fiends carry with them a markedly increased level of risk to the mortal, and in many cases, the only possible outcome of such a foolish endeavor is the forfeiture of the mortal's soul-yet there are always extenuating circumstances that make the forging of such a risky contract a viable (or perhaps the only) option. For example, a king might agree to sign a contract with a powerful demon, knowing full well that the demon will break the contract, yet if signing the contract can buy even a few extra hours for a group of adventurers to attempt a desperate gambit to save the kingdom, such a sacrifice may be worth it in the end. How a non-devil fiend honors a contract is generally left up to the GM, but the basic mechanics work as for infernal contracts."

			"Once terms have been agreed to, a devil has to create the infernal contract. Contract devils have the easiest time of this, making use of their infernal contract ability to instantly generate such a document. Devils of demigod-level power can likewise instantly call tailor-made infernal contracts into being as though they also had the infernal contract ability, though the effects they can create prove more potent and variable. Other devils can also produce infernal contracts but might have to employ less immediate techniques.",

			"Barring any extraordinary circumstances, most devils with the [greater teleport](spell/greater_teleport) ability know a place they can go to have an infernal contract created. This might involve opening a portal back to Hell, finding a contract devil lurking on the same mortal world, or other means. In any case, the devil can use this method to have an infernal contract made to meet its needs. However, doing so takes time. The Creation Time entry listed in each contract's description notes how long it takes for most common devils to have an infernal contract of that kind produced. This represents a combination of the devil's travel time, its influence in negotiating with other devils, the detail put into the contract's creation, and the time it takes to return. At the end of this period-unless the mortal has done something extraordinary to hide himself- the devil returns with a contract.",

This exceptional training, which takes place deep within the Fallen Fastness of Dis, the sunken libraries of Stygia, or the other blasphemous vaults of Hell, manifests as the [Infernal Legist](feat/infernal_legist) feat."

			"An infernal contract is a baffling linguistic labyrinth, rife with eons-old legalese, otherworldly citations, and near-endless clauses and counterclauses. One might consist of single scroll covered in fine handwriting, while another might consist of volumes of printed text bound in sable.",
			"",
			"Skimming an infernal contract and getting the gist of it takes only a matter of moments. Reading one in its entirety, though, can take hours, if not days, and is similar in many ways to performing [research in a library](unknown/research_in_a_library). All infernal contracts have a number of knowledge points (abbreviated as \"kp\") representing the sum of the contract's information. To research an infernal contract, a character must succeed at a Linguistics check or a specialized skill check as indicated by the contract in question. The DC of this Research check varies, but if the researcher uses the more specialized check to perform this research, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus for using precisely the correct skill for interpreting the contract, as opposed to the more general use of Linguistics. Attempting a Research check requires an uninterrupted 8-hour period of research, and characters cannot take 10 or 20 on this check. Each additional 8-hour period of research on the same contract grants a cumulative +1 bonus on Research checks. Up to two characters can use the aid another action to assist a researcher.",
			"",
			"Succeeding at a Research check reduces the contract's knowledge points, similar to dealing damage to a creature's hit points. As the knowledge points decrease, the contract reveals its secrets. The amount of kp reduced on a successful Research check depends on the intellectual capacities of the contract's primary researcher. A character with the ability to attempt any Knowledge check untrained (such as a [bard](class/bard), [loremaster](prestigeclass/loremaster), or [skald](class/skald)) reduces a contract's kp by 1d12 + the character's Intelligence modifier. Other scholarly characters ([alchemists](class/alchemist), [arcanists](class/arcanist), [investigators](class/investigator), [wizards](class/wizard), and so on, at the GM's discretion) reduce the contract's knowledge points by 1d8 + the character's Intelligence modifier. All other characters reduce the contract's knowledge points by 1d4 + the character's Intelligence modifier. Rolling a natural 20 on a Research check acts like a critical threat. If the researcher confirms the critical hit by immediately succeeding at a second Research check with all the same modifiers, the resulting knowledge point reduction is doubled. Rolling a natural 1 on a Research check results in an automatic failure, and the contract's knowledge points increase by 1d8. Because of the purposefully obtuse nature of infernal contracts, some researchers reach a dead end in their understanding of the document and are unable to further decrease a contract's knowledge points. Failing two consecutive Research checks means the researcher has misunderstood the contract's terms. In this case, the contract's knowledge points return to maximum and the researcher can't attempt to research that particular contract again until he gains a level.",
			"",
			"Infernal contracts contain only the overt terms of the agreement and, potentially, oblique provisos. Unless a GM stipulates otherwise, no knowledge other than that specified is gained through researching a contract. Not every infernal contract has hidden language-some are completely forthright. Those that do conceal cunningly disguised traps, though, can have their secrets revealed by reducing the contract's kp to its hidden condition threshold. Note that it is possible for a contract to have multiple hidden condition thresholds, though the ones detailed in this book have only one each. If such an unfavorable term is called out to a devil, it will usually acquiesce to changing the contract, though doing so means creating the contract all over again, and the new contract is by no means assured to be free of insidious new stipulations.",
			"",
			"Once a contract's kp is reduced to 0, the researcher discovers a flaw that could allow for an early termination of the contract. A mortal might exploit such a loophole to end the contract. In doing so, she would lose the contract's benefit but regain her soul. The specifics of this loophole might not be simple to engineer, but they provide hope of an escape. Not all infernal contracts contain such flaws, although the four detailed in [Sample Contracts](rule/sample_contracts) do."

			"",
			"**When an infernal contract is signed, two copies manifest:** one for the mortal signee and one for the devil. The mortal is free to do whatever he pleases with his copy, though destroying it is rarely directly helpful. Devils tend to do one of two things with their copies: Some keep the documents close at hand, securing them in vaults or in the care of guardians of their choosing. Most, however, send their contracts back to Hell for safekeeping, typically to the Fallen Fastness in Dis. In this infernal library, contracts are protected by countless diabolical scholars, the sanity shattering complexity of the library's organization, and its planar inaccessibility. For most mortals, retrieving a contract from Hell is practically impossible. Yet even once an infernal contract is signed and secured, there are still routes by which it might be changed-or escaped.",
			"",
			"**Transferring a Contract:** A devil might be convinced to adjust the terms of an infernal contract to apply to a different mortal. Just as in the case of the original signee, the new mortal must enter into the contract freely, accepting the benefits but also the damnation. Occasionally, a damned mortal can convince a second mortal to take his place in an infernal deal, or a particularly self-sacrificing mortal might decide to take on a loved one's contract. In either case, the devil must deem the new signee an equal or more valuable soul. Only the devil that created the original document (or had it created) can adjust the terms of an infernal contract, which must be done in the presence of the former signee, the new signee, and one copy of the original contract. Once the new signee commits her signature to the contract, with the devil as witness, the former signee's name is erased and both copies of the contract immediately change. The effects of the adjusted contract are left to the parties involved, but most commonly, the former signee loses all benefits and conditions of the contract, while the new signee gains them.",
			"",
			"**Destroying a Contract:** If both copies of an infernal contract are destroyed, the contract ends. The mortal and devil lose all benefits of the contract, and the mortal's soul is released to follow whatever natural course it might take upon death. This requires obtaining both copies of the contract, which isn't easy; a devil guards its contracts and isn't likely to let a mortal go back on a contract without a fight. Recovering the devil's copy of a contract might require the mortal to plunge into the depths of Hell itself.",
			"",
			"If the mortal signee has already died and her soul is already in Hell, destroying the contract does not transport the soul to the afterlife where it otherwise would have been sent. The best the petitioner can hope for is to be liberated from her tortures, and her escape is made even more challenging by the fact that her soul is now free game for all of Hell's various deadly denizens. Moreover, the weight of having made a deal with a devil stays with a soul for the rest of its existence. Even after escaping a contract (or Hell itself, in the previous case), a mortal might still be forsaken by her deity and find herself condemned to Hell or any of the other evil-aligned planes. Actual salvation might require much more than the mere destruction of the infernal contract."

This can be roleplayed or can be assumed to run in the background without needing to be defined or actively played out. Time spent ruling cannot be used for adventuring, crafting magic items, or completing other [downtime activities](rule/downtime_activities) that require your full attention and participation. Failure to complete your duties during a turn means treating the role as thought it's vacant.",

			"**PCs and NPCs as Leaders:** These rules include enough important leadership roles that a small group of PCs can't fill them all. You may have to recruit NPCs to fill out the remaining necessary roles for your kingdom. Cohorts, followers, and even intelligent familiars or similar companions can fill leadership roles, and you may want to consider inviting allied NPCs to become rulers, such as asking a friendly ranger you rescued to become the kingdom's Marshal.",
			"",
			"**Abdicating a Role:** If you want to step down from a leadership position, you must find a replacement to avoid incurring the appropriate vacancy penalty for your position. Abdicating a position increases Unrest by 1 and requires a Loyalty check; if the check fails, the vacancy penalty applies for 1 turn while the new leader transitions into that role. If you are the Ruler, abdicating increases Unrest by 2 instead of 1, and you take a -4 penalty on the Loyalty check to avoid the vacancy penalty.",

If a benefit mentions a particular phase in kingdom building, that benefit applies every turn during that phase. For example, the Royal Enforcer decreases Unrest by 1 at every Upkeep phase.",

			"**Vacancy Penalty:** This line explains the penalty to your kingdom if no character fills this role, or if the leader fails to spend the necessary time fulfilling his responsibilities. Some roles have no vacancy penalty. If a character in a role is killed or permanently incapacitated during a turn and not restored to health by the start of the next kingdom turn, that role counts as vacant for that next turn, after which a replacement can be appointed to the role.",
			"",
			"Like benefits, most vacancy penalties are constant, last as long as that role is vacant, and don't stack with themselves. If a vacant role lists an increase to Unrest, however, that increase does not go away when the role is filled. For example, if the kingdom doesn't have a ruler for a turn, Unrest increases by 4 and doesn't automatically return to its previous level when you eventually fill the vacant Ruler role."

As the leaders, you use your power and influence to direct the economic and constructive activity of your kingdom, deciding what gets built, when, and where.",

In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000 gp; use this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom expenditures are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one currency to the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend gp to increase the kingdom's BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold for your character to spend.",

The leaders aren't selling any expensive items, so nothing happens in Step 3. In Step 4, Rob, the Treasurer, rolls the Economy check to collect taxes. Rob rolls a 9 on the 1d20, adds the kingdom's Economy score (55), and subtracts Unrest (4) for a total of 60, which means the kingdom adds 20 BP (the Economy check result of 60, divided by 3) to the Treasury. At the end of this phase, the kingdom has Economy 55, Loyalty 42, Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and Treasury 27 BP."

			"Before you can start your own kingdom, you first need a base of operations-a fort, village, or other settlement-where you can rest between adventures and where your citizens know they can find you if they need help or want to pay their taxes. Once you have a kingdom, you'll want to create more settlements in order for the kingdom to grow and prosper. To found a settlement, you must perform the following steps.

The first is to purchase it with your own gp, which makes it your personal property and means you may do with it what you please (use it, sell it at half price for gold, deposit it in the kingdom's Treasury during the next Income phase, use it as a reward for a local general, and so on).",
			"",
			"The second method is to manipulate your kingdom's economy to encourage an NPC to purchase the item (such as a random adventurer passing through the settlement). During Step 3 of the Income phase, you may attempt one Economy check for each filled slot you want to empty. For every such check after the first one in a turn, your Economy decreases by 1, since these manipulations are harmful to your kingdom's economy and typically only serve to get rid of an item you consider undesirable. If the check fails, nothing happens. If the check succeeds, erase the item from that slot; you may attempt to fill the empty slot as normal in the next Upkeep phase. You do not gain any gp or BP from this sale; the money goes to the building's owner, who uses it to acquire or craft the next item.",
			"",
			"The third way is to spend BP (1 BP = 2,000 gp) to purchase the item. If you take the item for your own use, this counts as withdrawing BP from the Treasury for your personal use (see [Make Withdrawals from the Treasury](rule/kingdom_income_phase)). If you use the item in a way that doesn't directly benefit you or the other PCs (such as giving it to a hero of your army or donating it to a settlement as a religious or historical artifact), then purchasing it is essentially like other kingdom expenditures and does not increase Unrest or decrease Loyalty."

This should not occur, however, if you build too many Houses, Parks, Tenements, or Waterways.",

			"**Upgrade To/From:** Some buildings can be converted into a more advanced form of the existing building, such as converting a Shrine into a Temple. To upgrade a building, pay the BP cost difference between the current building and the new building. Remove the modifiers from the old building and apply the modifiers from the new building. Upgrading counts as constructing a building for the purpose of the maximum number of buildings you can construct on your turn. You can't upgrade a building to a larger one if there isn't space in the District Grid for the building's new size.  ",

			"**Magic Items:** This lists any magic item slot the building creates, which may be filled in the Upkeep phase (see [Magic Items in Settlements](rule/magic_items_in_settlements)). If a building lists multiple options within a category (such as -1 minor potion or wondrous item), it has an equal chance for each option.  ",
			"**Settlement:** This lists [settlement modifiers](rule/settlement_modifiers) that affect specific skills within the settlement. These modifiers are ongoing from turn to turn, but apply only to skill checks within that settlement (not other settlements in the hex or anywhere else in your kingdom). Note that the GameMastery Guide also uses a settlement statistic called Economy; to avoid confusion with the Economy kingdom score, this book renames the Economy settlement statistic \"Productivity.\"",

Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check. If both succeed, the cult is disbanded before your kingdom takes any penalties from the event. For each of these checks you fail, Unrest increases by 1 and Productivity, Society, and Stability decrease by 1. If both checks fail, the event continues in the next Event phase.",

			"",
			"**Food Surplus:** Farmers produce an unexpected windfall! In the next Upkeep phase, the kingdom's Consumption is halved (but returns to normal on the next turn).

			"**Land Rush:** Overeager settlers claim an unclaimed hex and construct a Farm, Mine, Quarry, or Sawmill at their own expense, but are fighting over ownership. This hex is not part of your kingdom, so you gain no benefits from it. Productivity, Society, and Stability decrease by 1. Attempt a Loyalty check. If you succeed, Unrest increases by 1.

The CR of the monster encounter is equal to the party's APL + 1d4 - 1. You can personally deal with the monster (earning XP and treasure normally for your efforts) or succeed at a Stability check to eliminate it (which doesn't affect you or the kingdom's statistics). If the monster is not defeated this turn, Unrest increases by 4. If the kingdom's Unrest is 5 or higher, the monster's hex becomes unclaimed-this is in addition to losing control of hexes in the Upkeep phase because of the kingdom's high Unrest score.",
			"",
			"**Natural Blessing:** A natural event, such as a bloom of rare and beautiful wildflowers or a good omen in the stars, raises your kingdom's morale. You gain a +4 bonus on Stability checks until the next Event phase.",

			"",
			"**Plague (Hex or Settlement, Continuous):** A deadly sickness strikes the target hex or settlement. You cannot construct terrain improvements or buildings there while plague persists. Attempt two Stability checks, each with a penalty equal to the number of Brothels, Foreign Quarters, Highways, Inns, Piers, Roads, Stables, Stockyards, Tenements, and Waterfronts in the hex, and a bonus equal to the number of Alchemists, Cathedrals, Herbalists, Hospitals, and Temples in the hex. If you succeed at both checks, the event ends, but Stability decreases by 2 and Treasury by 1d3 BP. If you fail at one check, Stability decreases by 4, Treasury decreases by 1d6 BP, and Unrest increases by 1d3. If you fail at both, Stability decreases by 4, Treasury decreases by 1d6 BP, Unrest increases by 1d6, and in the next Event phase the plague spreads to an adjacent hex.",
			"",
			"**Political Calm:** A sudden absence of political machinations coincides with an increase in public approval. Unrest decreases by 1d6. Until the next Event phase, you gain a +2 bonus on checks to resolve continuous events. If your kingdom has no Unrest and no continuous events, both Loyalty and Stability increase by 1. If you are using Law settlement modifiers for the kingdom (see [Expanding Settlement Modifiers](rule/expanding_settlement_modifiers)), this also increases Law by 1 for the entire kingdom.",
			"",
			"**Public Scandal:** One of your leaders is implicated in a crime or an embarrassing situation, such as an affair with another leader's spouse. Infamy increases by 1. Attempt a Loyalty check. If you fail, Unrest increases by 2 and you take a -4 penalty on all Loyalty checks until the next Event phase.",
			"",
			"**Remarkable Treasure (Settlement):** The settlement immediately fills one of its open magic item slots (selected randomly) with a better than normal item (medium if a minor slot, major if a medium slot). Treat the settlement's base value as 50% higher than normal for determining the item's maximum price. If the settlement doesn't have any open magic item slots, treat this event as Unexpected Find.",
			"",
			"**Sensational Crime (Settlement, Continuous):** A serial killer, arsonist, or daring bandit plagues your kingdom. Attempt two Stability checks, adding the settlement's Law and subtracting its Crime. If you succeed at both checks, the criminal is caught before your kingdom takes any penalties from the event. If you fail at one, the criminal escapes, Unrest increases by 1, and the event is continuous. If you fail at both, the criminal makes a fool of the authorities; Law and Loyalty decrease by 1, Treasury decreases by 1d4 BP, Unrest increases by 2, and the event is continuous.",
			"",
			"**Slavers (Settlement, Continuous):** Criminals begin kidnapping citizens and selling them into slavery.

If you fail at one of the checks, Corruption increases by 1d2 in each settlement, [Crime](rule/settlement_modifiers) increases by 1 for the kingdom, Productivity for the kingdom decreases by 1d3, Treasury decreases by 1d3 BP, and the event is not continuous.

			"",
			"**Squatters (Settlement, Continuous):** An empty settlement lot is taken over by beggars, troublemakers, and people unable to find adequate work or housing; they camp there with tents, wagons, and shanties. You cannot use the lot for anything until the squatters are dispersed. Fame and Stability decrease by 1, and Unrest increases by 2. You may try to disperse the squatters with a Stability check. Success means the squatters are dispersed and the event is not continuous, but if a House or Tenement is not built in that lot on the next turn, Infamy increases by 1 and Unrest by 2. Failing the Stability check means the event is continuous, and you may not build on that lot until the event is resolved.",
			"",
			"**Unexpected Find (Settlement):** Local citizens discover a forgotten magical item. The settlement gains one temporary minor (01-70) or medium (71-100) magic item slot that is automatically filled in the next Upkeep phase. This slot and the item go away if the item is purchased or in the next Event phase, whichever comes first.",
			"",
			"**Vandals (Settlement):** Thugs and dissidents riot and destroy property. Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check. If you succeed at both, the vandals are stopped before your kingdom takes any penalties. If you fail at one check, Society decreases by 1 and one random building in the settlement is damaged.

			"Trade edicts are special edicts that allow you to create a trade route with another kingdom, increasing the BP you gain every month, as well as possibly increasing your Fame and other kingdom statistics.",
			"",
			"To plan a trade route, select another kingdom as your trade partner and determine the distance in hexes from a settlement in your kingdom to a settlement in the target kingdom, tracing the path of the trade route rather than a direct line. A trade route can pass through grassland, desert, or any terrain that has a road or highway. If your settlement contains a Pier, the trade route can pass along rivers and coastal hexes. If your settlement contains a Waterfront, your trade route can pass through water hexes.",
			"",
			"Longer trade routes are harder to maintain than short ones. To determine the effective length of your trade route, hexes with roads or rivers count normally. Grassland and desert hexes count double. Water hexes and hexes with highways count as half. This total distance is the Trade Route Length (TRL). Divide the Trade Route Length by 10 to get the Route Modifier (RM). Subtract the TRL from your kingdom's Size to get the Length Modifier (LM), with a minimum LM of 0.",
			"",
			"Establishing a trade route takes 1 hex per day along Roads and Rivers (upstream), 2 along coastlines, and 4 along water or Rivers (downstream). If the journey requires 1 turn or more, you gain no benefits from it until the turn the traders arrive at their destination. You must invest at least 5 BP into the initial trade expedition using this trade route.

A successful food trade route increases Economy by 1 for every 10 Farms and Fisheries in the kingdom; this benefit is lost in any month that Farms and Fisheries do not reduce Consumption below 0. You must have at least 1 Granary and 1 Stockyard in your settlement.",

			"**Goods:** The trade route transports goods such as weapons and textiles. Count all Guildhalls, Smithies, Shops, Trade Shops, and Tanneries in the starting settlement and divide by 10; a successful goods trade route increases Economy by this amount. You must have at least 1 Guildhall in your settlement.",

Count all Alchemists, Caster's Towers, Exotic Artisans, Herbalists, Luxury Stores, and Magic Shops in the starting settlement and divide by 10; a successful luxuries trade route increases Economy by that amount. You must have at least 1 Luxury Store in your settlement.",

If both armies have ranged attacks, they may choose to stay at range and never approach each other for melee (at least until they run out of ammunition, though the Consumption cost of maintaining an army generally means the army is capable of many shots before this happens). Armies without ranged capability can't attack during this phase, but may still rush forward.",

If an army has a resource, the listed Consumption is for an army of the listed size; if you change the size of the army, remember to subtract the Consumption cost for its original size, scale that cost to the new size (see [Table 4-16: Resource Scaling](unknown/table_4-16__resource_scaling)), then add the scaled cost to the army's base Consumption cost. If the army lists an additional cost for recruiting the army, this recruitment cost scales in the same way.",

For example, an individual troglodyte's stench nauseates opponents, but there is no army special ability that does that, so the troglodyte army has paralysis instead, which has a comparable effect. Likewise, the astral deva army has the alchemy ability, which is a reasonable approximation of an individual astral deva's ability to use [heal](spell/heal) once per day; the one-unit army doesn't actually carry alchemist extracts.",
			"",
			"If a special ability provides a constant bonus (such as the bonus from charge or pounce), that bonus is automatically included in the army's stat block.

This represents the unit's special defenses (such as damage reduction) and high damage output against single targets, which should affect an opposing army in a greater way than the standard monster-to-army conversion rules would indicate. Determining army stat block values for small numbers of powerful monsters is more of an art than a science."

And of the young elf who spends years studying musty tomes and practicing simple spells before she heads out into the world to seek ancient lore. These are the stories of everyday adventurers, risen from the ranks of the common folk to make a name for themselves in places harsh and unforgiving.",
			"",
			"But these are not the only stories of heroism. Some adventurers are beyond exemplary-their stories forge the greatest sagas of history, and their every deed births a legend. From the children of gods, blessed with the divine spark, to the lucky heroes born under auspicious stars, these characters are destined to greatness. They are mythic: possessed of unparalleled heroism and capable of astounding acts.",
			"",
			"To be mythic means to draw upon a power that few even dare to understand, and even fewer hope to wield. An air of destiny surrounds mythic characters, and each choice they make shapes the world at large. Their story is intertwined with the great events of the day, and their actions are central to the outcomes. Mythic characters are more resilient and powerful than others, and as a result are awe-inspiring in ways their non-mythic counterparts could never match. Other adventurers might balk at taking on a dragon that plagues a village, but mythic heroes would not only take on the dragon, but also clear the entire region of threats.",
			"",
			"Ultimately, the story of mythic heroes is defined by the challenges they face. The GM has a number of new and awe-inspiring tools with which to confront mythic player characters, ranging from immense and deadly mythic monsters to vile and cunning mythic villains. Mythic monsters are unique creatures or remnants of a bygone age when such terrifying beasts ruled over the land. They now dwell in the lost places of the world, waiting for their time to bring great terror. Mythic villains have many of the powers of mythic characters, but they use their abilities selfishly-to subjugate kingdoms, slaughter the innocent, and bring ruin to the world. Unless heroes rise to stop them, mythic villains can cause destruction and chaos on an unimaginable scale.",
			"",
			"Even with such great power, mythic characters are not invulnerable, just more able to deal with the dangers of the world around them. If a mythic character dies, her loss is a great tragedy to the world, as the light of one of its true champions has been extinguished. This is what makes a mythic story exciting: these heroes might fall, just as non-mythic heroes might succumb to lesser threats. And when they do succeed, their victory often comes at a high cost, and usually leaves them scarred.",

			"In a world of might and sorcery, with dragons and elves, what does it mean to be \"mythic\"? Being mythic means possessing a degree of might unusual even in a fantasy world. Scenes turn more dramatic, the enemies are more lethal, and the consequences of the heroes' actions make a far-ranging impact. Being mythic means invoking a sense of wonder and awe even in those already accustomed to the strange and unusual.",
			"",
			"The way this book portrays the mythic narrative isn't solely about stories at 20th level and monsters with high Challenge Ratings-it's about the surprising and unfamiliar regardless of power and scale. Even 1st-level characters could be imbued with mythic power and become forces to be reckoned with. Similarly, lesser monsters such as ogres and skeletons that become mythic transform into terrifying foes with unknown powers, changing the nature of the story you're playing-and startling those accustomed to their non-mythic ilk.",
			"",
			"Not only the characters take on unexpected forms in mythic adventures; the setting does as well. The vistas are more dramatic, featuring flying islands and keeps that float in raging volcanoes. The colors are brighter, the sounds are more mysterious, and all of the other stimuli are sharper and more vibrant. Where the non-mythic hero would encounter a crumbling keep filled with familiar monsters, a mythic hero faces a towering citadel that builds itself from the bones of would-be invaders and is inhabited by cruel and malign creatures of nearly god-like power.",
			"",
			"Besides the setting, the challenges that face mythic characters are far more harrowing than usual. Enhanced abilities allow mythic characters to take on threats beyond the reach of those without such power. They can face with ease foes both powerful and numerous. The real challenge is when they take on mythic creatures that possess the same resilient nature and abilities similar in potency to those they themselves rely on. When a mythic hero comes face to face with a mythic monster, the battle is truly legendary.",
			"",
			"Finally, mythic adventures feature difficult choices and far-reaching consequences. As the characters progress through the story, they're tasked with taking on challenges that seem impossible even to them, and might be tempted to wander from their path. As mythic heroes, they're the first to respond to cataclysmic events, just as they're the last bastion to stem the tide of evil and darkness that threatens to wash over the world. Their successes and failures leave marks on the world for centuries to come."

			"**Ascension:** The [moment of ascension](unknown/moment_of_ascension) is the moment when a normal character becomes a mythic character. This event is usually a critical moment in the story that helps to define the mythic character's origin and the source of her power. Once a character has undergone ascension, she gains her first mythic tier and can select a mythic path.",
			"",
			"**Boon:** When a mythic character completes a particularly difficult task, the GM might reward that character with a [boon](unknown/boon). A boon represents having earned the favor of the source of the character's power. Once acquired, a boon allows the character to draw upon mythic power one additional time that day. A mythic character might be rewarded with a boon several times in a single session, but no more than once per encounter.",
			"",
			"**DR/Epic:** A type of damage reduction, DR/epic can be overcome only by a weapon with an enhancement bonus of +6 or greater. Weapons with special abilities also count as epic for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction if the total bonus value of all of their abilities (including the enhancement bonus) is +6 or greater.",
			"",
			"**Mythic:** With abilities seemingly beyond the those of ordinary mortals, a mythic character or mythic monster becomes part of a story that plays out on a greater scale than ordinary people can understand. An attack, spell, or other effect is considered mythic if it originates from a mythic source, such as a character or creature with a mythic tier or rank. (See [Mythic versus Non-Mythic](rule/mythic_versus_non-mythic).)",
			"",
			"**Mythic Path:** (Often referred to just as a \"path.\") The theme of a character's mythic abilities is determined by her [mythic path](unknown/mythic_path)-archmage, champion, guardian, hierophant, marshal, or trickster. Each path has a number of special abilities associated with it that the character can select as she advances in tier.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Power:** Each mythic character can call upon this [base mythic ability](unknown/base_mythic_ability) to influence destiny and fuel other abilities. At its most basic, mythic power is needed to use the surge ability, but it can also be called upon to use a number of other mythic abilities.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Rank:** (Often referred to just as a \"rank.\") Similar to tiers, [mythic ranks](unknown/mythic_ranks) are used to describe the approximate mythic power possessed by a monster. All creatures with a mythic rank are considered mythic for the purposes of feats, spells, magic items, and other abilities. Mythic ranks range from 1 to 10.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Tier:** (Often referred to just as a \"tier.\") Mythic characters advance in power by [gaining tiers](rule/gaining_tiers), each of which grants new abilities. Attaining a new mythic tier requires completing difficult trials within the campaign's story rather than accumulating experience points. Mythic tiers range from 1 to 10. Characters who achieve 10th tier are at the height of mythic power, and are in some respects akin to minor deities.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Trial:** (Often referred to just as a \"trial.\") A [trial](unknown/trial) is a difficult task that awaits mythic heroes. It usually represents the culmination of part of the heroes' story, marking it as an important point in their legend. A mythic character has to complete one or more trials in order to reach a new mythic tier. Trials and mythic path advancement are separate from XP and character level advancement, and are based on grand achievements within the story rather than individual encounters.",
			"",
			"**Non-Mythic:** Any attack, spell, or effect originating from a character or creature without any mythic abilities is non-mythic. This term can also refer to a character without a mythic tier or a creature without a mythic rank.(See [Mythic versus Non-Mythic](rule/mythic_versus_non-mythic).)",

In such a campaign, you should work with your GM to determine the source of your mythic power. This could be anything from contact with an ancient artifact to gaining the sponsorship of a deity. The GM might ask for all of the PCs to share some aspects of their power-such as its source-to give them a common bond, or you might come together as part of a larger destiny, a gathering of great heroes to accomplish truly legendary deeds.",

This critical part of the story is called the moment of ascension. Depending on the style of the campaign, this could occur very early in the story or much later in your character's career, as part of larger plotline.

Changing form in this way is a standard action. The target can assume another form as often as it likes for the duration of the spell. If you're the target, you can change forms as a swift action rather than a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power when you cast the spell, you can also grant the target the ability to assume the shape of one specific individual that the spell could duplicate (for example, the target could use polymorph to assume the form of a specific animal, humanoid, or elemental, but not a dragon because dragon forms aren't allowed by polymorph).

You can add magical enhancements, intelligent item powers, and intelligent item senses as if you possessed the appropriate crafting feat. (For example, if your familiar transforms into a staff, you could craft it into an intelligent staff of fire as if you possessed the Craft Staff feat.) You must still pay for enhancements as normal.

			"**Sanctum (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 19](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain access to your own personal extradimensional sanctum. By concentrating for 1 minute without interruption, you conjure the door to your own personal sanctum, similar to mage's magnificent mansion, but with the following differences. The sanctum takes up a space equal to six 20-foot cubes per tier, shapeable when you first create it as if it were a spell whose area or effect is shapeable. The sanctum is permanent and persistent, so you can store objects within the sanctum and retrieve them on future visits. The sanctum includes one unseen servant per tier. When you conjure the sanctum's door, you decide which creatures can see and use it (to all other creatures it's invisible and impermeable). The door remains until you dismiss it-a standard action with unlimited range as long as you are on the same plane as the door. If you dismiss the door while you are outside the sanctum, all creatures other than your familiar are immediately shunted outside. Conjuring the door automatically dismisses any other active door. As a full-round action, your familiar can enter or leave the sanctum from any square adjacent to you, without using the conjured door.",
			"",
			"**Star Walker (Su)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 21](source/mythic_origins)): You can transform your power to enable you to travel great distances. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to surround yourself with a bubble of air enclosed by a thin iridescent layer of force. While this bubble offers no protection from attacks, you can propel yourself through the air at great speed. As long as you concentrate, you gain a fly speed of 240 feet per round. If you cease concentrating, the bubble stops and then sinks 30 feet per round until it reaches the ground and collapses; you can expend one use of mythic power before the bubble collapses to regain control.",
			"",
			"In the void of outer space, the bubble's speed is much faster. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system takes 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond takes 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Ceasing concentration while in the void of outer space has no effect on the bubble-it continues traveling in the previously stated direction at the same speed until an outside force slows it down. The air in the sphere is constantly refreshed and kept at a constant temperature, protecting occupants from the void of space, but not necessarily the harsh climates of other planets or planes. By expending two additional uses of mythic power, you can increase the size of the bubble to a 10-foot-radius sphere and you can bring along up to 11 Medium creatures within the bubble. Other creatures can enter or exit the bubble freely."

			"The champion is the pinnacle of skill at arms and armor. No ordinary fighter could hope to match the skill with a blade, a bow, or an axe that surges within a mythic champion. The champion turns aside blows and shatters shields with every movement, all while racing gracefully across the chaotic battlefield. When the screams of fallen foes die down, the champion stands strong and defiant in blood-spattered armor, hefting a weapon and shouting a terrifying war cry.",
			"",
			"**Role:** As a champion, your role is to take the fight to your enemies. Using devastating melee powers, you can crush your enemies before they even have a chance to harm you and your allies. Few can match your skill at arms or your ability to perform amazing feats of strength. The champion abilities allow you to control your foes, move easily around the battlefield, and challenge a large number of foes all at once. The rest of the party can count on you to dominate any melee you charge into.",

			"**Classes:** While members or nearly any class could be champions, those who focus on melee attacks' barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, monks, paladins, and rangers-will find the abilities in this path most attractive and useful.

You take no falling damage from the height gained as part of this leap. If your attack hits, you may deal an amount of additional damage equal to the falling damage appropriate for the height you reached.

If the attack hits, your foe is also knocked directly away from you a distance equal to 10 feet per tier. If the foe strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it couldn't travel. If it strikes another creature, both it and the creature it strikes take half this damage.",
			"",
			"**Burst Through (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 21](source/mythic_adventures)): When you charge, you can move through allies and opponents almost as if they were not there to obstruct your path. You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent.

In addition, you add your tier to your leadership score when determining the number of followers you gain. Whenever you are within 100 feet of such followers, each follower can use the surge ability once per day without needing to expend mythic power. The followers use the same die type as your surge ability. If you have or gain the Leadership feat, you gain followers from both this ability and the Leadership feat (in effect doubling the number of followers gained).",

As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information. You can maintain this connection with only one creature at a time; if you use this ability on another creature, your connection with the previous creature is lost.",

			"**Juggernaut (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 22](source/mythic_origins)): Little can stand in your way when you charge forth into battle-even solid doors and walls don't stand a chance. While charging, you may attempt a free Strength check to break through a single door or wall in your path. You can expend one use of mythic power while performing this charge to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on your Strength check to break the object. If you destroy the object, you can continue your charge as though it were never there. If you fail to destroy the object, your movement ends in the square before that object. Note that destroying integral parts of a structure may trigger a collapse (treat as a cave-in) at the GM's discretion. This ability can be combined with other path abilities and effects that modify charge attacks, such as the *burst through* path ability. You can select this ability up to three times. Each additional time you select it, you may break through one more wall or door during your charge, and the circumstance bonus on your Strength check increases by 10 (to a maximum of a +30 circumstance bonus).",

Whenever you charge a creature while mounted, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet of your target, adding your tier to the result of the check. If you expend one use of mythic power, any creature demoralized by this ability is frightened instead of shaken. The duration of this condition is dependent upon your check, as noted in the Intimidate skill.",

			"",
			"When you use the surge mythic ability against a creature whose mythic tier or rank is higher than yours, you add the difference between your tiers as a bonus to the surge result; if the surge applied to an attack roll, the attack also deals additional damage equal to your tier.

For a throw, you can throw the target of your grapple up to 10 feet per tier; if the creature strikes a solid object before reaching this distance, it takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of the remaining throwing distance and lands prone. For a crush, you deal 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. For a swing, you can use the target as a weapon against another creature, treating the grappled creature as a twohanded weapon.

If you expend one use of mythic power when you use this ability, this damage ignores the hardness of the wall.

Whenever you score a successful critical hit against an adjacent creature, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to potentially disable one of that creature's limbs. Mythic creatures receive a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your Strength modifier + your tier), while non-mythic creatures do not. An affected creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and one of its limbs (your choice) is mangled. If you choose to disable an arm, the creature drops anything held in that arm, cannot hold items in that arm, and makes natural attacks with that arm at a -4 penalty. If you choose to disable a leg, the target's base movement speed is halved. These penalties are removed when the Constitution damage taken from this ability is healed. Foes that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are those with unusual anatomies (subject to GM discretion).",

As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power and pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. For a number of rounds equal to your tier, you are immune to this energy type and all of your melee and ranged attacks deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of this energy type.

While using the *uncanny grapple* path ability, if you throw a creature into a solid object, that object takes the same amount of damage as the creature; if this is enough to break the object, the creature continues to move through it. If you throw the creature into another creature, resolve the attack as a bull rush by you, except the thrown creature moves with the bull rush and does not incur any attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares. If you crush the creature, you can choose to deal either 1d6 points of lethal damage per tier or 1d8 points of nonlethal damage per tier, and you can limit the damage you deal to the amount required to render the target unconscious. If you swing the creature as a weapon, add your tier to the amount of damage you deal to both creatures; if you score a critical hit, the target of the swing attack also takes damage from a melee natural attack from the creature you are swinging (if it has one; choose randomly if it has more than one).

Each additional time you select it, the range increment increases by an additional 10 feet per tier and the maximum size of an object you can throw increases by one size category.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Damage (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 24](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you deal damage to a creature with damage reduction, you can overcome one of the following types of damage reduction: chaotic, cold iron, evil, good, lawful, magic, or silver. You can change this type with each attack. This ability only aids in overcoming one type of damage reduction; if the creature's damage reduction requires a combination of different types of damage, you must be able to overcome the other types using other means.",
			"",
			"**Precision (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 24](source/mythic_adventures)): Your deadly attacks are far more likely to hit their target than those of others. Whenever you make a full attack, your attack bonus on the additional attacks you gain by having a high base attack bonus is 5 higher. This ability can't give any of these attacks a higher attack bonus than your base attack bonus. For example, a 12th-level fighter normally has a base attack bonus of +12/+7/+2; with this ability, his base attack bonus is +12/+12/+7. This ability doesn't reduce the penalties from two-weapon fighting or other situational penalties on attack rolls (such as Combat Expertise, Power Attack, fighting defensively, or harmful conditions). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the attack bonus on additional attacks increases by another 5.",
			"",
			"**Titan's Rage (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 24](source/mythic_adventures)): You can cause yourself to grow in size, becoming a terrifying sight to behold. As a standard action (or a free action if you have the rage class feature), you can expend one use of mythic power to increase your size to one size category larger. This grants you a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, imposes a -2 penalty to Dexterity, grants you a +2 natural armor bonus, increases your natural reach by 5 feet, and increases your weapon damage based on the new size of your weapons. This size increase lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, and doesn't stack with any other spell or ability that alters your size.",
			"",
			"**To the Death (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 24](source/mythic_adventures)): You can shrug off wounds that others would find devastating. When below 0 hit points, you don't fall unconscious, but are instead staggered. You lose 1 hit point at the end of each turn when you take a standard action while staggered in this way.",
			"",
			"**Unorthodox Infusion (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): You learn to master an infusion beyond those that normally apply to the elements in which you specialize. You learn a new infusion of your choice, regardless of that infusion's associated blasts. You can apply the chosen infusion to any blasts you are capable of using, even if they are not one of that infusion's associated blasts. You must be at least 3rd tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"**Unstoppable Shot (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 24](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use a ranged or thrown weapon to make a single powerful shot that shoots through all creatures in a line. As a standard action, make a single ranged attack roll and resolve the attack against all targets in a straight line up to the maximum range of your weapon, stopping at any barrier the attack couldn't penetrate. Roll damage once and apply that damage to each creature hit by the attack. Before making the attack roll, you can expend one use of mythic power to bend the path of the attack up to two times as it strikes targets or objects. Each deflection can alter the line of the attack up to 90 degrees, allowing you to shoot around corners or cover.",

			"You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.",
			"",
			"**Critical Master (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you roll a critical threat against a non-mythic creature, you automatically confirm the critical hit and deal the maximum amount of damage to that creature. This ability can be selected twice. The second time it is selected, it also applies to mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"**Fistful of Daggers (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): When you could make a full attack with thrown weapons, you can instead make a single attack roll at your highest attack bonus and apply the result to any number of creatures in a 30-foot cone. Roll damage once and deal it to all creatures hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. You must throw one weapon at each target. Use the bonuses to attack and damage from the least powerful weapon thrown (for example, if you have one +2 dagger and 20 masterwork daggers, the attacks are treated as masterwork daggers). Apply any effects of concealment for individual targets as normal. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target.",
			"",
			"**Kinetic Font (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to open up a wellspring of kinetic energy within yourself. Each round, beginning on the round in which you use this ability, you can reduce the total amount of burn you would take for a single blast or utility wild talent by 1, to a minimum of 0. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to half your mythic tier. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Strike (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of mythic power as a standard action to deliver a perfect strike. A perfect strike attack is made using your full base attack bonus. If the attack hits, it deals double the normal amount of damage, and this damage bypasses all damage reduction and hardness. If the perfect strike is a critical hit, increase the critical multiplier for the attack by 1 (so a &times;2 weapon deals &times;3 damage). Damage that isn't multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied on a perfect strike. Perfect strike can be used in conjunction with any champion's strike if you expend uses of mythic power for each ability separately.",
			"",
			"**Seven-League Leap (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 23](source/mythic_origins)): Your leap is so mighty that you defy gravity. Add your tier to Acrobatics checks made to jump. The distance you can jump in a round is not limited by your movement speed. If you are carrying no more than a light load, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a powerful jump that lets you sail through the air. In order to use this ability, you must be able to run in a straight line for 1 minute. Any obstacles or impediments that prevent you from completing this sprint uninterrupted prevent you from being able to use this ability, though the expenditure of mythic power is not wasted. At the end of your 1-minute sprint, you attempt an Acrobatics check and leap a distance up to half the check's result in miles, rounded down to the nearest mile (for example, an Acrobatics check result of 29 would allow you to jump 14 miles). This trip takes 1 round per mile, and you reach a maximum height at the apex of your arc equal to half the distance traveled. You do not take falling damage from using this ability. You must have a clear arc of travel to complete this jump; if you strike an obstacle mid-jump, you and the obstacle each take a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 &times; the number of miles you have left to travel. If this damage destroys the obstacle, you continue your jump; otherwise, your jump comes to an end and you fall, taking falling damage as appropriate. You cannot aim this leap accurately, and always land 50 to 5,000 feet (5d%) from your intended destination.",
			"",
			"**Shatter Spells (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): You can destroy a magical effect (whether it's on a creature or an independent effect such as a wall of fire) by attacking it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. You must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend one use of mythic power. If this attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic, using double your tier as your caster level. If you dispel an effect, you suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.",
			"",
			"**Sweeping Strike (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 25](source/mythic_adventures)): Even when you're swarmed, your foes are not safe from danger. Whenever you could make a full attack, you may instead make a single attack at your highest attack bonus and apply the results to all opponents within your reach. Roll damage once and apply it to all opponents hit by the attack. This attack can't deal precision damage. If the attack roll is a critical threat, choose one target you hit and attempt to confirm the critical against that target."

			"Not all mythic characters seek glory and fame for themselves. Some take a more humble route, watching over those dear to them or the lands they call home. Guardians seek connections with those around them, even the beasts, and draw their power from the trust of such bonds. This doesn't mean that all guardians are peaceful-indeed many use violent means to further their goals and safeguard those they watch over. But they find worth in those who travel with them. In battle, none can take the sort of punishment and wounds that a guardian can sustain.",
			"",
			"**Role:** When others would retreat, you stand your ground. Your place is at the front of the battle, taking every hit your enemies can give while daring them to dish out more. Your job is to stop your enemies' advance, interposing yourself in the path of peril. You'll gladly take all that brutal punishment and return the beating with zeal. The wounds you suffer might kill a lesser hero, but you relish the thrill of combat, confident that your physical and mental perfection will lead to victory.",
			"",
			"**Classes:** Any class that is frequently in the middle of a chaotic melee will find many valuable abilities within the guardian path. Barbarians, cavaliers, fighters, inquisitors, monks, and paladins all make excellent guardians. Some of the guardian's powers also lend themselves to the druid, ranger, or even the summoner, granting bonuses to companions and allies.",

If you have another ability or effect that reduces damage (such as protection from energy), reduce the damage with the absorb blow ability before applying any other damage-reducing effects. For every 10 points of damage that this ability prevents, for 1 minute you gain DR 1/epic and 5 points of resistance against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. The DR and resistances stack with any other DR and resistances that you have.",
			"",
			"*Beast's Fury (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to imbue your animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount with some of your mythic power. As an immediate action, that creature can move up to its speed and make an attack with one of its natural weapons. When making this attack, the creature rolls twice and takes the higher result. Any damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. A creature affected by this ability can take these actions in addition to any others that it takes during its turn.",
			"",
			"*Sudden Block (Su):* As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to hinder a melee attack made against you or an adjacent ally. Add your tier to your AC or the ally's AC against this attack. The creature making the attack must make two attack rolls and take the lower result. Once the attack is resolved, you or your ally (your choice) can make one melee attack against the creature. The damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",

			"**True Defender (Su):** At 10th tier, whenever you take damage from a melee or ranged attack scored by a nonmythic creature, the damage is halved.

			"**Adamantine Mind (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 26](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mind is as hard as any armor, and is dangerous to engage.

Whenever you succeed at a saving a throw against a disease or poison, you become immune to that disease or poison for a number of hours equal to half your tier.

			"**Armor Master (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You don't take an armor check penalty or incur an arcane spell failure chance when wearing light armor or using a shield (including a tower shield).

			"**Armored Might (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You treat the armor bonus from your armor as 50% higher than normal, to maximum increase of half your tier (minimum 1). For example, if you are 4th tier and wearing +2 breastplate, you treat the armor's +6 armor bonus as +8 (50% of +6 is +3, limited to +2 by half your tier).",
			"",
			"**Avenging Maneuver (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): Taking grievous wounds only empowers you. Any creature that confirms a critical hit with a melee attack against you provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can use this attack of opportunity only to attempt a bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver check. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for attempting this combat maneuver check.",
			"",
			"**Borrow Elements (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): When you take acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, you store some of this energy within yourself and can direct it outward through your attacks. Whenever you take energy damage, you gain an amount of energy of that type equal to 1/2 the damage taken (after any resistances or immunities are applied). Whenever you hit with a melee attack, you may expend 5 points from the pool of one energy type to have the attack deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage of that type. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to release all stored energy of one type as a ray with a 60-foot range.

You can move through squares containing allies freely, but you must succeed at an overrun combat maneuver check for each opponent that obstructs your path to the target of your charge. If the result of the check exceeds the opponent's CMD, you may move through the opponent's square and continue toward the target without provoking an attack of opportunity from that opponent. If you fail any of these combat maneuver checks, your movement ends in the square before that opponent, but you may resolve the charge attack against the foe that stopped you.",
			"",
			"**Draw Fire (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): As an immediate action, when an ally within 30 feet is targeted with a ranged weapon attack, you can have that attack target you instead. If you would normally be out of range for that attack, the attack is able to hit you as if you were at maximum range. You can use this ability without using an immediate action by expending one use of mythic power.",
			"",
			"**Empathic Healing (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 27](source/mythic_adventures)): You can expend one use of mythic power to transfer up to 10 points of damage per tier from a touched ally to yourself, healing the target and damaging you. This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.",

			"**Ever Ready (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to your mythic tier. You can make attacks of opportunity while flat-footed, even if you don't have the Combat Reflexes feat.

			"**Guardian's Shout (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Your warning shouts keep allies from danger. Whenever you attempt a Reflex save to avoid an effect that affects multiple creatures, you can expend one use of your mythic power to call out a warning to your allies. Any allies within 100 feet who can hear you gain a bonus equal to your tier on their saving throws against that effect.",
			"",
			"**Immovable (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Add your tier to your CMD whenever an enemy attempts a bull rush, drag, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against you.

			"**Imprinting Hand (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): By touching a foe, you can gain knowledge about it, including its weaknesses. To use this ability, you must first successfully hit a foe with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or melee touch attack to make contact, then use this ability is a free action. As long as the target remains within 1 mile of you, you always know the direction and approximate distance to it. If the foe has any weaknesses or vulnerabilities (including a mythic flaw), you immediately know this information.

			"**Indefatigable Traveler (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): You can run and charge while fatigued or exhausted, and you ignore the movement penalty while exhausted. When [traveling overland](rule/overland_movement), you can expend one use of mythic power to be able to hustle for a number of hours equal to your tier without taking nonlethal damage or becoming fatigued (this is in addition to the 1 hour per day normally allowed for hustling). In a day of normal walking, you can walk 8 hours plus 1 hour per tier before you must start making Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"**Irrepressible Soul (Su)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): Your true self can't be buried beneath disguises or magical effects. Once per round as a free action, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt to end one effect that is currently affecting you. When you use this ability, you make an additional saving throw against the effect at its original DC, even if one would not normally be allowed. This ability can end only polymorph effects, charm and compulsion effects, domination effects, illusion effects that change your appearance, and any effects that control or conceal your true identity. If you succeed at the second saving throw, the effect immediately ends.",
			"",
			"**Knowledgeable Guardian (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): Add double your tier as a bonus on Knowledge checks you attempt to identify monsters, including checks made to learn any special powers and vulnerabilities.

			"",
			"**Lesson Learned (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 28](source/mythic_adventures)): You adapt quickly to the perils presented in battle. Whenever you fail a saving throw against a supernatural or spell-like ability, you gain a +5 bonus on all further saving throws against that ability, including subsequent saves against an ongoing effect, or against the same effect produced by a different source or creature. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to your tier. For example, if you fail a save against a demon's fireball spell-like ability, you gain this bonus against a fireball spell-like ability from any creature; if you fail a save against a blue dragon's electricity breath weapon, you gain this bonus against all blue dragon electricity breath weapons, but not against a black dragon's acid breath weapon or a gorgon's petrification breath weapon. If you fail another saving throw against the same ability, the duration of lesson learned resets but the bonus doesn't stack with itself.",
			"",
			"**Mule's Strength (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 24](source/mythic_origins)): You treat your Strength score as 5 higher when determining your carrying capacity. This bonus applies to encumbrance, the maximum weight you can lift over your head, dragging and pushing, and so on. You can take this path ability multiple times. Each time you do, you treat your Strength score as an additional 5 points higher when determining your carrying capacity.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Companion (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Select one animal companion, cohort, eidolon, familiar, or bonded mount. That creature can use the surge ability a number of times per day equal to your tier. Its surge ability uses the same bonus die type as you do when you use your surge ability.",
			"",
			"**Mythic Mercy (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use the mercy paladin class feature, your caster level check to remove curses, diseases, and poisons automatically succeeds unless the affliction is from a mythic source.

You must have the mercy class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Pack Wild Shape (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use the wild shape class feature, you can also transform allies when you change shape. When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies. The transformation ends for everyone when you return to your normal form or use wild shape again. An ally can end its own transformation early as a standard action without affecting the duration for you or other allies. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Partial Transformation (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You have refined control over your transformation ability. When using wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to only partially transform into or out of animal form. For example, you could transform your hands into tiger claws and your head into a tiger's head (giving you low-light vision and scent, and allowing you to make claw and bite attacks but still wear armor and use worn magic items normally), transform into a deinonychus with human hands (allowing you to still manipulate objects and wear rings), or transform into a constrictor snake with a humanoid head (allowing you to speak and cast spells with verbal components). You may make one such change per round as a free action for the duration of that use of wild shape. For example, if you change into a tiger, this ability allows you to partially transform yourself from tiger form to your normal form and back as needed until the duration ends or you fully return to your normal form. You must have the wild shape class feature to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Quick Recovery (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you are dazed, dazzled, deafened, sickened, or stunned, reduce the duration of that condition by half (minimum 1 round). Any other effects relating to the source of that condition are unaffected; for example, if you are panicked and sickened from an eyebite spell, the panicked effect has the normal duration even though you are sickened for only half as long. You can select this ability twice. The second time you select it, you also reduce the duration of the blinded, nauseated, and paralyzed conditions by half.",
			"",
			"**Raise Animal (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): By burying the corpse of a dead animal (at least its bones) and expending one use of mythic power, you raise it from the dead overnight. You can use this ability on an animal companion, familiar, or bonded mount even if it is not a creature of the animal type. At 1st tier, this functions like raise dead. At 3rd tier, this functions like resurrection. At 6th tier, this functions like true resurrection.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Disarm (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use a ranged attack to disarm an opponent. Attempt a disarm combat maneuver check using your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier, and add your tier to the roll. Using this ability doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If your attack is successful, your target drops one item of your choice that it is carrying, even if the item is wielded with two hands. If your attack exceeds the CMD of the target by 10 or more, the target drops the items it is carrying in both hands (maximum two items if the target has more than two hands). Unlike with a melee disarm, failing the attack by 10 or more doesn't make you drop your weapon, and you can't automatically pick up the item dropped.",
			"",
			"**Relentless Healing (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): You can restore life to the recently dead. If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power when casting a healing spell or using a class feature that heals damage to apply that healing to the dead creature. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.",
			"",
			"**Retributive Reach (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Treat your reach as 5 feet greater than normal for the purpose of determining whether or not you can make an attack of opportunity. If a creature provokes an attack of opportunity within this area of increased reach, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus equal to your tier on the attack roll and damage roll of the attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Sacrificial Shield (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 29](source/mythic_adventures)): Once per round when you would normally be hit by a weapon attack, you can use your shield to block the attack. You must be using a shield in order to use this ability. Subtract your shield's hardness and hit points (see [Table 7-12](rule/smashing_an_object)) from the damage of the attack and apply the remaining damage to your hit points. If the shield takes enough damage to destroy it, it's destroyed. Otherwise, it gains the broken condition, even if the damage was not enough to give it the broken condition under other circumstances. You can expend one use of mythic power when using this ability to negate any damage dealt to the shield, though you still take any damage that exceeds its hardness and hit points. You can choose to negate the damage after the damage is rolled.",
			"",
			"**Supreme Tracker (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 30](source/mythic_adventures)): If you have something that carries a creature's scent (such as a personal item or piece of flesh), you can expend one use of mythic power to create a supernatural bond that allows you track that individual. As a free action, you can sense the creature's general direction and distance, as well as know whether it is alive, dead, destroyed, dying, or undead. The creature must be on the same plane as you for this ability to function. For the purpose of spells and effects that block scrying and divination, your caster level for this effect is a number equal to double your tier. At 6th tier, you can track the creature if it's on a different plane than you.",

You are helpless and can't move or take other actions, nor replenish mythic power, but you age and consume bodily resources as though each year that passes were 1 minute. For example, if you could normally hold your breath for 3 minutes, you can use this ability to survive without air for 3 years.

Alternatively, you may focus this channeled energy so it affects only the undead creature that hit you.

If you do, add your channel energy damage to the damage from the critical hit. This damage is the same type as your channeled energy (positive or negative) but damages the target regardless of whether it's living or undead.

In all cases, the channel effect occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. For example, you could create a trigger that uses your channel positive energy if you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. If you prescribe complicated or convoluted conditions, your contingent channel energy ability could fail to trigger. The ability triggers based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to. You make all decisions about the ability when you expend the use of mythic power, according to what you can normally do with your channel energy ability; if you wish to exclude targets, you must name them at that time. You can have only one use of this ability waiting to be triggered at a time; if you use this ability again, the previous use expires.

Your caster level for this ability is equal to your character level. You can have only one creature that has been summoned using this ability at a time; summoning another causes the previous one to disappear. If you expend two uses of mythic power, the level of the summoning spell is equal to your tier instead. For example, if you are a 10th-level druid, 5th-tier hierophant, you can use this ability to summon one creature from the summon monster II or summon nature's ally II list (or a lowerlevel list) for 10 rounds; if you expend two uses, you can instead summon one creature from the summon monster V or summon nature's ally V list (or a lower-level list).",

This transferred damage bypasses all effects that reduce or negate hit point damage (such as damage reduction). Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power to transfer an ongoing disease or poison from a touched ally to yourself, which halts ongoing effects on the target from that affliction and requires you to attempt any remaining saves against it. If you're immune to the disease or poison, transferring it to yourself destroys the affliction.",

When talking or dealing with a non-mythic intelligent creature, you always detect the selected type of information without a skill check, though you do not necessarily understand what the information means. For example, realizing that someone is concealing an emotion doesn't necessarily tell you what emotion the person is hiding, whether she's lying, or why. This ability has no effect against mythic creatures. You can select this path ability up to three times. Each additional time you take it, you must choose an additional option.",

			"**Insightful Interaction (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 26](source/mythic_origins)): Add half your tier to Wisdom-based skill checks in which you are trained.

When spontaneously casting the opposite type of spell, you must use a spell slot that is at least 1 level higher than that of the spell you want to cast.

If you channel negative energy to heal undead, this is a profane bonus rather than a sacred bonus.",

When you use wild shape, you can expend one use of mythic power to select a number of willing allies equal to your tier. These allies take the same animal form as you do, with the same abilities as yours. Divide the duration of that use of wild shape evenly (rounded down) among yourself and the affected allies.

If a creature has died within 1 round, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to apply healing magic to that creature. This healing can be from a spell or effect you cause or from a magic item you wield. If this healing brings the creature's hit points above the threshold for death, it comes back to life and stabilizes at its new hit point total (similar to the way breath of life functions); otherwise, it remains dead. Alternatively, you can expend two uses of mythic power on a dead creature that would have the ability to magically heal itself if it were alive (such as a dead cleric with a prepared cure light wounds spell) in order to trigger the most powerful healing magic it knows or has prepared. If this brings the creature's hit points above its death threshold, it returns to life.",

This ability doesn't function if the creature is magically disguised or has been polymorphed into a different shape. You can automatically detect the alignment of any creature you see casting a divine spell; if that creature worships a deity, you also learn its deity. Spells and effects that mask a creature's alignment prevent the use of this ability. Whenever you cast a spell that affects creatures differently based on their alignment (such as holy smite), you may have the spell treat creatures of one particular alignment as an alignment one step away from that alignment.

For the next 10 rounds, you can apply this metamagic feat to any divine spell you cast without increasing the spell slot used or casting time. You can also use this ability on a divine spell cast from a scroll, staff, or wand. You can't have more than one use of this ability active at a time. If you use this ability again, any previous use immediately ends (though any metamagic effects on spells already cast remain). You can select this ability more than once. Each time you select it, the maximum spell slot level increase of the metamagic feat goes up by 1 to a maximum of 4.",

You can select this ability more than once. If you choose the same divine spellcasting class a second time, you gain four bonus 2nd-level spell slots; if you choose it again, you gain 3rd-level slots for choosing it a third time, and so on.

If the spell has other duration conditions, those still apply (for example, the duration of stoneskin changes to 24 hours or until discharged). A creature can't be subject to more than one spell affected by this ability at a time; if another is cast upon the creature, the first one ends. You can select this ability a second time at 6th tier or higher. The second time you select it, you can use it on spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or longer.",

If you expend one additional use of mythic power, the voice deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per tier to enemies within 60 feet of you who can hear it, and they are stunned for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wis modifier) halves the damage and negates the stun effect.",

			"**Hurling Vengeance (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 36](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you are wielding your deity's favored weapon or your paladin bonded weapon, you can throw it as if it had the returning and throwing weapon special abilities.

As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to target a single non-mythic intelligent undead creature within 60 feet with a blast of necromantic energy. Alternatively, you can expend an additional use of mythic power to target a mythic creature. The target can attempt a Will save against the effect (DC = 10 + half your tier + either your Charisma or Wisdom modifier, whichever is higher). If the target fails, its Intelligence score drops to -, leaving the creature mindless for a number of rounds equal to your tier. A target that fails its save receives a new saving throw each round to overcome the effect.",

In addition, whenever you channel energy to damage creatures (whether undead creatures with positive energy or living creatures with negative energy), you can choose to deal half damage (or one-quarter damage to creatures that succeed at their saving throws) and then push back all creatures damaged by the effect. You push each creature back 5 feet for every 1d6 points of channel energy damage you are capable of dealing.

			"**Overcome Curse (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 37](source/mythic_adventures)): You are immune to curse effects. For example, bestow curse has no effect on you, and you can handle, carry, or discard a cursed magic item without harm.

In order to use this ability, you must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to half the target's Hit Dice. The creature must have been slain within a number of rounds equal to your tier. You imbue the creature with enough positive or negative energy to allow its body to function without its spirit. This shell of a creature gains the mindless quality, and it acts like a puppet with you as the puppeteer.

The marshal is such a leader, renowned for his vision, courage, and strategic acumen. Soldiers flock to a marshal's banner for a chance to serve under such a commander, confident that his skill will see them through even the most difficult challenges.",
			"",
			"**Role:** As a marshal, your abilities allow you to inspire mythic and non-mythic allies alike to greatness. In a group, you protect and push your allies to even greater acts of heroism. All the while, the powers of the marshal allow you to take the lead, help your companions, and take the fight to your enemies.",
			"",
			"**Classes:** Bards, cavaliers, clerics, inquisitors, and paladins will all find a host of useful abilities in the marshal path. In fact, almost any character who assists others, both during combat and afterward, will likewise find that the path of the marshal includes a number of valuable abilities that will help in her noble endeavors.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Hit Points:** Whenever you gain a marshal tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.",
			"",
			"### Path Features",
			"",
			"As you gain tiers, you gain the following abilities.",
			"",
			"**Marshal's Order:** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"*Advance (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire a tactical advance on the field of battle. This allows you and each of your allies within 30 feet to take either a single move action of the character's choice or a 5-foot step, as long as you or your ally has the ability to take such an action (for example, an unconscious character still can't take an action). The action granted by this ability doesn't count toward the number or type of actions a creature is allowed to take on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Decisive Strike (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to give one ally within 30 feet the ability to immediately make a single melee or ranged attack on your turn. Add your tier as a bonus on the attack roll. The damage dealt by this attack bypasses all damage reduction. This attack doesn't count toward the ally's actions on its turn.",
			"",
			"*Rally (Su):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to rally your allies. This gives you and each of your allies within 30 feet the option to reroll any one d20 roll after the roll is made. The granted reroll must be used before the beginning of your next turn, and the creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"**Path Ability:** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the marshal path abilities lists or from the [universal path abilities lists](rule/universal_path_abilities). Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"**Visionary Commander (Su):** At 10th tier, whenever you or an ally within 30 feet rolls an initiative check, roll twice and take either result. If the first round of combat is a surprise round, you and all allies within 30 feet at the start of the combat can take a full round's worth of actions instead of just a move or standard action. Once per round, when you or an ally within 30 feet scores a critical hit against a mythic creature, you regain one use of mythic power.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Tier Marshal Path Abilities",
			"",
			"You can select these path abilities at any tier.",
			"",
			"**Additional Order (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You learn an additional marshal's order ability. You can select this ability twice.",
			"",
			"**Assured Skill (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you attempt a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.",
			"",
			"**Clarion Call (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You bestow your wrath on your allies. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to grant all allies within 30 feet the benefits of your active smite or challenge ability, directed at the same opponent you're targeting with that ability. Only the constant effects from the smite or challenge are conferred with this ability, not the ones you can use only once. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier or until either the combat ends or the subject of the smite or challenge is dead or unconscious.",
			"",
			"**Commanding Entrance (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): When you first enter an area or make your presence known to a group of strangers, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power and attempt a single Diplomacy or Intimidate check to modify the attitudes of everyone within 10 feet per tier, and an additional number of characters equal to your Charisma modifier who are outside that range but have line of sight to you. (For instance, you could affect everyone near the entrance of a throne room and key people on the dais at the far end.) Alternatively, when you reveal yourself during the first round of combat (not counting the surprise round), you can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to use Intimidate to demoralize your targets.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Guidance (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 38](source/mythic_adventures)): You are able to point out the weak points in an enemy's defenses, and your allies benefit from your tactical insight. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to designate a single opponent within 30 feet of you. All allies within 30 feet of that opponent gain the sneak attack ability when attacking it, and can thus deal +1d6 points of damage when flanking that opponent or when the opponent is otherwise denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. This sneak attack damage stacks with sneak attack damage from other sources. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to half your tier (minimum 1). You can take this ability up to four times. Each time you take it, the sneak attack damage from this ability increases by 1d6.",
			"",
			"**Directed Assault (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): By finding a gap in your enemy's defenses, you allow your allies to take advantage of your discovery. When you confirm a critical hit with a melee or ranged weapon against an opponent, allies within 30 feet of that opponent add your tier to their critical confirmation rolls against that opponent. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to your tier. During this duration, you can expend one use of mythic power to convert an ally's successful attack into a critical threat. The ally must be within 30 feet, and can also gain the bonus to its confirmation roll. Only one opponent can be the focus of your directed assault at a time. If you confirm a critical hit against another creature, you may make it the new focus (immediately ending the previous focus) or maintain the current focus.",
			"",
			"**Distracting Assailant (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): You make a barrage of attacks and quick feints that are so distracting your opponent loses focus against all other assailants. Whenever you successfully strike a foe with a melee weapon or natural attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action. For 1 round, that opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to AC on all attacks against it other than yours. While this ability is in effect, any allies who flank that foe gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls against it, instead of the normal +2. While the opponent is affected by this ability, each time you hit it, the duration increases by 1 round. This effect automatically ends if your turn ends and the target is not within your melee reach.",
			"",
			"**Focus (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mighty and inspiring presence enhances the power of your companions' heroic surges. Whenever a mythic ally that is within 30 feet uses the surge ability, it rolls its bonus die twice and takes the higher result.",
			"",
			"**Granted Stride (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic grace means that you and your allies easily pass through undergrowth at full speed. Allies within 30 feet of you gain the benefits of woodland stride (as the ranger class feature), as long as they can see and hear you.

You must have the woodland stride and favored terrain class features to select this ability.",
			"",
			"**Greater Surge (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): Your surge is more powerful than most. Treat your tier as if it were 3 higher for the purpose of determining your mythic surge die (maximum 10th tier). When you gain your 10th tier, your surge die becomes 2d8.",
			"",
			"**Helpful Rebuke (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): You are quick with stern yet helpful words of advice. Whenever an ally within line of sight fails a skill check with a skill you're trained in, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow that ally to reroll that skill check with a bonus equal to your tier. If the new roll is successful, your ally succeeds at that check instead of failing it. The ally who failed the skill check must be able to see and hear you to gain this reroll. You can use this ability with a skill you aren't trained in, but you must expend two uses of mythic power to do so, and the ally doesn't gain your tier as a bonus on the reroll.",
			"",
			"**Heroic Block (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 39](source/mythic_adventures)): With surprising speed, you can leap to an ally's defense. When a opponent makes a melee attack against one of your allies, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to move up to double your speed or take a 5-foot step. You must end this movement adjacent to the attacking opponent. When you end this movement, you can immediately use the aid another action to grant a bonus to your ally's AC. This bonus is applied before the opponent's triggering attack. These actions don't count against your actions this turn.",
			"",
			"**Inspire Minions (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Defense (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use bardic performance to inspire courage, the competence bonus against charm and fear effects instead applies to all saving throws. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a bardic performance to inspire courage, you add your tier to this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Surge (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Your surge inspires non-mythic allies to greater acts of martial daring. Each time you use your surge ability, each non-mythic ally within 30 feet gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for the next weapon attack it makes before the start of your next turn. An ally must be able to see and hear you to gain the bonus. You can take this ability up to three times. When you take it the second time, the bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to a number equal to half your tier.

			"",
			"**Lightning Performance (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Your tongue is as quick as any blade. You can start a bardic performance as a swift action instead of a standard action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can instead start a bardic performance as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Loyalty (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): You gain Leadership as a bonus feat. If you already have the Leadership feat (or if you take it at a later level), add your tier to your Leadership score. Whenever you use your marshal's order ability and your cohort is within 100 feet, you can include your cohort as an additional ally affected by your order.",
			"",
			"**Menacing Presence (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 40](source/mythic_adventures)): Something about you puts others on edge. You can attempt an Intimidate check to influence a creature's attitude as full-round action instead of it taking 1 minute. In combat, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent as a move action. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can attempt to use Intimidate to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a standard action, or as a move action if using the [Dazzling Display](feat/dazzling_display) feat.",
			"",
			"**Mounted Marshal (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): Whenever you're riding on a bonded mount or animal companion, you and your mount are each treated as flanking any opponent you both threaten. Whenever you use your surge ability while mounted, your mount heals a number of hit points equal to your surge result plus your tier. You can expend one use of mythic power while charging with your mount to deal double damage to the target of your charge (or triple damage if you're wielding a lance).",

When you are hit by an attack of opportunity, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to allow all of your allies to make an attack of opportunity against the creature that attacked you if it's within their melee reach.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Aid (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you successfully use the aid another action, your ally also adds your tier to the aid another bonus.

			"**Persuasive Countenance (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"**Potent Message (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): You can expend one use of mythic power to create a song, oration, poem, or joke that contains information that you want to spread. This can include points of fact or simple instructions. You only need to perform the work once (which takes 1d4 hours to complete); thereafter it will spread through the community by itself. For 1 day per tier, all nonmythic beings that hear this message (whether from you or someone else) are compelled to spread it to others by slipping it naturally into conversation or otherwise bringing it up. Anyone who has heard this message takes a -4 penalty on opposed Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive checks against you when you request that they to carry out duties related to this message. This is a language-dependent effect. At 6th tier or higher, you can expend one additional use of mythic power to make this work universally understandable, regardless of any language barriers.",

			"**Press the Advantage (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): When an ally seriously harms a foe, you seize the moment.

			"",
			"**Redirect Attention (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 28](source/mythic_origins)): Where you point, others feel overwhelmingly compelled to look. You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose-and away from others; non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-footcone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"**Resurging Words (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 41](source/mythic_adventures)): Using the power of your mythic presence, you spur on allies even when all seems lost.

Allies can benefit from this ability only once every 24 hours.",
			"",

Add your tier to your Charisma bonus and then multiply the sum by 5 to determine how many creatures are in the crowd (as long as the settlement has a sufficient population to provide a crowd of that size, as determined by the GM). For example, a 4th-tier marshal with a +6 bonus to Charisma could gather as many as 50 creatures. The crowd remains for 1 hour, and you gain a +10 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to direct the crowd.

			"**Words of Hope (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire allies within a 30-foot radius, granting each of them the ability to roll twice and take the higher result on one attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. An ally can use this ability once per round for a number of rounds equal to half your tier, and must choose whether to roll twice before rolling the die. This is a language-dependent emotion effect.",

			"",
			"You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.",
			"",
			"**Beacon of Hope (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 42](source/mythic_adventures)): You radiate a supernatural aura that fills your allies with hope and resolve. All allies within 30 feet gain a +2 morale bonus against fear and emotion effects, and a +4 bonus on stabilization checks. Furthermore, each time one of these allies is subject to a healing spell or effect, it heals a number of additional hit points equal to your tier. Once per day as a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power and end this aura to heal all allies within 30 feet of an amount of damage equal to 1d6 hit points per tier you possess. If dismissed, the aura automatically reactivates 24 hours later.",
			"",
			"**Castigate (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): While your words can soothe and aid your friends, they are equally adept at assaulting your foes. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to unleash a scathing verbal assault that demoralizes all opponents within 30 feet for 1 minute, as if you had successfully used the Intimidate skill. These opponents must be able to clearly see and hear you, but this ability is not language dependent.",
			"",
			"**Fast Friends (Su)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): You have such a way with words that you can befriend entire groups of people with a single utterance. As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to improve the attitudes of all nonmythic creatures within 30 feet by one step. You can use this ability multiple times to improve these creatures' attitudes by multiple steps. Mythic creatures receive a Will save (DC = 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to negate this effect. The improvement to attitude lasts a number of hours equal to your tier. This ability is generally ineffective in combat (except perhaps to sway the attitude of a crowd of bystanders or an unaffiliated neutral party) or against creatures that intend to harm you and your allies in the immediate future.",
			"",
			"**Fight On (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): With an order or a determined look, you spur a wounded ally to keep fighting. As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to allow a creature other than yourself that is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points to remain conscious and alive. The creature can't die from hit point damage until after the start of your next turn. You can extend this effect for 1 round at the start of your next turn by expending another use of mythic power as a free action. Though the creature can't be killed by hit point damage, any damage it takes still applies to its current hit points. When this ability's effect ends, the creature falls unconscious or dies if its current hit points or other circumstances would otherwise cause it to do so. The creature must be within 30 feet for you to start or extend this effect.",
			"",
			"**Free Your Mind (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): You can reach into the mind of your allies and free them from unwanted influence. You can spend 1 point of mythic power as a full-round action to remove a mind-affecting effect currently affecting an ally within 30 feet. The effect immediately affects you instead, and you receive a saving throw to resist the effect as if you were the original target. If you succeed, the effect has no effect on you; otherwise, you are subject to it. You must be at least 6th tier to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Assault (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire your allies to greatness in combat. Once per turn as a free action, each of your allies can either move up to its speed or make one melee or ranged attack at its full base attack bonus. These actions don't count against its actions for the turn. Once activated, this ability lasts a number of rounds equal to your tier, but immediately ends if you don't damage an opponent with an attack or spell on your turn. This ability doesn't stack with haste or similar effects. An ally must be within 30 feet of you at the start of its turn to benefit from this ability.",
			"",
			"**Stones Will Weep (Su)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 29](source/mythic_origins)): Your art can awaken the spirits of beasts, plants, and even the elements. You can attempt Perform checks in place of Handle Animal checks. You can expend one use of mythic power to speak with animals (as speak with animals), plants (as speak with plants) and elements (as stone tell, except this effect targets fire, wind, and water as well as earth) for a number of minutes equal to your tier. While speaking with plants or the elements, you can also request their aid, effectively allowing you to use animate objects, animate plants, control water, control winds, and stone shape. You must expend one use of mythic power as well as one use of bardic performance for each round you want to use these spell-like abilities, and on each round you can simultaneously use a number of these abilities equal to half your tier. You must have the bardic performance ability to select this path ability.",
			"",
			"**Surge of Inspiration (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): Your very presence pushes those around you to be their very best. As an immediate action, when an ally within line of sight misses with an attack or fails a saving throw, you can expend one use of mythic power or your confidence ability to grant the ally the benefits of your surge ability on that attack roll or saving throw. The ally uses your surge die, and can apply the bonus after the result is revealed, possibly turning a failure into a success.",
			"",
			"**Unswerving Loyalty (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): You are a bastion of strength and resolve, and you possess the ability to protect your mind from even the most powerful charms and compulsions. You gain immunity to non-mythic mind-affecting effects, though you can choose to be affected by them if you wish. When subject to a mind-affecting effect from a mythic source, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to gain immunity to that effect.",
			"",
			"**Words of Valor (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 43](source/mythic_adventures)): With a mere speech, you empower your allies to take on any foe. As a standard action, you can expend two uses of mythic power to inspire all of your allies within a 30-foot radius, granting them the effects of the spell heroism and making them immune to fear for 1 round per tier. Each mythic creature that is affected by this ability can use its surge ability once during this duration without having to expend one use of mythic power."

			"Seen only when they choose to be seen, tricksters manipulate kings and peasants alike, usually without anyone sensing their influence. Characters who rely upon their skills and wit find themselves drawn to the trickster's path. The mythic power of these heroes allows them to perform tasks that most would consider impossible. They can climb any wall, swim any current, and move without being seen by even the most observant guard. When they strike at their foes, they do so with unmatched accuracy.",
			"",
			"**Role:** As a trickster, your role in the party is one of deception and manipulation. You have access to a number of abilities that empower you to confound your foes, both physically and mentally. With a subtle jest or twist of phrase, you can steer entire cities and even nations to do your bidding-but should that fail, you can always rely on a dagger from the shadows.",
			"",
			"**Classes:** Members of any class that relies on skills would make good tricksters, as would those who heavily utilize ranged combat or magical methods of subterfuge. The alchemist, bard, and rogue all have a number of abilities that fit well with the trickster. Gunslingers, monks, and rangers will also find that the trickster has more than a few interesting options.",
			"",
			"**Bonus Hit Points:** Whenever you gain a trickster tier, you gain 4 bonus hit points. These hit points stack with themselves, and don't affect your overall Hit Dice or other statistics.",

			"As you gain tiers, you gain the following abilities.",
			"",
			"**Trickster Attack:** Select one of the following abilities. Once chosen, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"*Deadly Throw (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to draw a thrown weapon or alchemical item and make a ranged attack with it. This attack doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. When making a deadly throw, roll twice for the attack, take the higher result, and add your tier to the roll. If the attack misses, the weapon or alchemical item lands adjacent to the target, regardless of the range.",
			"",
			"*Fleet Charge (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to move up to your speed. At any point during this movement, you can make a single melee or ranged attack at your highest attack bonus, adding your tier to the attack roll. This is in addition to any other attacks you make this round. Damage from this attack bypasses all damage reduction.",
			"",
			"*Surprise Strike (Ex):* As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a melee attack or ranged attack against a target within 30 feet, in addition to any other attacks you make this round. When you make a surprise strike, the target is considered flat-footed regardless of any class features or abilities it might have, and you add your tier to the attack roll. Damage from this attack bypasses damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Path Ability:** At 1st tier and every tier thereafter, select one new path ability from the trickster path abilities lists or from the [universal path abilities lists](rule/universal_path_abilities). Once you select an ability, it can't be changed. Unless otherwise noted, each ability can be selected only once. Some abilities have requirements, such as a class ability or minimum mythic tier, that you must meet before you select them.",
			"",
			"**Supreme Trickster (Su):** At 10th tier, whenever you make an attack roll against a non-mythic foe, that foe is treated as flat-footed, even if it has abilities that prevent it from being flat-footed. Once per round when you roll a natural 20 on an opposed skill check against a mythic foe, you regain one use of mythic power.",

			"### 1st-Tier Trickster Path Abilities",
			"",
			"You can select these path abilities at any tier.",

			"**Additional Trick (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): You learn an additional trickster attack ability. You can select this ability twice.",
			"",
			"**Aim for the Eye (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): You can home in on your targets with uncanny and supernatural accuracy. You can make ranged sneak attacks from up to 60 feet away (rather than 30 feet). When calculating range penalties for ranged attacks, you are always considered to be one range increment closer to the target than you actually are. Whenever you successfully score a critical hit against a flat-footed creature with a ranged attack, as a free action you can expend one use of mythic power to blind that creature for 1d4+1 rounds. A mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Dexterity modifier). Creatures that are immune to critical hits are immune to this ability, as are creatures with unusual anatomies (GM's discretion).",
			"",
			"**Assured Drinker (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): No one can stop you from imbibing, even in combat. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity when drinking an elixir, extract, or potion. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve and drink an elixir, extract, or potion.",
			"",
			"**Assured Skill (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): In times of need, you're virtually assured success when using skills. As a free action before you roll a skill check, you can expend one use of mythic power to roll that skill check twice, take the higher result, and add your tier to the total.",
			"",
			"**Astounding Disable (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use Disable Device to disarm a trap or open a lock, doing so is only a move action and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Clown (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 44](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can expend one use of mythic power to make one creature laugh uncontrollably, as the hideous laughter spell. The saving throw against this effect is equal to 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier. If you aren't in combat when you use this ability, it can affect any number of creatures in a burst with a radius of 10 feet per tier.",
			"",
			"**Combat Trickery (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Through buffoonery and deceit, you can trick opponents into moving where you want them. You can make a single combat maneuver check using your Bluff check modifier in place of your CMB. Apply the result of this check to all adjacent opponents, and resolve it for each enemy independently as a bull rush, drag, or reposition combat maneuver. For example, if facing three opponents, you can roll one check and attempt to bull rush the first, drag the second, and reposition the third.",
			"",
			"**Compelling Feint (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): Your parries, attacks, and dodges are sporadic and difficult to predict by those who oppose you. Whenever you feint, you can choose to feint against all opponents within 10 feet, using the same Bluff check for each opponent. If you expend one use of mythic power while you're feinting, any target you successfully feint against is considered flat-footed against the first attack any creature makes against it before its next turn. You must use this ability after your Bluff check is rolled but before the results are revealed.",
			"",
			"**Control the Mindless (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): You can gain control over mindless constructs and undead. Using this ability is a standard action, and requires you to make a Knowledge check against the target's CMD. Use a Knowledge (arcana) check against a mindless construct, or a Knowledge (religion) check against a mindless undead. If your check equals or exceeds the creature's CMD, you can give the creature an order that lasts up to 1 round. For every 5 by which you beat the DC, your control lasts 1 additional round. The creature's creator or controller can't regain control during this time unless it also uses this ability. If you expend one use of mythic power when attempting to use this ability, the duration of your control increases from rounds to an equal number of minutes.",
			"",
			"**Crime Spree (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action when not in combat, you can attempt two Sleight of Hand checks to take items from other creatures, but you take a -5 penalty on each check. As a standard action in combat, you can expend one use of mythic power to attempt a steal combat maneuver check against each creature within your reach that you choose, without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Dodge (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +4 dodge bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn. During this time, whenever a creature misses on a melee attack against you, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You can choose to either take this attack of opportunity or force that creature to reroll the attack and change the target to a creature of your choice that is adjacent to you and within the attacker's reach. This reroll uses the same modifiers as the initial attack roll.",
			"",
			"**Defensive Move (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Once per round, you can designate one opponent. Unless you attempt to move through that opponent's space, your movement (including standing up from a prone position) doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that opponent. If you move through the opponent's space, you can still attempt an Acrobatics check to do so without provoking an attack of opportunity. You can take this ability more than once. Each additional time you select it, you can designate one additional opponent when you move.",
			"",
			"**Down Like Dominoes (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): When you successfully trip a foe, as a free action you can attempt an additional trip attack against a creature adjacent to the first foe tripped at a -4 penalty. The adjacent creature must be no more than one size category larger than the creature you just tripped. If this second trip is successful, you can continue to attempt to trip creatures as long as they are adjacent to the last one successfully tripped, taking a cumulative -4 penalty on each trip attempt after the first. In a round, you can trip a number of creatures equal to half your tier in this way, and only until your first failed trip attempt. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity for tripping additional foes with this ability, and if you fail a trip attempt after the first there's no chance of you tripping yourself.",
			"",
			"**Enhance Magic Items (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic presence enhances the power of certain magic items. Add half your tier to the caster level of potions, scrolls, staves, and wands you use. When using a staff or wand, you may activate the item by expending one use of mythic power instead of one of the item's charges.",
			"",
			"**Faster than the Eye (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): Few can trace your expert skills of legerdemain. You can use Sleight of Hand to lift or plant objects as a move action with no penalty. When you use Sleight of Hand to steal something, the target takes a penalty equal to your tier on its Perception check to notice the theft. You can use Sleight of Hand to plant a small object on someone else. When doing so, you use the same method and bonuses as you would for lifting the same item.",
			"",
			"**Ghostly Performance (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 45](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you use bardic performance, you don't need to spend an action to maintain the effect. This means you can maintain the performance if paralyzed or stunned, although it still ends if you are unconscious or dead. You must still expend rounds of bardic performance to continue the effect. Once you start a performance, its effect continues whether or not the subjects can perceive you or the performance. When the performance ends, its effects linger for a number of rounds equal to your tier. This extended duration stacks with any other abilities that extend the duration of your performance, such as Lingering Performance. This ability doesn't change how many active performances you can have at once.",
			"",
			"**Impeccable Balance (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Even the smallest of handholds and outcroppings are more than sufficient for your purposes. You automatically succeed at all Acrobatics checks to walk along narrow ledges. Your Acrobatics checks never take a penalty because of obstructed, slippery, sloped, or unsteady surfaces, and you can move at full speed across such surfaces with no penalty. You also gain a +10 bonus to CMD against trip attacks.",
			"",
			"**Improbable Prestidigitation (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You can attempt a Sleight of Hand check to hide or retrieve objects in a personal extradimensional space, similar to a glove of storing. You can take 10 or 20 on this check, and the space can hold up to 1 cubic foot of material per tier. An item the size of a potion or dagger can be stored or retrieved with a successful DC 20 Sleight of Hand check; the DC increases to 25 for an item roughly the size of a one-handed weapon. Storing an item is a swift action, and retrieving it is a move action. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to retrieve any number of items from your extradimensional space.",
			"",
			"**Inspire Minions (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): When you use a spell, a bardic performance, or another class feature to grant a morale or competence bonus, the bonus increases by 2 for creatures with at least 4 Hit Dice fewer than you. For example, if you're a 6th-level bard using inspire courage, creatures with 2 Hit Dice or fewer receive a +4 morale bonus on fear saves and a +4 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls instead of +2.",
			"",
			"**Knot Expert (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 30](source/mythic_origins)): You can tie knots in rope with a flick of your wrist, and can do so from the far end of the rope. You can tie a knot in any rope you hold, including turning it into a lasso, as a swift action. You can also use a whip, lasso, spiked chain, or similar weapon to constrict an opponent. In order to do so, you must make a successful attack with the rope-like weapon, after which you can, as a swift action, attempt a grapple combat maneuver against that creature, adding your tier to your combat maneuver check. If you are successful, the creature is considered to be grappled, though you are not, and you can deal [constrict](umr/constrict) damage to the creature equal to the amount of damage you could normally deal with the weapon used.",
			"",
			"**Master Dilettante (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You are passingly familiar with almost every subject and have dabbled in numerous fields and activities. You gain a competence bonus equal to your tier on all untrained skill checks. You can attempt all skill checks untrained, even if the skill normally cannot be used untrained.",
			"",
			"**Master of Escape (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use the Escape Artist skill to break free from spells and magical effects that limit your movement or actions. While you're subject to a spell or effect that gives you the entangled, grappled, paralyzed, pinned, staggered, or stunned condition, once per round as a free action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check to end the condition. The DC for this check is equal to the save DC of the spell or effect that caused the condition. If you succeed, you end one such condition on yourself (your choice), though this doesn't make you immune to similar effects from the same source (such as moving through black tentacles or web). If the spell or effect doesn't allow a saving throw, you can't use this ability to overcome it.",
			"",
			"**Nimble Glide (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you fall, you don't take any damage and you land on your feet. When using this ability, you fall at a rate of 150 feet per round, and can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 10 feet you fall.",
			"",
			"**No One of Consequence (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic nature is a cloak that can shield you from the minds and memories of others. Creatures struggle to recognize you, recall your appearance, remember the nature of conversations they had with you, and recount the actions you took when you were in their presence. If a creature makes a deliberate attempt to recall details about time spent with you, it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier) to recall anything beyond vague details. In addition, you're under a permanent nondetection effect with a caster level equal to your character level plus your tier. You can end this effect at any time, and can resume it as a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Path Dabbling (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Select one path ability from another mythic path. You must meet any other requirements that path ability has, including a minimum tier restriction.",
			"",
			"**Persuasive Countenance (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you encounter a creature whose attitude is at least indifferent to you, treat its attitude as one step better. If the creature's starting attitude is helpful, you can make requests of the creature with a +5 bonus on your Diplomacy or Intimidate check.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Disable (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): As a standard action, you can use a thrown weapon or reach weapon to attempt a Disable Device check to disable a device. If you're using a thrown weapon, the range of this ability is 30 feet; otherwise, it's your reach with the reach weapon. You take a -5 penalty on the check and can't take 10 on the check, even if you have an ability that would normally allow you to do so. If you expend one use of mythic power, you ignore the -5 penalty and can attempt the check in place of an attack (such as if making a full attack or attack of opportunity).",
			"",
			"**Rebounding Stare (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 30](source/heroes_of_golarion)): You can cause your hypnotic stare to bounce between creatures. When you use your hypnotic stare, you can spend 1 point of mythic power to affect an additional creature within 30 feet of the original target with the stare for 1 round. You can affect additional creatures up to your mythic tier. You can maintain additional stares by spending 1 point of mythic power per additional stare each round.",
			"",
			"**Redirect Attention (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You can expend one use of mythic power to direct the attention of a number of creatures equal to your tier within line of sight toward a location or general direction you choose-and away from others. Non-mythic creatures automatically turn toward the point you choose. Mythic targets receive a Will saving throw to resist this effect (DC = 10 + your tier + your Wisdom modifier). The effect persists for 1 round per tier, during which time affected targets receive a +5 bonus on Perception checks to notice anything unusual within a 60-foot-cone in the direction you indicate and a -15 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything elsewhere. This effect counts as a diversion to hide for creatures attempting to use Stealth in any area other than the location you directed attention toward.",
			"",
			"**Ricochet (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever a creature has cover from your ranged attack, you can deflect the shot off a nearby surface, treating that surface as the origin point of the attack to determine whether the target receives a cover bonus to its AC. You can use this ability to attack a creature with total concealment from you if you know what square it occupies, but the attack still has a 50% miss chance.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Stealth (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you're in darkness, you can move at full speed within that area without taking a penalty on Stealth checks. As a move action, you can expend one use of mythic power to teleport from one area of darkness to another within 100 feet as if using greater teleport. You must have line of effect to the destination.",
			"",
			"**Sniper's Riposte (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You're an expert at defending yourself while aiming a ranged weapon. You don't provoke attacks of opportunity from making ranged attacks. As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the Stealth check penalty for sniping for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Subtle Magic (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 46](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you cast a spell or activate a spell trigger or spell completion magic item, you can attempt a Bluff skill check opposed by a Sense Motive check from anyone that can see you. Those who fail the opposed check don't know that you cast a spell or activated an item unless it has an obvious effect that emanates from you. In addition, the magical auras of magical effects on you and magic items you carry (except for artifacts) can't be detected.",
			"",
			"**Supreme Stealth (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): Choose one of the following senses: blindsight, scent, or tremorsense. A creature using the chosen sense can't automatically detect you, and must succeed at Perception checks as normal to do so. If you choose blindsight, this ability also affects blindsense. You can select this ability up to three times, each time choosing a different sense.",
			"",
			"**This Might Just Work (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You're adept at combining optimistic resourcefulness with natural skill. You can attempt a skill check with a class skill in place of a skill that uses the same ability score modifier. For example, you could attempt an Acrobatics check in place of a Stealth check because both skills are based on Dexterity. You take a -5 penalty on this check and can't take 10 or 20 on it. The GM can disallow certain uses of this ability when the skill can't possibly be applied to the task.",
			"",
			"**Thwart Detection (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can bypass magical constructs, spells, and traps that are meant to allow only certain creatures to move or act within their range. This includes constructs, spells, and traps that can be bypassed with a password as well as those that can be programmed to exclude specific creatures based on type or other physical characteristics (such as alarm, forbiddance, glyph of warding, and symbol of death). You must be aware of the construct, spell, or trap's existence, though not necessarily its specific parameters, for this ability to function. For instance, you can't bypass a trap you haven't noticed. You can fool a mindless construct if it was programmed to allow certain creatures to enter its area without provoking a response, but not if it was ordered to prevent anyone from entering with no exceptions. If you expend one use of mythic power for each effect, you can bring with you a number of allies equal to your tier. They must remain within 10 feet of you until out of range of the bypassed effect.",
			"",
			"**Titan's Bane (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can move through the space of any creature two or more size categories larger than you without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you can share such a creature's space. When sharing a larger opponent's space, you gain cover against all melee and ranged attacks it makes, and it is considered flat-footed for the purposes of any melee or ranged attacks you make against it.",
			"",
			"**Transfer Magic (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): Your mythic nature allows you to take magic from others as easily as you could take their gold. By expending one use of mythic power as a standard action, you can make a melee touch attack to transfer an active magical effect from a target creature to you. If you succeed, the highest-level effect on the target transfers to you (determine randomly if the target has multiple effects with the same level), ending the effect for the target and continuing it on you with the remaining duration as if you were the original target. You may end the effect on yourself as a standard action; this doesn't cause it to revert to the original target. If the transferred magic can't affect you (for example, if it doesn't affect creatures of your type), it ends immediately as if dispelled. You can't use this ability to transfer continuous bonuses from magic items, such as an armor bonus from bracers of armor.",
			"",
			"**Trap Taker (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use the Use Magic Device skill instead of Disable Device to disable magical traps. If your Use Magic Device check overcomes the DC to disable the trap by 5 or more, you can instead leave the trap in place, but change it so that you and your allies can bypass it. You can also alter the trap so the original creator and any creatures he might have designated as safe instead set off the trap. If you expend one use of mythic power when altering a trap in this way, you can move the trap to any point within 100 feet that is in line of sight.",
			"",
			"**Treacherous Critical (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): When you score a critical threat, you can attempt a free combat maneuver check instead of dealing extra damage. If you do, attempt your confirmation roll as normal and add your tier to the result. If the result is equal to or greater than your opponent's CMD, the attack deals damage as normal and you can attempt a free dirty trick, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver check against that opponent, using the confirmation roll as your combat maneuver check for the purpose of determining the effects of the maneuver.",
			"",
			"**Unintentional Feint (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): You make near misses look like expert feints, and your efforts are rarely wasted. If you make an attack roll that misses your original target, you can expend one use of mythic power to specify a second target, which must be adjacent to you (if a melee attack) or the original target (if a ranged attack). If the second target would be hit by what you rolled, you hit that target and deal damage as normal.",
			"",
			"**Unwavering Skill (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can always take 10 or 20 on class skills, even if threatened or in a hazardous situation. You can't use this ability with skill checks that don't normally allow you to take 10 or take 20.",
			"",
			"**Wall Run (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): When you move, you can travel across vertical surfaces as if they were floors. If your movement doesn't end on a horizontal surface, you fall at the end of your move unless you are able to remain in place using another ability (such as using the Climb skill to cling to a handhold). The vertical surface must be capable of supporting your weight-for example, you couldn't move across a windowpane or curtain.",

			"**Combat Saboteur (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 47](source/mythic_adventures)): You can sabotage an opponent's gear with a simple touch. This sabotage is a sunder combat maneuver that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Add your tier to your CMB when attempting this maneuver. If you succeed, you can give the broken condition to a single item the opponent is wielding or carrying. This attack doesn't deal any damage to the object. The condition can be removed by spending 1 minute undoing the sabotage, or instantaneously with mending or a similar spell.",
			"",
			"**Critical Skill (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 48](source/mythic_adventures)): Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a skill check, you perform that skill with exceptional proficiency. Typically, this means that the task takes half the normal amount of time to accomplish. If the skill would normally take a full-round action, it instead takes a standard action. If it would normally take a standard or move action, it instead takes a swift action. If it would normally take a swift or free action, it instead takes no time at all. The GM might rule that instead of reducing the amount of time needed, using the skill takes the normal amount of time but the critical success results in some other added benefit, depending on the skill being used and the situation.",
			"",
			"**Ethereal Trapsmith (Su)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to spontaneously create a mechanical trap in any empty space within 30 feet. This trap must be chosen from those listed below (other traps may be allowed at the GM's discretion). The trap's CR can't be higher than your tier, and the trap remains in the place you designate for a number of hours equal to your tier. As long as you have line of sight to a trap that you've summoned with this ability, created through other means, bypassed, or reprogrammed to your benefit, you can trigger that trap as a swift action, no matter your distance to it.",

You can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to give such a creature a suggestion. The save DC against this effect is 10 + your tier + your Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"**Mirror Dodge (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 48](source/mythic_adventures)): When hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to replace yourself with an illusory duplicate and teleport to any open square within 30 feet of your current position. You take no damage from this attack, which instead destroys your illusory duplicate (similar to mirror image). Using this ability requires a line of effect to the teleportation target square.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Lie (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 48](source/mythic_adventures)): When telling a lie, you can expend one use of mythic power to make the lie indiscernible from the truth by both Sense Motive and magic. Obvious proof of your falsehood still reveals the lie for what it is, but in absence of proof, those who hear your lie believe it.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Mimic (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 48](source/mythic_adventures)): You can use the Disguise skill as a full-round action. When you attempt to impersonate a specific person, those familiar with the individual receive only half the normal bonus from familiarity to see through your disguise. If you expend one use of mythic power when creating a disguise to impersonate an individual, you can read that creature's mind as if using detect thoughts with a range of 1 mile. This allows you to better mimic the individual, granting you a further +10 bonus on opposed Disguise skill checks.

This ability doesn't work on effects with an instantaneous or permanent duration.",

			"**Vanishing Move (Su)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 48](source/mythic_adventures)): When you wish to not be seen, you aren't.

			"You must be at least 6th tier to select these path abilities.",

			"**Bloody Streak (Ex)** ([Mythic Origins pg. 31](source/mythic_origins)): Whenever you successfully deal sneak attack damage to a creature, you can expend one use of mythic power as a swift action to heighten your bloodshed. Thereafter, every consecutive round that you deal sneak attack damage, add a cumulative +1d6 bonus on your sneak attack damage roll. The targets of these sneak attacks don't need to be the same. You can gain a maximum number of bonus d6s on your sneak attack damage in this way equal to your tier. As soon as you fail to deal sneak attack damage to a creature in a round, this effect ends and you no longer gain the bonus on sneak attack damage until you use this ability again. For example, a 10th-level rogue, 6th-tier trickster uses this ability after dealing 5d6 points of sneak attack damage to a foe. On the next round, she deals 6d6 points of sneak attack damage to a foe (5d6 from her rogue levels + 1d6 from this ability).

You replicate that ability and place it into an item you hold for 10 minutes per tier. Any creature holding the item can expend 1 point of mythic power as a standard action to activate the replicated feature, using the level of the creature touched as their level for any effects based on level.

You gain the use of this class feature for 10 minutes per tier, using the level of the creature touched as your level for any effects based on level. You can't copy an ability that has a limited number of uses per day (such as rage, smite evil, or spellcasting) or an ability that involves a companion (such as eidolon, hunter's bond, or nature bond).

You can have this ability in effect on only one elixir, extract, or potion at a time. Using it on a second one causes the duration of the first to revert to normal-and to end immediately if the normal duration would have expired.

			"**Slayer's Cyclone (Ex)** ([Mythic Adventures pg. 49](source/mythic_adventures)): When you spot a breach in an enemy's defenses, you make attacks with a lethal blend of speed and precision. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. If you hit and the target is flat-footed, deal damage as normal. You can then move and make another attack. You may continue this process until you miss, attack an opponent that isn't flat-footed, or attack an opponent you already hit this round. You can't move more than double your speed in this way in 1 round.",

The designated creature keeps this bonus for up to 24 hours. You can have only one creature designated in this way at a time. If you designate a new creature, the bonus immediately ends for the previous target. The creature you designate must be one of the targets when you cast the spell, start the performance, or use the class feature."

Your projected spirit has incorporeal versions of all of your equipment, although consumable equipment and equipment with limited numbers of charges or uses cannot be used while incorporeal.

Mythic tiers are similar to levels in a class or prestige class in that the powers gained at each tier are added to all those that came before, but tiers are gained in a different manner from levels. A character gains a new mythic tier by completing a number of trials that occur during play. A trial is a difficult task that adds to the legend and story of your character.

These spines function as +2 armor spikes. Any creature striking you with a natural weapon or grappling with you takes 1d6+2 points of piercing damage.

If you choose wind, swirling winds surround you, guarding you from ranged weapons as though you were protected by wind wall and increasing the effective caster level of any spells you cast that have the air descriptor by 2.

This creates difficult terrain in an area centered on your target with a radius equal to 10 feet &times; your tier. You movement is not impeded by the difficult terrain created by this effect. By expending two uses of mythic power when you use this ability, you can create an additional shock wave that extends beneath your target's feet in a cylinder with a depth equal to 5 feet &times; your tier.

You take 3d6 points of damage as a horribly deformed creature of shadow crawls forth. This shadow merges with a creature of your choice within 30 feet, affecting the target as though with a phantasmal killer spell (DC = 10 + your tier + your Cha modifier) with a caster level equal to double your tier.

This ability only applies poison to the weapons your allies are currently wielding (the weapons they are merely carrying are unaffected), and there is no chance of accidentally poisoning yourself or your allies. You must be carrying a number of doses of poison equal to the number of weapons you wish to apply the poison to, and the doses of poison are consumed in the process of using this ability.

This weapon does damage as a +1 scythe of your size, and lasts for 1 round per tier. By expending one additional use of mythic power, your blade gains the wounding ability. Although it only uses one hand, the scythe deals damage as though wielded with two hands.

Mythic undead and any undead whose Hit Dice are equal to or greater than your character level plus your mythic tier receive a Will save to halve this damage (DC = 10 + your Wis or Cha [whichever is higher] + your tier).

			"For a game to feel mythic, it must evoke wonder and awe in the GM and the players. It represents a power shrouded in mystery and beyond the reach of mortals. When characters encounter the mythic, they should feel as though they've just received a glimpse into an unseen world, promising so much more if they're bold enough to explore its wonders and face its dangers. A mythic atmosphere involves legends coming to life, and the characters will have a part to play in shaping these myths. If they succeed, they'll be the subject of tales and epic ballads for generations to come.",
			"",
			"Running a mythic game requires more than just allowing the players to have mythic power and face off against mythic foes. While that is certainly part of it, creating a mythic atmosphere is just as important. The world itself and the structure of the story need to change to make room for the mythic to exist alongside the normal. This change doesn't require you to reinvent the world, but mythic creatures and their environments should feel as if they are part of the world; they may be hidden, but they should still be tied to the mundane events and lands around them.",
			"",
			"Contrasting the mythic with the normal world is crucial to conveying an atmosphere of legend and mystery. The extraordinary only seems that way if it's in sharp contrast with the mundane. For example, a flying castle with a 1,000-foot-tall tower at its heart, drifting through the air on a thunderous storm cloud, is certainly a dramatic sight, but only when compared to the pastoral farmland and grime-covered town in its shadow. Picture the same floating castle in a world of towering volcanoes, and 500-foot-tall fortresses and the castle just becomes another extreme element in a world of extremes. If your game is set on Golarion (or some other established world), inserting contrasting mythic elements is easy, since the world already has a specific feel. Making your game mythic simply requires you to push beyond the boundaries of the setting, identifying hidden places where mythic elements have always dwelled, waiting to be discovered."

Ultimately, it's up to the GM to decide how much influence these rules have on the campaign and world as a whole. The following types of scale are provided to give GMs an easy guideline for incorporating mythic rules into their games.",
			"",
			"**Rare:** At this scale, mythic creatures live only in remote parts of the world, content to be bygones of a lost age. People speak of them in stories, but none have actually encountered them. The PCs are not themselves mythic in this type of campaign, but throughout their travels, they may be up against a mythic creature at the conclusion of a noteworthy quest. Alternatively, a mythic creature might be forced into the world to terrorize the land, driving the PCs to find a way to deal with such a powerful threat.",

			"**Limited:** At the limited scale, the PCs get a taste of mythic power through some extraordinary event, albeit only for a short time. For the duration of an adventure or short campaign arc, they can wield this power to further their goals. Unfortunately, it's fleeting, and they soon become normal once again, perhaps with a few remnants of power they might call on in a future time of need. Perhaps their power will return at a later date-possibly even regularly according to some mysterious cycle, allowing them to plan out when they take on more difficult challenges coinciding with their resurgence of power.",
			"",
			"**Uncommon:** Mythic creatures and characters are uncommon in this scale of game, but not wholly resigned to the whispers of legend. The PCs also get mythic power, but their advancement in tier is slow. The GM can control this by limiting the number of trials that are presented. Likewise, mythic foes are still not pervasive, but are found with some regularity-leading secret cabals, harassing quiet villages on the edge of civilization, and dwelling in the dark places of the world.",
			"",
			"**Common:** In the common scale, mythic characters and monsters are an everyday part of life. This doesn't mean that every town has a group of mythic heroes defending it, but that such characters are known to exist and their deeds are common knowledge. Nobles, priests, and other powerful people call upon the PCs for help against those dangerous monsters and villains others are powerless to fight. In this type of campaign, the PCs begin play with mythic power and see it grow as they gain levels, roughly at the rate of one mythic tier per two character levels."

			"Campaigns and adventures come in many forms, taking shape organically with the whims of the players and the needs of the Game Master, but the key to running a successful mythic campaign or adventure involves a little more planning. The following structure is a guide to help GMs in planning out their mythic experience, regardless of length. This formula can work for a single session, where the PCs gain mythic power at the beginning and lose it by the end. Or you can apply it to an entire campaign, where the PCs gain mythic power early on and retire after of dozens of adventures.",
			"",
			"Many mythic stories follow a common narrative structure (see [The Monomyth under Mythic Themes](unknown/the_monomyth_under_mythic_themes)). This structure is divided into five parts: the contact, the awakening, the journey, the return, and the life after. In the contact, the PCs encounter a threat too great for them to handle. In the awakening, they're granted mythic power to handle this threat. In the journey, the heroes quest to increase that power and gain what they need to vanquish that threat. In the return, they finally encounter the threats as equals (or near-equals) and have the opportunity to forever right the world. In the life after, the mythic heroes deal with the aftermath of their trials, and either become normal characters once again or hold onto their new power.",
			"",
			"This structure isn't set in stone. GMs should improvise details to suit the campaign. The steps represent story ideas that might reveal themselves in one or more encounters.",
			"",
			"The Importance of Failure",
			"",
			"In a mythic game, failure can play an important role in motivating the characters. Failure doesn't need to mean death, but instead that the PCs' efforts aren't enough to solve all problems before them. They might win the battle, but find that around them the town was destroyed, or someone close to them died during the conflict. This failure is a story opportunity-it can be used as motivation to continue on their journey, even against loss and extreme adversity. This also illustrates that the PCs' enemies have power similar to theirs, and that challenges ahead will test the heroes' limits and resolve.",
			"",
			"Starting Off Mythic",
			"",
			"A key part of the mythic narrative is that the characters don't start out as mythic heroes. Even if they gain their powers during the opening scenes of their first adventure, each character has an ordinary life before their ascension. This helps to ground them in the world and gives them a framework by which they can understand the magnitude of this change within them. That's not to say the seed of mythic power couldn't have been a part of them since birth, but such latent power should be hidden from them until the appropriate time."

This gives them a chance to experience life as mundane heroes, struggling to earn enough gold to keep themselves fed and allowing them to explore the normal world around them.",
			"",
			"When the PCs first come in contact with something truly wondrous, the mythic campaign starts in earnest. They learn that there's much more to the world around them than they first realized. This can take the form of some great, emerging danger that the PCs cannot hope to defeat as they currently are. Perhaps an incredibly powerful dragon threatens the land, a long-dead god returns to the world, or the fearsome tarrasque reawakens. The PCs are drawn into this story as their lives are forever changed by this unchallengeable threat. These low-level characters should not combat such a beast, but they might be in a town ravaged by the threat, leaving them with no choice but to flee along with everyone else or perish. After that event, they're linked to the threat, but right now have no means of dealing with it."

By the end of this part of the story, the PCs have had their [moment of ascension](unknown/moment_of_ascension), whether together or separately, and are now mythic. They are not yet ready to face their primary challenge, but the first steps down the path to victory should be revealed at this point.",

The PCs are forced to flee into a secluded valley near where the beast was slumbering, only to find that the valley contains an ancient seal recently broken. A guardian spirit explains to them that it has failed in its duty to keep the beast contained, and beseeches the PCs to intervene if they are brave enough. Giving the last of its strength, the spirit imbues the PCs with mythic power. As the spirit fades away, it tells them to seek out a legendary blade capable of ending the tarrasque.",
			"",
			"After receiving aid, the PCs are ready to begin their journey, but first they must leave their old world behind. Make this a painful choice for them, as the PCs must leave loved ones and comfort to venture into the unknown and ready themselves against true danger. This is a good time to present their first major challenge, so they can fully grasp the power they now command. The GM should also mark this point with some sort of loss or setback, to emphasize the gravity of the situation and the need for the PCs to undertake their quest. In the example above, the PCs might leave the valley only to find that their hometown is completely gone, devoured by the tarrasque. Before the PCs have a chance to mourn, they're beset by a group of cultists who helped to weaken the seal. After a deadly fight, the PCs see that they must leave to retrieve the blade if they're going to save other towns from this horrible fate."

			"The second part of the mythic structure is the journey. This part of the story can be nearly any length, from composing the middle of one session to encompassing dozens of sessions. The PCs, now enhanced with mythic power, must contend with various trials and dangers. Although these tests can take many different forms, there are some common types.",
			"",
			"One type of test is that of the heart, compelling the PCs to struggle for something they care about other than themselves. These tests provide the PCs with a goal other than their own well-being and power. There should be something threatened if they fail, which serves to give the PCs resolve, a reason to carry on. As they visit a city in the path of the monster, the PCs might encounter people who remind them of home, or of friends lost. Or they could find a child in the clutches of a enemy, only to learn that he's the key to their diabolical plan, and the PCs must succeed if they're to save him in time. If the threat is powerful enough, the PCs may even come to learn that their own survival is secondary their quest's completion.",
			"",
			"Temptation is another type of test, one that has different twists. Some temptations are obvious, and you expect the heroes to refuse, such as discovering a bucolic valley where they could forgo their journey and retire in peace, or a dubious stranger offering them a shortcut through a cursed forest. Such temptations are important to a mythic tale because refusal defines the characters and shows us their limits. Then there are the subtle temptations, ones that heroes might actually consider-either because the price seems small (or even nonexistent) compared to the gain or because the source seems trustworthy: taking food from an evil witch after starving for days, or choosing to give up a child they're protecting in exchange for an entire city's safety. Keep in mind that forces of good and evil are equally likely to test the heroes, to either reveal their mettle or lead them down the path of corruption. In any case, the PCs might be tempted a number of times along their journey and they must find the resolve to carry on and stay on the path.",
			"",
			"The PCs will eventually come to a point where they must confront the source of their own power, which provides another form of test. During their travels, they learn more and more about that source, ultimately revealing the truth about its nature. This might lead to a confrontation with the source of their power, after which the PCs feel they are equals to this source rather than its servants. For example, the PCs might learn their power comes from a divine source, and that deity is using them for its own ends. At great risk, they confront an aspect of the god to find answers. At the conclusion of the conflict, the PCs realize that while they're only a piece of the god's grand scheme, they're no mere pawns. Just as the god is using them to achieve her ends, they're using the god to achieve theirs.",
			"",
			"At the end of their journey, the PCs find their ultimate goal just within reach. Achieving this should be their most difficult test yet. Some foes are there to cull the unworthy, while others are agents of evil set to destroy the PCs. This last step in the journey should include a reward the likes of which the PCs have never seen, the culmination of their entire journey. With our earlier example, the PCs arrive at the resting place of the legendary sword capable of ending the tarrasque. Retrieving the sword from its ancient tomb is no easy task though, as the weapon is guarded by a host of mythic monsters and deadly traps. With the sword in hand, they must return to defeat the danger."

			"Beyond the story, there are a wide variety of elements you can add to give your campaign a mythic feel. These elements are different ways of looking at various parts of an adventure. A mythic adventure should contain some of these, though not necessarily all at once.",
			"",
			"**Cunning Foes:** The enemies mythic characters face should be cunning and devious in their plans. Unlike normal monsters that tend to wait around to be fought, a cunning foe is proactive in its efforts to defeat the PCs. Such enemies use the environment to their benefit, utilize their abilities to the fullest, and have at least one contingency plan. Cunning foes frequently escape a losing battle to regroup and prepare another attack. After the PCs' first encounter with a cunning enemy, their foe learns from that experience and uses new tricks and tactics to neutralize the PCs' strengths. The foe might even do research or conduct reconnaissance before the fight, pitting the PCs against her minions while she watches silently, noting the PCs' capabilities.",
			"",
			"**Hard Consequences:** With all the incredible power at characters' fingertips, it's easy to forget that the heroes are still people-complicated and flawed. Mythic heroes suffer or witness dramatic consequences in stories all the time, and it's those moments that define a hero and help us connect with her. There are different ways to bring about consequences. Failure is one option, whether it is failing a combat or skill check or to failing to make the right decision (see [The Importance of Failure under Mythic Story Structure](unknown/the_importance_of_failure_under_mythic_story_structure)). There are other ways to bring about consequences, though, such as having something unforeseen happen because of the PCs' actions. Imagine watching the countryside burn because you used a [mythic fireball](spell/mythic_fireball) to defeat a foe. And there is always the classic story moment of presenting a hard choice, where no option is without cost. It's through suffering and reacting to such consequences that the true nature of these mythic heroes emerges.",
			"",
			"**Impressive Settings:** The world of mythic adventures is enormous and dramatic. While a large keep is certainly impressive, one with a 200-foot-tall tower at its heart is more suitably awe-inspiring. This applies to natural environments as well, such as an entire forest with plants five times the normal size, waterfalls more than 100 feet high, or an immense volcano erupting at its heart. This might also take the form of a location with supernatural effects, such as a lake that is perfectly calm even when disturbed, or a swamp that is preternaturally dark. These places should appeal to all the senses, making them vibrant and memorable.",
			"",
			"**Legendary Creatures:** Some creatures the PCs face should be legends in their own rights. While those that are drawn from ancient myth (such as the minotaur and the medusa), are likely candidates, any monster can fit into this category given the proper backstory. A random encounter with a dire wolf in the wilderness isn't especially legendary, but if the PCs visit the nearby town first and learn that there's a feral monster that's been feeding on townsfolk for a decade, and there are many local myths about the beast, that same encounter gains a legendary quality. Defeating such foes adds to the mythic characters' story, making these moments important to a mythic adventure.",
			"",
			"**Otherworldly Influence:** Whether from artifacts, ancient magic, or the gods, mythic power is beyond that of the mortal realm. When the PCs gain such power, they attract the attention of mysterious forces that seek to control or otherwise influence them. This can take many forms, from a deity speaking to them through a cryptic seer, a strange sign from the stars, or gifts left in a tranquil glade to aid the heroes on their journey. Not all such influences will be beneficial-the PCs might be hammered by powerful storms, led astray by a constantly changing map, or attacked by agents of an evil power. The PCs should feel like their quest has caught the attention of powerful forces, even if they do not understand their sources or motives.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Enemies:** Foes should have powers and abilities far beyond those the PCs normally expect to face. Through their mythic abilities, the PCs have the tools to defeat these challenges, but such foes are powerful and dangerous nonetheless-more than capable of bringing pain to the world if not defeated. Battles with powerful foes make it clear that the PCs truly need their mythic power to survive. Of course, not every fight should be against a powerful foe; lesser foes give the PCs a chance to show off their talents.",
			"",
			"**Supernatural Events:** Strange and wonderful events surround mythic characters, events that twist and alter the world around them. Such events might be local (a perpetual blizzard in a small valley) or they might cover a vast area (a gloom that covers the sun). These supernatural events are in some way tied to the story of the characters. Perhaps the blizzard is the sign of a mystical frozen water elemental seer who is trying to get the heroes' attention. Or the gloom covering the sun is caused by a mythic demon seeking to bring ruin to the surface world."

			"When portraying the PCs' mythic origins and powers, the GM has a few options. The mythic nature could be apparent to everyone in some visible way, like a glowing brand or faint aura. This could be always visible, or manifest only as a character uses mythic power. Alternatively its nature could be subtle and felt rather than seen. Of course, it could start as something subtle at lower tiers, and become more pronounced as a mythic character progresses. Regardless of what direction you take, the people in the world should not mistake mythic characters for normal people.",

Even a 1st-level/1st-tier character is worthy of respect.

			"On the flip side, mythic power is an alienating force. Very few people have it, and many of those who do are threats, not friends. So the people the heroes encounter will look at them with reverence, fear, or even resentment, but never with familiarity and ease.

			"After the heroes achieve a monumental task thought to be too much for them, the essence of the mythic world bows to their achievement and fills them. This could come from destroying a plane-shattering artifact, defeating a legendary monster, or surviving a deadly journey to a wondrous location.",
			"",
			"**Scope:** The scope of this campaign can be quite farranging. The experience that grants the heroes mythic powers could occur anywhere in the campaign world (though that could be merely one of many such moments happening all around the world). Events related to the experience could send the heroes to distant lands-perhaps the heroes gain their powers from destroying an evil artifact, and learn of other such artifacts hidden in dungeons around the world.",
			"",
			"**Ascension:** An NPC begs the heroes to destroy an artifact that's corrupting the land. After a deadly adventure, the PCs finally manage to destroy the object, but in doing so release a wave of energy that grants them mythic power.",
			"",
			"Reports of an ancient dragon ravaging an entire valley reach the heroes' ears. When they battle the beast, they find themselves vastly outmatched, but through cunning and luck, they manage to slay the dragon. Upon its death, its blood washes over them, infusing them with mythic power.",
			"",
			"While traveling overland, the heroes become lost in a wild storm. For hours, they're battered by sheets of rain, and surrounded by unnaturally thick mist that refuses to be dispersed. When the storm lifts, the heroes find themselves on the rim of an ancient, enchanted valley-one told of in many tales but few people believed to truly exist.",
			"",
			"**Story:** Any sort of adventure could appeal to parties of legendary origin. The nature of their mythic powers could inspire certain storylines, such as recovering pieces of an artifact or hunting down the source of a pack of mythic monsters. The heroes may realize that if their experience granted them power, it could do the same for others, including those with sinister or chaotic motives. The mythic power in the heroes' bodies seems attuned to other such sources of power, and the main campaign arc involves the heroes tracking down these sources and keeping them from becoming tools of evil.",
			"",
			"**Challenges:** Since many different experiences, objects, and places in the world can be sources of mythic power, mythic villains and monsters could appear frequently. If the PCs destroyed an artifact or killed an ancient beast to gain their power, others may seek revenge for that act.",
			"",
			"**Ending:** At the end of their journey, the heroes should come full circle, perhaps even returning to the place where they first gained their mythic power. They might have to face off against the villain that precipitated their journey, or maybe even the source of their power itself. In the end, they should feel like their legend has closure, even if they keep their mythic power."

They contain a great deal of mystery, as there are few in the world who know about mythic power and what perils come along with wielding it. The PCs travel around the world, seeking knowledge of its origins, what caused its downfall, and how it can be used. Of course, others have also learned about this power, and they intend to use it for nefarious ends.",

Most mysterious, however, are creatures from the lost age, returned to the world to take back what they see as rightfully theirs-whether that's the mythic power or the whole world.",

Keeping it for themselves means the power can be taken by other villains, and the heroes will need to keep constant vigil for the sake of their mythic nature.

Alternatively, there may be no choice in the matter; the power has returned and the PCs must find a way to deal with it.

The collars around their necks give them access to mythic powers and transport them to their next labor when they finish their current one.

Several of the latter augment those who enter to allow them to survive; this power sometimes lasts only while a visitor is on that plane, while other times it's permanent.

A rival deity almost always opposes the goals, and will stop at nothing to see the PCs fail. The PCs might have to face off against a powerful agent of that rival or maybe even against some sort of avatar of the divine being itself. At the loftiest heights of power, the PCs might be tasked with going to the rivals' home realm and fighting the angry god directly. They might not survive such an encounter, but with the backing of their patron, they might still accomplish their goal-and their heroism may become a religious story to be told down through the ages."

			"Designing a mythic encounter is a lot like designing an encounter in any other adventure. During play, the PCs will face a variety of challenges: monsters, NPCs, traps, and more. The difference is that during a mythic adventure, the challenges are far deadlier. It's important to stress to the players, through the encounters that they face, that these are dangers beyond what they might normally expect in the game. Much of this comes through the design of the encounters, which can vary greatly depending on the PCs and how you want to challenge them. In the most basic terms, the mythic rules can be used in one of two ways: to challenge normal PCs and to challenge mythic PCs.",
			"",
			"**Encounters for Normal PCs:** If the PCs aren't mythic, then these rules can be used to present challenges of an unexpected nature. Mythic creatures and villains are more powerful than their normal counterparts, making encounters significantly more dangerous. See Adjusting CR and Level below.",

			"Normal PCs should be rewarded with experience points and treasure based on this adjusted CR. This means the PCs will face creatures that would normally be below them in terms of their original CRs, but whose strange abilities make them true threats. Such encounters should generally be at least challenging in relation to the PCs' Average Party Level (APL; see [Table 12-1](unknown/table_12-1)).",
			"",
			"For example, a group of four 6th-level PCs is exploring an ancient crypt filled with undead. As they face a variety of normal undead foes, they also begin to discover a far greater evil dwelling within, sealed away centuries ago by a holy brotherhood. Upon breaching the final chamber, they face a pair of mythic mummies crackling with dark magic. The pair of mythic mummies has an adjusted CR of 8, making it a deadly threat to the 6th-level PCs.",
			"",
			"**Encounters for Mythic PCs:** Mythic adventurers are ready for challenges beyond those normally expected for characters of their level. (See Adjusting CR and Level below.) When designing encounters to challenge these characters, roughly one-third of the encounters should use their adjusted APL, one-third should use the characters' original APL, and the remaining should fall somewhere between those two values.",
			"",
			"Of course, individual encounters can vary from these numbers as normal (such as a challenging encounter versus an easy encounter, as noted on [Table 12-1](unknown/table_12-1)). When facing a mythic foe, add half its mythic rank to its original CR to determine the foe's adjusted CR (as above).",
			"",
			"For example, when designing challenges for a group of four 12th-level, 6th-tier mythic PCs, approximately onethird of the encounters they face should be CR 12, one-third should be CR 15, and the remaining encounters should be CR 13 or 14. That means some of their encounters are rather easy (allowing them to dominate foes using their mythic power), some are of average difficulty, and some truly push them to their limits. The challenging encounters should be against other mythic foes, forcing the PCs to confront enemies with similar power.",
			"",
			"Adjusting CR and Level",

			"Having mythic tiers changes the effective level of the character for the purposes of determining what threats they can face and what treasures they should earn. Likewise, having mythic tiers or ranks changes the effective CR of the foes heroes must contend with.",

In the game, these events denote the stages of the mythic character's journey. Think of trials as an important plot point, one that is intrinsically tied to the legend of the characters.",

These trials are the true tales of mythic heroism, representing the culmination of an entire adventure or campaign arc in which the PCs overcome a terrifying challenge or achieve some fantastic victory. The trial can be anything the GM imagines, but it's not accomplished until some major goal is completed-be it to defeat a monster, save a town, or recover an artifact. So while an entire adventure might be a trial, it does not count toward advancement until the heroes complete it.",
			"",
			"The rate at which these trials are accomplished determines how quickly the PCs gain mythic tiers. As a guideline, the PCs should face a number of trials equal to the amount needed to gain a tier in the time it takes for them to gain two character levels. This should keep the character's mythic tier roughly equal to 1/2 the character's overall level. (Of course, the GM can alter this rate to suit the campaign.) That means if the PCs attain their first mythic tier at 1st level, they should probably face only a single greater trial by the time they reach 4th level, so that they reach 2nd tier at that time. Conversely, higher-level characters that gain mythic power later in their careers might face a number of trials in quick succession to gain tiers quickly, or they might even start with multiple tiers right away to get them closer to the average. [Table 1-2](rule/gaining_tiers) lists the number of trials a character must overcome to gain a new tier, but this number is subject to GM discretion and the needs of the story.",

Either way, the rate of tier progression shouldn't feel much different from what would normally happen.",

			"When designing a trial, GMs should keep the following points in mind. Trials represent important stories in the legend of mythic characters. Unlike an anecdote about particularly nasty fight or dangerous trap, trials are lengthy tales of multiple dangerous encounters, against mythic foes and unimaginable adversity. A trial should be the culmination of an entire adventure or a short series of adventures.",
			"",

			"",
			"The following trials should give GMs ideas of the various challenges mythic characters need to face to gain tiers. Use these as is or as inspiration for designing your own. Some of these suggest a mythic origin as well, but can be reworked for other mythic characters. Note that some of these are larger in scope and might represent an entire campaign arc. At the GM's discretion, such longer events might represent several trials.",
			"",
			"**A Noble's Mind Overthrown:** A great king or emperor succumbs to a strange madness, either from some unforeseen disease or a villain's magical corruption. In the ensuing mania, the ruler declares war on followers of the major religions, hitherto great supporters of the crown and a boon to the common people. Not wanting to provoke outright war between the crown and the faiths, the mythic characters are charged by their patron to discover the cure for their monarch's besieged mind.",
			"",
			"**Abyssal Parasite:** A powerful interaction of multiple mythic spells destroyed the body of a powerful demon, but in its place created a vengeful spirit neither dead nor alive. The spirit is capable of possessing others and infusing its host with demonic powers, using this as an opportunity to gather evil allies and gain strength. A celestial being that opposes demonkind calls the upon PCs to stop the vile being. They must then track the demon spirit as it moves from victim to victim, until the heroes can eradicate the demonic shade.",
			"",
			"**Aftermath:** The kingdom has been ravaged by a terrible battle with an invading force. The king's armies suffered a pyrrhic victory-the realm is all but destroyed. The PCs must help restore the domain to its former glory by rooting out remaining enemies, tending to the suffering people, rebuilding the cities, striking deals with neighboring nations for aid, and protecting the kingdom against further attack by emboldened foes.",
			"",
			"**First Steps:** The PCs are normal adventurers who come to the aid of a strange creature beset by vicious enemies. Unfortunately, by the time the PCs fend off the attackers, the gravely wounded creature is drawing its last breaths. Just before dying, it bestows mythic power upon the heroes and entrusts them with a quest that it was not able to complete. With their new abilities, the PCs can finish the mission, avenge their fallen benefactor, and take their first steps into a larger world of challenges and foes greater than they ever knew existed.",
			"",
			"**For Those Who Must Follow:** The PCs are heroes in the days before a coming apocalypse at the hands of a dark divine or even extraterrestrial power. Unlike a campaign where the PCs must stop a cataclysm, in this trial they have no hope of averting the impending disaster. Instead, they must draw on mythic power to lay a foundation for future heroes to save the world. Their adventures will lead them to create secret repositories containing knowledge and small slivers of their own mythic power. While doing this they also attempt to form deep alliances with disparate groups the world over, laying the groundwork for the heroes that will one day rise and change the fate of a world that they themselves had not time enough to save.",
			"",
			"**Into the Abyss:** The PCs go on a quest to the Abyss, and must endure a harrowing expedition through the infinite layers of that chaotic evil realm. They're tasked to rescue an important mortal sold into demonic slavery, retrieve a soul that was condemned to the Abyss by mistake, or topple a particularly destructive demon lord. Whatever the reason, the adventurers face challenges that push their new abilities to the limit.",
			"",
			"**Lost Souls:** The souls of the dead are not reaching their final destinations, but are instead trapped in a state of waiting. The PCs must discover what is powerful enough to interfere with this cosmic process-and for what dark purpose. Worse, the denied souls are being twisted into monstrous forms, causing pockets of corruption and instability, and presenting other threats to the world. The PCs struggle to unravel the mystery and defeat the furtive villain behind it all.",
			"",
			"**Mirror through the Multiverse:** A sudden magical event, like an arcane earthquake, shreds the barrier between parallel worlds. The divine powers of each realm perceive the others as threats and seek to do away with the rival \"mockeries\" of their own world through their ascended champions. The PCs are selected on behalf of their world's pantheon of gods while searching out their opponents, some of whom might be eerily similar to them. GMs can offer players the choice of vanquishing their opponents or of allying with them in a joint effort to stop this cosmic bout.",
			"",
			"**Proving Grounds of the Great Beyond:** The PCs are captured and taken to a grand arena where they must fight against other legendary creatures for the amusement of powerful planar entities. Each round of the competition proves more deadly than the last, as it becomes clear that only one team will survive this tournament. If the PCs are victorious, a great boon might be bestowed upon them, so when the chance to escape presents itself, they must decide whether or not to continue.",
			"",
			"**Redemption:** Pursuing a once-strong champion of goodness like a fallen angel or an antipaladin, the PCs use mythic power not to oppose their enemy but to discover the source of his defection in the hopes of turning him back to the light. Or they must cleanse a relic that's been polluted by some festering malignancy. The corruption is so deep-seated that the PCs must journey to a distant place of renown that can be reached only by heroes wielding the strongest of mythic powers.",
			"",
			"**Revenge Unyielding:** Some legendary warrior or powerful monster returns, like a dragon or giant once imprisoned in stasis, petrified, or under an enchanted sleep. Finding its world gone and all of its family and kin perished at the hands of heroes long since past, its mind collapses into madness. The creature vows revenge on all its foes' descendants, or perhaps even the entire world, and slaughters in blind rage. The heroes must find a way to stay the avenger's madness or put the tormented soul to rest.",
			"",
			"**The Culling Plague:** A rare disease has stricken one of the great races of the world. Giants, dragons, even outsiders might be victim to this debilitating plague. The oldest members of the afflicted species beseech the adventurers to stem this horrible contagion. Such a quest could take the PCs to far-flung parts of the world (and perhaps even beyond) searching for rare ingredients to concoct a cure. Alternatively, a sickness that strikes a species spread across the spectrum of good and evil, like outsiders or dragons, might make the PCs unlikely peace brokers between angels and devils or chromatic and metallic dragonkind while trying to find the cure.",
			"",
			"**The Giving Rain:** The flensed flesh of a deity executed for unknowable crimes falls in a gory rain across the land. The areas with the highest concentration exhibit bizarre, troubling effects. The PCs, being close to one such place, gain mythic powers. Drawn to other epicenters as if pulled by the godflesh, the heroes must deal with the changes wrought by the storm. This includes putting down monsters that have likewise gained strange new abilities, hunting down masses of godflesh that are hidden deep underground or atop the highest peaks, and restoring peace to kingdoms that have gone to war over possession of these divine blessings.",
			"",
			"**The Old Guard:** The PCs inherit a grand duty from a group of aging heroes with a sacred and momentous charge. This might be guarding a rift in the multiverse, manning the prison of a dreaded lich or even an elder god, or preserving the first teachings of arcane magic or a hallowed fighting style. The aging guardians deputize the PCs and charge them with a sacred quest to find others able to wield mythic power and take over for the august veterans when their time has come, or grant the PCs a chance to become the new guardians themselves. In the latter case, the older heroes direct the PCs toward quests and accomplishments that will increase their mythic power to the levels needed to replace the retiring guardians. Perhaps the PCs don't even realize they're being vetted for this crucial role as they undergo their adventures.",
			"",
			"**To Challenge a God:** An evil deity and its minions are making a play for ultimate power in the mortal realms. Other gods, prevented from interfering in the matter by a divine compact, task the characters to oppose the usurper. The PCs must disrupt the schemes of the deity's minions and work their way up through the ranks, breaking the chain one link at a time, until they finally confront the ambitious god.",
			"",
			"**Uniting the Armies:** War rages across the land. Disparate humanoid and monstrous races fight with one another, oblivious to a rising threat that will soon endanger them all-and that might have orchestrated their conflicts in the first place to keep their armies occupied. The heroes alone learn the truth and must use their mythic powers to unite the warring groups-but doing so means facing a series of challenges of diplomacy, intrigue, and brute force. Only by banding together will the land be able to fight off their immense foe in the ultimate battle."

			"Mythic boons are special rewards given for moments of dramatic achievement. Mythic PCs should repeatedly act in a heroic fashion, charging boldly into danger with confidence, and they should be rewarded for accomplishing such astonishing feats of daring, luck, and courage. Awarding mythic boons is one way for the GM to encourage the players to push their characters to their limits.",
			"",
			"Granting a boon is simple: when the PCs accomplish an astounding feat of bravery, cunning, or luck, they should regain one use of their mythic power (but may not exceed their total uses). This can represent different things depending on the origin: the divine smiling upon the PCs, eldritch energy surging within, or even a character's pride made manifest as actual power.",
			"",
			"When rewarding boons, the GM should reward all the PCs involved in that moment and keep these rewards balanced across the whole group. For example, if a barbarian champion charges forward and slays a powerful villain with a lucky critical hit with his axe, you might reward the barbarian, but don't neglect the rogue trickster flanking the villain with the barbarian and the bard marshal granting bonuses on the attack roll with his bardic performance as well. A character should get a boon no more than once per encounter, but the GM might waive this guideline in special circumstances.",
			"",
			"Included below are example moments worthy of a boon. This is not an exhaustive list, as any situation can result in an extraordinary outcome. These should not be automatic; if a character is built to perform critical hits, he shouldn't be rewarded every time he scores three or more in one combat, but only when he does so in extreme circumstances.",
			"",
			"Many of these boons require the character to perform the task against a mythic foe, but a suitably challenging normal foe might qualify as well, as determined by the GM. Unless otherwise specified, these moments must take place within the same encounter- the indestructible boon moment doesn't count if you survive two critical hits in one combat and one in the next, for instance.",

			"Recurring villains are a staple of fantasy fiction and with a little careful planning you can make your mythic villains memorable opponents your players to remember and talk about for years to come. With the heroes possessing extraordinary power, the villains that defy them should also possess a measure of that power. A memorable, iconic villain will bump elbows with the PCs over and over again. Such a villain builds tension-for even as the PCs foil her plans, they're kept frustrated by failing to permanently stop this fiend. Creating such nasty villains is challenging as heroes grow stronger and get better at killing off persistent foes. To ensure the mythic villain survives, make use of noncombat encounters, ensure your villain always has an escape plan, and don't be afraid to reintroduce her after the players think she's had been finished off.",
			"",
			"Noncombat encounters help players develop a connection between their PCs and the villain in a way that doesn't risk the villain's life (or the PCs'). Early on, she can appear as a harmless or even helpful NPC. Or, if the PCs have already fought the villain, she can leave notes or use magic to taunt them. Various mythic powers, the Disguise skill, or even simple magic like [disguise self](spell/disguise_self), [glibness](spell/glibness), or [nondetection](spell/nondetection) can be used to help a villain blend in and rub elbows with the heroes all while seeming innocuous. Later, once the villain is revealed, she can work behind the scenes, using minions and other allies to accomplish her ends, all the while making it plain to the PCs that she's continuing to thwart them.",
			"",
			"In a world where powerful creatures are hunting you, paranoia and the willingness to abandon plans and allies are key to survival. If you want your villain to fight the players, plan an early exit. It's okay for a villain to flee even if she might win a confrontation, as her plans are a long game and require that she survive to see them through. There are many spells, mythic powers, and class abilities that give the villain the ability to get away in a hurry. She should use more mundane escape methods when possible, concealing her iconic escapes as much as possible so they're more difficult for the PCs to counter.",
			"",
			"Should the villain be killed, don't be afraid to have her revisit your campaign for a little posthumous mockery and mayhem. There are many ways to reintroduce a dead villain-sometimes it's as simple as having a minion cast [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) or [resurrection](spell/resurrection), but there are other, more sophisticated options. You can introduce a new recurring villain who tracks down one of the PCs' dead foes and brings him to some semblance of life in the form of an undead minion or possessed item, or who uses speak with dead to learn the deceased foe's secrets."

Because of the heroes' great power, these failings and weaknesses are also often dramatic, and if their enemies learn of these flaws, they will seek to exploit them.",

The GM should carefully weigh whether or not to include them in the game, and decide if their addition is a benefit to the story as a whole and (more importantly) something the players will enjoy playing.",
			"",
			"If you decide to include mythic flaws in the game, they are gained at the same time the character gains mythic power, during the moment of ascension. You can select these flaws yourself, making them an aspect of the theme used to grant the PCs mythic power, or you can allow the PCs to select them, integrating the flaws into their backstories. The following mythic flaws are examples of the types of flaws you could include in your game.",
			"",
			"**Dependency:** There is only one food or drink that can nourish your hero, and without it your powers fade. Select one specific type of food or drink (other than water). If you don't ingest that food or drink at least once per day, you begin to lose your mythic powers. After the first day of absence, you can no longer regain uses of mythic power. After the second day, you lose all the powers and abilities granted by your mythic path. After the third day, you lose all of your mythic abilities, with the exception of ability score increases, bonus hit points, and bonus mythic feats. These powers and abilities are immediately restored as soon as you consume that food or drink.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Vulnerability:** One element above all others has an adverse effect on your power and is capable of harming you like no other. Select either acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You take double the amount of damage whenever that damage is of the selected type. You never benefit from resistance or immunity to that element. When an effect of that type is used against you, it is always treated as though it's from a mythic source.",
			"",
			"**Furious Rage:** Your rage is a beast, one that you can barely control. Whenever you are hit by a critical hit or demoralized by the Intimidate skill, you go into an uncontrollable rage. This functions like the [barbarian's rage class feature](class/barbarian), but you don't gain a bonus to your Strength or Constitution score (even if you have the rage class feature). This limits the actions you can perform and gives you a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1d4 plus your mythic tier, but you aren't fatigued after this duration expires. If you have the rage class feature, this does not count toward your uses of that feature. If you are raging when this flaw is triggered, that rage immediately ends and this effect begins.",
			"",
			"**Hubris:** You are first, best, and above all others. Your power is unrivaled and you know it. You receive a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear. Whenever you succeed at a saving throw against an effect that would have caused you to gain the shaken, frightened, or panicked condition, you instead gain the staggered condition for a duration equal to the duration of the effect that you saved against, as you spend part of each round boasting about your prowess. If you instead fail a saving throw against such an effect, that effect's duration is doubled as you're also confronted with doubt or shame.",
			"",
			"**Material Weakness:** There is one material that can penetrate even your toughest defenses. Select cold iron, silver, or wood. Weapons made primarily from that material automatically confirm all critical hits against you and the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons made primarily of that type always bypass that reduction.",
			"",
			"**Mercurial Mind:** The power that you wield speaks to you, and it befuddles your mind at critical moments. Whenever you're hit by a critical hit or fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or special ability, you also gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**School Aversion:** Despite your power, there is one type of magic that is foretold to be your undoing. Those that wield it are of great danger to you. Select one school of magic (except divination). Whenever you attempt a saving throw against a spell or effect of that school, you take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The effects of such spells (if harmful) last twice as long if you fail the saving throw. In addition, all spells and effects of that school used against you are always treated as though they're from a mythic source. You also may not benefit from spells and effects from the selected school, subject to GM discretion.",
			"",
			"**Weapon Weakness:** The prophecies say that one weapon will be your doom. Select one group of weapons from the list of fighter weapons. Weapons from the selected group gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against you. If a weapon from the selected group scores a critical hit against you, the critical multiplier is increased by 1 (to a maximum of &times;4). If you have damage reduction, weapons from that group always bypass that reduction."

Each idea includes a basic synopsis of the plot, a list of some of the challenges the heroes could face, a look at the primary adversary, and ideas for further adventures. Some of these ideas imply the heroes' mythic origin, but they can easily be tailored for PCs who have already gone on other mythic adventures.",

			"Many stories in novels, comic books, television shows, and movies involve powerful characters losing their abilities for a short time. It's tempting for many GMs to make that a part of a mythic campaign. While you can certainly use such a plot device in your game, the loss of power must be handled carefully to avoid turning an otherwise fun string of adventures into something no one wants to play anymore. Here are a few tips to make this idea work in a fun way.",
			"",
			"To start with, this is only a good option when the characters are in the middle tiers (between 4th and 7th tier). If the heroes are of a lower tier, they haven't used their mythic power enough to make the powerlessness storyline interesting. If they're of a higher tier, the gulf between their mythic story and the story being told now is so great that it may break the flow of the story.",
			"",
			"Powerlessness arcs should last no more than a couple sessions, lest the temporary loss of power start to seem like a permanent disability.",
			"",
			"Causes of the PCs' powerlessness need to be explainable- and either the characters know about it beforehand or someone informs them of the cause after they've lost their powers. It could be an event that comes to pass, like a lunar eclipse or a great volcano's eruption disrupting the flow of power in the world. Or a foe might enact a ritual to nullify the heroes' power. The PCs might even be responsible for their own loss of power, especially if the divine being who granted the powers doesn't approve of their recent activities.",
			"",
			"Solutions to the PCs' plight should make sense from a story perspective. Events pass, reinstating the PCs' mythic power (in which case, the PCs need merely to wait, and possibly fight to survive until then). The foe's rituals are undone by the temporarily normal PCs. Or penance can be granted as the PCs show that they're still worthy.",
			"",
			"Drama happens between the cause and solution: foes that should have been easy before become challenges again, and those the heroes have angered can now retaliate, whether they are monstrous foes or slighted townsfolk. The rewards acquired during this time should reflect the difficulty of the challenges the PCs face."

The phoenix soared into the sky to meet the challenge, but in the ensuing battle, both were left crippled, falling back to earth.

Now it stalks the land, burning everything it its wake, mad with pain, its mind clouded by the dragon's magic.",

			"A monster's mythic rank (MR) is a game statistic for monsters that's roughly equivalent to a mythic tier- monsters with only a little mythic power are 1st rank, and the greatest mythic monsters are 10th rank. Unlike PCs, monsters usually start with a specific mythic rank and that rank never changes. For example, a mythic troll is 2nd rank and is always going to be 2nd rank, unless the GM has a reason for its rank to increase-like if a tribe of trolls has an artifact that grants the trolls mythic power, and the longer it takes the PCs to deal with them, the more powerful the artifact makes these monsters.",
			"",
			"In terms of power, mythic ranks and mythic tiers are similar, but not exactly the same. For any ability, spell, magic item, or other rule that requires a mythic tier or interfaces with the tier rules, a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier. For example, a sword that gains additional abilities when wielded by a character of 3rd tier or higher gains those bonuses when wielded by a monster of 3rd rank or higher. A few mythic monsters have mythic tier abilities identical to those available to PCs; a monster's mythic rank counts as its tier for any effects dependent on tier. For example, a monster with the parry spell [guardian path ability](rule/guardian) uses its mythic rank to determine the level of spells it can parry with that ability.",
			"",
			"It is possible for a low-CR creature to have a high mythic rank, or for a high-CR creature to have a low mythic rank. For a typical monster that's acquired mythic power, its rank is equal to half its original CR. For example, a CR 4 owlbear that becomes a mythic creature should be 2nd rank. To determine a mythic monster's final CR, add half its mythic rank to its original CR. For example, a 2nd rank mythic owlbear's final CR is 5 (2 &times; 1/2 + 4). See [Designing Encounters](rule/designing_encounters_ma) for more details. All the monsters presented in this chapter use this typical MR value.",

For example, a mythic creature that gains the [vampire template](monster/vampire_template) has a mythic tier, and a non-mythic creature that gains the [mythic vampire template](unknown/mythic_vampire_template) has a mythic rank, but a mythic creature that becomes a mythic vampire loses its tier and gains ranks instead, as explained in the mythic vampire template.

Because you rarely check the Feats entry for a monster when rolling initiative, it would be easy to forget that ability when using the monster. As a reminder of this ability, a monster with that feat has a superscript -M- after its initiative modifier. The listed initiative modifier already includes the additional bonus from the [Mythic Improved Initiative](feat/improved_initiative) feat.",
			"",
			"**Feats:** The creature's feats are listed here. Most mythic feats improve non-mythic feats, and have the non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. In these cases, the non-mythic feat isn't listed along with the mythic feat.",
			"",
			"**Special Attacks:** All of the monsters presented in this chapter have the [mythic subtype](rule/mythic_subtype), which grants them the [mythic power universal monster ability](umr/mythic_power), allows them to expend uses of mythic power to add surge dice to d20 rolls, and may add other abilities as well. When running a monster with mythic power, always remember that it can use the surge ability-especially because some mythic creatures don't use mythic power for anything else, so that ability is necessary for the monster to keep up with and challenge mythic PCs. (Plus, part of the fun of using mythic rules is getting to use mythic surges, and the GM should get to do that, too.)",
			"",
			"**Environment:** The mythic monsters presented here list the same environment as the non-mythic version of the creature-by default, mythic trolls prefer cold mountains like common trolls do, and mythic owlbears prefer temperate forests like common owlbears do. Of course, you can change the environment of a mythic monster to anything appropriate for your campaign, especially if the mythic monster is unique. For example, if you want the one mythic hydra in your world to live in the desert instead of in marshes like non-mythic hydras, that change serves to make the mythic hydra even more unusual and iconic.",
			"",
			"**Organization:** The mythic monsters presented here list the same information on organization as the nonmythic versions of the creatures. These stat blocks make no assumptions about the uniqueness or rarity of these mythic monsters in your campaign. This allows you to adapt existing encounters in printed adventures to a mythic campaign by replacing one, some, or all nonmythic creatures in a specific encounter with their mythic equivalents. For example, to challenge a group of mythic PCs in an adventure featuring an encounter with six trolls, you could replace any number of those trolls with mythic trolls-perhaps just the leader is a mythic troll, creating a slightly more difficult encounter, or perhaps all of them are mythic, resulting in a much harder challenge.",
			"",
			"**Treasure:** Most of the mythic monsters presented here use the same treasure notation as their non-mythic counterparts. For example, trolls have standard treasure, so mythic trolls also have standard treasure. However, a mythic monster's CR will be higher than its non-mythic equivalent, so when awarding treasure you should account for the CR increase and adjust the monster's treasure accordingly. A mythic troll encountered with non-mythic trolls should have slightly better treasure because of its higher CR (just as a fiendish troll encountered with a gang of normal trolls should have better treasure). If a monster normally has NPC-type treasure (like an ogre does), the mythic version of that monster usually has better treasure than its non-mythic counterparts, since its CR is higher.",
			"",
			"Mythic monsters-especially intelligent ones-may be more likely to use magical treasures found in their lairs, perhaps out of some instinctive cunning about the item or because the item was given to the monster by the entity that granted the monster its mythic power. For example, a mythic hydra with an amulet of mighty fists +1 in its treasure hoard could be a sacred guardian created by the god of snakes, and the amulet could have been granted to the hydra by the god, giving the creature the full benefit of the item.",
			"",
			"**Special Abilities:** These monsters include descriptions of the non-mythic monster's special abilities, so you don't need to reference the non-mythic monster in another book to use the mythic monster. In some cases, these descriptions are simplified or shortened to make room for the mythic monster's new abilities. If you have questions about how a monster's special ability works, refer to the full text of the non-mythic monster's original description in the Bestiary.",
			"",
			"**Description:** Rather than repeating information about the original, non-mythic monster, this section presents information on the mythic version of the monster, such as suggesting how its origin or its role in the game differs from that of a non-mythic creature of its type.

			"The following variant system treats alignment as a storytelling mechanic, giving you guidance on creating challenges, tracking shifts, and presenting rewards to those who champion their alignments appropriately.",
			"",
			"For each character in the campaign, you'll need a copy of the alignment diagram reproduced below as Table 3-1. Whether the characters' positions are tracked by the GM or the players is up to you. There are two general ways you can start using this system. The first is the relative alignment method, which starts a character at neutral on both axes (or as near to neutral as his class's starting alignment allows). Alternatively, you can use the standard alignment method, which allows each character to start with the alignment he wants, though he will begin closely bordering neutral and must work to fulfill the true ethos of his chosen alignment. The basic principles for each method are detailed below.",
			"",
			"**Relative Alignment:** In the relative alignment method, many, if not most, characters start out as truly neutral on both axes of the alignment charts (the number 5 position on both the law/chaos axis and the good/evil axis). If a character's starting class has an alignment restriction, the character starts at the nearest border to the neutral range on those charts as she can without breaking the class's alignment restriction. For instance, a monk would start at the 3 position on the law/chaos axis, but would still start at the 5 position on the good/evil axis. A paladin, on the other hand, would start at the 3 position on both axes.",
			"",
			"This method makes moral conflicts dangerous for low-level characters. For a character who must adhere to a specific alignment ethos to keep certain abilities or progress in her class, an early slip might have her searching for an atonement or rethinking her chosen career path.",
			"",
			"**Standard Alignment:** The standard path is less restrictive than the relative method. A player chooses his character's alignment normally, and the character is positioned on the chart within that alignment but as close to the border of neutral as possible (either the 3 or the 7 position on each axis). If the player chooses neutral on either axis, then the character starts right in the middle (the 5 position) on that axis.",
			"",
			"This method can also make early levels and moral conflicts precarious, but it does make it easier to stay on track and gain the rewards allowed later on.",

			"During the course of play, characters fight monsters, find treasure, and decide to take the left fork or the right, but there are other choices that come up in a game as well- moral choices. In most games, these choices are fairly straightforward. Do you help vanquish an ancient evil from the kingdom? Do you stop the raiders from pillaging? Do you put down the hungry troll raiding far-flung hamlets? Without mitigating circumstances, all of these can be seen as good (and probably lawful) moral choices, and can count as such when you are using this system. But this system really shines when the choices are not nearly so clear-cut.",
			"",
			"Real moral conflict occurs through either moral challenges or moral dilemmas. A moral challenge occurs when something assumed to be a clear moral path is shown to be false or more complicated, requiring the characters to reevaluate based on the new information. What do characters do when they find out the ancient evil threatening the kingdom is actually a rebellion trying to feed the poor? What if the raiders are hill people who were displaced by a dragon and are just trying to survive? Perhaps that troll is seeking revenge for the slaughter of its mate and children by the hamlet-dwellers. What the characters do in these situations, and their reasoning for their actions, may cause individuals to shift on either of the alignment axes.",
			"",
			"Consider, for instance, a situation in which a group of characters is tasked by a monarch with ridding the kingdom of an ancient order of cultists threatening the status quo. The act of taking the monarch's quest poses no real moral challenges or dilemmas, and thus does not have a chance to push a characters' alignment in any direction on the two spectrums, though an argument could be made that the characters' obedience to their monarch might be an intrinsically lawful act. But for the moment, let's assume the characters are being amply rewarded for such a quest (as they usually are), so unless a particularly lawful-minded character turns down such rewards, the characters can be seen as pursuing their own self-interest, which is intrinsically neutral within this system. Through the course of their quest against the disruptive cult, the characters find that while the cult is indeed working to undermine the monarch, its reasons for doing so are not even remotely evil. The cult is chaotic, yes, but good, and it seeks to throw down the status quo as a way of relieving the social injustices the ultra-lawful king pursues to keep his power nearly absolute.",
			"",
			"What do the characters do? If they blindly follow the monarch's commands, and even find themselves agreeing with the throne's more draconian methods for keeping the peace, they will slide toward the lawful side. Depending on their level of support for some particularly heartless policies, they might also drift toward the evil side of the spectrum. If they throw in their lot with the cult and actively fight their former employer, they'll shift more toward the chaotic end of that spectrum, and depending on their motivations, they could also drift toward either end on the good/evil axis. These are not the only options, of course! The characters could try to get one or both sides to recognize the concerns of the other. This would be the ultimate peacemaker role and, if accomplished, would be a major victory for the good of the kingdom as a whole (and thus a large shift toward good on that axis). It is possible they could also play the sides against one another, pushing them into a deeper and more bitter conflict, then take advantage of the power vacuum created by such strife, which would be evil and probably also chaotic.",
			"",
			"Regardless of the outcome, it is only in moral conflict that characters have a chance to make decisions about competing moral goals on both the good/evil and law/chaos axes, and it is those kinds of challenges this system requires.",
			"",
			"More difficult to design, and often harder to adjudicate, is the moral dilemma. Moral dilemmas are like challenges, but they contain moral paradoxes, meaning there is never a clear solution, and the PCs must struggle to find the solution that is best for them. A group of adventurers sworn to protect the king and the royal line finds out that the king is a power-hungry demoniac who is opening a gate to the Abyss, and the only way to stop the plan is regicide. Killing the king would mean a bloody civil war, and the characters would be branded as traitors. Not killing the king, though, could lead to deeper suffering, or force the PCs to try to defeat an army of demons before the fiends tear the kingdom apart. The adventurers must decide the best course of action when neither is optimal. Naturally, the point in these situations is not to make the \"right\" decision, but to see what decision the characters make, and adjust their alignments based on that decision."

			"Nearly every adventure has the potential for moral conflicts, but you should be careful not to spring them on your players too often; otherwise you risk creating conflict fatigue or lessening the dramatic impact. While moral conflict can be a fun and thought-provoking part of a campaign, remember that some players like to focus on more concrete aspects of the game, and the best sessions often feature a diverse selection of moral, strategic, and tactical challenges. Moral challenges are often nuanced, and moral dilemmas can be frustrating with their \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" nature. Both can be just as stressful as a challenging battle, and can ramp up tensions at the table-for better or worse.",
			"",
			"In addition, oversaturating a game with moral challenges and dilemmas may have the unwanted effect of cheapening them. Try to think of these conflicts as something akin to the classic \"boss fight\" in a combat-oriented game: a momentous occasion of great struggle, as opposed to the more common nuisance of a trap, which can be foiled quickly once the mechanism is understood. Consider limiting these types of challenges to once per character level, at most. Some groups may thirst for more, and you should give them what they want, but once per level is a good place to start.",
			"",
			"While it may be fun to constantly challenge strongly aligned individuals, try to create moral challenges that the whole group can participate in. In these situations, characters will act as individuals and put forward many points of view and desired actions. This inter-character strife is often enough to create the framework for spin-off moral challenges, and give individuals the opportunity for alignment shifts and affirmations through interactions with other party members. Be ready to assimilate such spontaneous moral challenges and gauge them as appropriate. Even more so than the moral challenges you design into your campaign, these interactions can be visceral and fulfilling to players because they come from natural character interaction."

It's up to the GM to judge whether a response warrants a shift on the alignment axes. Often, this will be easy: Did a character act in a selfish and uncaring manner? That may cause a shift toward evil on the good/evil axis. Did the character uphold the law of the land over the rights of its citizens? That may cause a shift toward the lawful side of the law/chaos axis. Particularly severe actions may warrant a 2-step shift.

In these cases, the character is awarded one or two affirmations-small, temporary benefits keyed to the affirmed alignment-based on how many steps you think the action would otherwise have shifted the alignment. A character can spend an affirmation she has gained once within the next 24 hours; any affirmations not spent within that time disappear. Spending an affirmation is usually not an action, but a character must be conscious to do so. The following are benefits gained by spending affirmations.",

			"",
			"As players advance in level and become more invested in the system, feel free to create your own affirmations based on a particular character's emergent moral dimensions. For instance, if one of your players is a paladin of Torag, it's reasonable to allow her to use a lawful affirmation to grant an adjacent ally her bonus to AC.

Typically, items of normal or greater complexity require a workshop of some sort, but under certain circumstances, the GM can rule that such items can be created in the field.

Those rules assume that the character is spending a full week conducting business (when it is often more desirable for a PC to merely do a single day's work), and they offer few ideas on how to modify the basic check to account for circumstances, roleplaying opportunities, and so forth. For example, there are two primary methods of plying a trade while practicing the various professions suggested in the Pathfinder RPG. One is by setting up a place of business in a static location, and the other is by traveling from point to point, offering services. Both of these approaches are possible within a single area of expertise in almost every case, though there are advantages and disadvantages inherent in each. The Profession rules as written do not take any of this into account.",

Alternatively, if you don't wish to delve into the complexities of creating a business and handling the bookkeeping to run it, then assume you find enough opportunities to convince the occasional passerby to buy a good or service from you to make a small profit. You earn your check result in silver pieces per day in this fashion.

			"**Initial/Upgrade Costs:** The cost listed is the amount required to either establish (for a Mobile or Small business) or upgrade (from Small to Medium, or Medium to Large) a business. The value is multiplied by the number of ranks you have in the appropriate Profession skill, and reflects the quality of tools, equipment, decor, advertising, and so forth needed to maximize your talents and effectiveness at running a business of that size. If you gain more skill ranks, you must pay for the increased cost associated with those ranks in order to gain the benefit of those ranks on checks to determine profits-otherwise, all checks made to determine profits are capped at the highest skill rank for which you've paid. If you spend 125% of the listed cost, you set up a masterwork operation, with the finest equipment, tools, and furnishings available. Such a workspace grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on all associated Profession checks (including ones to determine profits).",

			"Running a business using the Profession skill requires a great amount of time, and as such, most heroes don't maintain an active operation. Those who do often turn over most of the day-to-day tasks to subordinates so they themselves can continue adventuring. You can employ and supervise trained apprentices and assistants to help you manage the business affairs. For every assistant or apprentice you take on to help run your business, you reduce your time required to actively participate in the business by 25%. Thus, with one assistant, you work 75% of the time and are free the rest of the time. With two assistants, you can split your time evenly between the business and other endeavors, and so forth, up to four assistants, who can take complete control of the business operations on your behalf. You can choose to divide each day, week, or month between working and free time. Each assistant you add imposes a penalty equal to the appropriate Labor Factor penalty on your skill check to determine profits. See Table 2-7.",
			"",
			"It takes time to find and hire such skilled employees. For each employee, you must spend 1d4 days &times; the number of ranks she possesses in the appropriate Profession skill searching her out and training her. You can only hire a trained worker who has at least half as many ranks in the appropriate Profession skill as you do, but no more than you do; a skilled individual with more ranks than you will not lower herself to be your assistant."

If you roll a 9, for a total of 14, you then multiply that total by 10 (the Monthly Profits Factor for a Small business) to determine that you've made a net profit of 140 gp over the course of the month. If you had chosen to manage the business in person, with no help from extra assistants, then your profits would have been 160 gp, but you would have been tied to the store and unable to adventure for half the month."

			"Listed below are each of the professions featured in the Pathfinder RPG, along with a quick description of how a character could operate that business either as a traveling service or from a storefront. Of course, other professions are possible, limited only by a character's imagination.",
			"",
			"**Architect:** Mobile architects are very uncommon, and most often travel from noble to noble, providing expertise in the construction of manor houses and strongholds. A mobile architect might also serve as an attachment to a military unit or a mercenary company, training the soldiers in construction of defenses on the field of battle. More often, architects operate small businesses in larger towns and cities, creating and selling plans for construction or overseeing projects already under way.",
			"",
			"**Baker:** A baker can peddle goods (usually cooked at home) as a street vendor, often from a bazaar stall or cart. In rare instances, a renowned baker might travel the countryside, offering to create masterfully made baked goods in smaller communities, most often during holidays and other celebrations (and sometimes while in search of apprentices). A baker can also establish a storefront to sell all manner of breads, cakes, pastries, and pies, probably in conjunction with various Craft (baked goods) skill checks. The baker might also take special orders for custom creations, particularly catering to the wealthy within a sizable town.",
			"",
			"**Barrister:** Traveling barristers might operate on a predetermined circuit, attending to legal matters in small communities scattered through rural areas, often at the behest of the local nobility. However, most barristers serve in a fixed location, performing their legal duties in conjunction with an established court of law. Depending on the type of government that exists within a locale, the barrister might serve a set of clients among the general populace, or he might act more as judge and jury in all disputes.",
			"",
			"**Brewer:** A traveling brewer likely functions as a microbrewer, crafting his beverages at home then selling them from a wagon or cart, sometimes even between multiple communities or at local fairs. Larger brewing operations may set up shop in a rural community where the ingredients are fresh and then ship the finished product in larger towns, or they might receive the ingredients from elsewhere and craft their brews within the city walls.",
			"",
			"**Butcher:** A mobile butcher might move among several very small, rural communities, either buying livestock or offering to slaughter and dress them on the premises. Most butchers operate butcher's shops, selling fresh cuts of meat delivered from elsewhere. Very large operations might sell to nobles or armies in need of sustenance.",
			"",
			"**Clerk:** Traveling clerks, while not common, are not unheard of. They frequently roam from town to town, preparing paperwork on behalf of clergy members, mayors, and minor nobles. Clerks who operate storefront businesses tend to provide bookkeeping services to other businesses, and also offer the creation of announcements, invitations, and other printed materials.",
			"",
			"**Cook:** Cooks who travel often do so in the company of military units or caravans, while those who want to settle down frequently run restaurants or pubs. Some cooks also make a living serving fantastic dishes at court or operating catering services for other businesses.",
			"",
			"**Courtesan:** There are very few instances of traveling courtesans; most who claim to be are grifters or con artists, offering companionship only as part of some elaborate scheme. Most true courtesans are found either at court or working in a bawdy house. An individual could run a brothel as a full-time business using this Profession skill.",
			"",
			"**Driver:** By its nature, the profession of driving requires travel, so most mobile drivers work independently, serving military units or caravans, handling carts, wagons, carriages, and the animals that pull them. Localized driving businesses could offer dray work to other shops in a community, provide carriage service (like a taxi service), or even contract out full caravan service. Alternatively, mercenary drivers might participate in chariot games for sponsors willing to pay enough.",
			"",
			"**Engineer:** Engineers function in much the same way as architects. Mercenary captains who lead bands of military engineers for hire typically have some skill in this profession.",
			"",
			"**Farmer:** Mobile farmers often serve as traveling workers, moving between farms to gather crops on behalf of wealthy landowners. Some highly skilled farmers also travel between communities, demonstrating and selling new kinds of plant breeds or diagnosing diseases. Otherwise, farmers operate plots of land, growing produce to sell in urban areas.",
			"",
			"**Fisherman:** Fishermen must go where there is water, but some truly do travel, by either taking wealthy clients on fishing expeditions for sport or finding work as an independent contractor on a commercial fishing vessel. Fishermen who wish to start a local business often run a dockside company with one or more boats or ships with crews that bring in large catches, which the business owner then sells to local inns, taverns, and so forth.",
			"",
			"**Gambler:** A lone gambler who makes a living winning coin usually moves from place to place once her skills are noted and she wears out her welcome. Some occasionally hire on to teach others how to gamble effectively (this is particularly popular among nobles who are constantly trying to one-up one another). Gamblers who want to make a business of it often set up betting houses, bookie services, and casinos.",
			"",
			"**Gardener:** Mobile gardeners serve as landscapers, hiring out to grow and groom public parks. Some gardeners start local businesses that cater to either the city or wealthy nobles who want flower gardens, hedge mazes, and the like. Their employees visit clients regularly to plant new starts, trim and train established plants and trees, and ready gardens for the changing seasons.",
			"",
			"**Herbalist:** A traveling herbalist rides alone or with a caravan, moving between locales to gather fresh herbs and sell dried ones. Stationary herbalists sell their wares from small cottages in the rural parts of the country or from shops in big cities. The largest herbalist businesses conduct trade with large-scale food suppliers and hospitals, providing seasonings and remedies, respectively.",
			"",
			"**Innkeeper:** A traveling innkeeper serves as a hired hand who helps get struggling businesses back into profitable shape by arranging for better entertainment, bouncers, victuals, and other amenities. Inns run as businesses can range in size from small bed-and-breakfasts to large military barracks.",
			"",
			"**Librarian:** A traveling librarian moves about the land, dealing in books (particularly rare ones) with communities that either don't have access to a library of their own or with folks who simply can't afford much in the way of reading material. Permanent libraries can be anything from small, specialized shops that deal with very specific subjects to massive cultural edifices that represent the pinnacle of a given civilization. Private libraries that are run as businesses are rare and usually cater to clients with large amounts of money to spend.",
			"",
			"**Merchant:** Traveling merchants can bring goods either on pack mules or as part of a great caravan, and can be found hawking their wares on nearly every street corner. Shopkeepers of all ilks buy and sell every trade good imaginable. The largest trade consortiums manage hundreds of caravans, storefronts, and warehouses.",
			"",
			"**Midwife:** Some midwives travel between communities, helping to deliver babies at each stop. In more urban communities, they can be hired on by temples and hospitals that specialize in infant birthing.",
			"",
			"**Miller:** A traveling miller might go from village to village with a portable mill and set up shop for a few days or a week, grinding the community's grain before moving on to the next place. Millers running established operations in farming country would work out of a mill built near a flowing water source, while larger commercial milling operations in urban areas could serve all the farms and merchants for miles around.",
			"",
			"**Miner:** Miners must find work wherever the ore, stone, or precious materials they mine are found. However, a lone miner could make a living excavating foundations and basements, live as a prospector hunting for gems and panning for gold in the wild, or work as a mercenary employed to assist a military unit in building defenses or sapping the enemy's walls.",
			"",
			"**Porter:** Portage work tends to operate out of hubs of civilization, whether in small frontier towns where the need for porters to carry exploration and adventuring gear is high, or in great cities where merchants are in constant need of strong backs to carry, load, and unload cargo. A lone porter could hire out to anyone needing assistance on a short- or long-term basis, while a businessperson could run a portage and delivery service in any sized community.",
			"",
			"**Sailor:** Individual sailors not tied to a particular port simply hire on to ships that need an extra hand. However, organized groups of sailors sometimes hire themselves out to those with ships in need of full crews.",
			"",
			"**Scribe:** Lone scribes who travel from town to town offer not only writing services, but also sell fine papers, inks, pens, and scroll and map cases to customers. Larger enterprises can provide a full range of copying, translating, and illuminating services to a broad range of customers in villages, towns, and cities.",
			"",
			"**Shepherd:** A single shepherd will travel to find work wherever there is a need for tending sheep, especially during shearing and birthing season. Someone with a mind to run a shepherding business would have the skill to operate sheep ranches and wool-processing facilities, as well as working in conjunction with butchers to process meat.",
			"",
			"**Soldier:** Soldiers go where there is fighting. Individual mercenaries, guards, or marines serving aboard ships accept coin in exchange for their combat prowess. Mercenary captains in charge of whole units or armies effectively run sizable businesses. Urban organizations offering escort and guard services to wealthy nobles and merchants can also grow quite large.",
			"",
			"**Stable Master:** Anyone who has a way with horses could travel with caravans or armies, serving as a horse handler, while operations in small villages might exist side by side with inns and taprooms. Larger businesses could offer a full-service stable that buys, heals, races, sells, and trains horses.",
			"",
			"**Tanner:** A lone tanner might provide his leatherworking services to a number of communities in proximity to one another, and small businesses that offer both tanning services and finished goods for sale are common enough. Bigger operations usually set up near cities where large numbers of livestock are gathered for processing.",
			"",
			"**Trapper:** Solo trappers can catch and skin enough game to make a living in a frontier or wooded region, and small groups of them might establish a trading post where they could sell their wares along with other goods. A large trapping company might hire scores of individual trappers, bringing in massive quantities of furs that are then shipped to other parts of the world.",
			"",
			"**Woodcutter:** Individual loggers might move from place to place, felling enough timber to sell to one small community at a time. Large logging operations can potentially clear entire regions of forest in a short time, preparing and shipping the wood-either as whole logs or sawn lumber- by water or caravan to sell anywhere growth and development occurs. Shipyards also require substantial amounts of lumber and make good customers."

Any weapon, armor, or shield special abilities on attuned items count against a character's enhancement bonus from attunement. To determine an attuned magic item's enhancement bonus, subtract the cost of its special ability from the enhancement bonus granted by attunement. (This applies only to special abilities whose cost is equivalent to an enhancement bonus, not to those that cost a flat amount of gold pieces.) For example, if a character with a +3 enhancement bonus from weapon attunement wields a [keen](magic/enhancement/keen) scimitar, she subtracts 1 point of her enhancement bonus (for the cost of keen), leaving her with a +2 keen scimitar. If a character doesn't have enough of an enhancement bonus to afford the special ability (such as a 4th-level character with a [vorpal](magic/enhancement/vorpal) longsword), she can still use the weapon's power on its own, but the weapon gains no enhancement bonus.",

			"The skill system presented in the Core Rulebook has a lot of versatility. It allows characters to overcome various challenges related to their diverse talents, with simple rules for dealing with beneficial or adverse conditions. Though many players simply spend their skill ranks on the same skills at every level, it is also possible for a character to diversify his investment in order to gain access to more skills overall or to remedy a shortcoming.",
			"",
			"However, not all skills provide the same benefit to characters. It's difficult to argue that a high bonus in a Profession skill has the same value as a high bonus in a more general skill such as Perception. Yet Profession is an important skill for nonplayer characters, as well as for players who wish to show that adventuring isn't the only thing their characters care about.",
			"",
			"The background skills system recognizes that skills such as Craft, Knowledge, and Profession serve an important role in the game. Though these skills don't directly affect the careers of typical adventurers the same way that Bluff, Perception, and Stealth do, they are useful means for characters to interact with and explore the world outside of combat. You shouldn't have to choose between having the knowledge to understand the world and the ability to survive in it!",
			"",
			"These skills are called background skills because they reflect the non-adventuring interests and passions of a player character, or the skills more important to NPCs. All other skills are called adventuring skills. In a campaign that uses the background skills system, each character gains an additional 2 skill ranks per level, which must be spent on background skills. More details appear in the [Gaining Background Skills](rule/gaining_background_skills) section. These new rules make characters and their skills more versatile, but because they boost non-adventuring skills, they're unlikely to unbalance a campaign.",
			"",
			"### Converting Characters",
			"",
			"Implementing background skills in an established campaign is easy. To convert a character's skill ranks into this system, first determine the total number of background skill ranks she has-this is equal to 2 &times; the PC's character level. Next, find out how many ranks she has already spent on skills that are background skills under this system. The character gains that number of regular skill ranks to spend on any skills-essentially refunding the regular skill ranks spent on background skills. Finally, subtract this number from the character's total number of background skill ranks to determine how many background skill ranks she still has to spend. For example, a 5th-level rogue would have 10 background skill ranks. If she had already put 5 ranks into skills that are now background skills, she would spend 5 of her background skill ranks on those skills, freeing up the original 5 ranks to spend on any skills, and she would still have 5 background skill ranks left to spend on background skills.",
			"",
			"The GM might want to allow some amount of retraining to factor in the new background skills. A character who took Profession (poet) might prefer to put those ranks in Artistry (poetry) instead, or a character who took Knowledge (geography) to represent the time she spent traveling a specific river might take Lore in that river instead."

For instance, if you were trying to create a memorable work (a commission price of 1,000 sp) and have made only 600 sp worth of progress, you can cut your losses to gain a commission fee for an impressive work (500 sp, or 50 gp). You can't earn the value for a higher quality than you were aiming for, so if you aimed to create a memorable work but ended up creating a masterful work, you couldn't gain a commission price higher than 100 gp. When you cut your losses, you don't gain back any money you spent on supplies and services. So if you spent 250 sp when trying to create a memorable work, selling an impressive work would net you only 250 sp total if you spent 1 week of work, and would cause you to break even if you spent 2 weeks.

However, they can also be useful for other tasks related to practicing those skills. Further uses are expanded upon here, with sample DCs for common tasks. These expansions are meant to include additional uses to help these skills work into the framework of a regular game, and can be used separately from the background skills system if desired.

			"When a victim fails his initial save and is afflicted with a disease or poison, he immediately gains the effects of the first step down that affliction's progression track. For diseases, this is latent/carrier; for poisons, it's usually weakened. This replaces the affliction's normal effects (such as ability damage and ability drain), though many afflictions still produce additional symptoms. At the GM's discretion, truly deadly diseases and poisons might cause the victim to start further along the progression track than normal. All effects from disease and poison tracks are cumulative.",
			"",
			"Most afflictions also have an end state-a point at which the disease or poison has progressed as far as it can. Once an affliction has reached its end state, the victim keeps all current effects (but doesn't suffer further effects) and can no longer attempt saving throws to recover from the affliction. By default, each disease and poison track has an end state of dead, but some afflictions have less severe end states, and others might progress only to a certain intermediate state at worst, allowing victims to continue attempting saves.",
			"",
			"In general, whenever a victim fails a saving throw against her affliction, she moves one step further down the progression track, gaining the effects of the next state and keeping all previous effects, until she reaches the end state. If she's afflicted with a disease, she moves one step back toward healthy whenever she fulfills the conditions in the disease's Cure entry (usually by succeeding at one or more saves). Once she reaches healthy, she is cured. Poisons work differently-fulfilling the cure condition removes a poison from the victim's system, but she remains at the same step on the track and recovers gradually. (Treat a poison that has exhausted its duration in the same way.) For every day of bed rest (or 2 nights of normal rest), a victim recovers one step; this recovery is doubled as normal by Heal checks, and tenacious poisons might require a longer recovery period.",
			"",
			"Usually, [neutralize poison](spell/neutralize_poison) or [remove disease](spell/remove_disease) immediately moves the victim to a healthy state on the respective track, and a [heal](spell/heal) spell will work for both. However, once the disease or poison has reached its end state, only a more powerful spell such as [miracle](spell/miracle) or [wish](spell/wish) can remove its effects.",
			"",
			"Some diseases and poisons cause the same effects as a condition (such as sickened) or render characters paralyzed. Effects that modify or remove those conditions (such as immunities) do not apply; only effects and immunities that help against diseases or poisons apply, as appropriate."

			"A handful of hard-to-find, naturally occurring substances contain magical potency and can be used as special material components. Some spellcasters are trained to use these esoteric material components in their enhanced practice of the magical arts. The four more common types-entropic resin, geodes, prismatic sand, and verdant salts-link to two schools of magic each. A fifth type, yliaster, is extremely potent, but far more rare; it is universally useful, and can be substituted for any other material component.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Component Cost:** The value of esoteric material components that must be spent on a spell is equal to 1 gp &times; caster level &times; spell level, as shown on Table 4-7: Esoteric Material Component Costs. This value must be spent if esoteric components are mandatory in the campaign, or can be spent to replace normal material components if esoteric material components are optional.",
			"",
			"**Expending Components:** Each component works effectively for only two schools of magic. A caster can expend an esoteric component type that doesn't match his spell's school, but he must expend twice as much of the substitute component to fake the effects of the appropriate component. The esoteric components used in a spell need not all be of the same type. For example, a 3rd-level wizard casting [bear's endurance](spell/bear's_endurance) could expend 6 gp worth of geodes, or 12 gp total worth of entropic resin and verdant salts, or 4 gp worth of geodes plus 4 gp worth of verdant salts, and so on.",

			"**Greater Component Effects:** Expending twice the amount of components indicated on Table 4-7 activates a greater component effect, which varies by esoteric component type. These benefits are listed under the component descriptions at the end of the chapter, and depend on the component expended. To obtain the greater component benefit, the caster must use a single component type; using a type that doesn't match the spell's school still costs twice as much. The wizard in the above example could gain the geodes' greater component benefit by expending an extra 6 gp worth of geodes, or gain the verdant salts' greater component benefit by expending an extra 12 gp worth of verdant salts. A single casting of a spell can normally benefit from only one greater component effect, but the caster can expend additional components and attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 20 + double the spell's level to add more. The caster must pay the cost in esoteric components even if the Spellcraft check fails. For each greater component effect beyond the second, the DC increases by 5 + the spell's level. If the caster fails this check by 5 or more, the spell fails and its slot is lost. You can't apply the greater component effect of a single type of component more than once on a single casting of a spell.",

Spells don't need esoteric components to be cast, and normal material components function as normal. Expending esoteric material components worth the listed values allows the caster to replace normal material components she lacks (but not to replace expensive material components). It's far more useful in this system to pay double the amount of esoteric components to gain the greater component effect. A 6th-level wizard casting fireball can do so using a normal spell component pouch. If he's missing his pouch, he can expend 18 gp worth of entropic resin to cast the spell anyway.

One easy way to decide the order is to ask yourself what your character would do if these loyalties came into conflict. For a more simplified game, you could use one or two loyalties. These loyalties then replace alignment as the standard by which characters' actions are measured.",

Remove the restriction against casting spells of certain alignments (since such spells no longer exist), but create a list of spells that each deity would ban based on his or her portfolio and personality. For instance, the neutral good deity Iomedae would not tolerate spells involving consorting with outsiders from the Lower Planes.

This means the paladin isn't punished for having to guess, but she also can't use her smite class feature on every opponent as a de facto loyalty detector. If the paladin's highest loyalty is to good, she can smite foes with a loyalty to evil, but if her highest loyalty is to her king, her smite might instead apply to foes with loyalties to the jealous baron's rebellion. The GM has the final say on how the ability works, since only the GM knows the NPCs' true loyalties-a mercenary who works for a cause might not have a loyalty to that cause, for example. The GM can decide to simply have smite work only on foes with a loyalty to evil, or to require the paladin's highest loyalty be to the concept of good."

			"",
			"**Radiant and Shadow:** You can instead have alignment-based effects apply to everyone, or nearly everyone. Remove the alignments and replace \"good\" and \"evil\" with stand-ins that lack moral implications, such as \"radiant\" and \"shadow.\" These are then treated as simply two more forms of energy that exist in the world, and any creature can wield a weapon that deals radiant or shadow damage. You'll need to make appropriate changes, such as changing DR 5/good to DR 5/ radiant, making [unholy](magic/enhancement/unholy) weapons shadow weapons, and so on. Creatures that were once strongly defined by their alignment become more unpredictable. Maybe some angels are just as corrupt as devils, despite their celestial forms, and the PCs must team up with a noble demon and wield shadow weapons to defeat their foe. You can choose to grant certain creatures immunity; for instance, perhaps angels don't take radiant damage from radiant weapons or radiant smite, the stand-ins for holy weapons and [holy smite](spell/holy_smite).",
			"",
			"**Subjective Morality:** You can make your world extremely complex by replacing all alignment-based effects with subjective morality based on loyalties. In this kind of game, everyone is the hero of his own story, and the only alignment-based items and spells that exist are the ones named after the good alignment (such as holy weapons and [holy word](spell/holy_word)) plus [detect evil](spell/detect_evil). However, these effects apply not to good in the usual sense, but instead depend on the loyalties of their users. When someone uses [detect evil](spell/detect_evil), it detects others who have loyalties that oppose the caster's. When a character wields a holy weapon, it deals extra damage to those with conflicting loyalties, and so on. It's up to the GM to decide when loyalties conflict. For instance, if a magus decides that his primary loyalty is to himself, he could not reasonably claim that everything that ever attacks him has a conflicting loyalty, but an enemy who constantly abused him in the past would have a conflicting loyalty. Against this enemy, the magus's holy attacks would strike true. This world might even do away with the idea of loyalties to the concept of good and allow paladins and antipaladins alike to use the paladin class and smite each other. Since even outsiders no longer have an alignment subtype, you'll need to add other subtypes to the list of choices for abilities such as [bane](magic/enhancement/bane) or a ranger's favored enemy class feature. This covers subtypes such as demon or devil, but some outsiders have no non-alignment subtype. If you want such creatures to be subject to these abilities, you could lump them together under a new subtype (such as \"independent\"), or add subtypes on a case-by-case basis-the astral leviathan might have the \"astral\" subtype, for example."

			"",
			"This section describes the various actions in the game, their costs within this system, and new rules on how each one works. The sidebars throughout highlight exceptions and help you adjudicate situations that are not addressed directly in this section.",
			"",
			"There are a number of different simple actions, free actions, and advanced actions you can take during your turn. Taking a simple action requires 1 act. Free actions don't cost any acts; you just say you want to take them, though some must be taken alongside other simple or advanced actions. In addition, the GM may limit the number of free actions you're allowed during your turn.",
			"",
			"Advanced actions are more complicated; you must commit 2 or more acts to perform them. Some advanced actions require more acts than you can possibly commit during a single turn. In this case, you must continue committing acts toward that advanced action over multiple turns until the advanced action is complete. To take most advanced actions, you must commit all of their requisite acts consecutively. If you stop committing acts toward such an advanced action, it never comes to completion, and it must be started all over again in order to have a chance of success. Other advanced actions can be completed after committing the total requisite number of acts, which can be split up over time. In both cases, any roll attempted to determine whether an advanced action is successful is attempted after the appropriate number of acts are committed to that advanced action by the creature committing the final act. If an advanced action doesn't say whether it requires consecutive or nonconsecutive acts, all its acts must be consecutive.",
			"",
			"Some actions and reactions have one or more of the following subtypes. The subtypes are thematic, sometimes affect other actions taken later in the turn, and are used to determine whether (and at what point) an action provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Attack Actions:** Actions with the attack subtype involve making at least one attack roll against an opponent or object. They typically provoke attacks of opportunity only if the attack is a ranged attack or you don't have the appropriate feat to take that attack action without provoking attacks of opportunity, such as [Improved Unarmed Strike](feat/improved_unarmed_strike) for unarmed strikes or [Improved Trip](feat/improved_trip) for trip attempts. In the latter case, the action provokes an attack of opportunity only from the creature you target. When an attack action provokes an attack of opportunity, the attack of opportunity is made before the provoking attack roll is made.",
			"",
			"The first time during your turn that you take an action with this subtype, you roll the attack as normal. Each subsequent attack action taken during your turn imposes a cumulative -5 penalty on the attack roll or combat maneuver check (so the second attack action has a -5 penalty on the attack roll, the third has a -10 penalty, and so on).",
			"",
			"**Complex Actions:** These actions involve intense concentration, strenuous physical manipulation of objects, or some other source of complexity. A complex action always provokes attacks of opportunity, which are made before the complex action is taken. Complex actions that occur over multiple turns (whether consecutively or not) provoke attacks of opportunity on each turn that acts are committed toward their completion.",
			"",
			"**Move Actions:** These actions involve moving through the encounter area in some way. Actions with the move subtype provoke attacks of opportunity when you attempt to either leave a square in an enemy's threatened area or stand up from a prone position in a space that has at least 1 square in a foe's threatened area. Not all actions that allow you to move have the move subtype. For example, a step is a very slow and careful movement that doesn't have this subtype, and thus doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when you take that action to leave a square in a threatened area.",
			"",
			"Actions without a Subtype: Actions without a subtype don't provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"## Two-Weapon Fighting and Flurry of Blows",
			"",
			"When you fight with a second weapon in your off hand or with a double weapon, you can make two attacks with the first attack simple action you take during your turn: one with your primary hand and another with your off hand. You take penalties on these attack rolls as listed on [Table 8-7: Two- Weapon Fighting Penalties](unknown/table_8-7__two-_weapon_fighting_penalties). Any other attack simple actions you take during your turn allow only one attack roll, using either the weapon in your primary hand or the one in your off hand.",
			"",
			"If you have the [Improved Two-Weapon Fighting](feat/improved_two-weapon_fighting) feat, you can make two attack rolls on both the first and second attack simple actions taken during your turn; both of the attacks made on the second attack action are made at a -5 penalty. Further attack simple actions taken during the same turn allow only one attack roll, using either the weapon in your primary hand or the one in your off hand.",
			"",
			"If you have the [Greater Two-Weapon Fighting](feat/greater_two-weapon_fighting) feat, you can make two attacks on each of your attack simple actions on your turn, though you take all the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting, as well as the cumulative -5 penalty per attack simple action (all attacks made as part of the same attack action have the same penalty).",
			"",
			"The [flurry of blows class feature](class/monk) works in a similar way. At 1st level, you can make an additional attack with a -2 penalty on your first attack simple action during a turn. At 8th level, you can make an additional attack on both your first and second attack simple actions during your turn. At 15th level, you can make an additional attack on each of your attack simple actions during your turn. You must, of course, take all the penalties associated with those attacks."

			"",

If you're successful, you push the foe back 5 feet. For every 5 by which your check exceeds your foe's CMD, you push that foe back 5 additional feet. You can choose to move along with the target if you have the necessary acts to do so. The foe's movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity unless you have the [Greater Bull Rush](feat/greater_bull_rush) Feat.",

			"**Disarm (Attack):** You attempt to disarm your foe. If your disarm combat maneuver check is successful, your foe drops one item of your choice that it's carrying or wielding (even if it's holding the item with two hands). If you exceed your foe's CMD by 10 or more, the foe drops two items of your choice. If you fail your combat maneuver by 10 or more, you drop any weapon you were using to disarm your foe.",
			"",
			"**Dismiss a Spell:** You dismiss the effects of a dismissible spell.",
			"",
			"**Draw or Sheathe a Weapon:** You draw or sheathe a weapon. If your base attack bonus is +0, this action provokes an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Escape a Grapple:** You attempt to escape or gain control of a grapple by attempting either an Escape Artist check or a combat maneuver check. The second time in a turn you take this action, you take a -5 penalty on the check. The third time, you take a -10 penalty on the check.",
			"",
			"**Feint (Attack):** You use Bluff to attempt a feint against an opponent. If you succeed, that opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC for the next attack you make against it this turn. If you have the [Improved Feint](feat/improved_feint) feat, this action doesn't have the attack subtype.",
			"",
			"**Handle an Animal:** You command an animal to perform a trick it knows by attempting a Handle Animal check. Some class abilities let characters attempt this as a free action.",

			"**Light a Torch with a Tindertwig or Open Flame:** You ignite a torch with a tindertwig or an open flame.",

			"",
			"**Manipulate an Item (Complex):** You grab an item that is in a backpack, pouch, pocket, or other similar container on your person; pick up an item; or move a heavy object. Sometimes, the GM might rule that manipulating an item is an advanced action and determine the number of acts that must be committed to succeed. Based on what you want to do, those actions may need to be committed consecutively.",
			"",
			"**Move (Move):** You move up to your speed. Typically you move across the land at either a walk or a sprint, but this covers other movement modes, including burrowing, flying, jumping, and swimming.",
			"",
			"**Mount or Dismount a Steed (Move):** You mount or dismount a steed. You can do this as a free action by attempting a DC 20 Ride check; failure means you provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Open or Close a Door:** You open or close a door that is within your reach (not counting expanded reach from reach weapons). You must have at least one hand free to take this action.",
			"",
			"**Overrun (Attack):** You move up to your speed, and over the course of this action you attempt to move through the space of a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you. When attempting to move through your foe's space, your foe can choose to allow you to pass through and let you continue your movement. If the foe doesn't choose to or can't let you move past, you attempt an overrun combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you move through the target's space. If your check exceeds your foe's CMD by 5 or more, you move through the target's space and the target is knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, it gains a bonus to its CMD against overrun combat maneuvers equal to +2 for each additional leg it possesses. If you fail this check, your movement stops in the space directly in front of the opponent.",
			"",
			"**Ready a Simple Action or an Advanced Action:** You ready a single simple or advanced action that you can take before the start of your next turn as a reaction. You must designate a definite trigger for that reaction (such as \"if a foe attacks me,\" \"if a foe casts a spell,\" or \"if a foe moves adjacent to me\"), and you must have enough acts left to complete the action you ready. Once you ready an action, your turn ends. If you don't take the action you readied as a reaction by the start of your next turn, you lose that reaction.",
			"",
			"**Ready or Drop a Shield:** You either strap a shield to your arm to gain its shield bonus to AC or unstrap and drop the shield. If you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can do either of these as a free action when you take the move simple action.",
			"",
			"**Search:** You use Perception to search a room for salient hidden creatures or clues, or you make a detailed search of a 10-foot-square area to detect traps, triggers, hidden objects, or footprints. When you search an area, this action has the complex subtype.",
			"",
			"**Spell Combat (Attack, Complex):** You make an attack roll with a light or one-handed melee weapon, then cast a spell on the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action. You take a -2 penalty on the melee attack, but the spell is cast regardless of whether the attack hits. If you cast the spell defensively, you can subtract your Intelligence bonus from the result of the attack roll to add the same value as a circumstance bonus on the concentration check. You must have the [spell combat class feature](class/magus) to take this action, and can take this action only once per turn. To take this action, you must have one hand free. You can't also take the following actions this turn: cast a standard-action spell or cast a 1-round-action spell.",

			"**Stand Up (Move):** You stand up from being prone.",
			"",
			"**Step:** You move 5 feet.",
			"",
			"**Sunder (Attack):** You try to sunder an item held or worn by your foe. Attempt a sunder combat maneuver check. If you succeed, you deal damage to the item normally.

			"",
			"**Trip (Attack):** You try to trip your opponent. Attempt a trip combat maneuver check against a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you.

As long as you have a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, you can draw a weapon as a free action at any point during the charge. At the end of the charge, you gain a +2 bonus on any melee attacks, bull rush combat maneuver checks, or overrun combat maneuver checks you attempt until the end of your turn, as long as those attacks or combat maneuver checks are made against the creature you designated when you charged.",
			"",
			"**Concentrate to Maintain an Active Spell (2 Acts):** You concentrate to maintain an active spell.",
			"",
			"**Continue a Grapple (2 Acts):** You continue a grapple. If you initiated the grapple, you must either take this action at the start of each subsequent turn or end the grapple as a free action.

			"**Dirty Trick (Combat; 2 Acts):** You attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check. If you're successful, the target gains one of the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, entangled, shaken, or sickened. This condition lasts for 1 round. For every 5 by which your combat maneuver check exceeds the target's CMD, the condition lasts for 1 additional round.

			"",
			"**Disable Device (Complex; At Least 3 Acts):** You attempt to unlock a lock or disable another device. For every round the action takes, you must commit 3 acts. These acts may or may not need to be consecutive based on the nature of the device. For example, acts committed to open a lock or disable a trap must nearly always be consecutive. The GM may rule that some complex devices take more than 3 acts to disable; for example, a complex arcane machine that will cause a devastating calamity in 1 minute could take 10 acts to disable, though the acts may not need to be consecutive.",

			"",
			"**Prepare a Flask of Oil as a Splash Weapon (Complex; 2 Acts):** You prepare a flask of oil with a fuse so that you can throw it as a splash weapon.",
			"",
			"**Provide First Aid, Treat a Wound, or Treat Poison (Complex; 2 Acts):** You provide first aid, treat a wound, or treat poison using the Heal skill.",
			"",
			"**Push an Animal (3 Acts):** You attempt a Handle Animal check to get an animal to perform a trick it doesn't know but is physically capable of doing, or to push the animal to its limits. If the animal has taken hit point damage, nonlethal damage, or ability score damage, the DC of this check increases by 2. Characters with animal companions, such as druids or rangers, can push their companions as simple actions instead.",
			"",
			"**Reposition (Combat; 2 Acts):** You attempt a reposition combat maneuver check against a foe that is no more than one size category larger than you. If you succeed, you force that foe to move 5 feet. For every 5 by which your check exceeds the target's Combat Maneuver Defense, you can move that target an additional 5 feet.

Theoretically, you can take as many free actions in a turn as you wish, though the GM may apply reasonable limitations on free actions. For instance, although speaking is a free action, since a round is only 6 seconds in length, your GM might stop you from spouting off a long diatribe during your turn (or between turns), and may even rule that if you are casting a rather complex spell with a verbal component, you aren't able to verbally warn your companions of some danger that you notice before they do.

If you'd prefer to keep the adjustments more tied to the game world, you can instead replace the character's lost treasure share with a magical substance that must be used to increase the power of scaling items.

This implementation works best if all or most of the characters possess scaling items, and no character possesses a far higher number than the others. This method has the advantage of hiding behind the scenes, requiring no in-game justification. Add up the percentages of all scaling items owned by all PCs. Divide this percentage by the number of PCs, and reduce the total value of treasure the party finds by that percentage before dividing it among the characters.

Price the base item according to the [normal rules for creating magic items](unknown/normal_rules_for_creating_magic_items).

However, because many scaling items have a large range of limited-use abilities, following the standard rules can result in items that are too expensive for their actual utility. Therefore, on worn items, you should typically waive the 50% increase in price for an additional power unless it's a particularly useful ability or has a strong synergy with the item's other abilities. For instance, if you create a set of gloves with a [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) effect, you wouldn't need to pay the extra cost for a higher-level ability that grants you fire resistance, but you would for an ability that grants fire resistance to all allies within 10 feet of you since that ability complements [burning hands](spell/burning_hands) so well.",

Because the price of spells varies based on the item's caster level, it's usually best to price other abilities first, then estimate the finished caster level, then price the spell at that caster level. If a spell doesn't improve significantly at higher caster levels, price it using the item's minimum caster level. If the spell becomes more powerful with level increases (as does [fireball](spell/fireball)), use the caster level of the level at which it's unlocked to determine its price. Cap a spell's caster level at the highest level that makes a significant difference, such as 10th level for [fireball](spell/fireball). Generally, if only the spell's duration changes with caster level, spells with a duration of 1 minute per level or 1 round per level should use the full caster level, but those with longer durations (10 minutes per level or more) should use the minimum caster level.",

The text remains stored in the rod until the viridian stone is pressed again. The rod can copy a text the size of its surface area: 10 inches by 12 inches. Spellbook pages can be copied into a mimetic rod, but this is only useful for saving the text to transcribe later; the caster must still pay the full price for copying the spell into a spellbook.

The size of the rod's surface area doesn't limit the size of magical trap text it can copy. When the rod reproduces the magical writing, any decisions made by the original caster are unchanged.

			"",
			"The arrays presented in this chapter allow you to quickly derive the statistics for three broad types of monsters. Each one allows for a fair amount of customization-especially through monster options-but the monster's statistics stay close to the baselines set by PC progressions and [Table 1-1 in the Bestiary](rule/step_2_target_statistics). The options roughly correspond to the combat, skill, and spell roles used for monster advancement in the normal monster creation system. Therefore, if you were to recreate a monster with the combat role (such as an ogre or vrock), you would start with the combatant array. You can choose whichever array you prefer, unless the monster is meant to mimic an NPC created with a character class from [Step 2](rule/step_2_creature_type_or_class_graft) or a template from [Step 4](rule/step_4_template_graft). The three arrays are as follows.",
			"",
			"**Combatant:** Any monster that focuses primarily on its physical power uses the combatant array. High attack bonuses, hit points, and defenses are the defining traits of this array. A combatant's skills are weak, and the majority of its options are in the combat category. Most creatures of low or no Intelligence should be combatants, as should intelligent monsters with combat training.",
			"",
			"**Expert:** A monster uses the expert array if it's focused on skills, interaction, or cunning tactics. This array provides moderate statistics in most areas, but strong skills and extensive monster options. The expert array is the ideal way to replicate skill-based NPCs such as rogues or bards. In many cases, expert monsters are more likely to attempt tricking or befriending the PCs than fight.",
			"",
			"**Spellcaster:** If a monster relies primarily on spells, it uses the spellcaster array. Though the monster's statistics are typically weak overall, it gains access to a sizable number of spells from the lists in [Step 6](rule/step_6_spells). Because this system uses benchmark numbers instead of calculating individual statistics, a monster that uses its spells primarily to increase its own abilities (so that it can become a strong melee combatant, for instance) should use the array that best matches the way it will be used in the game rather than using the spellcaster array just because it can cast magic."

			"You might create a monster that should use the statistics for a character class, either because the monster would normally be created by adding class levels to the monster or because you think the monster's abilities are similar enough to those of a character class that it would be quicker to start with the class. In this case, look ahead to the [class grafts](rule/class_grafts) and use the array required by the class you desire. Keep in mind that a monster with class levels typically has a CR equal to its class level - 1, so if you want your monster to have particular level-dependent class abilities, you'll want to use the statistics for a CR that's 1 lower than the target class level.",

			"In the simple monster creation system, you don't use the normal calculations to generate your monster's final statistics. Instead, you take the numbers directly from the array, then make a few adjustments based on grafts and monster options later along in the process. In other words, if the array says the monster's Fortitude saving throw bonus is +11, that number is its total bonus-it's assumed to already include all bonuses from Hit Dice, classes, Constitution modifier, and magic items, regardless of later adjustments.",
			"",
			"Each array consists of two tables: the first contains most of the monster's statistics and choices, and the second contains the array's options for attacks and damage values. To start creating your monster's statistics, find the table with the appropriate array and go to the row for your monster's desired CR. Record the statistics from that row according to the following guidelines.",
			"",
			"CR, AC, Saving Throws, CMD, hp, and DCs: Record these numbers as they appear on the table. A few of these might change in later stages, but there aren't any additional choices to make for these numbers during this step of the process. Note that for AC, the first number is the normal AC, the second is touch AC, and the third is flat-footed AC. For saving throws, you can swap one save with another to better suits your monster. The two DC columns are used for all the monster's abilities and spells. For any ability that isn't a spell, use the ability DC listed. For any spell the monster can cast, add the spell's level to the number from the spell DC column. Use the spell's cleric or sorcerer/ wizard level if multiple classes can cast it. If neither of those classes has the spell, use the highest spell level listed in the spell's description.",
			"",
			"**Ability Modifiers:** For this step, you'll assign the modifiers for the monster's three most important ability scores. You can use whatever criteria you like to assign the ability modifiers; each array's section gives suggestions for typical choices. All other abilities have a modifier of +0, though you can give the monster a penalty if thematically appropriate. Note that these entries are the ability modifiers, not the ability scores, since you'll primarily use them as the default modifiers for skill checks and ability checks. Write down the ability modifier assignments you've chosen.",
			"",
			"**Skills:** All skills are divided into two categories, representing those the monster has mastered and ones it's merely good at. The number with the plus before it is the skill's bonus, and the number in parentheses indicates how many skills the monster gets at that level of expertise. For instance, a master entry of -+11 (2)- means that the monster gets two skills at +11, and any other \"master skills\" that grafts provide will also be at +11. These bonuses are assumed to include the monster's ability score bonuses, ranks, feats, and racial modifiers as appropriate to get the value given here. Write down the monster's good and master bonuses, and note how many skills it has with each bonus. Because grafts can alter a monster's number of skills or bestow or deny specific skills, you'll decide on specific skills in [Step 8](unknown/step_8).",
			"",
			"**Options:** Most of a monster's abilities beyond its base statistics come from monster options. There are four categories of options: combat, magic, social, and universal. Each entry lists how many options of a given category that monster can take, with \"any\" meaning that there's no category restriction for those options. Make a note of how many options of each type the monster gets. You define the options in [Step 7](unknown/step_7).",
			"",
			"**Attacks and Damage:** The second table shows four options for a monster's attacks. Two columns show weapon-based attacks, one with a high bonus and one with a low bonus. Use the higher attack and damage values for the monster's main attack. If the monster has additional attacks that are less powerful, use the lower attack and damage values for those attacks-a creature that's primarily a ranged attacker would use high values for its longbow attacks and low values for its longsword attacks. You can mix and match these values. For example, since ranged attacks typically deal less damage, you might have a longbow attack use the high attack value but the low damage value.",
			"",
			"The remaining two columns are for natural attacks' either two attacks (two slam or claw attacks, for example) or one powerful primary attack and two weaker secondary attacks (such as a bite and two claws). At some levels, a monster might have a negative number for an attack bonus; this means that number of attacks is probably too strong for a monster of that CR. These entries are included for completeness.",
			"",
			"The number in parentheses indicates the amount of damage each attack deals. For example, an entry that reads -+10/+5 (10)- means that when the monster makes a full attack, it makes one attack at +10 and one at +5, and that each attack deals an average of 10 points of damage. An entry reading -1 at +10 (10), 2 at +5 (5)- indicates that the monster would make one attack at +10 that deals 10 points of damage and two at +5 that deal 5 points of damage each.",
			"",
			"Write down the attack bonuses and the damage for the monster's attacks. In [Step 9](rule/step_9_damage), you'll assign dice to the damage values. If your monster should have a number of attacks different from what you see here (four tentacle attacks, for example), that section includes advice for how to alter the monster's attacks using [Table 1-1](rule/step_2_target_statistics).",

			"Class grafts are more detailed than creature type grafts, ensuring that they more closely represent a PC class of the appropriate level. Each class graft is divided into the following sections.",
			"",
			"**Special Rules:** This section appears in only some entries, and describes the class's significant requirements or features.",
			"",
			"**Required Array:** You should use a specific array when you create a monster of this class. This is one instance in which a graft has a prerequisite, meant to match the feel of the class.",
			"",
			"If you want to replicate a class without using the indicated array, do so without using the class graft. For example, if you wanted to create a cleric monster with the combatant array, you could still achieve a cleric's flavor by choosing the secondary magic option in Step 7. This essentially replicates a cleric built under the standard creation system that took combat feats and pre-casts many of its spells to give itself combat bonuses.",
			"",
			"**Statistics Adjustments:** These change or replace some of the baseline numbers, skills, and options given by the monster's array. Apply the adjustments as written. Any skill listed replaces one of the choices of skills the monster gets from its array (with either a master or good bonus, as specified). If a monster gains additional skills above the normal allotment, this entry lists \"one additional master skill\" or \"one additional good skill.\" The adjustments might also specify options, which replace the allotted options the monster gets from its array.",
			"",
			"**CR Entries:** These adjustments replicate advancement by level. Apply only the highest entry to your monster: a CR 3 rogue would get the CR 3 line, but not the CR 1 line. Options gained from these entries replace options granted by the monster's array. It's possible the class graft will add more options than the monster's array allows; that's fine, and as usual you can selectively add or remove bonus options if you need to do so to make the monster function in a thematically appropriate way. See Step 7 for descriptions of these options.",
			"",
			"**Suggested Ability Modifiers:** This section lists the recommended assignments for the monster's ability score bonuses, in order from highest to lowest. For instance, the barbarian lists \"Strength, Constitution, Dexterity,\" meaning that when making a CR 1/2 barbarian, you would give it a +3 Strength modifier, a +2 Constitution modifier, and a +1 Dexterity modifier.",
			"",
			"**Suggested Options:** These entries offer suggestions for cases in which the monster's array grants additional monster options beyond those determined by the class graft. They typically mimic flexible character class options, such as barbarian rage powers or rogue talents (see [Step 7](unknown/step_7)).",

			"Options are the main way to specialize your monster. They represent feats, universal monster rules, magic items, and all the other abilities a monster has at its disposal beyond its statistics. There are a large number of monster options to choose from, especially compared to the number of choices you make during the other steps of the simple monster creation process. Some are active abilities (such as those that give the monster a special attack), others adjust statistics (such as the power attack option, which has the same purpose as the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat), and still others grant conditional modifiers (such as combat casting's bonus to concentration checks). Unless specified otherwise, saving throw DCs in this section use the Ability DC from the monster's array, modified by the monster's grafts."

			"**Source** [Pathfinder Unchained pg. 228](source/pathfinder_unchained)",
			"",
			"Look at the number of monster options you're supposed to choose based on the monster's array and grafts. You should have a list saying how many to pick of each category. When you pick an option, write down the option's name and effects. Adjust any statistics the option's entry tells you to. After you've selected all the monster options you're supposed to, look at the list carefully. Does the monster do everything it needs to do? Does it seem like it has too few or too many options? Using your best judgment, add or remove options as necessary.",
			"",
			"**Categories:** Monster options are divided into four categories: combat, magic, social, and universal.",
			"",
			"*Combat options* are the most numerous, and most monsters the PCs are meant to face in battle should have at least one combat option. These options are subdivided to make them easier to choose based on the monster's theme, though you can choose from any combat option subcategory. Decide whether the monster is primarily cunning, powerful, quick, or tough, and look in that subcategory first. These subcategories correspond roughly to physical ability scores' Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution, respectively. One additional category, monstrous, lists options that are rarely appropriate for monsters of PC races, such as energy drain or regeneration.",
			"",
			"*Magic options* benefit monsters that cast spells, and are typically useful only to those with the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal monster option. They also include some options that mimic PC class features of a magical nature. These options are divided into the creature, offensive, support, and versatile subcategories.",
			"",
			"*Social options* give a monster advantages in interactions with other creatures. These are divided into the inspiration and miscellaneous subcategories. The inspiration subcategory includes mostly effects that bolster morale or cause fear.",
			"",
			"*Universal options* can be chosen as though they were listed in any category. This means you can use a combat, magic, social, or \"any\" option to take a universal option.",
			"",
			"**\"Any\" Options:** When a graft or array tells you to choose \"any\" option, you can take an option from the combat, magic, social, or universal category.",
			"",
			"**Feats:** If you're looking to replicate a certain feat, look for its name in Table 5-7. Note that many monster options use the same names as feats but have different mechanical effects. This is intentional. The power attack option adjusts the monster's statistics once, applying an effect similar to the [Power Attack](feat/power_attack) feat, but making it simpler to use rather than having you choose each time the monster attacks. In a case like this, if you prefer to have the added complexity and flexibility, you can use the feat's rules instead.",
			"",
			"**Universal Monster Rules:** As with feats, many of these options mimic but simplify universal monster rules. Other monster rules, such as senses, can be used as-is and aren't repeated in this chapter.",
			"",
			"**Duplicate Options:** Generally speaking, you can choose an ability more than once when it makes sense and is useful. For example, you might give a monster the extra attack option twice because it fights with two weapons, one of which is a [speed](magic/enhancement/speed) weapon. Use your best judgement to determine whether it's a good idea to do so.",
			"",
			"**Damage:** Many options say to use the high or low attack or damage value from the monster's array. Use the values from the high or low weapon attack and damage columns, not the natural attack values (even if the option is more like a natural attack thematically). You can choose to use a lower value if the ability would deal too much damage otherwise.",
			"",
			"### Universal Monster Rules",
			"",
			"Some options listed in this section grant a monster the use of a universal monster rule. Often these refer to the entry in the appropriate Bestiary volume, sometimes with notes on how to simplify the ability. When a universal monster rule is gained through this system, use the ability DC from the monster's array instead of calculating the DC by the formula listed in the rule's entry in the Bestiary.",
			"",
			"If you want to give a particular universal monster rule to a monster, look for it in the lists below. Most universal monster rules that aren't appropriate for player races appear in the section of monstrous combat rules.",
			"",
			"#### Simplified Rules",
			"",
			"The following universal monster rules have been recreated as options in this system, typically to simplify them or give concrete values for numbers that aren't defined in the original universal monster rule.",
			"",
			"These rules are: [bleed](umr/bleed), [blood drain](umr/blood_drain), [breath weapon](umr/breath_weapon), [channel resistance](umr/channel_resistance), [constrict](umr/constrict), [damage reduction](umr/damage_reduction), [disease](umr/disease), [distraction](umr/distraction), [energy drain](umr/energy_drain), [engulf](umr/engulf), [fast healing](umr/fast_healing), [frightful presence](umr/frightful_presence), [immunity](umr/immunity), [incorporeal](umr/incorporeal), [natural attacks](umr/natural_attacks), [poison](umr/poison), [poisonous blood](umr/poisonous_blood), [powerful charge](umr/powerful_charge), [rake](umr/rake), [regeneration](umr/regeneration), [rend](umr/rend), [rock throwing](umr/rock_throwing), [sound mimicry](umr/sound_mimicry), [spell resistance](umr/spell_resistance), [stench](umr/stench), [telepathy](umr/telepathy), [trample](umr/trample).",
			"",
			"#### Substitutions",
			"",
			"Some universal monster rules are very similar to other combat options, but the combat options use a different name because they're meant to be easier to understand with a quick look. The following list describes these, and shows in parentheses the name of the monster option to use instead: [ability drain](umr/ability_drain) (ability damage), [all-around vision](umr/all-around_vision) (unflankable), [blood rage](umr/blood_rage) (rage), [fear](umr/fear) (fear aura/fear attack), [grab](umr/grab) (improved combat maneuver), [natural invisibility](umr/natural_invisibility) (constant invisibility), [powerful blows](umr/powerful_blows) (power attack), [pull](umr/pull) (repositioning attack), [push](umr/push) (repositioning attack), [resistance](umr/resistance) (energy resistance), [rock catching](umr/rock_catching) (rock throwing), [spell-like abilities](umr/spell-like_abilities) (either the spellcaster array or the secondary magic universal option), [summon](umr/summon) (summon allies).",
			"",
			"#### Unmodified Rules",
			"",
			"Most universal monster rules not mentioned elsewhere in this sidebar can be used as written. Unless they have a major effect on the monster's combat abilities, it's not worth counting them against the suggested number of options the monster can take. Senses, for example, are not covered in this section, and can be used as-is without costing the monster any options. Assume that weaknesses (such as [light blindness](umr/light_blindness) or vulnerabilities) also fall into this category and can be used unmodified.",
			"",
			"Other universal rules that can be used without modification, but which should be counted against the monster's number of options are [attach](umr/attach), [burn](umr/burn), [capsize](umr/capsize), [change shape](umr/change_shape), [curse of lycanthropy](umr/curse_of_lycanthropy), [fast swallow](umr/fast_swallow), [ferocity](umr/ferocity), [fortification](umr/fortification), [gaze](umr/gaze), [pounce](umr/pounce), [web](umr/web) (using the monster's CR as its Hit Dice to determine the web's hit points), [whirlwind](umr/whirlwind)."

			"**Bombs:** As a standard action, the monster creates a bomb and throws it with a range of 20 feet. Use the throw splash weapon special attack. On a direct hit, the bomb deals fire damage equal to the monster's low weapon damage, using 3d6 damage dice. Splash damage is 6 + 1/2 the monster's CR.",
			"",
			"**Challenge:** Once per day as a swift action, the monster can challenge one target within sight. The monster gains a bonus on melee damage rolls equal to its CR (minimum 1) against that creature, but takes a -2 penalty to AC against attacks made by creatures other than the target. The target remains challenged until it is killed, falls unconscious, or the combat ends. The monster can use this ability three times per day at CR 5, and at will at CR 14.",

Additionally, choose one physical ability modifier. This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks, skill checks, and ability checks that use that ability modifier.",
			"",
			"**Constant Invisibility:** Because of its natural appearance or an exterior effect, such as a cloak of invisibility, this monster is invisible at all times. If this ability is used below CR 10, it should be for monsters that aren't focused on combat.",
			"",
			"**Fast Feint:** The monster can attempt a Bluff check to feint as a move action.",

The monster doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity when using that maneuver, its CMB for that type of maneuver increases by 4, and its CMD increases by 4 against that type of maneuver. You can choose one of the monster's attack types. If you do, whenever the monster hits with an attack of that type, it can automatically attempt a combat maneuver of the type chosen with this option.",

			"",
			"**Poison:** The monster uses poison with its attacks, either through a natural weapon or by applying the poison to a particular manufactured weapon. The target of a successful attack with the chosen weapon must attempt a Fortitude save to resist the poison. The basic poison is type injury,",
			"",
			"onset 1 minute, frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes, effect 1d2 points of damage to any one ability score (chosen when the monster gains this option), cure 1 save.

			"",
			"**Repositioning Attack:** When it hits a creature of its size or smaller with a certain type of attack, the monster can immediately attempt a reposition combat maneuver check to push or pull that creature. Its CMB for this check increases by 4. The distance the monster pushes or pulls the creature can increase under certain conditions, such as if the monster has special appendages.",
			"",
			"**Sneak Attack:** When flanking or attacking a foe denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, this monster deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 CR the monster possesses. Decrease the base damage of the monster's attacks by 2 points for every 1d6 of sneak attack it has.",

			"**Team Fighter:** The monster gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls against targets that are threatened by one of the monster's allies (other than itself ). This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 CR the monster possesses.",

			"**Trap Squares:** The monster can trap any square adjacent to it as a standard action. Any creature that enters the trapped square takes an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the monster's CR of a damage type chosen by the monster while setting the trap. The trap is invisible and lasts for a number a rounds equal to the monster's CR. It can be found with a successful DC 25 Perception check and disarmed with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check.

If the target's size category is not within one size category of the lycanthrope's, this ability has no effect.",

All of these changes are fair game! Just keep an eye out for balance when you deviate from the baseline, and compensate elsewhere if necessary. The guidelines from Table: Monster Statistics by CR still apply for monsters created using this system."

			"This long-form example gives a detailed breakdown of monster creation from start to finish, resulting in a new medusa archer. This illustrates the steps of the process, and shows how to think about creating a monster using this variant system. Throughout, it compares the new medusa to the [original](monster/medusa).",
			"",
			"### Monster Concept",
			"",
			"The GM wants to create a monster much like the traditional medusa: a humanlike creature with serpents for hair and the ability to turn her enemies to stone. He also wants to make her a skilled archer and focus on that set of abilities. He wants to use the medusa at the same level that she'd normally appear, so he chooses CR 7 (and the medusa's Hit Dice are treated as 7 as well). He knows some other basic details: the medusa is a lawful evil monstrous humanoid, her size is Medium, and she has a base speed of 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Step 1:** Array",
			"",
			"This medusa should be a formidable enemy, so the GM chooses the combatant array. He fills out her statistics from the CR 7 entry on [Table 5-1](rule/combatant_array). She has AC 22, touch 13, flat-footed 16. Her saving throw bonuses are: Fortitude +8, Reflex +8, and Will +6. Her CMD is 24, and she has 93 hit points. The GM makes a note of all these statistics, and won't need to change any of them unless a later graft or option alters them.",
			"",
			"Next, the GM makes a note of the remaining values he'll be deciding on later. The monster's special abilities will have a DC of 15. He doesn't plan to give her spells, so he skips the spell DC column. Since he's already pretty sure how he wants the medusa's ability modifiers to shake out, he gives her a +6 Dexterity modifier, a +4 Constitution modifier, and a +2 Charisma modifier. Her initiative ends up being +6, matching her Dexterity modifier. He marks down that he'll later pick one master skill with a +15 modifier and two good skills with +12 modifiers. In Step 7, he'll also pick one combat option and one option from any category.",
			"",
			"The last things to record from the arrays are the medusa's attacks. He wants her to be best at ranged attacks, so he uses the high weapon attack column for a longbow attack, marking down attack bonuses of +13/+8 and noting that he'll later pick a value adding up to 22 points of damage. For her melee attacks, she uses the snakes that make up her hair, and the GM decides that she uses the low weapon attacks table since she's primarily focused on ranged attacks. He marks down a +10/+5 attack bonus that deals 16 points of damage.",
			"",
			"Her attacks and damage are significantly stronger than those of the monster in the Bestiary. The GM decides to leave them this way for now, planning to compensate by weakening some of her other abilities in later steps.",
			"",
			"**Step 2:** Creature Type or Class Graft",
			"",
			"Since the medusa is a monstrous humanoid, the GM applies the automatic traits for that creature type graft, giving her darkvision 60 feet. After toying with using the ranger class graft, he decides that doesn't really fit with his concept for the monster. Instead, he uses the monstrous humanoid graft, increasing the medusa's Reflex to +10 and Will to +8, and increasing her attack bonuses to +12/+7 for her snake hair attack and +15/+10 for the longbow. He looks at the elective adjustment of one additional good skill and decides not to give her the extra good skill.",
			"",
			"**Steps 3-6:** Skipped Steps",
			"",
			"The medusa doesn't need a subtype, isn't based on a template, is size Medium, and doesn't have spells, so the GM skips steps 3 through 6. Most monsters created using this system will skip at least one or two steps of the monster creation process.",
			"",
			"**Step 7:** Monster Options",
			"",
			"The GM is sure that he wants the medusa to have a petrifying gaze attack. Because the gaze option uses the same rules as the preexisting [universal monster rule](umr/gaze), the GM writes down a gaze with a 30-foot range that turns targets to stone permanently. He uses the ability DC from the combatant array: 15. This ability uses up the medusa's one combat option, leaving her with one option from any category. The GM adds poison to the snake bite attack, and decides that the medusa can apply it to her arrows too. Choosing the poison option gives him the base statistics of the poison plus two advantages, plus an additional two advantages since the medusa is CR 7. He ends up with a poison that is: type injury, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect 1d3 Str, cure 2 consecutive saves. This is pretty close to the poison in the Bestiary, though with a lower DC, which is what the GM wants. Though an ability such as all-around vision could be replicated by giving the medusa unflankable as a bonus monster option, the GM decides against that to help compensate for the medusa's stronger attacks.",
			"",
			"**Step 8:** Skills",
			"",
			"The medusa will have one master skill and two good skills. The GM picks Perception as the master skill instead of leaving it at its default of good, since that fits an archer. The medusa now has Perception +15. For the good skills, he wants one social skill and one physical skill that uses the medusa's Dexterity, so he gives her Intimidate +12 and Stealth +12.",
			"",
			"**Step 9:** Damage",
			"",
			"The longbow attack will deal a total of 22 points of damage, using a d8 damage die (since it's a longbow). The GM finds the 21-23 row and 1d8 column on Table 5-9: Damage Dice Values, learning that the attack should deal 1d8+18 points of damage. Thinking about it further, the GM wants to roll more damage dice, just to make the monster's damage a little more variable and sort of like the Manyshot feat. So instead, he uses 2d8+12. The melee attack will deal 16 points of damage using a d4, which turns out to be 1d4+14.",
			"",
			"### Reality Check",
			"",
			"Looking back over the monster, the GM thinks that the petrifying gaze plus the powerful attacks make the medusa too powerful. He decides that the part that seems strangest is the damage, particularly since the medusa uses a longbow and gets to deal poison with all her attacks. He decides to trim the damage down as though the medusa were 2 CR lower. The longbow attack now deals 2d8+6 points of damage, and the snake bite deals 1d4+8 points of damage.",

			"To use simplified spellcasting, find the appropriate progression table for your class (or the table for a class that normally has the same spell progression as your class) and consult the row for your caster level. The 3 highest spell levels in the row each have a listed number indicating spells per day. Prepare these spells each day as you normally would; you still gain bonus spells per day for those levels if you have a high enough ability score. The letter -P- appears in the columns of all other available spell levels (except level 0) to indicate lower-level spells that are cast using your class's spell pool.",

The level of spell doesn't matter (as long as it's one of the levels that uses your pool), so if you could cast five spells from your pool per day, it wouldn't matter if you cast five 1stlevel spells, five 2nd-level spells, or a mix of the two. A spell cast using slots from your spell pool must still be on your spell list or in your spellbook, just as it would need to be if you were preparing the spell. It also must meet any other restrictions imposed by your class or other abilities, such as restrictions on casting spells of an opposing alignment. The slots in your spell pool refresh after 8 hours of rest, and any effect that prevents you from preparing spells also prevents you from refreshing your spell pool. Your pool increases if you have a high spellcasting ability modifier, similar to how you gain bonus spells in slots you prepare.

			"When casting a spell or using a magical effect that allows a saving throw, the caster makes a spell attack roll, rolling 1d20 with a bonus equal to her spellcasting ability modifier plus the spell's level. Any bonuses that would normally make the spell more difficult to avoid (such as the Spell Focus feat) also apply. The DC of this roll is equal to 11 + the target's relevant save bonus. If the caster succeeds, treat the spell or effect as if the target had failed its save. Otherwise, treat it as if the target succeeded at its save. Just like an ordinary attack roll, a natural 1 is an automatic failure, while a natural 20 is an automatic success. This rule does not change the chances of success; it just changes who is rolling the die.",
			"",
			"For example, a wizard with an Intelligence score of 18 casts [charm person](spell/charm_person) on an orc guard. Normally, the orc would attempt a DC 15 Will saving throw (10 + 1 for a 1st-level spell + 4 for the wizard's Intelligence bonus). Since the orc's Will save modifier is -1, he has to roll a 16 to succeed, and thus will fail his save 80% of the time. Under the spell attack roll rules, rather than the orc attempting a Will save, the wizard makes a spell attack roll with a +5 bonus (the spell's DC of 15 - 10) against a DC of 10 (11 + the orc's -1 Will save modifier). The wizard has to roll at least a 5 to succeed, so he still affects his target 80% of the time.",
			"",
			"This variant puts more dice in the hands of the players. Consider running NPC spellcasters under the core rules instead, so that players can feel responsible for their own saves. It's usually easiest for the player to write down the spell attack roll bonus for each level.",
			"",
			"**Faster Variant:** Normally, a caster would roll a separate spell attack roll against each target. A GM who wants to speed up play (at the expense of making the game more prone to extremes and not matching the core rules as closely) can instead require only a single roll and apply it against the defenses of all the targets."

A character who selects this option doesn't gain feats at 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, but instead gains class features from her secondary class as described on Table 2-8: Multiclass Character Advancement. It is probably a good idea to use either this variant system or normal multiclassing, but it's possible for the two systems to be used together. In a game using both systems, a character can't take levels in the secondary class she gains from this variant.",

Though this ensures that injured characters remain useful and effective, it can feel unrealistic, and it devalues any healing that doesn't strictly prevent a knockout. Consider using the following variant to add tension and increase the strategic value of healing, but be aware that it can lead to situations that punish the side that's already behind, and that the pace of fights could drag in the late stages as two injured parties slug it out.

A single armor piece comprises the armor parts one needs to protect its corresponding area-either the arms, the legs, or the torso (including the head); a single arm or leg armor piece provides armor for both arms or both legs, respectively. A plate arm armor piece typically consists of pairs of pauldrons, gardbraces, rerebraces, vambraces, and gauntlets along with bits of chainmail and padded armor, while a chain lamellar arm armor piece consists of two chain sleeves, gauntlets, and perhaps pairs of pauldrons and couters. Both protect the arms, though they have a different number of specific parts and types of overall components.",

If a character has only one armor piece, that piece is considered the totality of her armor, and she uses the statistics of that piece as her armor. If a character is wearing more than one armor piece, she add the armor costs, armor bonuses, and weights of the armor pieces, and takes the worst maximum Dexterity bonus, arcane spell failure chance, and speed limitations from among the various armor pieces to determine the full statistics and qualities of the armor she is wearing. As long as she is wearing a single armor piece, she is considered to be wearing armor for any effects that rely on wearing armor (such as the fighter class's armor training and armor mastery).",

Wearing less than a full suit of mixed armor does not increase the wearer's arcane spell failure chance.

Each relic was once a typical magic item that played a central role in a massively important event, increasing dramatically in potency as it drew power from its shaping of fate. Relics occupy a space somewhere between normal magic items and artifacts. Unlike most magic items, relics can't be crafted. Unlike artifacts, however, they can be destroyed normally. Eventually, these extra-powerful items are misplaced, forgotten, or ignored, and their power wanes as a result-though it is not entirely lost.",

			"As she adventures, the wielder of a relic might achieve great deeds, called triumphs, tied to the item's associated cause, which she can apply to the relic to increase its power. Each volume of the War for the Crown Adventure Path indicates which deeds qualify as a triumph for the relics of old Taldor. Each PC involved in achieving a triumph can apply that triumph to up to one of her carried relics, unlocking the next set of abilities for that item.",
			"",
			"An individual relic can attain only the triumphs for which it is present, so if the PCs achieved two triumphs before finding [Koriana's Blade](magic/relic/koriana's_blade), the sword wouldn't gain the benefits listed under First Triumph until the PCs' third triumph. To be present for a triumph, a relic needs to be worn, held, or carried (as opposed to being stored in a [bag of holding](magic/wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1), for instance), and the PC carrying it must have been involved in the triumph in some way. Some triumphs improve on existing abilities, such as granting more uses of an ability per day or increasing a relic's enhancement bonus from +1 to +2. All other triumph abilities are cumulative with the item's base abilities and with each other. For example, a relic that has attained two triumphs grants both its first-triumph and second-triumph abilities along with its base abilities.",
			"",
			"**Increasing DCs:** Some effects have DCs that increase as the relic attains more triumphs; these are indicated by a note such as \"DC = 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained.\" An effect with such a DC counts neither the triumph that the effect came from nor any previous triumphs. For example, if a relic's first triumph granted an effect with a DC of 15 + 1 per additional triumph attained, that DC would be 15. When that relic attained a second triumph, the DC would increase to 16.",
			"",
			"**Fading Glory:** When the PCs discover a relic, the power of the item has faded significantly since it has gone many years without being used for its cause. In most campaigns, it's unlikely that enough time will pass for the discovered relic's power to fade again. However, if years pass without a relic being used for its cause, its triumph abilities begin to go dormant, starting at the highest level and descending from there. This can vary by item and is ultimately determined by the GM, but a good benchmark is one triumph entry lost per 1d4 years."

If there's a high chance the PCs will fail to achieve a particular triumph, you might include another triumph event fairly soon after. You can always alter future triumph events if items are looking like they'll outpace the rate of one triumph every 2 levels.

			"A wordcaster still has spell slots, just like other members of his class, but he uses them differently. Each spell slot holds a wordspell or allows a wordcaster to arrange a number of words of power into one. The level of the wordcaster's wordspell is determined by the arrangement of words. Each word of power has a level associated with it and, in some cases, restrictions on what other words can be arranged in a wordspell with it. The level of a word is also the minimum level of the spell slot that can be used to arrange that word into a wordspell.",
			"",
			"If a wordcaster belongs to a class that prepares spells, he must arrange his words of power into wordspells when he prepares his spells, deciding in advance the exact combination of words that will occupy each of his available spell slots and the wordspells that arrangement makes. If a wordcaster belongs to a class that spontaneously casts spells, such as a sorcerer, he can arrange his wordspells as he casts them.",
			"",
			"Each wordspell is made up of an arrangement of two or more words of power, including one target word, one or more effect words, and possibly a number of meta words.",
			"",
			"**Target Word:** This word determines the range of a wordspell, how the wordspell manifests, and what it can affect. If the wordspell has an area, it affects every creature in the area defined by the target word. If it has targets, it affects the specific targets described by its word. A wordspell can have only one target word.",
			"",
			"**Effect Word:** Effect words determine what effect a wordspell has when cast. They also determine the schools of the wordspell and its duration, saving throw, and spell resistance, if any. A wordspell can have more than one effect word, even ones from different schools of magic. In this case, the spell counts as both schools of magic. The maximum level of the effect words contained within a wordspell depends on the level of the spell slot used and the number of words arranged in the wordspell, as noted on Table 4-1: Effect Word Combinations. For example, a 5th-level wordspell might include one 5th-level effect word, two 3rd-level effect words, or three 2nd-level effect words. Alternatively, the wordspell might include one 4th-level effect word and one 2nd-level effect word, or one 3rd level effect word and two 1st-level effect words.",

			"",
			"**Meta Word:** This word modifies the wordspell in some way, often by increasing either its duration, range, or components. It can also boost certain target or effect words, changing the wordspell's overall effect. Unlike with other words, a wordcaster can only use meta words a number of times per day equal to half his caster level in his wordcasting class (minimum 1). A wordspell does not need to contain a meta word.",

			"A wordspell can have multiple meta words arranged within it so long as each target word and each effect word are modified by only one meta word apiece.

			"Casting a wordspell is similar to casting a standard spell. Each wordspell is assumed to have a material, somatic, and verbal component. Divine casters using this system must provide a divine focus instead of a material component. Unless otherwise noted, the material component can easily be found in a spell component pouch.",
			"",

			"Casting a wordspell is almost exactly the same as casting an ordinary spell. A wordspell can be dispelled and disrupted, and casting one provokes attacks of opportunity, just like any other spell, unless the wordcaster casts the wordspell on the defensive, which also requires a concentration check as normal.",
			"",
			"There are two major differences to casting a wordspell: counterspelling and schools.",
			"",
			"**Counterspelling Wordspells:** If a wordcaster is attempting to counter another wordspell, she can make a Spellcraft skill check as normal to identify the wordspell as it is being cast and then cast an identical wordspell to counter it. This means that the opposing wordcaster must know all of the effect words of the wordspell and either have an identical wordspell prepared or have an available spell slot of an equal or higher level. If the wordspell contains multiple effect words, but the opposing caster only knows one of the words (or only has a wordspell with one of the effect words prepared), that caster can still attempt to counter the wordspell, but this functions as if using [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) and does not come with the guarantee of success. The opposing caster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell. She must still expend a spell of the same or higher level containing at least one word of the wordspell to be countered.",
			"",
			"If a wordcaster is attempting to counter the spell of a normal spellcaster, she must make a Spellcraft skill check to identify the school of the spell being cast. She can then counter that spell using any wordspell so long as it is of an equal or higher level than the spell being cast and contains at least one effect word of the same school as the spell. This works like a [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) counterspell attempt, and the wordcaster must make a dispel check to counter the spell. If a spellcaster attempts to counter a wordspell, she must use a spell of an equal or higher level that is of the same school as one or more of the effect words in the wordspell being cast. This too works like a dispel magic counterspell attempt, and the spellcaster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell.",
			"",
			"**Wordspell Schools:** If a wordspell has more than one effect word, it can belong to more than one school, although it never benefits from effects based on school (such as Spell Focus) more than once. It can take penalties based on school more than once; for example, if a target has a bonus on saving throws against necromancy and illusion spells, that character would add both bonuses on the saving throw if the wordspell is of both schools.",
			"",
			"**Wordspell Saving Throws:** The type of saving throw for a wordspell is determined by the highest-level effect word used that allows a saving throw. If the save is successful, it applies to both effect words, but the result for each word can vary based on the individual word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words. The save DC is equal to 10 + the wordspell's level (not the effect word's level) + the wordcaster's spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, and rangers; and Charisma for bards, paladins, and sorcerers). For example, if a 5th-level wordspell contains a 2nd-level effect word that allows a Reflex save for half and a 4th-level effect word that allows a Will save to negate, targets of the wordspell make a Will save with a DC of 15 + the caster's ability score modifier. If the save is successful, the target takes half the normal effect from the 2nd-level word and negates the 4th-level word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words.",
			"",
			"**Wordspells and Spell Resistance:** If the wordspell uses more than one effect word, and any of those words allow spell resistance, the resistance applies to all of the effect words of the wordspell. A wordspell only ignores spell resistance if all effect words ignore spell resistance.",
			"",
			"**Multiple Effect Words and Damage:** If more than one effect word causes the wordspell to deal damage, the total number of dice of damage the wordspell can deal can be no greater than the wordspell's caster level. The caster can decide which dice belong to which effect word, in any combination, so long as the total number does not exceed his wordcaster level and the number of dice allocated to a specific effect word does not exceed its maximum.",
			"",
			"**Multiple Effect Words and Duration:** If a wordspell has more than one effect word, the shortest of all the effect words' durations is used for all of the effect words."

The target receives either a Fortitude save or a Reflex save, chosen by the caster. If the save is successful, the target takes half the cold damage, takes no negative levels, and is not entangled. A sorcerer, witch, or wizard can boost the target word to make this spell affect multiple targets, but doing so increases the spell's overall level to 9th.",
			"",
			"**Selected Alignment Shield Enhance Form Grave Bane (cleric 6):** This wordspell grants the target a number of bonuses. First, it grants the target a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws when it is attacked by creatures of one alignment type (chosen by the wordcaster). The wordspell also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen by the wordcaster). Finally, the wordspell grants an additional +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against death spells and death magic effects; the subject cannot gain negative levels while this wordspell is in effect, and the target is automatically stabilized if brought below 0 hit points. All of these effects last for 1 round per level, as that is the duration of the effect word with the shortest duration. Note that alignment shield is only 1st level, and could be replaced with a 2nd-level effect word without changing the overall level of the spell."

			"Words of power represent a primal form of magic used in ages past. As such, use of the words of power system is rare these days, and its practitioners tend to be masters of esoteric lore. Words of power constitute a root system, from which all modern magic descends. Although powerful, this system is more primitive in some ways than modern magic. Flexible, but lacking the refinement of modern spells, this system allows spellcasters to shape magic in ways they never could before, while simultaneously preventing them from producing the same sort of incredibly specific effects that ordinary spellcasters master. It is not surprising that most magical institutions and centers for learning treat words of power as an archaic art, to be studied along with other historical matters, but not actually practiced. Those who delve into the lore of words of power often find themselves lost in an ancient art that they alone might now know. There is power there, but each wordcaster must find it alone."

Rather, hit points suggest that the fighter has undergone more training, and while he may have improved his ability to deal with wounds to a small degree, the hit points gained at higher levels reflect less his capacity for physical punishment and more his skill at avoiding hits, his ability to dodge and twist and turn. Each loss of hit points, in this case, suggests that he is becoming progressively less nimble over the course of combat-in other words, that the decreasing hit points are a marker for his overall endurance and condition. It's not quite as satisfying, however, to roll a critical hit and then tell a player that his opponent ducked out of the way, but that the sword's slash made the enemy a little less lucky.",

Healing Spells and Effects: When casting healing spells or using an ability with a healing effect (such as channeling holy energy on living creatures or the paladin's lay on hands ability), the creature casting the spell or using the effect must choose whether it wants to heal wound points or vigor points. The creature decides this before casting the spell or using the ability.
