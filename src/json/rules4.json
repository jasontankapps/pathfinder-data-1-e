			"",
			"**Storyteller:** First and foremost, the Game Master is a storyteller. He presents the world and its characters to the players of the game, and it is through the GM that the players interact with them. The Game Master must be able to craft stories and to translate them into a verbal medium.",

			"**Entertainer:** A Game Master must also be a master at improvisation. He has to be ready to handle anything that his players want to do, to resolve situations and issue rulings quickly enough to keep the pace of the game going at an entertaining clip. A Game Master is on stage, and his players are his audience.",
			"",
			"**Judge:** The Game Master must be the arbiter of everything that occurs in the game. All rule books, including this one, are his tools, but his word is the law. He must not antagonize the players or work to impede their ability to enjoy the game, yet neither should he favor them and coddle them. He should be impartial, fair, and consistent in his administration of the rules.",
			"",
			"**Inventor:** The Game Master's job does not end when the game session does. He must be an inventor as well. By creating NPCs, plots, magic items, spells, worlds, deities, monsters, and everything else, he propels his game's evolution forward, constantly elevating his campaign into something greater.",
			"",
			"**Player:** Just because he's playing dozens of characters during the course of a session doesn't make him any less a player than the others who sit at the table."

			"Before you run a game, you need to know what kind of game you'll be running. Whether you write out the plans for the coming session in a dozen notebooks, scribble down ideas and key NPC stat blocks on a bunch of sticky notes or your computer, or just have a vague idea of a plot and a few names in your head, you'll need to prepare parts of your adventure before the game begins. Some GMs enjoy the challenge of presenting a \"sandbox\" for the players to explore at their whim, but even then you need to know what kind of things are in that sandbox for the PCs to encounter. And as a general rule, everything you can prepare before the game begins will save you time making decisions during the game. Even more important, preparation beforehand allows you to maintain consistency-few things ruin the suspension of disbelief more for a group of discerning players than having the Game Master call the local innkeeper \"Radimus\" one session and \"Penelope\" the next. Preparing for your adventure beforehand can help you maintain innkeeper gender identities and so much more!",
			"",
			"Of course, the backbone of any campaign is the adventures that comprise it, be they an intricately connected series of plots and storylines or an open-ended sandbox of possibility. But where do these adventures come from? There are, essentially, two sources for adventures. You can build your own from scratch, or you can run a published adventure. Both options have different pros and cons, and you certainly don't have to limit yourself to only one choice for the duration of a campaign."

As a Game Master, you're going to be spending a lot of time as it is preparing for games-and when you don't have time to come up with an adventure, a published adventure can be a godsend. By studying how published adventures are put together, you can hone your own adventure-creating skills. And by running a published adventure for your group, you leave the details of invention and creation to the adventure writer, giving you time to focus on the game play itself.",

			"The most important thing to remember when using a published adventure, though, is that the writer of the adventure doesn't know your group the way you know your group. If you know your players are particularly paranoid and assume all helpful NPCs are out to get them, then a published adventure about a kindly cleric who's actually a shapechanged demon probably won't work well for your group. Feel free to change published adventures as you see fit, either while you're reading them or during play. If, for example, one of your players has written into his character's backstory that his father was killed by an orc warlord and he became an adventurer to someday get revenge on that orc, go ahead and change the hobgoblin warlord in the adventure into an orc. Adapting adventures to your group and your play style in this manner is an important part of running published adventures, since it customizes the experience to your group and makes it all the more enjoyable.",

			"There are countless ways to build an adventure. The classic method is to simply write everything out beforehand. While this does get everything you need to know about the adventure down on paper, it's an awful lot of work. If you're the only person who'll ever be running the adventure, it's okay to simply outline the plot, draw a map of the adventure site, create encounters and stat blocks, and have at it. An adventure need not look like much more than a shopping list-you only really need to write down what you can't easily remember come game time.",
			"",
			"One important tip to remember about adventure writing-you're not writing a story. The main characters of the adventure should be the players, and they're missing from the tale when you prepare the adventure. Instead, think of the adventure as an outline for a script. You can have an idea in your head of how things will work out, but if you avoid making assumptions about what your characters will do in the adventure and instead just focus on creating the building blocks of the adventure (such as room descriptions, NPC motivations, stat blocks, and the like), you'll be much more capable of reacting to the unexpected when the PCs do their thing.",

The Pathfinder RPG Bestiary provides more than 300 pre-made monster stat blocks for use in adventures, and that's just the beginning-you can use stat blocks from other monster bestiaries or adventures just as easily in your game. One good trick is to copy a stat block onto a 3x5 card or into a small document you can easily bring up on your computer during the game-you can keep these cards and documents forever to reuse them as needed.",

			"The heart of any adventure is its encounters. An encounter is any event that puts a specific problem before the PCs that they must solve. Most encounters present combat with monsters or hostile NPCs, but there are many other types-a trapped corridor, a political interaction with a suspicious king, a dangerous passage over a rickety rope bridge, an awkward argument with a friendly NPC who suspects a PC has betrayed him, or anything that adds drama to the game. Brain-teasing puzzles, roleplaying challenges, and skill checks are all classic methods for resolving encounters, but the most complex encounters to build are the most common ones-combat encounters.",
			"",
			"When designing a combat encounter, you first decide what level of challenge you want your PCs to face, then follow the steps outlined below.",
			"",
			"**Step 1-Determine APL:** Determine the average level of your player characters-this is their Average Party Level (APL for short). You should round this value to the nearest whole number (this is one of the few exceptions to the round down rule). Note that these encounter creation guidelines assume a group of four or five PCs. If your group contains six or more players, add one to their average level. If your group contains three or fewer players, subtract one from their average level. For example, if your group consists of six players, two of which are 4th level and four of which are 5th level, their APL is 6th (28 total levels, divided by six players, rounding up, and adding one to the final result).",
			"",
			"**Step 2-Determine CR:** Challenge Rating (or CR) is a convenient number used to indicate the relative danger presented by a monster, trap, hazard, or other encounter- the higher the CR, the more dangerous the encounter. Refer to Table 12-1 to determine the Challenge Rating your group should face, depending on the difficulty of the challenge you want and the group's APL.",

			"| Challenging | APL +1 |",

			"| Epic | APL +3 |",
			"",
			"**Step 3-Build the Encounter:** Determine the total XP award for the encounter by looking it up by its CR on Table 12-2. This gives you an \"XP budget\" for the encounter. Every creature, trap, and hazard is worth an amount of XP determined by its CR, as noted on Table 12-2. To build your encounter, simply add creatures, traps, and hazards whose combined XP does not exceed the total XP budget for your encounter. It's easiest to add the highest CR challenges to the encounter first, filling out the remaining total with lesser challenges. For example, let's say you want your group of six 8th-level PCs to face a challenging encounter against a group of gargoyles (each CR 4) and their stone giant boss (CR 8). The PCs have an APL of 9, and table 12-1 tells you that a challenging encounter for your APL 9 group is a CR 10 encounter-worth 9,600 XP according to Table 12-2. At CR 8, the stone giant is worth 4,800 XP, leaving you with another 4,800 points in your XP budget for the gargoyles. Gargoyles are CR 4 each, and thus worth 1,200 XP apiece, meaning that the encounter can support four gargoyles in its XP budget. You could further refine the encounter by including only three gargoyles, leaving you with 1,200 XP to spend on a trio of Small earth elemental servants (at CR 1, each is worth 400 XP) to further aid the stone giant.",

			"",
			"**NPC Gear Adjustments:** You can significantly increase or decrease the power level of an NPC with class levels by adjusting the NPC's gear. The combined value of an NPC's gear is given in on [Table 14-9](rule/step_6_gear). A classed NPC encountered with no gear should have his CR reduced by 1 (provided that loss of gear actually hampers the NPC), while a classed NPC that instead has gear equivalent to that of a PC (as listed on [Table 12-4](rule/placing_treasure)) has a CR of 1 higher than his actual CR. Be careful awarding NPCs this extra gear, though-especially at high levels, where you can blow out your entire adventure's treasure budget in one fell swoop!"

			"While it's often enough to simply tell your players they've found 5,000 gp in gems and 10,000 gp in jewelry, it's generally more interesting to give details. Giving treasure a personality can not only help the verisimilitude of your game, but can sometimes trigger new adventures. The information on the following pages can help you randomly determine types of additional treasure- suggested values are given for many of the objects, but feel free to assign values to the objects as you see fit. It's easiest to place the expensive items first-if you wish, you can even randomly roll magic items to determine what sort of items are present in the hoard. Once they've consumed a sizable portion of the hoard's value, the remainder can simply be loose coins or nonmagical treasure with values arbitrarily assigned as you see fit.",
			"",
			"**Coins:** Coins in a treasure hoard can consist of copper, silver, gold, and platinum pieces-silver and gold are the most common, but you can divide the coinage as you wish.",
			"",
			"**Gems:** Although you can assign any value to a gemstone, some are inherently more valuable than others. Use the value categories below (and their associated gemstones) as guidelines when assigning values to gemstones.",
			"",
			"**Low-Quality Gems (10 gp):** agates; azurite; blue quartz; hematite; lapis lazuli; malachite; obsidian; rhodochrosite; tigereye; turquoise; freshwater (irregular) pearl",
			"",
			"**Semi-Precious Gems (50 gp):** bloodstone; carnelian; chalcedony; chrysoprase; citrine; jasper; moonstone; onyx; peridot; rock crystal (clear quartz); sard; sardonyx; rose, smoky, or star rose quartz; zircon",
			"",
			"**Medium Quality Gemstones (100 gp):** amber; amethyst; chrysoberyl; coral; red or brown-green garnet; jade; jet; white, golden, pink, or silver pearl; red, red-brown, or deep green spinel; tourmaline",
			"",
			"**High Quality Gemstones (500 gp):** alexandrite; aquamarine; violet garnet; black pearl; deep blue spinel; golden yellow topaz",
			"",
			"**Jewels (1,000 gp):** emerald; white, black, or fire opal; blue sapphire; fiery yellow or rich purple corundum; blue or black star sapphire",
			"",
			"**Grand Jewels (5,000 gp or more):** clearest bright green emerald; diamond; jacinth; ruby",
			"",
			"**Nonmagical Treasures:** This expansive category includes jewelry, fine clothing, trade goods, alchemical items, masterwork objects, and more. Unlike gemstones, many of these objects have set values, but you can always increase an object's value by having it be bejeweled or of particularly fine craftsmanship. This increase in cost doesn't grant additional abilities-a gem-encrusted masterwork cold iron scimitar worth 40,000 gp functions the same as a typical masterwork cold iron scimitar worth the base price of 330 gp. Listed below are numerous examples of several types of nonmagical treasures, along with typical values.",
			"",
			"**Fine Artwork (100 gp or more):** Although some artwork is composed of precious materials, the value of most paintings, sculptures, works of literature, fine clothing, and the like come from their skill and craftsmanship. Artwork is often bulky or cumbersome to move and fragile to boot, making salvage an adventure in and of itself.",
			"",
			"**Jewelry, Minor (50 gp):** This category includes relatively small pieces of jewelry crafted from materials like brass, bronze, copper, ivory, or even exotic woods, sometimes set with tiny or flawed low-quality gems. Minor jewelry includes rings, bracelets, and earrings.",
			"",
			"**Jewelry, Normal (100-500 gp):** Most jewelry is made of silver, gold, jade, or coral, often ornamented with semi-precious or even medium-quality gemstones. Normal jewelry includes all types of minor jewelry plus armbands, necklaces, and brooches.",
			"",
			"**Jewelry, Precious (500 gp or more):** Truly precious jewelry is crafted from gold, mithral, platinum, or similar rare metals. Such objects include normal jewelry types plus crowns, scepters, pendants, and other large items.",
			"",
			"**Masterwork Tools (100-300 gp):** This category includes masterwork weapons, armor, and skill kits.",
			"",
			"**Mundane Gear (up to 1,000 gp):** There are many valuable items of mundane or alchemical nature that can be utilized as treasure. Most of the alchemical items are portable and valuable, but other objects like locks, holy symbols, spyglasses, fine wine, or fine clothing work well as interesting bits of treasure. Trade goods can even serve as treasure-10 pounds of saffron, for example, is worth 150 gp.",
			"",
			"**Treasure Maps and Other Intelligence (variable):** Items like treasure maps, deeds to ships and homes, lists of informants or guard rosters, passwords, and the like can also make fun items of treasure-you can set the value of such items at any amount you wish, and often they can serve double-duty as adventure seeds.",
			"",
			"**Magic Items:** Of course, the discovery of a magic item is the true prize for any adventurer. You should take care with the placement of magic items in a hoard- it's generally more satisfying for many players to find a magic item rather than purchase it, so there's no crime in placing items that happen to be those your players can use!",
			"",
			"Although you should generally place items with careful consideration of their likely effects on your campaign, it can be fun and save time to generate magic items in a treasure hoard randomly. You can \"purchase\" random die rolls of magic items for a treasure hoard at the following prices, subtracting the indicated amount from your treasure budget and then rolling on the appropriate column on [Table 15-2](rule/purchasing_magic_items) to determine what item is in the treasure hoard. Take care with this approach, though! It's easy, through the luck (or unluck) of the dice to bloat your game with too much treasure or deprive it of the same. Random magic item placement should always be tempered with good common sense by the GM.",

			"Your job as Game Master begins well before the game session does. Your most important duty before a game is, of course, to prepare for that game. This means reading up on the adventure you'll be running (or perhaps even designing the adventure), preparing any props or handouts you might need to give the PCs, prepping the play area for guests, and so on. In the days leading up to the game, you should resolve any out-of-game issues that your players have-email is a great way to do this, since it creates its own written record you can use to add to your campaign journal. This includes helping players level up their characters; answering questions they may have about using noncore rules and supplements for spells, feats, and the like; and providing them with answers to questions they have about the game world.",
			"",
			"For example, say one of your PCs is searching for his missing sister, who was abducted years ago by a thieves' guild. You can drop in clues about this sister in the game, but between games, the PC might want to spend a few days investigating a lead in the local underworld or at the City Hall of Records. Personal quests like these are a great way for a player to build his character's history and personality, but they can get in the way of gaming when other players are at the table. If you can't afford to spend one-on-one time with players, handling these side-quests via email is a great way to take care of the situation.",
			"",
			"You should also ensure that all of the players can make the game, and if not all of them can, decide if the game should be canceled or not. There are few things more frustrating than realizing that half your group can't play, especially if some of the players had to drive a long way to reach the game. If a player is absent, decide what happens to his PC. Can someone else play him? Does he gain experience and treasure as usual?",
			"",
			"Make sure that accommodations are met. If your game session's going to last a long time, think about where folks can go for lunch or dinner-if you're planning on providing food, make sure it's ready to go before the game begins. Many tables organize responsibilities among the players-if a GM hosts the game at his house, the players might split up the task of providing drinks, snacks, or meals. Try to use common sense here-while it's tempting to load up with potato chips and soda pop, gaming is no excuse for poor health! Of course, if your home is not the hosting site for the game, that doesn't let you off the hook. You as GM are the organizing force for the gathering-you're technically throwing the party, and it's your responsibility to see that your players have a comfortable, enjoyable place to game, otherwise the game itself will suffer."

			"The bulk of this book provides the rules you need to adjudicate the game and run things, but there are many other problems and events that can come up that require you to think quickly before they become disruptive. Listed here are several of the more common speed bumps and problems that you'll invariably be called upon to handle during the game.",
			"",
			"**Cheating and Fudging:** We all know that cheating is bad. But sometimes, as a GM, you might find yourself in a situation where cheating might improve the game. We prefer to call this \"fudging\" rather than cheating, and while you should try to avoid it when you can, you are the law in your world, and you shouldn't feel bound by the dice. A GM should be impartial and fair, and in theory, that's what random dice results help support. Some players have trouble putting trust in their GM, but dice offer something that's irrefutable and truly non-partisan (as long as the dice aren't doctored or loaded, of course). Still, it's no good if a single roll of the dice would result in a premature end to your campaign, or a character's death when they did everything right.",
			"",
			"Likewise, don't feel bound to the predetermined plot of an encounter or the rules as written. Feel free to adjust the results or interpret things creatively-especially in cases where you as the GM made a poor assumption to begin with. For example, you might design an encounter against a band of werewolves, only to realize too late that none of the PCs have silver weapons and therefore can't hurt them. In this case, it's okay to cheat and say that these werewolves are hurt by normal weapons, or to have the town guard (armed with silver arrows) show up at the last minute to save the PCs. As long as you can keep such developments to a minimum, these on-thespot adjustments can even enhance the game-so the town guard saved the PCs, but now that they have, it can give you leverage over the PCs to send them on their next quest as repayment to the guards!",
			"",
			"**Divine Intervention:** The literary term for it is deus ex machina-\"god from the machine.\" This is what happens in a story when a plot device manifests in an unexpected (and usually unsatisfying) way to resolve a story element, typically in a way that renders the actions of the main characters meaningless. Even great authors use deus ex machina to resolve stories now and then, so don't be afraid to use it in your game if things are looking grim. The town guard rushing in to save the PCs from the werewolves in the previous paragraph is an excellent example of deus ex machina, but so is the old classic of \"divine intervention.\" In this case, the PCs are faced with an impossible situation and you, as the GM, change the situation so that they can now achieve their goals, perhaps after a PC begs for aid from his deity.",
			"",
			"You can quantify divine interventions, if you wish, at the start of a campaign. Tell every player that they get a fixed number of interventions during the campaign (it's often best to limit this to just one such intervention). Thereafter, the PC can use this divine intervention to save himself or the party, perhaps by preventing an effect that would otherwise cause a character's death, or to suddenly manifest an escape from a deathtrap. You, as the GM, have full power over how the intervention resolves, of course, so players won't be able to use divine intervention to bypass plot elements you know they can handle-if a player tries this, simply tell him that his request for intervention is denied and that he can save his intervention for when it's truly needed.",
			"",
			"**GM Fiat:** The GM is the law of the game. His reading of the rules should be respected and adhered to. It's easy to get hung up on complicated aspects of the game during play, but the game is never enhanced by long, drawn-out arguments over these complications between players and GM. When complications involving rules interpretations occur, listen to the player and make the decision as quickly as you can on how to resolve the situation. If the rule in question isn't one you're familiar with, you can go with the player's interpretation but with the knowledge that after the game you'll read up on the rules and, with the next session, will have an official ruling in play. Alternatively, you can simply rule that something works in a way that helps the story move on, despite the most logical or impassioned arguments from the players. Even then, you owe it to your players to spend time after the game researching the rule to make sure your ruling was fair- and if not, make amends the next game as necessary.",
			"",
			"One handy rule to keep under your belt is the Fiat Rule-simply grant a player a +2 or a -2 bonus or penalty to a die roll if no one at the table is precisely sure how a situation might be handled by the rules. For example, a character who attempts to trip an iron golem in a room where the floor is magnetized could gain a +2 bonus on his attempt at your discretion, since the magnetic pull exerted by the floor helps pull the golem down.",
			"",
			"**Handling PC Death:** Eventually, through bad luck or bad tactics, a player character is going to die in your game. Other events, such as petrification, paralysis, sleep, and stunning can have a similar effect on the game as PC death, and the following advice should apply to those effects as well.",
			"",
			"When a PC dies, his player no longer has any input into the game (unless he has a cohort or other allied NPC he can start playing). That player has to sit at the table quietly, watching and waiting while everyone else continues to have fun with the game. In some cases, the effect is only temporary, with another player able to step in to restore the PC to life (or cure his petrification, remove his paralysis, or whatever), but nevertheless, when a player stops playing the game because his character's been removed from the action, you as a GM have a problem on your hands.",
			"",
			"When such an event occurs, keep going with the game; try to resolve the current conflict or combat as quickly as possible so that the players can move on to addressing the problem of their dead ally. If there's no way to restore the dead PC to life and the party needs to retreat to the city to pay for a resurrection, don't delay that event by forcing the PCs to endure additional wandering monsters; just gloss over the return to civilization as best you can so you can get the unlucky player back into the game as quickly as you can. A PC death is often a great time to end the session, in fact, since you can then handle the resurrection details out of game via email.",
			"",
			"If the player of a dead character prefers instead to move on to a new character, let him create his new character at the table. In this case, that player need not sit around bored-the act of creating a new character is involving enough that you can continue to run the game for the surviving PCs, after all. Once the player's new character is done, let the other players take a 5 or 10 minute break while you step aside to talk to the player and learn about his new character, and to work with the player on a way to introduce the new character into the game as quickly and seamlessly as possible.",
			"",
			"One other thing that PC death can do is bloat surviving player treasure. If your group simply splits up the dead PC's gear or sells it, the surviving players can become obscenely over-geared for their level. If this doesn't bother you, you should at least work to ensure that the new PC has gear equal in power to that now possessed by the rest of the party. It's usually a much easier solution to simply assume that the old PC's gear goes away, either being buried with his body or sent on to his surviving kin. One pretty handy way to solve the situation is to introduce the player's new character as a prisoner that the PCs rescue, and to have the old PC's gear be given to the new PC to equip him for the remainder of the adventure. Of course, this isn't always a graceful solution, but it can be a good one to keep treasure levels under control until the new PC can sell off parts of his old character's gear to purchase new gear. In this situation, consider letting the PC get full resale value for his gear, since you don't want to penalize him for losing a character by saddling him with half the gear he used to have.",
			"",
			"**Rolling Dice:** Some GMs prefer to roll all of their dice in front of the players, letting the results fall where they may. Others prefer to make all rolls behind a screen, hiding the results from the PCs so that, if they need to, they can fudge the dice results to make the game do what they want. Neither way is the \"correct\" way; choose whichever you wish, or even mix and match as feels right for you.",
			"",
			"The only time you should not reveal the results of a die roll to the player character is when knowledge of the roll's result would give the player knowledge he shouldn't have. A good example of this is saving throws against effects that the player shouldn't necessarily realize his character has been exposed to (such as a disease or a subtle, long-acting poison).",
			"",
			"**Troublesome Players:** Play the game long enough and eventually you'll find yourself with a troublemaking player-it's just an unfortunate fact of any pastime that involves multiple people interacting in a team-oriented event. To a certain extent, you can rely on other players to help mediate problems with a troublemaker, but sometimes you'll need to step in and ask the player in question to cease his inappropriate behavior. Don't be afraid to ask the troublemaker to leave the game session if he won't correct his behavior after a polite but firm request. If tempers are running hot among multiple players, don't hesitate to call the game session early and break up, giving the players time to cool down and get over the event.",
			"",
			"Campaign Journal",
			"",
			"All Game Masters should keep a campaign journal. This can be a simple folder containing stacks of paper, a three-ring binder, a PDA, a computer, a tablet, a notebook, or anything else that you can keep notes in. Use this journal to record your thoughts and ideas related to the game as they happen, before, during, and after the game session. As you continue to run campaigns, you'll doubtless need to expand your journal. Periodically, you should back up your journal, perhaps by copying the contents to a computer and saving them to a DVD, or maybe just by photocopying the contents and stashing the copy in a safe place. Nothing's more frustrating than losing 3 years of campaign notes due to a crashed hard drive or a natural disaster!",

			"So now you have an adventure or two ready for your players to experience. While you can certainly keep these adventures as separate entities, and perhaps even have your players make new characters each time you start a new adventure, the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game assumes that your players will keep their same characters as they go from adventure to adventure, growing more powerful as they accumulate experience and treasure.",
			"",
			"So, what happens between adventures? What is the world that those adventures take place in? Who lives there, and what do NPCs who don't take part in the adventures do? The answers to these questions and more comprise your world, or setting, and the specific progression of adventures your PCs undertake in this setting is known as a campaign.",
			"",
			"Many published campaign settings exist-the Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting is the assumed setting for most games that use the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules, but it is by no means the only one. Dozens of publishers offer intriguing and detailed settings to choose from-you can even use settings from games that use rules quite different than those presented in this book, or settings that are inspired by or lifted directly from a favorite series of books or movies. But for some, the most rewarding part of being a Game Master is the act of creating your own campaign setting and running it for your players.",
			"",
			"The act of creating a campaign is no less daunting than creating a world. It can quickly become overwhelming, especially when you start to consider all of the areas you'll need to become an expert at. If your world has multiple moons, how does that affect tides? If you choose a specific shape for your main continent, what does that do to trade winds? Where do the deserts go, and where do the swamps go? How many rivers is too many? What impact would a technologically advanced nation of warriors have on the neighboring shamanistic barbarians? Does your world have chocolate and coffee and avocados? What's the tallest mountain in your world, and why is it the tallest? Are there salmon and trout in your world, and if there's not, what do the bears eat instead? If you have a nation modeled on ancient Japan, does that mean you need to learn Japanese in order to name NPCs who live there? Is there gunpowder in your world, and if not, why not? Is the world's core molten? If it's not, how would that impact your world's magnetosphere-would there still be a north pole? How much does a longsword weigh if your campaign world is half the size of Earth? What happens if your campaign world is shaped like a ring?",
			"",
			"For these reasons, it's generally best to assume an Earthlike baseline for your first campaign world. Another handy tip is to avoid detailing everything at once. Staying just one step ahead of your players is often all you need to do-if you know that the first adventure they'll be going on is an exploration of an abandoned fort, don't worry about detailing anything but the surrounding 5-mile area, along with, perhaps, a small village for them to start the adventure in. If you know that the second adventure's going to be in a haunted mine in the mountains, you then have as long as it takes the PCs to explore that abandoned fort to detail the area between your first village and the badlands to the east where the mine's located. By creating only what you need to run the next few games, you slowly but surely build a larger whole, while at the same time maintaining your sanity.",
			"",
			"Yet still, the lure of building an entire campaign setting is great. In a lot of ways, creating your own world is like an entirely different game in and of itself-a Game Master thus gets to play the game more often than his players, since when the actual session isn't going, the GM gets to design cities and evil temples and nations and dungeons and monsters to his heart's content. The Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide provides a wealth of advanced advice and tools you can use to build your campaign world, but the remainder of this chapter covers a number of different topics to aid you. These topics barely scratch the surface of the implications and ideas you'll be facing when creating your own campaign world, but they can get you started."

Yet what about things like food? Rent? Taxes? Bribes? Idle purchases? You can certainly handle these minor expenditures in detail during play, but tracking every time a PC pays for a room, buys water, or pays a gate tax can swiftly become obnoxious and tiresome. If you're not really into tracking these minor costs of living, you can choose to simply ignore these small payments. A more realistic and easier-to-use method is to have PCs pay a recurring cost of living tax.

The Pathfinder RPG Bestiary has many non-standard races to choose from, but you should note that most of these are significantly more powerful than those presented as common. Any race that grants racial Hit Dice is probably too potent a choice for most campaigns. As a general guideline, you should advise your players to choose races of roughly equal power, using a creature's racial HD (not its CR) as a general guideline. Characters who wish instead to play standard races should be allowed to start at higher level, so that their total HD match the highest HD held by a non-standard race in the party.",

			"In the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, 20th level represents the top end of power most mortals can hope to achieve, yet this certainly doesn't mean that your campaign needs to go all the way to 20th level. If you aren't running an open-ended campaign where the PCs set the pace and the goals, you should pick a level at which you wish the campaign's story arc to end. Talk this over with your players to make sure you're picking a level range that they're comfortable with as well. Note that you can also extend or shorten the length of a campaign by selecting a slow or fast XP progression. If you choose to run a campaign with a level cap of lower than 20th, consider placing your new level cap at a point where it feels like the last level achievable is something worthy. Oddnumbered levels are generally better than even-numbered ones, since most spellcasters achieve a new level of spell on odd-numbered levels. Multiples of 5 are good as well, since these multiples represent the last level before a new iterative attack. Stopping at 9th level is a good choice, since that allows the players to achieve capstone abilities like a bard's inspire greatness, a druid's venom immunity, a sorcerer's 3rd bloodline power, and teleport and raise dead as capstone spells. Likewise, 13th level works well, giving capstone abilities like a monk's spell resistance or spells like greater teleport, limited wish, and resurrection. Setting level caps of lower than 20th allows you to use them as soft limits-if your campaign's story arc goes beyond what you'd originally planned, your players can continue to gain levels and new abilities beyond what you estimated. Since the classes presented here don't have additional rules provided beyond 20th level, setting a campaign arc to end at 20th level requires great timing and, invariably, some manipulation on your part as GM to make sure the story winds up before the PCs reach enough XP to theoretically hit 21st level."

			"Although the rules don't describe what happens after 20th level, this isn't to say that there are no resources available to you should you wish to continue your campaign on to 21st level and beyond. Rules for epic-level play like this exist in numerous products that are compatible with the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, although in many cases these alternative rules can provide unanticipated problems. For example, if your campaign world is populated by creatures and villains who, at the upper limit of power, can challenge a 20th-level character, where will epic-level PCs go for challenges? You might be looking at creating an entirely new campaign setting, one set on different planes, planets, or dimensions from the one where your players spent their first 20 levels, and that's a lot of work.",
			"",
			"Paizo Publishing may eventually publish rules to take your game into these epic realms, but if you can't wait and would rather not use existing open content rules for epic-level play, you can use the following brief guidelines to continue beyond 20th level. Note that these guidelines aren't robust enough to keep the game vibrant and interesting on their own for much longer past 20th level, but they should do in a pinch for a campaign that needs, say, 22 or 23 experience levels to wrap up. Likewise, you can use these rules to create super-powerful NPCs for 20th-level characters to face.",
			"",
			"**Experience Points:** To gain a level beyond 20th, a character must double the experience points needed to achieve the previous level. Thus, assuming the medium XP progression, a 20th-level character needs 2,100,000 XP to become 21st level, since he needed 1,050,000 XP to reach 20th level from 19th. He'd then need 4,200,000 XP to reach 22nd level, 8,400,000 XP to reach 23rd, and so on.",
			"",
			"**Scaling Powers:** Hit dice, base attack bonuses, and saving throws continue to increase at the same rate beyond 20th level, as appropriate for the class in question. Note that no character can have more than 4 attacks based on its base attack bonus. Note also that, before long, the difference between good saving throws and poor saving throws becomes awkwardly large-the further you get from 20th level, the more noticeable this difference grows, and for high-level characters, bolstering their poor saving throws should become increasingly important. Class abilities that have a set, increasing rate, such as a barbarian's damage reduction, a fighter's bonus feats and weapon training, a paladin's smite evil, or a rogue's sneak attack continue to progress at the appropriate rate.",
			"",
			"**Spells:** A spellcaster's caster level continues to increase by one for each level beyond 20th level. Every odd-numbered level, a spellcaster gains access to a new level of spell one above his previous maximum level, gaining one spell slot in that new level. These spell slots can be used to prepare or cast spells adjusted by metamagic feats or any known spell of lower levels. Every even-numbered level, a spellcaster gains additional spell slots equal to the highest level spell he can currently cast. He can split these new slots any way he wants among the slots he currently has access to.",
			"",
			"For example, a 21st-level wizard gains a single 10th-level spell slot, in which he can prepare any spell of level 1st through 9th, or in which he can prepare a metamagic spell that results in an effective spell level of 10 (such as extended summon monster IX, or quickened disintegrate). At 22nd level he gains 10 spell-levels' worth of new spell slots, and can gain 10 1stlevel spells per day, two 5th-level spells per day, one 7th-level and one 3rd-level spell per day, or one more 10th-level spell per day. At 23rd level, he gains a single 11th-level spell slot, and so on.",
			"",
			"Spellcasters who have a limited number of spells known (such as bards and sorcerers) can opt out of the benefits they gain (either a new level of spells or a number of spell slots) for that level and in exchange learn two more spells of any level they can currently cast.",
			"",
			"You might want to further adjust the rate of spell level gain for classes (like paladins and rangers) who gain spells more slowly than more dedicated spellcaster classes.",
			"",
			"**Multiclassing/Prestige Classes:** The simplest way to progress beyond 20th level is to simply multiclass or take levels in a prestige class, in which case you gain all of the abilities of the new class level normally. This effectively treats 20th level as a hard limit for class level, but not as a hard limit for total character level."

			"After recording all of the NPC's class features, the next step is to outfit the character with gear appropriate to his level. Note that NPCs receive less gear than PCs of an equal level. If an NPC is a recurring character, his gear should be selected carefully. Use the total gp value found on Table 14-9 to determine how much gear he should carry. NPCs that are only scheduled to appear once can have a simpler gear selection. Table 14-9 includes a number of categories to make it easier to select an NPC's gear. When outfitting the character, spend the listed amount on each category by purchasing as few items as possible. Leftover gold from any category can be spent on any other category. Funds left over at the end represent coins and jewelry carried by the character.",
			"",
			"Note that these values are approximate and based on the values for a campaign using the medium experience progression and a normal treasure allotment. If your campaign is using the fast experience progression, treat your NPCs as one level higher when determining their gear. If your campaign is using the slow experience progression, treat the NPCs as one level lower when determining their gear. If your campaign is high fantasy, double these values. Reduce them by half if your campaign is low fantasy. If the final value of an NPC's gear is a little over or under these amounts, that's okay.",

You can assume that the character has whatever gear is needed for him to properly use his skills and class abilities. This category can also include jewelry, gems, or loose coins that the NPC might have on his person.",

			"Looking over your notes for the evening's game, you discover that you need a mysterious forest character for the PCs to interact with on their way to town. If things go poorly, they might have to fight him. Since your party consists of 4th-level characters, you decide to make this forest guardian an elven ranger 4/rogue 2. You want him to be skilled at fighting with ranged weapons, but you also want him to be competent with a rapier. Taking this into account, you use the heroic ability scores for a ranged NPC found on Table 14-6. Since he is an elf, you apply the racial modifiers to Dexterity, Constitution, and Intelligence. Since he is 6th level, you put his bonus attribute point gained at 4th level into his Dexterity, raising it up to 18. Moving on to skills, you see that rangers receive fewer skill selections than rogues, so you start by selecting skills for the ranger. You add two for his Intelligence modifier for a total of eight skills at six ranks each. After selecting these eight skills, you move on to the rogue skills. The difference between the ranger and the rogue is two, meaning that you can select two more skills, with two ranks in each. After selecting his skills, you move on to his feats. Starting with his class feats, you select Rapid Shot as his ranger combat style feat. In addition, the forest guardian receives three additional feats for his class levels. Since you want him to be skilled at archery, most of these feats come from the ranged list, including Deadly Aim and Point Blank Shot. To ensure that he is good with a rapier, you spend his final feat selection on Weapon Finesse. Next you note all of his class and racial features, making whatever selections are necessary, such as favored enemy, favored terrain, hunter's bond, and rogue talents. Moving on to gear, you assign gear using the line for a 6th-level heroic NPC, giving him a +1 longbow, a masterwork rapier, +1 studded leather armor, a potion of invisibility, a potion of cure moderate wounds, and a pack full of nonmagic gear. Although he has a bit more gp in weapons than the chart allows, he has spent a bit less in armor, roughly balancing him out. With your task nearly completed, you add all of his statistics and details, naming him Kiramor. Your forest shadow is then ready to face off against the PCs.",

			"You might already know what a Game Master is. The likely definition, if you're holding this book, is \"you.\" But if you don't know, a Game Master (or GM) is the Pathfinder RPG player who arbitrates the rules of the game and controls the actions of every game element that isn't explicitly controlled by the other players. But as any experienced Game Master knows, being a GM is also much, much more.",
			"",
			"**Host:** Game Masters are the unifying force behind most of the game, not just organizing a social event but providing excitement and entertainment for those who participate. [Getting Started](rule/getting_started) focuses on the GM's role as a host, presenting considerations on how to start a game, how to prepare for a session, and how to select a tone and rules that players will be eager to explore.",
			"",
			"**Mastermind:** GMs work to keep a game's momentum moving in directions that entertain all the players while exploring the stories and settings they desire. To such ends, a GM manipulates dozens of elements, from how narrative components unfold to what rules are used and how they function in every situation. [Running a Game](rule/running_a_game) addresses a variety of topics that help GMs handle some of the most complicated aspects of their duties, from the details of how a GM actually performs in-game and frames a story to ways to create adventures and juggle the myriad aspects of a campaign.",
			"",
			"**Mediator:** Just as GMs make sure all of a game's plots and rules work together to entertain, they must also ensure that the players themselves mesh and cooperate. From tips on handling unusual characters and common PC problems to the delicate tasks of introducing new players and addressing the needs of several gamer archetypes, [Player Characters](rule/player_characters) offers GMs a host of suggestions to help them avoid, ease, and handle the wide variety of challenges that arise from both in-game characters and their real-world players.",
			"",
			"**Actor:** Through the GM, the cast of entire fantasy worlds takes the stage. In a given session, a Game Master might play a generous peasant or a conniving king, a rampaging dragon or an enigmatic deity. Whatever the persona, the GM's characters are only as convincing, endearing, despicable, or memorable as the person who portrays them. [Nonplayer Characters](rule/nonplayer_characters) deals with designing and depicting nonplayer characters, encouraging players to take a vested interest in NPCs, creating sinister villains, and many more suggestions to bring even the smallest role to life.",
			"",
			"**Patron:** While GMs constantly confront their players with all sorts of dangers, they also serve as the source of every reward the PCs ever gain, from each experience point to treasures of legend. [Rewards](rule/rewards) aids GMs in creating and managing a wide variety of rewards, and includes ways to handle common challenges presented by character wealth and bring new life and adventure to old treasures.",
			"",
			"**World Builder:** Whether running games on Golarion, home of the official Pathfinder campaign setting, or on a world of their own creation, GMs control nearly every aspect of an entire fantasy reality. With not just one world, but perhaps even multiple planets, planes, or even stranger settings under the GM's direction, the more insight and forethought invested into the ways and workings of locations, the more believable these become. Details on these elements, along with considerations on societies, time, technology, and more fill [Creating a World](rule/creating_a_world).",
			"",
			"**Storyteller:** Among a GM's most important tasks is imagining and telling engaging stories. To aid in this task, [Adventures](rule/adventures) presents expansive discussions on several of the settings most common in the Pathfinder RPG, focusing on considerations and helpful rules GMs can employ wherever their tales might take them. In addition, numerous idea-generating charts and random encounter tables assure that GMs never lack for details or excitement once their stories reach their destinations.",
			"",
			"**Game Designer:** Even with the vast range of options presented in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, only GMs know what threats their players might face or powers they might come to control. Just as GMs arbitrate the rules within their games, so can they manipulate, repurpose, and wholly invent new rules to improve their games. [Advanced Topics](rule/advanced_topics) not only offers GMs a variety of new rule subsystems and considerations for running challenging types of adventures, but also expands upon several existing rules elements and demonstrates how GMs can customize the rules they already know to perfectly fit the types of adventures they want to run.",

			"**Director:** Over the course of a campaign, Game Masters have need of dozens of characters and hundreds of encounters, choosing and customizing each and presenting them however best aids the overarching plot. Yet creating these elements can prove a repetitive and time-consuming task. To aid in this process, [NPC Gallery](rule/npc_gallery) unveils a gallery of dozens of stat blocks for the types of NPCs most commonly encountered in the Pathfinder RPG. These characters can be used however the GM wishes, allowing him to focus on other, more exciting aspects of his campaigns.",

This GameMastery Guide seeks to address such needs, counseling on challenging aspects of campaigns, contributing new options and inspirations, and refreshing the game's classic elements. Most importantly, the countless tools herein are designed not to change games or tell GMs how they should play, but rather to inspire new stories and save effort, leaving GMs with more time to run exactly the adventures they and their groups want to play-or have been playing for years."

			"While everyone at the table plays the game, the Game Master creates the world, breathing life into it in front of a small audience enraptured by his story. The Game Master works the hardest of everyone, spending night upon night before each game session carefully weaving the strands of fate and plotting the course of the adventurers' lives, working in twists, building encounters and monsters, and pouring blood, sweat, and tears into his creation. To use a common analogy, roleplaying games are like movies where the actors get to improvise and alter the script as they go, working off prompts from the Game Master. Extending this comparison, if the players are the actors, then the Game Master is the director-and often the screenwriter, even when basing the story on a published adventure. While this is a generic comparison, it illustrates some of the multiple roles the Game Master fills. The position can also be broken down into a number of other duties and responsibilities as follows.",
			"",
			"**Storyteller:** Weaving plots involving the player characters and any number of nonplayer characters, leading dialogue, and unfurling a vast tapestry of ideas, stories, and adventure, the Game Master is a storyteller first and foremost. While the game is a collaborative narrative told from all sides of the table, the Game Master paves and maintains the road along which the adventurers walk.",
			"",
			"**Entertainer:** Despite the best-laid plans and most intricate plots, if the game isn't fun and engaging, it isn't worth the effort. It's the Game Master's job to do whatever's necessary to keep the players' energy and interest up, immersing the group in the story through the use of strange voices, animated gestures, and generally making a fool of himself in the most classic sense. In order to fulfill the role of every individual the player characters encounter, the Game Master needs to be impressionist, comedian, and thespian all in one. In the role of the entertainer, the Game Master is the steward of every player's experience, keeping everyone at the table involved and the story moving along at the proper pace.",
			"",
			"**Moderator:** While important in any game, the role of moderator becomes even more important in games with new players unfamiliar with the rules, or situations where the Game Master might be running a game for strangers, such as \"organized play\" sessions at gaming stores and conventions. Many players enjoy the tactical aspects of the game and make the most of the rules in and outside of combat. The Game Master should know what each character is capable of, as well as the abilities of the nonplayer characters and monsters, and should be prepared to pass judgment on any contradictory or disputed interpretations of the rules. And while it's important for the Game Master to be fair and hear out players' opinions and arguments, a good Game Master has the confidence and resolve to hold firm once he's made a decision.",
			"",
			"**Creator:** Not only does the Game Master bring stories to the table, but many times he is also the creator of entire worlds. More often than not, he spends more time preparing for the session than the session actually takes to play. When not using a published setting or adventure, the Game Master must take the time outside of the game to create the plot, build enemies, construct encounters, develop magic items and spells, design monsters, and flesh out the world of adventure the players will soon inhabit.",
			"",
			"**Instructor:** Not everyone is going to show up to the table with an equal-or even sufficient-understanding of the rules. Some of these players will be young, the new generation of gamers eager to enter into the ranks, and others will be friends you've encouraged to learn the joys of roleplaying games; some may even be fresh recruits at conventions or game stores. Everyone has a different aptitude for the admittedly complex rules of roleplaying games, and many people are intimidated by them. Part of a Game Master's role is to guide players in learning the game-after all, the majority of Game Masters playing today learned from another Game Master who was patient with them.",
			"",
			"**Player:** Despite a pervasive myth, roleplaying games are not about pitting the Game Master against the players. They are not competitions, and the Game Master does not lose when the players succeed-rather, if the players leave the table feeling tested but triumphant, then the Game Master has achieved the best possible result. Though one person guides the game, everyone is a player in some sense. Game Masters must be as convincing with the nonplayer characters they control as the players are with their own characters, if not more so.",
			"",
			"In addition to these roles, the Game Master might also fill a handful of others. Many groups maintain a set of house rules for their games, and the Game Master has the final say on particular interpretations and arbitrations of rules (though everyone in the group should be aware of any house rules beforehand). The Game Master may also act as host for the game. At the least, the host provides an ample place to play. While some extraordinary Game Masters might provide all materials, including books, character sheets, pencils, dice, miniatures, and a battlemat, groups should decide upon those details themselves. As the host for a game, it is important to provide a surface large enough to play upon, a place for everyone to sit, reasonable facilities, and the desire to get a good game going. Whether played at a Victorian dining table lit with candelabras, on the floor of a spartan apartment, in the library during recess, or in the back of a van on the way to a family camping trip, roleplaying games can be tailored to most any situation, as long as there's excitement and a desire to play."

			"**Campaign Arc:** A sequence of adventures that mesh well with each other, usually part of a larger campaign. Game Masters often run these shorter arcs to create a story that's more concise than a full campaign but longer than a single adventure.",
			"",
			"**Encounter:** An encounter is a short scene in which the PCs are actively doing something. Examples of encounters include a combat with a monster, a social interaction significant to the adventure's plot, an attempt to disarm a trap, or the discovery of a mystery or clue requiring further investigation.",
			"",
			"**Metagaming:** This is when characters act on information that they don't have access to, but which their players know from the real world. Metagaming comes into play when players fail to maintain a divide between in-character knowledge and out-of-character knowledge. That could include anything from uncannily accurate in-character predictions from a player who's already read the adventure, players recognizing monsters when their characters wouldn't, low-Intelligence characters accessing well-educated players' knowledge and talents, etc.",

			"Finding the right fit with a group depends on a shared preference of styles of play and the willingness to compromise. Does your group prefer to focus more on combat or roleplaying? The former style moves quickly through the story and centers primarily on fun tactical situations. If it's the latter, games should highlight character development and storyline, and it wouldn't be unusual to have an entire session pass without combat. Most groups fit somewhere in the wide middle of this spectrum, but knowing what your players enjoy most is crucial to keeping everyone entertained."

			"Once your players decide what style of game they're looking for, it's time to consider tone and setting. A group that's more interested in lighthearted silliness will disappoint a Game Master wanting to run a creepy horror campaign. Setting and tone determine whether you're running a complex, gritty political game in which the PCs unravel conspiracies or a high-magic and high-action fantasy epic involving bizarre monsters and divine mandates. Setting encompasses the central themes and tropes of your world, and tone is the feel, whether that's gritty realism or fairy-tale derring-do. The desired magic level is also worth discussing early on, as some players like readily available magic, while others prefer it to be exclusive and rare, only finding a handful of magic items throughout their entire career. A short meeting before launching the campaign allows you to tailor the experience for your players, and most players appreciate the effort to satisfy everyone's tastes."

			"In addition to focusing on the game-specific themes and styles, consider the group of players sitting around the table. Are they looking for a casual \"beer and pretzels\" game, or are they committed roleplayers looking for a deeply immersive campaign? Have you been playing with the same group for years? Is everyone at the table a complete stranger in a session you're running at a convention or a game store? Each of these different group styles requires a different performance from the Game Master. Casual groups require less focus and can often be more forgiving of mistakes, glossing over problematic situations in favor of hanging out and enjoying a shared hobby. Committed roleplayers can demand significantly more focus and attention, as each player brings a complex and interesting character in need of development within the game. Some Game Masters find convention play or hobby store play difficult because they lack a point of reference for the newly formed group. In these cases, a bit of small talk before the game begins often offers cues as to players' interests. Use time before play begins to ask a few focused questions about not only the players, but also their characters."

			"Listening to your players is important not only when looking to start a new campaign but also during the course of the story. From your seat at the game table, you can tell who's engaged and who's not. The goal should always be to figure out what's going to grab the bored, distracted, or annoyed players and get them back in the game (without sacrificing the fun of the others, of course). If during the last game session a particular player seemed bored when it wasn't her turn at combat, make a point to chat with her about the reasons why. Maybe she doesn't feel like her character is performing well or getting enough of the spotlight outside of combat. It often only takes a slight tweak or a single encounter tailored to her skill set to make a disenfranchised player feel like a valuable part of the group.",

			"Always be open to switching things up. Players inevitably throw wrenches into the Game Master's plans, despite how obvious a lead seems or how convincing a hook sounds. Don't be afraid to play off their creativity the same way they do with yours. If you have a plot the characters are trying to unravel, and the solutions they come up with make more sense than your prepared ones, try ignoring the original resolution from your notebook or a published adventure and turning the story in a new direction-the players never need know about the original version, and you can take full credit for their enjoyment. Similarly, if the players keep going off track and getting involved in events outside of your planned story, that might be a sign that your players are interested in a different sort of game than you originally crafted. And even if you have great empathy with your gaming group and give them everything they want, remember that tastes can change over time. Remember what your players enjoyed and try to perform in that way again, but realize your players likely have varied palates and can enjoy a wide range of game types."

			"Mature themes like cannibalism, drug use, gory violence, profanity, prostitution, and various forms of sexuality sometimes come up in the game, and not every group deals with them in the same way. Knowing the group of people you're playing with and accurately gauging their comfort zone is crucial to keeping a session enjoyable. If you anticipate anyone at your table being uncomfortable with certain mature themes, talk to your players beforehand. Determine their preferred treatment of the issues, and respect their preferences when deciding how heavily you want to play up those themes. If your group openly discusses sexuality, fondly recalls the gruesome scenes from a favorite horror film, or makes frequent off-color jokes, then it's probably fine including those themes in your campaign (though not necessarily-the player with the filthiest mouth or biggest slasher-movie collection might still be sensitive to certain issues). Instead of deciding everything ahead of time, you can also seed given elements into your adventure bit by bit to determine players' comfort level. For example, if you have a lecherous nonplayer character attempting to seduce a player character, drop a few hints, subtle at first, and see if the character takes the bait. Watching the player's reaction indicates their comfort level with the topic and lets you know how close to the boundary you can play. And of course, there's a difference between dropping hints and innuendos and graphically describing the dwarven lovers' sweaty embrace. A little mature content goes a long way.",
			"",
			"Because combat is a core element of the game, violence happens. But just as children's TV shows can provide action without gore, so too is there a spectrum in roleplaying. Violence, or rather how graphically violence is portrayed, is one element in determining how appropriate movies and video games are for different ages and sensibilities, and a similar determination can be made for different styles of roleplaying. Depending on the context, you can describe the same combat with a simple \"you hit him with your sword,\" or create a more visceral description of the same action: \"you hit him with your sword,\"",
			"",
			"Adult themes can be an excellent way to get the characters to react to a villain or event. A foul villain who uses men and women as sexual playthings before strangling them in the carnal act can produce fear, anger, and a thirst for vengeance in even the most peaceful of characters. The level of comfort regarding violence can also change depending on the victim. While it may be perfectly acceptable for some groups to murder a bugbear villain, murdering a child-even for the greater good- is probably pushing the boundaries too far. In fact, involving children, animals, or other innocents at all can be a dangerous game-you might think that a villain who abuses animals is the ultimate example of depravity (and hence a great antagonist), but your players might not be prepared to talk about such things, even in the context of fighting against them. It's also important that, if you enjoy a game involving a lot of questionable morality and \"lesser of two evils\" plots, your party has similar inclinations. Allying with an obvious evil character in pursuit of mutual goals might feel like gritty realism to you, but others might see it as in poor taste, or completely against their characters' alignments. If you design an encounter that strains your paladin's commitment to his beliefs, make sure the player enjoys that sort of thing. In all situations, be mindful of the group's sensitivity and design your games accordingly.",
			"",
			"If you feel certain styles or topics might turn off your players but still want to include them, consider testing the waters with your group by running that style of game as a one-shot and not something destructive to your regular campaign. When playing with strangers, young people, or with other potentially sensitive players, or when playing in a public place, it's best to keep any adult content out of your games. While society tolerates violence to some extent, other adult topics better suit more private, mature groups. Remember, some players might not want to see gritty real-world topics in their lighthearted weekly game. Above all, know your players' the better you know the preferences of the group you play with, the more enjoyable the game will be for everyone involved."

A lot of gaming groups fall apart because of interplayer conflict. As a result, when taking a chance on a new player, it's generally best to issue a limited invitation, such as for a single adventure, and then decide from there.

Sometimes you might have to play the character for a bit to finish a combat, but a short-term withdrawal usually works. The main problem with this technique is that you must provide a logical in-game exit and re-entrance opportunity, and tie those in with the storyline.",

			"The character disappears from the group, reappears when the player does, and no notice is taken of the event. This solution is quite simple, but it requires a degree of maturity to pull off. The character was there, then simply is not. After a time, she's there again. The GM does not need to find something else for her to do or stage an exit and re-entrance. When she reappears, the character may know what happened in her absence, or may not, depending on the group's preference."

			"There's an adage in military circles: no plan survives contact with the enemy. Sometimes players head off in directions you didn't anticipate, defeat your primary villain with a few rolls, miss an obvious clue, or lose a key battle. You can take such developments in stride by considering a few contingencies that can set your plot back on track. Start by thinking about how things might go astray. Does some key individual drive your plot? Do the characters need to learn something before they can succeed? Is there a danger that, if overlooked, can defeat your party? Once you've identified the key stumbling blocks, think of plausible ways to repair the damage if the worst happens.",
			"",
			"Of course, sometimes you still won't be able to prepare for player actions. When things go astray, it's generally the most fun for everyone to play along, exploring the new story and using it to gently nudge the game back onto the original track. Sticking without exception to a prepared plot makes players feel powerless, and part of the fun of being a GM is being surprised by your players. Go with it."

These scenarios might be \"standalone,\" with little or no connection to other campaigns you run, or merely a diversion for your regular characters to give you extra time to put together the next major challenge. Paizo's Pathfinder Society Scenarios are designed for just such situations, and can be downloaded from paizo.com. Keep in mind that the characters in these sessions can be the usual PCs, affiliates such as hirelings, or totally new characters intended only for a single game-one-shots are often perfect for unusual character ideas that might fail or grow stale in a longer game."

A properly constructed campaign also provides you with story elements, locations, personalities, and conflicts that serve as springboards for your creativity as you create adventures. Campaigns can be completely plotted out ahead of time, such as the 6-part Pathfinder Adventure Path series, which give GMs all the adventures and supplemental material they need to run a complete campaign, or they can be crafted on the fly, with GMs stringing adventures together just a session or two in advance. A Campaign Sheet is included in the back of this book, which you can use to plan and record all of the relevant details of your campaigns.",

			"While everyone at the table plays the game, the Game Master creates the world, breathing life into it in front of a small audience enraptured by his story. The Game Master works the hardest of everyone, spending night upon night before each game session carefully weaving the strands of fate and plotting the course of the adventurers' lives, working in twists, building encounters and monsters, and pouring blood, sweat, and tears into his creation. To use a common analogy, roleplaying games are like movies where the actors get to improvise and alter the script as they go, working off prompts from the Game Master. Extending this comparison, if the players are the actors, then the Game Master is the director-and often the screenwriter, even when basing the story on a published adventure. While this is a generic comparison, it illustrates some of the multiple roles the Game Master fills. The position can also be broken down into a number of other duties and responsibilities as follows.",
			"",
			"**Storyteller:** Weaving plots involving the player characters and any number of nonplayer characters, leading dialogue, and unfurling a vast tapestry of ideas, stories, and adventure, the Game Master is a storyteller first and foremost. While the game is a collaborative narrative told from all sides of the table, the Game Master paves and maintains the road along which the adventurers walk.",
			"",
			"**Entertainer:** Despite the best-laid plans and most intricate plots, if the game isn't fun and engaging, it isn't worth the effort. It's the Game Master's job to do whatever's necessary to keep the players' energy and interest up, immersing the group in the story through the use of strange voices, animated gestures, and generally making a fool of himself in the most classic sense. In order to fulfill the role of every individual the player characters encounter, the Game Master needs to be impressionist, comedian, and thespian all in one. In the role of the entertainer, the Game Master is the steward of every player's experience, keeping everyone at the table involved and the story moving along at the proper pace.",
			"",
			"**Moderator:** While important in any game, the role of moderator becomes even more important in games with new players unfamiliar with the rules, or situations where the Game Master might be running a game for strangers, such as \"organized play\" sessions at gaming stores and conventions. Many players enjoy the tactical aspects of the game and make the most of the rules in and outside of combat. The Game Master should know what each character is capable of, as well as the abilities of the nonplayer characters and monsters, and should be prepared to pass judgment on any contradictory or disputed interpretations of the rules. And while it's important for the Game Master to be fair and hear out players' opinions and arguments, a good Game Master has the confidence and resolve to hold firm once he's made a decision.",
			"",
			"**Creator:** Not only does the Game Master bring stories to the table, but many times he is also the creator of entire worlds. More often than not, he spends more time preparing for the session than the session actually takes to play. When not using a published setting or adventure, the Game Master must take the time outside of the game to create the plot, build enemies, construct encounters, develop magic items and spells, design monsters, and flesh out the world of adventure the players will soon inhabit.",
			"",
			"**Instructor:** Not everyone is going to show up to the table with an equal-or even sufficient-understanding of the rules. Some of these players will be young, the new generation of gamers eager to enter into the ranks, and others will be friends you've encouraged to learn the joys of roleplaying games; some may even be fresh recruits at conventions or game stores. Everyone has a different aptitude for the admittedly complex rules of roleplaying games, and many people are intimidated by them. Part of a Game Master's role is to guide players in learning the game-after all, the majority of Game Masters playing today learned from another Game Master who was patient with them.",
			"",
			"**Player:** Despite a pervasive myth, roleplaying games are not about pitting the Game Master against the players. They are not competitions, and the Game Master does not lose when the players succeed-rather, if the players leave the table feeling tested but triumphant, then the Game Master has achieved the best possible result. Though one person guides the game, everyone is a player in some sense. Game Masters must be as convincing with the nonplayer characters they control as the players are with their own characters, if not more so.",
			"",
			"In addition to these roles, the Game Master might also fill a handful of others. Many groups maintain a set of house rules for their games, and the Game Master has the final say on particular interpretations and arbitrations of rules (though everyone in the group should be aware of any house rules beforehand). The Game Master may also act as host for the game. At the least, the host provides an ample place to play. While some extraordinary Game Masters might provide all materials, including books, character sheets, pencils, dice, miniatures, and a battlemat, groups should decide upon those details themselves. As the host for a game, it is important to provide a surface large enough to play upon, a place for everyone to sit, reasonable facilities, and the desire to get a good game going. Whether played at a Victorian dining table lit with candelabras, on the floor of a spartan apartment, in the library during recess, or in the back of a van on the way to a family camping trip, roleplaying games can be tailored to most any situation, as long as there's excitement and a desire to play.",

The Game Master's job is to help guide the story and involve each character in a way that makes her actions feel meaningful. This means listening to the players while simultaneously keeping your own preferences in mind. No two gaming groups are the same, so groups that discuss their preferences for styles of play, tone, and group dynamics are more likely to enjoy long-running, trouble-free games.",

As the group member most responsible for the game's success, the GM is also the de facto host for each session, in charge of handling or delegating the logistics behind the fun.",
			"",
			"The social side of a session is at least as important as the quality of the game itself. Adult gamers might rarely get time to socialize, given the pressures of jobs, families, and homes, so game night becomes a welcome chance to spend time with friends, no different than a night of board games, movies, or poker. And like any party, there's work to be done both before and after.",

Some typical house rules are discussed below, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Discuss the issues and the options for handling them with your players before play begins, and make sure everyone agrees to abide by the final decision. If you see a need for a new house rule as play proceeds, talk to your players outside of the game, then implement the new rule at the next session, reminding the group about it before play begins.",

This way, the players have some idea what to expect and can create and play their characters to best fit into the overall setting. The most important function of a campaign guide is to make your players excited to delve into the setting and play the game! Consider the following when preparing a campaign guide."

			"You might plan a campaign with an ending in mind-a fairly easy task if you've laid out a story. Or you might decide to end the campaign when player interest (or your own) starts to flag. In either case, consider what elements in the campaign have struck a chord with the group. Perhaps you've grown fond of a particular town or character. Perhaps they really despise some villain or have a burning desire to obtain a certain item. Craft your ending so things end on a high note, with main conflicts resolved and the loose ends tied up. It's often fun to create an epilogue that lays out each character's later career and retirement and looks ahead to the general state of your game world during the surviving characters' sunset years."

			"Preparation is great, but sometimes you just want to play. Published adventures are perfect for this, but even those require a bit of reading ahead of time. If you want to truly wing it, with nothing more than a few notes and some dice, try flipping through some completed adventures for stat blocks you can use-at the very least, you're going to need to know things like hit points, AC, and saves-or tag some creatures in a monster book. Sketch out as much of the plot as you feel you need; it could be a whole adventure, or just the first scene. Consider throwing in a big decision requiring party deliberation whenever you need a minute to figure out the next encounter, and remember that a fun roleplaying encounter with an oddball NPC can provide extensive entertainment without any math involved.

Reading through such a scenario can give you an idea of how an adventure is put together, what challenges are suitable for your group's power level, and what sorts of rewards are appropriate. The Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook deals with these subjects, but there's nothing like seeing all the elements put together. More importantly, a close look at adventures someone else has thought through can give you new ideas for constructing your own. It's easy to fall into a rut, especially when you're running games regularly, and adventures like Paizo's Pathfinder Adventure Paths and Pathfinder Modules can help dig you out.",

This way, the players have some idea what to expect and can create and play their characters to best fit into the overall setting. The most important function of a campaign guide is to make your players excited to delve into the setting and play the game! Consider the following when preparing a campaign guide."

It includes choices like viewpoint, tone, and style, which can not only affect how the content is conveyed, but can also provide additional information and insight for players in and of itself. The two main approaches to voice are an \"inside\" or subjective voice, or an \"outside\" or objective voice.",
			"",
			"**Subjective Voice:** This method presents some or all of the content of the campaign guide in the form of fictional documents or dialogues, such as travelogues, journals, letters, or scholarly works written by people in the setting. Subjective voice documents are heavy with setting-specific flavor and present a strong point of view, a fictional window into the world for the reader. On the other hand, they can be biased or incomplete, and they tend to provide less information in the same amount of space than documents written in objective voice. These qualities can be good things, especially if you want players to initially receive somewhat biased or inaccurate information about things, but crafting such documents typically involves more work. Subjective voice presentation can serve double duty by introducing players to the fictional authors of the documents in addition to the subjects they discuss. For example, if the party is likely to interact with a certain sage or noble in the setting, perhaps part of the campaign guide can be written in that character's voice. This way, when the game starts, the players already have a feeling of \"knowing\" that character.",
			"",
			"**Objective Voice:** This style of guide is written from the perspective of the Game Master and exists outside of the setting. This approach allows for a broader perspective in campaign guide materials, in which you can provide comparisons to modern examples and discuss things a subjective author might not know. Objective voice tends to be more concise because you can say exactly what you mean without having to phrase it in terms an insetting character would use. This lets you provide more information in less space, saving time and effort if they are at a premium.",
			"",
			"**Combining Voices:** Of course, you can also mix subjective and objective voice in your guide. You might use a primarily objective voice to provide the bulk of the information and then put the information into context with snippets or examples of subjective voice, such as quotations from in-setting characters or even more involved things like sketched-out maps."

			"Before you run your first session, there are a number of decisions you need to make regarding the nature of your game. Is your table a serious roleplaying experience, with players staying in character at all times? Is it an immersive experience with painted miniatures, three-dimensional terrain, soundtracks, and mood lighting? Is it a zany get-together with friends, where half the fun is the in-game banter? Or is it some combination of those, or perhaps something else altogether? There's no best answer, but such decisions have a vast impact on the experience you and your players have. Noted here are a few of the more common decisions a GM needs to make when running a game.",
			"",
			"Miniatures vs. Freeform: The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game presumes you're playing with miniatures and using a gridded mat to keep track of character locations during combat. This isn't the only method, though- you can also try charting things out on graph paper or drawing it on a white board, or utilize paper minis and combat tokens that can be printed out and discarded as needed. Yet you may decide that focusing on where everybody is and how far they can move in a round ruins the cinematic drama that you wish to create. In this case, you might prefer a more freeform style of play, where the GM keeps track of the action in his head, players describe the actions they wish to take, and the GM adjudicates the results. In this type of game, many rules take a backseat to flavorful flourishes and cinematic descriptions from both players and GM.",
			"",
			"In Character vs. Out of Character: Do your players need to remain in character during the game, or can they speak as themselves, strategizing and giving advice to other players? Some GMs allow the latter only if there's a mechanism for determining when someone's in character, while others allow a casual blurring of the lines.",
			"",
			"GM Tracking vs. Players Tracking: There's a large amount of information to keep track of during a game. The Pathfinder RPG rules imply that this work should be split, with the players keeping track of their characters, hit points, abilities, ongoing effects, and so forth, and GMs tracking the same information for the NPCs. Yet some GMs prefer to keep everything a secret from their players, tracking even their experience points, hit points, spell durations, and other information, only giving the players vague, lifelike information-such as telling them that they feel weak from blood loss rather than how many hit points they have left. While this can help enhance both the game's mystery and its sense of danger, the sheer amount of bookkeeping required on the part of the GM makes it easy for such games to bog down and overwhelm the GM.",
			"",
			"**Taking Back Mistakes:** Almost every game session, a player does something they didn't mean to do, whether it's stepping on the wrong square or forgetting to add a bonus that means the difference between success and failure. Some GMs have a rule that once it's left your mouth or you've moved your miniature on the mat, you're committed, even if the end result isn't what you would have normally done. Other GMs allow players to retroactively add bonuses to rolls, or take back poorly planned spells and other mistakes, letting them make the best moves possible for their character. This is a difficult balance- too much leeway and there's no risk, but being too strict can ruin the fun for your players. Remember, though, that the standard used for your players should apply to you as well, and such \"rewind\" moments can be anything from a misplaced miniature to letting a clue slip out too early."

			"Below are a few key points to remember.",
			"",
			"**Read the Adventure:** If you're playing a published adventure, read through it at least once. It also helps to reread the parts of the adventure you expect the players to tackle in the upcoming session, to keep it fresh in your mind.",
			"",
			"**Predict Player Actions:** Try to guess what your players might do in a given situation. If you think they might go to a tavern to get info, think about what NPCs will be encountered there, and what information they may have to impart. Likewise, if you think they might use subterfuge to get into a fortress, consider how the inhabitants might react to various plots. A little foresight goes a long way.",
			"",
			"**Adapt to Players:** Consider tailoring your adventure to take into account the backstories of certain PCs, or incorporate a subplot that players initiated in a previous adventure. If one of your players is a paladin who hates devils, think about changing the generic cleric villain to a priest of Asmodeus to get your PC more invested. By tying your characters into the plot, your story naturally has more impact.",
			"",
			"**Review Relevant Rules:** As you're reading through the upcoming portion of the adventure, take time to familiarize yourself with relevant monsters, feats, spells, magic items, and rules subsets. Part of your job as the GM is to play NPCs and monsters to the best of their ability, which means being as familiar with the NPCs' options as your players are with their own characters-.",
			"",
			"**Prepare Stats and Strategies:** Make sure the adventure's challenges are appropriately balanced for your party's level and composition. Think about the locations where the encounters take place, and how NPCs can turn the location and their particular abilities to their advantage. It can also be good to copy the stats for each NPC and monster for ease of reference, allowing you to make notations on spells used, hit points lost, and other information without marking up a book.",
			"",
			"**Prepare Additional Tools:** If you use props in your game, preparing in advance helps the game flow smoothly. Pick the miniatures and any three-dimensional terrain you want to use in a given session and put them in an easily accessible place. Put any pictures you want to show in a folder on your computer or print them onto sheets. If the players have the map to a dungeon level, think about drawing the level on the battlemat ahead of time."

			"",
			"Even once the adventure is prepped and the players are gathered, the GM's work is just beginning. There are a few things to pay special attention to during a game session.",
			"",
			"**Initiative:** Keeping track of whose turn it is during combat can be complicated. While a simple written list helps, such can get cluttered and complicated as characters hold actions and delay. The GameMastery Combat Pad allows you to keep track of initiative order by arranging the characters and their adversaries on erasable magnets and moving them as needed. You might also manage initiative by using a stack of index cards with the name of a characters or opponents written on each one-maybe even with notes for easy reference.",
			"",
			"**Dice Rolling:** Some dice rolls need to be made in secret, such as when a rogue looks for a trap or a monster attempts a Perception check. At other times, you may want to roll in front of the players, such as when a pivotal save is being made during combat which could potentially kill a player character. Making rolls in the open adds a sense of drama and fairness to the moment, and your players can see the result as they root for the outcome they desire. Yet doing so can also tie your hands unnecessarily, interrupt the flow of the narrative, and generally detract from the sense of mystery. For this reason, physical barriers like the Pathfinder RPG GM Screen come in handy.",
			"",
			"**GM Subterfuge:** You don't want your players to know when something important is happening by watching for you to roll your dice. As such, many GMs roll dice unnecessarily every so often, pretending to look something up in their notes. This makes it harder for players to guess when something significant has happened, such as a failed Perception check. It's equally important for things like finding secret doors-if you don't call for a Perception check simply because there's nothing to see, the PCs quickly learn that rolling dice means something is up, whether they made their roll or not.",
			"",
			"**Tracking Hit Points:** During battles, you'll sometimes have more than one of the same type of monster on the table, so keeping track of which one has all its hit points and which one is barely holding on is important. Whether you track hit points on a sheet of paper, a dry erase board, or via some other method, make notes about which creature is which and any damage or conditions it may have acquired.",
			"",
			"**Corpses:** If you use miniatures in the game, what do you do with the miniature when the monster dies? Some GMs immediately remove dead or unconscious creatures to avoid clutter. Others leave the bodies where they fall, providing terrain obstacles. With the ability to use channel energy to heal friends and foes in an area of effect, leaving monsters on the board could require you to track hit points of monsters well into the negatives on the off chance that the PC cleric unintentionally catches them in a healing wave. This is just one of many situations in which a GM must choose between the game's realism and the ease of actually running the game.",
			"",
			"**Dead Characters:** Sometimes player characters die in combat. This is often a traumatic event for players, and how you handle it as GM has enormous bearing on whether those players continue to have fun or not. First off, determine whether there's a chance for those characters to be revived via [raise dead](spell/raise_dead) or some similar spell. If they're likely to be revived at a later date, you can keep them engaged by having them play the role of NPC allies, cohorts, or even familiars or animal companions. Then when the combat is over and the characters get returned from the dead, they can resume their usual roles. If they're not likely to come back, having them start rolling up new characters is a good way to keep them busy for the rest of the session. For more information on this issue, see [Death of a Hero](rule/death_of_a_hero).",
			"",
			"**Time Management:** Keep an eye on the clock to help you wind up your game on time. If you know your game needs to end at midnight, don't start the triumphant battle with the main villain at 11:30 p.m. Know when to gloss over less-important encounters in order to reach a good stopping point, but also don't be afraid to pad things out and leave some goodies for next time. Finding a cliffhanger to stop on-the revelation of a piece of information, or a villain's dramatic entrance-makes for both a dramatic conclusion and a hook to keep the players excited for the next session.",
			"",
			"**Keeping the Game Moving:** One of the biggest dangers in a game session is the risk of getting bogged down. Sometimes it's the result of the GM not being prepared and needing to read over something during the game. Other times, it is because of a player not being prepared or taking too much time to make a decision. These slowdowns can ruin the mood, tension, and drama of a game. Preparation as the GM helps minimize these risks on your end. For players, sometimes a decision merely takes a moment, and having a bit of patience is fine. Should long turns and side conversations regularly detract from the action, however, give players a time limit to declare their actions, after which they're considered to be delaying, and you move on to the next character in the initiative order. Of course, new players naturally require more time to make decisions than experienced ones, which is why it can be useful to assign one of your more adept players as a mentor."

			"As a Game Master, you already know what's expected. You have some players, you've designed an adventure full of cunning threats, wild terrain, and a big clever twist, and you're ready to entertain. That should do it, right? Yet the best-laid plans of every storyteller sometimes go awry. There's a range of reasons, but while the Pathfinder RPG is a form of group entertainment, it still depends on you as the GM in order to succeed. You are the scriptwriter and director for this production, but you're also the chief performer. How you choose to approach the role makes a huge difference.",
			"",
			"It's not that players aren't important; on the contrary, they're both your audience and your fellow performers, and in many ways everything you do is for them. But they also have less control over the world, and play more limited parts. You lead the band. If you bring gusto to the adventure, your players will respond in kind. If you show up unprepared and harried, they may not invest much effort either. Delivering the best possible performance as a GM depends on how you see yourself when you game, how well you prepare, and what tricks and techniques you use to keep your campaign moving smoothly."

It's often worth it to ask your players after the game (or one-on-one later, if that's easier) to tell you why they didn't buy into your original adventure premise, and what sort of adventure they'd prefer. If they want more gold and glory, or to find out what's beyond the western mountains, find a way to make that an option.

			"If you enjoy improvisational play, the best move may be to temporarily drop the planned plotline (or at least the planned plot hook) and follow your players' lead. Are they more interested in the dark, brooding mage with a zombie-filled [bag of holding](magic/wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1) than the murder the prince of the city has asked them to investigate? Very well, then: the necromancer is the new patron of the adventuring party, and boy does he know about some dark doings-the prince of the city has sent his best troops out on a suicide mission, and the mage would like the PCs to bring back some heads for a quick [speak with dead](spell/speak_with_dead).",

And you get the additional fun of improvising and reacting to the players' ideas, plus the chance to be pleasantly surprised by yourself as ideas flow fast and furiously.",
			"",
			"If you're especially fortunate, you can probably turn some of your existing encounters, NPCs, or plot elements into elements of the adventure that the party wants to pursue-or use their new direction to steer them subtly onto the adventure you had planned-but it's not always possible. When forced to think on your feet, one helpful trick is to listen to player speculation and then elaborate on their fears or suspicions to make the plots feel even more complex. If the players say \"I'll bet the duke's involved!\", a simple option is to take the cue and have the duke actually be behind the nefarious plot they've uncovered, thus making players feel satisfied for having figured it out. On the other hand, if it turns out that the duke is actually an unfortunate innocent, with his daughter held as a pawn of the true villains-then the players get both the satisfaction of being partially correct and the thrill of uncovering something new, and your adventure feels meatier and more intricate with almost no additional effort."

			"This is the finest of techniques when it works, though it can be overplayed. The illusion of free choice is really a matter of the GM convincing the PCs to do exactly what he wants while making them think it's their idea. The simplest method in theory is often the hardest in practice: giving the players several choices, all of which lead to the same adventure. This might be as easy as simply changing a hook-the PCs didn't know that the old man they ignored in the bar was about to tell them the same thing as the ancient treasure map they discover in the town graveyard. The ancient dungeon can be uncovered by order of the king, as the party is marching off into the wilds, or as the only hope for a town surrounded by enemies-once they go there, the adventure is the same, regardless of how they got there.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, of course, the party has a reasonable idea what the adventure is and still decides to avoid it. In these cases, it's sometimes best to subtly make the adventure more and more compelling until of course the players decide to go after the big treasure hoard guarded by their arch-nemesis-they've finally learned his weakness, and they only have a few days to exploit it!",
			"",
			"That's a bit of a hard sell, but notice three things about the example. First, it involves a pre-established nemesis; by tying the adventure into the PCs' goals as characters, you've made the same basic adventure seem far more appealing. Second, it provides a lure in the form of cash- because in this case, you've watched your players enough to know that this particular party loves loot more than glory or doing the right thing. Third, the hook relies on a change in circumstances that is time-dependent. If the party doesn't act now, ready or not, this opportunity will not come again. Limited-time offers have a way of selling things, whether it's adventures or refrigerators.",
			"",
			"Above all, put yourself in the player's shoes. Don't think about how cool the villain is, how clever the traps are, or how smart the backstory is-think about what's in it for your players, and why an adventure would appeal to them personally, and you'll never go wrong."

			"Stage presence is as important to GMing as dice. Though many GMs hide behind their screens and only venture out to move minis, others are animated, gesturing and using strange accents to demand attention.",
			"",
			"While it's certainly possible to overdo it, the latter style is far more exciting and memorable. The GM doing those things is performing; he's fully engaged and driving the game with his desire to entertain. Yet not everyone is a natural performer, and many of the most bombastic GMs are shy and quiet in everyday life. Just like the rules and adventure design, the performance aspect of GMing is a skill that can be learned. Below are a few tips.",
			"",
			"**Stand up:** Standing tends to make you more forceful and keeps you looking at your players, not fiddling with your dice. It also has the added benefit of letting you glance at players' character sheets or move miniatures faster and more easily. Try standing up during the most action-oriented sequences, when you have combat or other sources of immediate tension in play.",
			"",
			"**Gesture:** Point at a player to get his attention. Put him on the spot, and make it clear that the NPC you're roleplaying expects an immediate response. This tends to push players into responding in character as well.",
			"",
			"**Make Eye Contact:** Look at your players. If you're roleplaying the major villain, don't blink-literally stare them down.",
			"",
			"**Dialogue:** Maybe you prefer to say \"He speaks with the voice of the grave\" rather than attempting to do so yourself. But even if you aren't comfortable showing off, that doesn't mean you can't put a little spin on things, modulating your pitch or whispering instead of speaking. Hiss a little. Ham it up. Push your limits, and see what works.",
			"",
			"Even without accents, a character's word choices say a lot about his personality. Is he a noble dandy who refers to himself in the third person and sometimes uses big words improperly? Or is he an arcane scholar who knows exactly what those big words mean, and uses them to the exclusion of all others? Is his language dirty and lowbrow, much like the character himself, or prissy and precise, refusing to debase itself with contractions? The words you choose are every bit as important as the manner in which you say them.",
			"",
			"Of course, if you're interested in working up accents to make your NPCs more memorable, there are numerous ways to improve your skills. First and foremost, take risks-even if your accent falls flat after the first few lines, it'll still be more interesting to players than if you used your normal speaking voice. Next, try thinking of familiar actors, cartoon characters, or (if you're feeling daring) friends and family with speech patterns different than your own. Speak your lines as if you were that person- the odds of you mimicking them perfectly are low, at least at first, which means what comes out will be attributed solely to your NPC in the players' minds, and having a person whose voice you're already familiar with in mind allows you to maintain consistency. For further creativity, try borrowing from real-world regional accents, slang terms uncommon to your area, or a wide array of speech impediments like lisps and stutters.",
			"",
			"While all of these options can be combined at random, it can often be easiest and most effective to identify a single speech trait that characterizes each character. Spend some time thinking about what most represents each NPC. A voice that cracks frequently makes people think of someone young, inexperienced, and comical. Someone who speaks in a rapid-fire chatter often sounds anxious or like they're trying to sell something, and characters who speak slower than normal often sound dull and unintelligent. Everyone has certain ingrained associations and prejudices tied to specific patterns of speech-identify yours and your players-, and use them to your advantage. Not only can you paint a clearer picture, but you can also create interesting roleplaying encounters by occasionally playing against type.",

			"Handouts are extremely valuable for two reasons: they give players information about the adventure, and they are tangible, focusing attention on that information in a way that just saying it doesn't. Whatever information you put on that handout is information that the party is more likely to pay attention to or act on, simply because it's sitting in front of them. So write or sketch that diary entry, cargo manifest, treasure map, ambassador's report, or shopping list for the golem artificer. If the players can't figure out the story hook hidden in it, give them some Knowledge rolls to help them along, but know that every handout you spend time on will almost always pay dividends at the game table.",
			"",
			"Fun, authentic-looking handouts are quite easy to make. For an old treasure map, for instance, try dipping white, unruled paper in coffee to make it resemble parchment, then drawing on it when it dries. You can also crumple it up a few times, tear and tatter the edges, and even smear a little dirt or ash on it. Other options include the following:",
			"",
			"- Rolling up paper to make a scroll (and decorating a cardboard paper towel roll as a scroll case)",
			"- Writing \"TRAPPED WITH GLYPHS\" on the scroll presented above, to punish incautious players",
			"- Tearing a handout in half, so the PCs have to find both pieces",
			"- Writing in a foreign language or unusual font to represent the need for [read magic](spell/read_magic)",
			"- Using an image or replica of a real medieval manuscript page (with your text in English on a separate page)",
			"- Using real parchment or shell gold to make a fancy proclamation",
			"",
			"Props are much the same sort of thing, but taken to broader ideas. Old pennies or just metal slugs can be put into a dice bag and thrown on the table for a solid thud when the party is offered 200 gp for the job. You can show a wand, crystal ball, staff, or dagger when you play the part of certain NPCs; likewise with hats. And best of all are the \"real treasure\" props. Throw down an old necklace to represent the Medallion of Rozxanatan the God-Smiter; if you have some costume jewelry with glass or paste gemstones, that usually does the trick.",
			"",
			"In general, props are worth digging out for artifacts, for special NPC audiences that you know are coming up, and for particular impact with players who might be a bit jaded or easily distracted.

			"",
			"Sometimes you want that extra emotional impact for a game. And for those special occasions, it's worth digging around your music collection to build a playlist. It may seem a little trite, but most fantasy movie soundtracks work well as background music for a fantasy game, so long as you stay away from overly recognizable themes that will jar your players out of the moment. Most of the time, it's best to use fairly subtle soundtracks (though there's nothing wrong with some heavy metal beats to keep the momentum, if that's what you group loves, so long as there aren't a lot of words to distract people). But if you really want to knock a game out of the park (say, when doing a special \"send-off - game for a player leaving town), then it might be worth it to ascribe themes to particular characters or, better yet, choose songs to go with specific encounters, such as heavy industrial noises for a fight in the dwarven smithy, soft mandolins and violins for the visit to the elven queen, a dirge for a dead NPC, or a bombastic, brassy symphonic charge for the final battle against the villain. The important thing to remember is that the music should support the scene subtly, without taking center stage\" for this reason it's often best to avoid popular music or things with comprehensible lyrics, and it's important to have the songs cued up and ready so you don't waste valuable game time and dramatic tension by searching for the proper track."

			"It's the GM's job to plan and predict the course of an adventure. Depending on you and your players' play style, this may be an easy endeavor or require a lot of work. The basic types of adventures are linear, unrestricted, and nonlinear.",
			"",
			"**Linear:** A linear adventure scenario is pretty straightforward; the PCs begin at point A, travel to point B, then C, and so on until they reach the end of the adventure. What exactly those points are, and which of them are combat encounters, roleplaying encounters, or merely places to rest and buy new equipment varies from adventure to adventure. For example, a scenario may start at a village where orcs just attacked, follow a survivor's directions toward the orc lair, deal with the orcs in the lair, and end with the PCs returning triumphantly to the village; there isn't much room for deviation from the expected plot. Most published adventures are linear adventures simply because a book only holds a limited amount of information-it's impossible to account for every possible character motivation, wild goose chase, or wrong turn that the PCs may take during the course of one or more nights of play.",
			"",
			"With linear adventures, the GM has to be ready to steer the PCs back to the task at hand; one of the easiest ways is to use a timed event to encourage the PCs to stay on track (such as a prisoner held captive in the next location who must be rescued before the monsters kill him), but some GMs fall into the trap of using brute force, such as an army of lizardfolk that coincidentally appears whenever the PCs try to go a different direction. Linear adventures are often called \"railroads\" because there's only one place the PCs are supposed to go-but this isn't always a bad thing. If you're just running a one-shot game-say if an old friend is in town for a long weekend or the gaming group wants to play a single game with high-level characters' it's perfectly acceptable to railroad the characters; the expectation is that everyone wants to finish the adventure, and wasting time looking for clues in the wrong place just makes it more likely the group won't finish in the allotted time. In these situations, it's okay for the GM to say, \"you don't think this has anything to do with the Dungeon of Bloody Death, and heading to Black Blood Mountain is clearly the way to deal with this threat.\" In the same way that your group can use their imaginations to see ex-quarterback Bob as a female gnome rogue, they can accept a gentle push in the direction of the actual adventure when things get too far off track.",
			"",
			"In an ongoing campaign, you have to be prepared for the PCs to go off the rails and stay off the rails for extended periods of time. Even if your plan is to run a linear adventure, it's a good idea to have some mini-adventures, random encounters, or interesting locations for the PCs to visit should they detour from the plot of the adventure. With careful planning, these deviations can help steer the PCs back toward the main adventure-a random encounter with an orc raiding party that's fresh from cooking and eating some peasants may inspire the PCs to deal with the lair; an old ranger needing help fighting a dire wolf may have a few +1 [orc bane](magic/enhancement/bane) arrows he was saving for a special occasion, and so on. Of course, the best solution is to have several linear adventures planned, seeding the PCs with information about each, and letting them pursue whichever one they want-which actually works much like the next adventure type.",
			"",
			"**Unrestricted:** In an unrestricted adventure, the PCs can go anywhere and do anything; they may not even be aware of your initial ideas for the first adventure. This sort of gaming is often called a \"sandbox\" because there are no limits to what the PCs can do, like children on a playground creating their own imaginative stories with toys. Running a sandbox game requires a GM with a lot of prepared game material or the ability to create multiple story elements on the fly. An easy way to \"cheat\" at running a sandbox game is to have several parallel adventures planned so if the PCs wander away from one 3rd-level dungeon, you can insert another one in the path of the PCs. Another trick is to \"re-skin\" one adventure with a different flavor, such as taking a fire-themed temple and changing all encounters, spells, and monsters from fire to cold as the players go through it. If you're running a sandbox campaign and you get stuck, either because the PCs have lost track of adventure hooks or they're heading toward something you haven't thought much about, use the same tactics you'd use in a linear or nonlinear adventure (see below)-steer them in a new direction, tell them where they're headed isn't ready yet or is too powerful for them, or ask them what they expect to find there and use that to inspire what's actually there.",
			"",
			"The one big potential trap of a sandbox game is that because there's so much to do, some players may split off from the main group for extended periods, leaving you to GM one group of players while the rest have to sit and wait until it's their turn. If this happens, steer the wandering PCs back to the main group, as dividing your attention for too long leads to bored players. Sometimes it's best to arrange a short session (or even a series of emails or messageboard posts) for just those PCs to let them deal with their plot elements and get back on track with the main plot. Sometimes the most drastic and mysterious action is best-if the wandering PCs turn up near the main group, disoriented and with no memory of the last few days except a sense of horror, you can move on with the main plot and plant seeds for what happened to that \"missing time.\" For more information on dealing with split parties, see [here](rule/splitting_the_party).",
			"",
			"**Nonlinear:** If an unrestricted adventure is a blank page, a nonlinear adventure is a flow chart, as when the PCs have multiple options for engaging a storyline, they feel more in control, and the adventure starts to look more like a flow chart or series of crossroads than a straight railroad-this is the core of a nonlinear adventure. In many cases you're able to bend or add to the developments of a linear adventure based on the actions and desires of the PCs, turning it into a nonlinear adventure.",
			"",
			"For example, in the aftermath of an orc raid on a village, the PCs may decide that tracking the orcs back to their lair is too difficult without a ranger and decide their abilities are better suited to building defenses for the town and waiting until the orcs come back. Instead of the PCs dealing with the monsters room by room, you can use those area-based monster encounters to attack the town in waves, or (if you think the PCs are up for it) to attack from two different directions. The PCs don't need to know that the encounter with the orc monster tamer and his worg pet was supposed to be area 4 of the orc lair, and perhaps the increased mobility of an open area brings an interesting twist to what may have been an otherwise routine encounter.",
			"",
			"Nonlinear adventures require you to plan ahead for what the PCs may do, and think on your feet in case they come up with something you weren't expecting. For example, if the PCs are intimidated by your description of the damage from the orc raid and ask about finding better weapons to help deal with the orcs, you may be momentarily caught offguard because this sort of action wasn't in the original idea of the lair-based adventure. However, developing a stable of secondary characters and side treks lets you quickly insert an appropriate NPC for this purpose, such as the aforementioned old ranger with the +1 [orc bane](magic/enhancement/bane) arrows-who no longer needs help with a dire wolf, and is now willing to trade the arrows for a favor to be named later (which you can use as a plot hook for the next adventure). If you're stuck for ideas when the PCs make an unexpected shift, don't be afraid to ask the players what their characters are looking for; if they ask about [orc bane](magic/enhancement/bane) arrows, that may inspire you about a hermit ranger, but if they ask for potions or scrolls, it may inspire the idea of a lonely, half-mad cleric living at a ruined shrine, and the players don't need to know that their suggestion as to what they're looking for helped define the course of the adventure."

			"",
			"Combat is the slowest and most complex part of the game, with issues of timing, multiple creatures acting at once, and many, many dice rolls. Here are some tips for speeding up combat-things you can do and things your players can do to help.",
			"",
			"**Be Prepared:** This sounds like a no-brainer, but the greatest source of combat slowdowns is not knowing what a creature can do or how its special ability functions. It's hard enough for the players to keep track of what their PCs can do, but as a GM you're usually running multiple creatures at once and have to keep in mind how the results of this combat affect other events in the session. Read over the stat blocks for all creatures you're using that session; if any of them have special abilities or use a [universal monster rule](rule/umr), be sure you're familiar with those as well. If a creature has a complex spell or spell-like ability, note its page number or print out the ability to save time referencing it.",
			"",
			"**Display the Combat Order:** If a PC knows what the current tick of the initiative clock is and knows when the participants get to act, he knows when his turn is coming up and can plan for what he wants to do. This means instead of hemming and hawing for a minute at the start of his turn, he can hem and haw during the previous player's turn and be ready when it's his turn. It also lets the PCs coordinate their actions together-while stingy GMs may see this as cheating or metagaming, remember that the turn-based initiative system is just a tool to simulate real-time combat in a way that doesn't take forever, and in a real combat, people on the same side wouldn't be locked into only acting in a specific order without awareness of each others' intent.",
			"",
			"**Five Second Rule:** If the players can see who's up next in the initiative order, they have no excuse for not knowing what's going on or what their characters want to do. If a PC's turn comes up and the player takes more than a few seconds to announce his character's action, skip him as if he had chosen to delay his action and move on to the next creature's turn-after all, combat is hectic, and sometimes in the thick of battle you need a second or two to focus. This doesn't cost the PC any actions, so they're only penalized their position in the initiative, and it hopefully encourages them to pay more attention to what's happening. Note that speeding up combat in general means players get to act more often and are less likely to get distracted between their turns, so the rest of these tips should make this one less necessary. Note also that you should let players know in advance that you're going to do this, as springing it on them unexpectedly can seem vindictive.",
			"",
			"**Plan and Combine Dice Rolls:** Rolling attacks and damage separately takes twice as long as rolling them all together. Save time by coordinating your attack roll dice with your damage roll dice so you can roll them at the same time, and encourage players to do the same. For example, if the PCs are fighting four orcs, each with a falchion, get four different-colored d20s and a pair of matching d4s for each orc, then roll all 12 dice at the same time; if the red d20 and green d20 are hits, you know to look at the red d4s and the green d4s and ignore the blue d4s and purple d4s. If the PCs are fighting a dire lion, you can color-coordinate the bite's d8 die with one d20 and two claw d6 dice with two other d20s, and roll all the dice at once.",
			"",
			"Be aware, however, that while rolling attack and damage at the same time is always a good idea, rolling all your attacks at once can be problematic if you (or your players) want to split the attacks between multiple opponents-if you don't carefully assign each attack before you roll, it's tempting to say that two of those three attacks which would have missed the main villain were actually directed at his weaker henchmen, whether or not that was your original intention.",
			"",
			"**Tokens:** There are dozens of conditions in the game that can affect a creature's behavior, possible actions, or combat stats, and it's easy to lose track of them during gameplay. One way to help with this is using tokens next to or underneath a creature on the battlefield or the displayed initiative tracker. The simplest tokens are torn pieces of paper with the condition written on them. Alternatively, you can use glass beads, colored plastic disks (possibly even magnetic ones for easy stacking), flat wooden squares, or even fancier tools. Several companies make variants of these, allowing you to customize them to your needs, such as a yellow marker for panicked, green for nauseated, red for enraged, and so on. Tokens also let you single out unusual creatures when unique miniatures are unavailable (\"the orc with the purple marker has tentacles instead of arms\") and help the players identify targets in combat without having to ask which opponent is which (\"I attack the panicked orc before he runs away and alerts anyone to our presence\")."

			"As a GM, you should know your players and their PCs, and create encounters that suit their play style and show off what their characters can do. If the fighter's player likes to jump into the middle of groups of monsters and hack away, be sure to include such encounters every so often so that player gets to do what he likes best. If he has the [Cleave](feat/cleave) feat, set up situations where he can cleave an adjacent foe; if he has [Great Cleave](feat/great_cleave), make sure every now and then he can go cleave-crazy on a horde of weak opponents. If the sorcerer's player is a tactician and likes to use ranged spells and enchantments, put her against charm-vulnerable opponents using ranged attacks so she has perfect targets for her style of play. If the monk's player is a fan of Wuxia films and likes the extreme-cinematic style of combat, put opponents on ledges so he can use high jump, or enemies at the bottoms of cliffs so he can get there quickly using slow fall, and make sure some enemies aren't immune to stunning fist.",
			"",
			"This means you should keep an eye on what feats and spells your players select as their PCs level up, and on what magic items you award them or they create. If the fighter takes [Great Cleave](feat/great_cleave) at level 5 and only gets to use it once by the time he's reached level 10, it's as if he wasted that feat choice, and that's not fun. You want the players to use the abilities that make them excited about the game. Reward them for playing well by letting their characters flex their muscles.",
			"",
			"This is not to say that you shouldn't challenge the players to try different tactics. Put the fighter who likes being surrounded in a situation where he has to guard a narrow bridge and can't let anyone get past him, or have him fight monsters that get flanking bonuses or sneak attacks that make him rely on terrain or the other PCs to avoid getting killed. Let the tactician-sorcerer take control of a minion. The trick is to teach other styles of play (or at least present them as options) without them feeling forced."

			"",
			"[Table 12-1: Encounter Design](unknown/table_12-1_encounter_design) only covers encounters from APL -1 to APL +3, so that CR range is the usual limit for most encounters. After all, for a party of four 6th-level PCs, an \"easy\" encounter (APL -1) is a \"rival\" group of four 2ndlevel NPCs (CR 1 each, +4 for 4 creatures = CR 5); if beating up NPCs one-third your level is easy, beating up even weaker creatures is more like bullying than adventuring. The risk of using very easy encounters is that the players may grow bored-they know their characters can deal with the monsters, but have to go through the motions of making attack and damage rolls without the excitement or risk from a \"real\" encounter. (Much like a \"god mode\" setting in a video game, the novelty of easily destroying all opponents gets old after a few encounters.) In some cases it's acceptable or even a good idea to lead off an adventure with a very easy encounter-for example, if the players need a morale boost or have power-boosting abilities that require some kills to start functioning-but in most cases you don't want to create encounters below APL -1.",
			"",
			"The value of APL +3 should be a fairly hard limit for difficult encounters unless you want there to be a considerable risk of PC death. Once you're beyond APL +3, the PCs' ability to pose a threat to a monster dwindles, especially if the encounter is a single powerful creature rather than multiple ones on par with the APL. In most cases, this is because using a higher-CR monster may cross one of the invisible \"break points\" in monster design where the creature's defenses and abilities assume the PCs are a certain level and have access to certain spells or gear, such as magic weapons, spells to remove ability damage, items neutralizing poisons or disease, or even simple things like being able to hit the monster's AC or meet its saving throw DCs. If the PCs lack a critical spell or piece of gear, a difficult encounter may be nearly impossible.",
			"",
			"For example, a succubus is a CR 7 encounter, and is an \"epic\" encounter for a group of four 4th-level PCs. Most PCs at that level lack cold iron or good weapons, and thus have to deal with the demon's DR for every attack. The PCs may have difficulty overcoming her SR 18, energy resistances, and immunities, thus spellcasters will be frustrated. The PCs have even odds at best of resisting her at-will [charm monster](spell/charm_monster) and [suggestion](spell/suggestion) (usually taking one PC out of the fight), and have to work very hard to make up for the temporary hit points from her at-will 6d6 [vampiric touch](spell/vampiric_touch).",
			"",
			"It's entirely possible to have an exciting and challenging fight (CR equal to APL +1 or +2) without overwhelming the PCs. An \"epic\" fight may last two or three hours of real time-a memorable fight if the PCs win, but a depressing slog if they can't. It's generally better to keep combat encounters to about an hour-that way you can get two or three encounters into one night of gaming, and make more progress in the adventure or campaign than a single, longer fight. If the fight you've given the PCs ends up too tough for them, don't forget to remind them that they can run away, or you can cheat a little bit and suddenly treat the monster as if it had the young creature template (-2 on all rolls), which might be enough to turn the tide in the PCs' favor-after all, you want the PCs to win, because that means everyone gets to keep playing. Killing them with an accidentally-too-hard encounter is no fun for anyone."

			"Sometimes there's the temptation to use one powerful monster instead of multiple weaker monsters. The main drawback to this encounter-designing tactic is that the PCs outnumber the monster; even in the optimal situation where the monster attacks first, a group of four PCs gets to attack four times before the monster gets another turn, and with good planning it's entirely possible for the PCs to kill the monster in one round. Using multiple monsters forces the PCs to either focus their attention on one opponent (giving the remaining opponents more opportunities to attack) or engage all of the opponents (preventing an immediate slaughter). Using multiple monsters also lets you set up special abilities like sneak attack that are difficult to implement with a single monster, and means you can distribute the monsters' actions throughout the round (whether by rolling separate initiatives or using the delay or ready actions) and react more than once per round to what the PCs do.",

			"This is another way of saying \"play to the PCs\" strengths,- but is worth reiterating. Part of the fun of playing is leveling a character and gaining new abilities. If you create encounters that circumvent the PCs' newest abilities, it takes away some of the fun of the game because it's like they didn't gain all the benefits of their level. For example, if the PC wizard just reached level 5 and learned the [fireball](spell/fireball) spell, you may be tempted to throw some fire-resistant or fire-immune encounters at the PCs to compensate for this ability-which makes the 5th-level wizard feel like a 4th-level wizard. However, thousands of RPG campaigns have survived PCs who can cast [fireball](spell/fireball); it's better for a GM to embrace the new ability than fear it. Give the wizard a cluster of minions to blast so he feels powerful-or set up an encounter where he has to choose between blasting a bunch of minions or using the spell on just the boss.",
			"",
			"Some monsters are designed to be more challenging to certain character classes. Golems are immune to almost all magic, some outsiders have very high damage reduction, oozes are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks, and so on. If the PCs end up facing these kinds of creatures over and over again (especially in a short amount of time), the stymied players can easily get frustrated-after the third encounter with stone golems, the sorcerer and wizard are likely to give up and want to stop playing. If you're going to use a lot of these creatures (say, in a themed dungeon), you have two options to prevent player frustration.",
			"",
			"**Give the Character a Tool:** There are dozens of limited-use items in the game, plus consumables like potions and scrolls. If you know one PC is going to have a problem with an upcoming encounter, drop a helpful item into an earlier encounter or even an earlier adventure-an item that lets the character be useful in the battle despite the monster's resistances. If a PC druid has no magic weapons and you're planning an iron golem encounter, give her a [golembane scarab](magic/wondrous/golembane_scarab) so she can better attack it in wild shape. If a PC rogue has no bludgeoning weapons to use against a black pudding, let her find a low-level [wand of magic missile](spell/wand_of_magic_missile) and blast away using Use Magic Device. Many items and spells in the game are designed to deal with unusual encounters, but don't see play very much because PCs prefer general-utility magic; introducing a cheap or expendable item like this gives smart players something to fall back on if their primary strategy isn't effective or if they run into an encounter where the unusual tool is exactly what they need.",
			"",
			"**Present Other Options:** Just because the encounter involves a monster doesn't mean that all the PCs have to focus on defeating that monster. Create another task that helps overcome the monster, prepares for the next encounter, or disables a parallel threat during the fight. For example, in a fight against a bunch of black puddings, rather than having the rogue frustrated by not being able to use sneak attack, add a spiked wall trap that the rogue can disable while the other characters deal with the oozes. If the encounter has an iron golem and the wizard has no electricity attacks to slow it, put a magical puzzle-crystal in the room that unlocks a secret room if the wizard makes a Knowledge (arcana) check. If the party cleric channels negative energy and the other PCs are fighting undead (meaning the cleric would heal enemies if she tried to channel), include a door made of fused bone that only opens from a focused blast of negative energy. If the opponent is resistant to physical attacks, put a chained prisoner in the room that the barbarian, fighter, or paladin can rescue while the spellcasters deal with the threat."

			"Whether you're running a low-magic campaign or just have a group of players uninterested in playing healers, a lack of curative magic in the party is a big deviation from the norm. Without a healer, monsters that deal high damage have a greater risk of killing a PC-there's no healer to step in and compensate for a critical hit- so you should rely on weaker monsters that don't deal damage in large increments. If there is magic in the campaign, the PCs can at least rely on potions (and scrolls and wands, given an adequate Use Magic Device bonus), but this forces them to decide between attacking and healing each round. Without reliable access to any healing magic (such as in a historical campaign), the PCs must resort to nonmagical methods like the Heal skill, or perhaps limited-use legendary items or quasi-magical items derived from unusual monster parts. They should also consider using more defensive tactics, such as taking the Dodge and Combat Expertise feats, in order to raise their Armor Classes and reduce the number of successful attacks against them. Keep in mind that without healing, PCs generally have no way to deal with curses, diseases, poisons, and other afflictions, so use creatures with those abilities sparingly or make mundane methods of overcoming such dangers a more significant and readily available part of your campaign."

			"Though technically a broader example of the \"no healers\" variant, a campaign with no spellcasters at all has an entirely different set of problems. Most adventures assume that a typical party has one arcane caster and one divine caster; without any magic at their disposal, the PCs may have a hard time dealing with monsters that are resistant to physical damage but vulnerable to magic. Even something as simple as a swarm (immune to weapons but vulnerable to area attacks) becomes a significant challenge when the PCs don't have magic. Conversely, an otherwise challenge-appropriate monster that has a high spell resistance may actually end up weaker than a \"normal\" creature because its CR assumes the PC spellcasters are going to have trouble-a hindrance a no-spellcaster party completely ignores. Keep an eye out for monsters with high DR, high SR, or vulnerabilities to magical attacks (including cold and fire vulnerability); these are likely to be more or less difficult than expected."

			"This section is more about a party with no melee classes, rather than a party where every PC is a spellcaster-a group of four clerics or paladins is technically an allspellcaster party, but they don't have the sort of problems that four sorcerers, wizards, or even bards face. Such a party is the opposite of the no-spellcasters group; DR is less important, SR and resistances are more important, and creatures with nearly universal magic immunity are a serious problem. Golems, for example, can't be damaged by most direct-attack spells, and even though a stone golem is CR 11, it may be able to eliminate an entire party of 12th-level wizards, especially given a wizard's low AC and hit points compared to a melee class. The golem is an \"easy\" challenge on paper, but more dangerous in execution. Of course, smart players will use summoned monsters and charmed enemies to take the brunt of physical attacks, and a smart GM can stave off a lot of player frustration by providing such things to the PCs (even in the form of scrolls or wands) if the players don't think of it themselves; even a few summoned orcs at the start of an adventure can help an all-caster party survive."

			"Sometimes you have a player who can't make it to this week's session; sometimes you only know two other gamers in your area. Either way, having a small party presents you with some unique challenges. With fewer characters, a battle can shift against them very quickly- one unconscious, charmed, or held PC in a group of three is a loss of 33% of the party's resources compared to 25% in a standard party. Often, one or more PCs may have to take on multiple roles (melee character, skill character, arcane damage-dealer, or divine healer), and as the game rewards specialization, this means these hybrid characters are slightly less effective at either task than two focused characters would be. Fewer characters means it's more likely they're clustered together, and thus are more vulnerable to area attacks. When dealing with a small party, temperance is the key-start with smaller, weaker encounters, and give the players time to get the feel of their group's vulnerabilities. Once the players have an idea about their party dynamics, test them with encounters closer to their average party level, and eventually you'll find a good CR range that suits their abilities and is still challenging."

			"A party of eight PCs is a much different \"problem\" for a GM: they're able to handle more difficult encounters and more of them per day, often by expending disproportionately fewer resources than a four-person party. It would be easy to make the assumption that because doubling the number of monsters in an encounter adds +2 to the CR, a party of double the normal number of PCs can routinely handle encounters where the CR is equal to the APL +2. This isn't always true, however, mainly because higher- CR monsters tend to have built-in assumptions about party gear (see [High- and Low-CR Encounters](rule/high-_and_low-cr_encounters)). These differences are especially evident with a large number of weaker PCs.",
			"",
			"A good low-level example of this is the barghest; it's only CR 4, and in theory, if four 2nd-level PCs can handle a CR 2 encounter, eight 2nd-level PCs should be able to kill a CR 4 monster. However, most 2nd-level characters aren't going to have a magic weapon, and therefore the barghest's DR 5/magic absorbs a lot of incoming damage. Also, a barghest's average damage per round is 20.5, assuming it hits with all three attacks (and with a +10 attack bonus for all three, that's a safe bet against 2ndlevel PCs); while that's dangerous for 4th-level PCs (where a typical fighter has about 40 hit points), it's murder for 2nd-level PCs (where a typical fighter has about 22 hit points). In this case, the battle becomes a race to wear down the monster as soon as possible because it's killing a PC almost every round.",
			"",
			"It's perfectly fine for a large group of PCs to have an easier time dealing with challenges where the CR is equal to the APL. In general, it's better to use multiple weak monsters than one powerful monster. This gives each PC multiple opponents to choose from, gives you more creatures to play with, and keeps PC mortality low."

Such an arrangement is often perfect for spouses, roommates, siblings, and any other situation where players are scarce. In addition, a solo campaign is ideal for pursuing the kind of plotline that excludes other players-for example, an in-character romance, or a character who wants to build a business or carry out nefarious activities.",

For example, if your player wants a seafaring character, your campaign should focus on the ocean. You and the player should agree on the basics, then you can design adventures accordingly.",
			"",
			"While this kind of campaign obligates you to cater to the tastes of your player, it also frees you from worrying about whether the other players are having fun-if your player's enjoying it, you're 100% successful. Still, this doesn't mean you need to focus exclusively on things you know your player likes, as that can rob you of the chance to find new things he or she might enjoy. Lay your campaign's foundation on known tastes, but feel free to explore.",

			"Having only one PC poses some difficulties with standard adventures. A solo PC is incredibly vulnerable, not just to combat encounters, but to simple problems like falling into a pit-if the PC can't make the required Climb check or get out of the pit with magic, he's basically stuck. Likewise, a party of four PCs can deal with a monster that casts [charm person](spell/charm_person) on one party member, but a solo PC who fails that save is done for (unless you have a plan for dealing with the charmed PC shaking off the effect later and escaping). A good example to follow is a movie where there's just one protagonist; combat encounters are usually either multiple weak opponents that are only a threat to the hero in numbers (and the hero often controls the battlefield so he can deal with them one or two at a time) or a single, more difficult opponent such as a lieutenant or the main villain.",
			"",
			"One way to compensate for the lack of other party members is to expand the character's range of abilities beyond what the game normally allows. As long as the character won't ever be played in a \"normal\" campaign, there's really nothing wrong with this tactic. Another option is to introduce one or more NPCs with the appropriate abilities, friends or sidekicks of the hero which can be played by either you or the player. You could also use magic items to help fill the gap. At some point, however, you may still need to adjust your adventure to eliminate challenges that the player simply cannot meet.",
			"",
			"Stealth, skill, and roleplaying encounters are much more common in solo play. Just remember to have a backup plan should the PC fail to accomplish a goal, such as an alternate route around a trap, a quick combat resolution to a failed stealth situation, or a temporary way to neutralize or contain a dangerous opponent."

Greed is always a powerful motivator; the lure of incredible wealth is a draw for many PCs, and throwing out a few plot hooks relating to a fabulous treasure should get them started. Other PCs want power; a frontier castle that's been taken over by monsters, a strange cult, or an enemy nation is a nice prize, especially if the local ruler is willing to grant land and title to those who reclaim it. Other PCs want fame; give them the opportunity to slay a fell beast that has been murdering folk for generations, or break the back of the thieves' guild. Look to history, fiction, television, and movies for other motivations-love, jealousy, vengeance, and fear are all common story elements that drive characters to their destinies.

If the PCs missed a secret door, let them find a rough treasure map of the dungeon with the door clearly marked (on the back of a scroll they found earlier is a nice trick), or they can hear about it from another group of adventurers. Cohorts are good for spotting overlooked secret compartments in treasure chests, as is a sharpeyed town merchant. A forgotten reference to an ancient king, priest, or wizard can turn up in an old prayer book or during spell research. While the PCs may be the focus of the campaign world, there are countless secondary characters and events that can put them back on the right track if they get lost."

			"Players are inherent \"surprise generators,\" and being surprised by their ingenuity is one of the joys of being a Game Master. You don't need to consider every possible power combination. But when you see a game-changing power coming down the road, take a moment to think like a player. What will Bob want to do once he can turn invisible? Once you answer that, you won't be surprised (or at least as surprised) and can move on to the other two goals.",
			"",
			"\"Don't let the new ability run amok\" and \"don't render the new ability useless\" are two sides of the same coin. Your fundamental job as Game Master is to provide entertainment, challenge, and above all, balance. Players have a natural desire to play with their new toys-you helped instill that desire in them when you put all those interesting challenges in their way in the first place. Now you have a responsibility to make sure that one player doesn't trivialize the game's challenges, for himself or for the whole table.",
			"",
			"Below are some potentially difficult game elements, and some thoughts on how to manage them.",
			"",
			"**Invisibility:** There's an inherent mischief to invisibility. Consider The Invisible Man, or the iconic example of Bilbo in The Hobbit. Let the players have their mischief-it frequently costs you nothing, and they're having a good time-and deploy the traditional countermeasures (divination magic, traps, creatures that don't use sight) only at points where you want to preserve the challenge. If invisibility isn't available to everyone in the party, that helps puts a brake on their invisible ambitions in two ways. First, invisible means invisible-the other party members can't find the invisible PC for healing, communicate silently, or know where she actually went when she said she'd scout ahead. Second, for every sneaky gal in the party, there's usually a guy buried under layers of clanking plate armor as well. That guy is the Game Master's best friend, providing warning to enemies. The invisible player can probably choose her position and get a surprise attack in, but the presence of loud, visible companions ensures that the advantage of invisibility will be fleeting unless the group splits.",
			"",
			"When the whole party can turn invisible, brace yourself for the entire table choosing to sneak past encounters you spent hours preparing. As long as they're truly quiet and don't run into monsters who can counter their invisibility, let them do so. You can recycle those encounters later, and it's probably better for everyone's fun to respect the party's choice to bypass. It's possible they're using invisibility to tell you they'd rather be doing something else. So move along, but save those encounters for later use.",
			"",
			"**Flying:** Your immediate concerns are more tactical when flying shows up at your table-do melee-only monsters get slaughtered like bison on the Great Plains? You'll need to consider the monster mix in your encounters more carefully so that the players don't just fly above the dire wolves and drop rocks on them. But there's nothing wrong with letting the aerial advantage be an advantage every once in a while. Let the flying PC trivialize an encounter or a trap-there are always more of both coming down the line.",
			"",
			"Unlike most other game-changing powers, flying comes with a hidden danger to players: altitude. When a ground-bound player gets stunned, knocked out, or dropped to negative hit points, he slumps to the ground. Depending on the exact nature of the flight power, the consequences for a flying character might be far more severe. If a character runs out of hit points and can't fly anymore, impact with the ground will almost certainly finish him off.",
			"",
			"When a player learns to fly, it's worth a brief conversation with that player. Show him the math: \"If you reach 0 hit points when you're &times; feet in the air, you'll take y damage on average, which leaves you at negative z hit points-dead, in other words.\" Once he's got a grasp on the inherent danger, the player can take calculated risks, and it adds even more drama to a desperate battle in the sky. Teleportation: Teleportation raises an issue similar to invisibility: once the whole group can do it, they can bypass content. And as with invisibility, if the players have done a proper job of playing by the rules, let them have their way. It's likely not that the players want to skip the encounters you've made, but rather that you're abundantly eager to get to the other encounters you've made. Tap into that eagerness! (And don't forget to recycle the work on those skipped encounters later.)",
			"",
			"Teleportation can also challenge your preparation and ability to improvise. If your players can open a portal to the throne rooms in any of the Hundred Sacred Kingdoms, how do you cope with the mountains of preparation that come with unfettered, instant travel?",
			"",
			"You improvise and cheat, of course. You don't have a hundred throne rooms (with a hundred high-level monarchs, royal guard complements, and sets of court intrigues) prepared. You have one prepared, notes for a second, and a good idea for a third. You rename your prepared stuff on the fly-the Peaceable Kingdom of Jarrach becomes the Shadow Duchy of Sindrauta. Prince Karelius becomes Countess Kar-than-draya. The royal guards become elves-and you just describe them as having pointy ears, because nobody really cares that their Perception scores are +2 higher. You've got better ways to spend your precious time, and your players will never know the difference.",
			"",
			"For that second kingdom the PCs teleport to on a lark, go with your notes. Steal stat blocks as needed, from any source. A devil's stat block works just fine for the sinister seneschal who's rumored to consort with dark powers. Likewise for the third kingdom. And if you feel like the PCs are teleporting around too rapidly for you to keep up-well, you have a whole book full of monsters right in front of you, don't you?",
			"",
			"**Lie/Evil Detection:** This magic can be exceedingly troublesome, especially in mystery adventures, yet instead of banning it outright, your best alternative is to stick with the three goals. First, don't be surprised. When your NPC schemers start scheming, consider how the players will put divination magic to use. Second, make sure that discern lies and detect evil don't run amok. You have magical countermeasures, of course, but save those for \"this guy absolutely must be able to fool the PCs\" moments. When you can, use low-key solutions such as:",
			"",
			"- The NPC can use nonmagical but expert means (high Bluff score, natural defenses against divination) to thwart the PCs.",
			"- The NPC can tell half-truths and leave the really incendiary stuff unsaid.",
			"- The NPC gets caught lying, but that doesn't help the PCs uncover the truth.",
			"- The NPC is serving evil under duress or is otherwise sympathetic.",
			"- The PCs spot the lie, but jump to the wrong conclusion- they know that \"troops are marching to Declanburg\" is a lie, but it's a lie because the troops are already there, not because they're marching elsewhere.",
			"",
			"NPCs-at least some of them, anyway-know how the world works. It's reasonable to assume that just as you thought about what your players would do with divination magic, so too will an NPC consider what meddling PCs might do and prepare accordingly.",
			"",
			"Third, let the magic work-as a clue delivery system for you. PCs sometimes make astounding deductive leaps, but sometimes they ignore the blindingly obvious. Use [discern lies](spell/discern_lies) and [detect evil](spell/detect_evil) to get important information in the players' hands fast. Players might find a traditional interrogation of an NPC riveting, but they're unlikely to find the fifth such interrogation as interesting. Put a little divination magic to work, and watch your table quickly get the information it needs to get on with the fun.",
			"",
			"**Remote Viewing:** [Clairvoyance/clairaudience](spell/clairvoyance_clairaudience) and other scrying magic poses many of the same issues as teleportation. On the one hand, remote viewing is less work for you because the PCs aren't interacting with the NPCs and places they're observing. But on the other hand, remote viewing is generally easier and less risky than teleportation, so PCs are more likely to employ it.",
			"",
			"By now, you're likely accustomed to the familiar refrain of \"think like the players,\" and are largely concerned about remote viewing in two ways: Reconnaissance: PCs use [clairvoyance](spell/clairvoyance) and similar spells to get a look at adventure sites beforehand. On balance, this usually works in your favor, because players will then plan a route (often when you're within earshot) that tells you exactly what they want to experience. That makes your job easier-now you just provide encounters that either support or confound their expectations. That's the beauty of remote viewing-it's more of an information trade than the players realize.",
			"",
			"**Espionage:** Players love to scry on the Big Bad Evil Guy when he's going about his sinister business in his chambers. This is a test of your ability to improvise- you've got to describe an interesting scene on the spot. Espionage-style spying can also be a clue delivery system for you. Decide what information you want to impart, surround it with enough dialogue and detail to make it believable, then get on with the fun.",
			"",
			"But what if you don't have specific information to deliver, and in fact you're trying to keep the PCs and the antagonist separated for a while? If you don't want PCs tuning in at the dramatic moment, then you have two choices: describe a realistic but utterly mundane scene in the villain's life, or come up with a scene that refers at least obliquely to the ongoing narrative.",
			"",
			"When the PCs are scrying, the players are pure spectators-a recipe for boredom for everyone but you. It might be realistic for most espionage-style scrying to reveal the mundane, day-to-day life of the villain (and a nice reminder if the players seem to be overusing it), but that doesn't do anyone any good. So accept the blow to realism and give the PCs tangible-if sometimes obscure-information with each scrying attempt. Even a mundane conversation about troop movements can have a little hook (it takes 2 hours to reach the northern watchtower) that makes the players say \"Aha!\" They might never go to the northern watchtower, but in that moment, they get a little \"I know something I'm not supposed to know\" feeling-and that can propel them into action.",
			"",
			"**Portents and Omens:** Few things are as difficult as predicting the campaign's future. How can you tell a player her future when the campaign's conclusion might make her a demigod-or a string of bad rolls might make her a halfling-kebab on an ogre's spear?",
			"",
			"First, do what real-life oracles and fortune-tellers do all the time: couch your predictions in symbolism and metaphor. Don't say \"Your father won't give up the throne for you.\" Say \"Winter refuses to acknowledge spring.\" It sounds more ominous-in the literal sense of the word-and gives the campaign's plot some much-needed elbow room.",
			"",
			"Next, be specific, not general. At first, this advice seems counterintuitive. Isn't a general prophecy easier to keep than a specific one? That's true, but specific details are easier to insert into the narrative. Don't say \"You shall become the king of the elves.\" Say \"When winter's moon is nigh, the fey will dance to the tune you call.\" You have a likely fulfillment of that prophecy in mind (a formal dance at the coronation ceremony), but if the campaign goes off the rails, there are other ways to make that prediction come true. Specific details have another benefit: they make the players feel like they're getting their money's worth out of the prophecy. If you try too hard to leave yourself room with a prophecy, you risk a prophecy so vague that the players find it useless or feel deliberately cheated. You're smart enough to engineer something interesting involving the fey near a full moon in winter-even if you aren't sure what it is yet. But based on that detail, the players will think that the oracle-and by extension you-has it all figured out.",
			"",
			"If you have to hit the reset button, make it obvious that you're doing so. The campaign may have gone in a bold, player-driven direction that you weren't anticipating. And when it did, all that talk of destiny from the crazy lady back in the starting village was invalidated or became completely irrelevant. If you feel like you'd have to stretch the narrative too far to cover an out-of-date portent, then make it clear in the story of the world that the old destiny no longer applies. Perhaps the stars rearrange themselves in the sky (due to the PCs' actions, ideally), and now everyone's fate is uncertain, or can be perceived anew. Maybe the goddess of destiny appears and says that the trickster god has stolen threads from her loom of fate-including the threads that represent the PCs. You're operating in a realm where anything is possible, so avail yourself of that power."

Coming up with reasons for monsters to hang out together and fight the PCs takes less time than flipping through the books to find the perfect monsters. That's particularly true in an emergency situation where you're likely going to \"reskin\" the monsters anyway. That armored knight? You can just describe him as a hill giant and your players will never know. Then you can make him into a dire wolf, or a swarm of killer bees, and still your players may never know. Sure, you'll know that the damage dice should have been different, the skills were completely irrelevant, the Armor Class was wrong, and the special abilities were made up on the spot, but you're the only one who sees the stat block.

If you use the flow chart as a map, of course it won't have proper dimensions and everything laid out in proper architectural fashion. But your concerns are more basic. You want to keep track of the rooms so that when the PCs retreat from the map room, they come back to the observatory, not the barracks they visited two encounters ago.",
			"",
			"Remember, thrust matters more than direction. As you improvise your way through a session, it's tempting to worry about whether you're making decisions-especially plot and setting decisions-that will come back to haunt you later. Ignore those concerns; you'll have plenty of time to tie up loose ends, patch over plot holes, and bring the players back to the main plotline later. You care that the PCs are doing something interesting. The pause while you figure out the perfect encounter diminishes everyone's fun more than the out-of-place detail or the tangential plotline ever could."

Have a powerful patron or mysterious presence somehow resurrect the PCs (or restore them from petrification, etc.) for some greater purpose.

If mid-level characters suffer a TPK when investigating the actions of a demon cult, tell the players to show up at the next session with high-level characters. Then reveal that those characters have recently been taken out of suspended animation by a ragtag band of humans-scattered remnants in a world utterly ruled by demons and their army of tortured slaves.

Do your homework in terms of rules study and arithmetic; you want to make sure that the overall technique is no longer overpowered, not just the specific application you saw at the table. But make sure the PC still has viable options-and that the player still has interesting choices to make during an encounter.",

Talk to that player away from the table before the next session begins, so that everyone's got time to pore over rulebooks and consider alternatives. It's also a good time to tell the player that you're acting for the good of the table, not to save your monsters. Most players respond better to a nerf when they realize they're diminishing others' fun and the change isn't driven by Game Master competitiveness.",

Spell &times;, magic item y, and feat z are fine by themselves, but They've got a problem once a player has all three. When you change the rules to make something less powerful, it's only fair-and certainly doesn't hurt anyone at the table-to let the player retroactively make different character advancement choices to compensate, so they haven't wasted half the game achieving a build that's no longer viable.",

			"**Overpowered Monsters:** Sometimes the proverbial shoe will be on the other foot, and a monster will be unexpectedly powerful. At first, let it play out a bit. Once the power disparity is clear to everyone at the table, take action-either nerf the monster on the spot and tell the players (in general terms) what you've done and why, or forego use of that monster, telling the players that \"the dragon turtle has some problems, which I'm going to fix before our next session.\""

			"Roleplaying games have been around for over 30 years, and there's a huge library of materials out there for other games which you can use in your campaign. One particularly easy conversion is from the 3.0 or 3.5 edition of the world's oldest roleplaying game to the Pathfinder RPG.",
			"",
			"The Pathfinder RPG was designed to be backwardcompatible with the 3.5 rules set. It's possible to integrate the two seamlessly with almost no work; the only big difference in most games is that Pathfinder PCs are a little stronger overall than 3.5 PCs, so your PCs may have an easier time battling things from the old rules. You can run with that, or apply one of three simple fixes below to balance things out:",
			"",
			"**Reduce the CR by 1:** Treat anything from 3.0 or 3.5 as 1 CR value lower.",
			"",
			"**Add the Advanced Creature Simple Template:** Use the easy -+2 to everything- version rather than rebuilding all the old stat blocks.",
			"",
			"**Add Improved Initiative and Toughness:** Pathfinder creatures get more feats than 3.0/3.5 creatures (every odd level rather than ever 3 levels). Adding these two feats for mid-to-high-level creatures helps make up the slight power difference between the two systems.",
			"",
			"Of course, you can also look to other game systems for ideas and adventure materials, it just requires more work on your part. In most cases, searching the internet for fanmade conversion suggestions is a timesaver; most of these suggest skill DCs, replacement spells and magic items, and rough stat blocks or simple replacements (such as swapping the tcho-tcho people of the Lovecraftian mythos for goblins). Use the Pathfinder RPG rules as a resource- the Bestiary includes a wide variety of monsters so you can create the sort of fantasy that you want, and by trading a few proper nouns, you can convert even a superhero, space opera, or hard SF scenario into a fantasy plot."

			"The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, at its simplest level, begins with an easy animosity: one player controls the \"bad guys\" while the others control the \"good guys.\" Add to this the fact that GMs control behind-the-scenes elements, actively concoct schemes to challenge the players, and hold the final say on rules arbitration, and there's ample opportunity for competition, frustration, and hurt feelings. In the best roleplaying groups, both the GM and players figure out ways to avoid these problems.",

At the same time, players share the responsibility for the group's entertainment-including the GM's-and should remain aware that time disproportionately spent on their characters, rules concerns, or out-of-game digressions potentially detracts from other players' opportunities to participate.",

In the best campaigns, players should feel like they have a stake in the ongoing story, and a good Game Master keeps in touch with what game elements the players enjoy most, tailoring the campaign to take advantage of their preferences. In the end, though the GM always has the final say, it's important for everyone involved to remember that it's only a game, and a bit of flexibility here and there results in a more enjoyable experience for everyone in the end."

When designing their characters, players and GMs should consider not just what characters people want to play, but also how those characters might mesh with a larger adventure group in a thematic rather than mechanical sense. Some of the most common inter-party conflicts, both in character and out, stem from issues of disparate alignments, inflexible viewpoints or goals, class prejudices, or racial enmities. While no player can be expected to create a character that meshes perfectly with all the others in his party-and indeed, a bit of tension between characters makes roleplaying more interesting- every player should seek out ways and reasons for a group to work together, rather than focus on bickering that detracts from the adventure.",

Unless an option clearly conflicts with the tone of the game, or the GM feels the power level is unbalanced, it's often a good idea to honor player requests, but ultimately the GM makes the call as to what rules can be used, and this information needs to be available to all players up front to avoid disappointment. When in doubt, you can always allow a power on a provisional basis, with the understanding that you'll help the player rebuild his character if you later reject the rule."

			"In a game featuring as many rules and options as the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, the concept of \"fairness\" has a number of different interpretations. For players, though, fairness largely relates to their interaction with the Pathfinder rules and the group at large.",
			"",
			"In terms of the rules of the game, the same aphorisms that held true in grade school remain true during gameplay: No one likes a cheater. In most games with experienced players, the GM doesn't need to check over every player's character sheet or double-check the math on every bonus. A game operating on dozens of different subsystems requires honesty and goodwill, as the fun of the game lies in the simulation, not the calculations behind it. Misreporting dice rolls, ignoring a vulnerability, or bending the rules in any of a thousand other ways puts the game's integrity in jeopardy, and is ultimately pointless' a character's story is made interesting by the failures as much as by the successes. The danger lies in losing the other players' trust, forcing the game to slow down when the GM inevitably does note discrepancies, and even potentially being asked to leave a game. Yet even though players may give lip service to these ideas, or the fact that there's no such thing as \"winning\" a roleplaying game, sometimes players succumb to temptation, and it's the GM's duty to deal with such players quietly, gracefully-and firmly.",
			"",
			"Beyond simply obeying the rules, however, fairness can also mean sharing the spotlight equally, and ensuring that all players are getting the chance to perform. While not every player is going to be on the edge of his seat every minute, it's a GM's job to watch and see if anyone is hogging the spotlight or being left out. Compromise and sacrifice are needed to keep the game going smoothly, and you should avoid letting players monopolize your attention with their characters' individual needs or interests. Similarly, sometimes characters are knocked out of combat or killed. Although it's no fun to sit out for a portion of a session, players should remain positive and understand that sometimes the dice roll against them-and that you as GM will get them back into the action as soon as possible."

			"Separating the information a player knows from the facts a character possesses regularly proves one of the most difficult challenges players face. \"Metagaming,\" or making decisions based on player knowledge as opposed to character knowledge, quickly erodes the group's belief in the world the GM creates. It often frustrates both the GM and other players when an interesting adventure cracks because a given PC acts on information the character has no way of possessing, and such issues should be dealt with quickly and calmly when they come up.",
			"",
			"To determine if a character's action is appropriate, have the player justify his decision using only information the character knows. For example, if no one in-game has mentioned anything about vampires, but the player knows the GM loves vampires or was looking at vampire miniatures earlier, it's metagaming to have his character stock up on wooden stakes and holy water. If, however, the character remembers the strange marks on the victims' necks and the fact that all the attacks occurred at night (and perhaps makes a skill check to recall any information he has about monsters fitting those criteria), buying wooden stakes is a perfectly justifiable action.",
			"",
			"Metagaming isn't always intentional. If a player isn't certain where the line between player knowledge and character knowledge falls, have him explain in-character why he's making a decision. If he resorts to using game terms or vague statements (or sophisticated concepts that clash with the voice of his Intelligence 7 barbarian), the information likely comes from player knowledge.",
			"",
			"This certainly doesn't mean that characters have to be as dumb as posts, never making decisions unless they are blatantly obvious, but rather that players should strive to process information in the same way their characters would. This is the essence of roleplaying. For example, suppose a wizard character says, \"The orc used sneak attack on us-therefore, he's got to be a rogue, so I won't cast [fireball](spell/fireball). I'll cast [charm person](spell/charm_person) instead; he probably has a weak Will save.\" This is clearly player knowledge: the player described his reasoning using game terms and rules knowledge. Contrast this with the player instead saying: \"The orc is wearing light armor and doing an awful lot of damage with just a short sword. This reminds me of the wererat murderer we fought in Korvosa. That wererat avoided my [fireballs](spell/fireballs) like they weren't even there, so I'm going to try [charm person](spell/charm_person).\" Here the player performs exactly the same action, using the same information, but justifies it with character knowledge instead of directly metagaming. Of course, this isn't an excuse for players to fast-talk their way into metagaming, and if a character has too many justified epiphanies, you may still want to have a talk with the player.",
			"",
			"One particularly sticky area of metagaming has nothing to do with game mechanics, but rather realworld knowledge and intelligence. Sometimes the player who's a genius at solving puzzles and riddles wants to play a dumb brute of a swordsman. This is great-so long as his character isn't still solving all the puzzles. In this situation (or the reverse, where the player who's terrible at puzzles has an Intelligence score of 22), let all the players work together to solve the puzzle, but use skill checks and Intelligence checks to offer hints or determine who actually comes up with the solution. Similarly, don't fall into the trap of letting a player's knowledge base inform the character's beyond what's reasonable. Just because your player knows how to make gunpowder out of bat guano doesn't mean his uneducated halfling cleric does."

			"In real life, players might be justifiably suspicious if a stranger approached them at a bar and offered them money to perform a dangerous task. In a game, however, players who scrutinize plot hooks too closely can cause a GM a lot of stress. These players sometimes make the case that blindly accepting a plot hook (or rushing into battle, or delving into the dungeon) when their character wouldn't likely do so goes against the whole idea of roleplaying. If the player knows the GM wants him to follow the hook and the player accepts, isn't that metagaming?",
			"",
			"In a way, yes. While a good GM is often capable of presenting incentives and circumstances that allow PCs to float seamlessly and justifiably from encounter to encounter, sometimes the GM needs a little help. In these situations, it's important for the players to remember that the rule against metagaming is subordinate to the rule about having fun, and if you as the GM need them to work with you, it's their responsibility to do so.",
			"",
			"Thankfully, no matter what the situation, there's never a time when a creative GM can't help his players find a believable way to undertake a given action. Though it can be frustrating to deal with a player who stubbornly proclaims, \"My character would never do that!\", take a moment to look at the character's backstory and see if there's a potential rationalization, or a previously \"unrevealed\" aspect of the situation that can get the character invested once more. A paladin might normally reject a sinister dark elf's offer, but perhaps in this case she pretends to accept in order to find out what the dark elf is up to. Conversely, maybe the drow forgot to mention that there's several innocent lives at stake, making accepting her offer the only righteous option.",
			"",
			"This doesn't mean that players should always bend over backward to accommodate the GM-if none of the players take to the adventure hook for some unforeseen reason, you've failed to adequately read your party, and it's up to you to repackage the adventure in a more appealing way. Alternatively, if a player genuinely can't think of a good reason for a character to work toward an adventure's ends, saying so might spark a lively in-character discussion and lead other characters to convince him.",
			"",
			"Obstinacy, however, is one of the quickest ways for a player to kill a campaign. A player who refuses to play his character any way but his own, fails to accommodate other players' wishes and interests, or insists on heading off on his own is forgetting the cooperative nature of the game. In this case, it's the GM's responsibility to intervene and speak privately to the player. If working together to add additional plot elements, or coaching the player in more team-based play, doesn't succeed in bringing him back in line with the rest of the group, then it might be best for him to create a new character or resign from the gaming group altogether- perhaps taking his headstrong character on a solo adventure."

			"Just because the session ends, that doesn't mean the game can't follow a player home. Many players make their most meaningful contributions to a game between sessions. Literary-minded or artistic players often keep some manner of in-character campaign journal or sketchbook, depicting the party's exploits from their characters' point of view. This might take the form of notes, an actual penand- ink diary, or posts to an online journal or forum, and can be anything from letters to another character, reports to a related organization, a scholarly work, or a bardic epic. Making such records accessible to the other players (or even the wider gaming community) allows others to share in the group's adventures.",
			"",
			"Although campaign journals serve as the most common creative activity between sessions, no GM should underestimate the imagination of her players. Artistic players might create sketches of their characters, portraits of their enemies, or illustrations of their exploits, while more craft-focused players might help the GM make maps or props of important items, or might fashion costumes or adornments based on their characters. If you have a player looking for such a project, consider bringing them in on one of the creative aspects you don't have time for, whether it's painting miniatures, making maps, or creating a playlist for the game's soundtrack.",
			"",
			"It's not just artists and writers who can help the GM between sessions, either. If you have a trusted player who's particularly adept with the rules (or maybe even GMs himself ), feel free to use him as a resource, perhaps vetting rules supplements proposed by other players and advising you on tricky balance issues, or educating other players in particularly confusing aspects of the game."

			"Even a group that's been playing together for years occasionally finds itself in need of new players. Teaching newcomers, rather than finding established players, brings several challenges but also has the potential for great rewards. This can be particularly challenging when an individual has never played a tabletop roleplaying game before and therefore has no point of reference for such an experience. Whether you find yourself looking for new members, trying to introduce a friend to roleplaying games, or teaching someone who has just become interested, consider the following topics.",
			"",
			"**Meeting New Players:** New players come most readily from your group's extended circle of friends, where potential newcomers' interest and compatibility with the rest of the group is already known or can be reasonably estimated. Beyond existing circles of friends, game stores, gaming conventions, and organized play programs (like Paizo's Pathfinder Society) make great places to meet new players. Many gaming related websites, college campuses, libraries, and coffee houses also host forums where local gamers might network. While all of these options can help bring together fantastic groups, you should always remain aware of the potential dangers of meeting strangers. Always arrange to meet in a public space (such as a local game store, mall, or coffee shop), let loved ones know where you are going, share your contact's information, and never go alone.",
			"",
			"**Introducing Players:** If your group is interested in introducing someone to roleplaying for the first time, the best way to start is by inviting that person to a session. What the new player does at this first session is up to her. If she's most comfortable watching and asking questions, she should do so. If she prefers to learn by doing, playing existing sidecharacters like allied NPCs, familiars, or animal companions allows her to jump in on the side of the PCs; alternatively, the GM might hand over control of a monster to teach her the basics. And of course, there's no better way for her to start than jumping in with a new character, created with the GM's help. If this first session goes well and the new player seems interested in learning more, perhaps it's time to formally invite her to join the group.",
			"",
			"**Teaching New Players:** Learning a roleplaying game's rules is the greatest challenge facing any new gamer, especially when contending with an entire group spouting lingo like a second language. Experienced gamers can do a lot to make the learning process easier. First and foremost, make the new player feel welcome. As GM, you already have a lot on your plate in a given session, and it's often helpful to ask a willing, experienced player to act as a \"buddy\" for the new player, explaining game terms and suggesting actions. Encouragement is especially important during this learning period, and it's crucial that you ask the new player for input in party decisions, as it's easy for newcomers to be overwhelmed by a party already used to working together. Keep in mind that it's not important for the new player to know every rule or option from the start. New players should be made aware of the basics, which can later be added to once they're more comfortable with the game. Other players should also avoid jumping in, as having suggestions offered from multiple directions can prove confusing and frustrating. Providing the player with a cheat sheet of common terms and rules also helps her learn the game. And as helpful as it is for a new player to receive advice and support, it's important to step back periodically and give her a chance to demonstrate what she's learned. With each passing session, she'll need less help, and in time she'll be playing like a veteran.",
			"",
			"A Basic Rules Cheat Sheet is included in the back of this book. Feel free to photocopy it and give it to your new players to assist them in learning the rules and terminology of the game.",
			"",
			"**Beginner's Game:** If you're trying to find a number of new players, or if you know multiple people interested in roleplaying but don't want to interrupt the momentum of an ongoing campaign by bringing inexperienced players up to speed, you might consider running a game just for beginners. Such a game allows all the new players to start at the same point and with about the same base of knowledge. New players don't have to worry about learning both the Pathfinder RPG rules and the details of a long-running campaign at once, as optimally the game starts a new story. They also don't have to feel inexperienced or like a drag on the more adept members of the group-with a beginner's game, new players can take their time with the rules, ask questions, and learn from questions asked by others.",
			"",
			"GMs who choose to run a game for beginners should decide whether they want to make it open to the public or restricted to a select group of friends. While inviting a few interested potential players is usually the easiest course, many game stores and conventions welcome GMs willing to teach new roleplayers. As with any new game or topic, the GM should be patient with beginners, receptive to their questions, and interested in making sure everyone understands what's going on. Not every rule and option needs to be presented from the start; ensuring that everyone is comfortable with the basics before gradually introducing new elements helps to avoid overwhelming anyone. Remember that, first and foremost, the Pathfinder RPG is a game and is most fun when played, so demonstrations, simple combats, and keeping an open forum for questions can not only make for a fun adventure, but can also quickly expand a GM's pool of potential players."

			"There's an important step between creating characters and having that first adventure: forming an adventuring party. Unless your players have discussed connections between their characters in advance, you might find yourself with a disparate group of individuals seemingly unlikely to work toward the same goal. This can prove an extremely daunting task, and may require some quick and clever improvisation, though experienced players are likely to try and make the job easier for you by responding receptively to potential common interests. The less handwaving a GM has to do, however, the stronger a story feels. To help a group deal with the often-awkward first encounter, the following options aid in transforming a group of strangers into a cohesive adventuring party."

			"One of the easiest ways to deal with the first time characters meet is to make it their hundredth time. Working with players to create characters who know each other from the start alleviates much of the hassle of trying to entwine them with one another. Characters may be childhood friends, students of the same master, or relatives who have shared countless experiences before the adventure even begins. Working with the group to create a uniting factor makes explaining why the characters are in the same place at the same time straightforward. Knowing one another doesn't have to mean the characters are friends. Passing acquaintances, respectful peers, or even longstanding rivals might be shoved together by circumstance.",

Shared pasts also provide an excellent means of introducing villains with a connection to the PCs, making the adventure a personal vendetta from the very first encounter."

Both need to clear out the same dungeon, so they might as well work together. It's the PCs' objective, not their history, that brings them together in this case. While such happenstance can easily stretch credulity if numerous adventurers show up at a site all at the same time, chancing upon a character or another group with a similar destination or goal can be made to feel natural if it's done thoughtfully. Unlike the shared past method, the characters must learn to trust one another over time, providing ample opportunities for roleplaying as characters feel each other out and create friendships and rivalries."

			"Few things energize a new gaming group more than sitting down for their first adventure and immediately being told, \"Roll initiative!\" Novels rarely begin at the most boring part of the story, and neither should adventures. Starting the party in the midst of an ambush on their caravan, fighting a fire at their inn, imprisoned in a dungeon, or hearing screams from down the hall begins the adventure immediately. The characters might already be aware of each other, but it's their reactions to the event facing them that initially draws them together, giving the GM a starting point from which to weave a lasting connection.",

Having the players decide upon how the characters met, develop a few connections or rivalries, and determining what shared goals they already have allows a group to forgo the introductory period. While this glosses over many nuances of character motivation and potentially memorable first meetings, it also means that the GM can start an adventure at the first encounter of the adventure and start the story moving forward from there. This method tends to work best for one-night adventures, where specifics of characterization and motivation prove secondary to the excitement of the game, but can also be useful for groups where players are keen on weaving an elaborate group backstory."

If you're comfortable with it, you can try to continue to run events as normal, dealing with each group while the other one is considering its next move so that neither side feels neglected. For instance, this might work well in a combat that spans two different rooms (or two simultaneous combats), and keeping both groups operating as part of the same initiative order during these periods can help ensure that no one is left out for an unfair period of time. In general, though, this is by far the most difficult way to handle a split party.",

			"",
			"**Extra Scene:** If the separation is sure to go on for an extended period, the group might arrange an extra session focusing on only the relevant characters. While a session that includes only some of the characters can sometimes help a campaign (for example, when multiple players know they're going to be absent, or a subgroup wants to go off on a side quest), it can also leave certain players feeling left out of the action. In such cases, a more creative solution might be required. You might have the players whose characters are not being focused on create temporary characters, newly introduced to their companions, or else take control of important NPCs; this approach allows them to accompany their companions for the duration of their side adventure while still maintaining continuity with their existing characters. This method means no players get left out of an adventure, and the entire group remains in tune with all of the story's events.",
			"",
			"**One Man Show:** In cases where a lone character decides to run off on his own, the GM should do what she can to keep the game fun for the player, but by the same token shouldn't feel that she needs to split game time evenly between the majority of the group and the party of one. If a player chooses to take his character away from the central narrative, receiving less of the GM's attention might just be part of the price. Alternatively, a separate solo session or email narrative might be exactly what the player needs to satisfy his character goals without sacrificing any fun for the rest of the group.",
			"",
			"**Go With the Flow:** When the two parties reunite, let it happen. Don't worry that 10 minutes passed for one group and only 5 minutes passed for the other. It's probably not worth it to award experience points differently-few people really care that they get 150 more XP than someone else, and making such distinctions is more likely to foment discord than prevent it."

This can make for fun and rewarding interplay between the player and the GM, but it's important to remember that one player running an entire mini-party of his own risks detracting from other players' chances for participation, and the more cohorts and hirelings a GM must control, the more likely their presence will slow down and complicate the campaign.

			"Over the course of any adventure, there are treasures to find and rewards to win. While the shape of these [rewards](rule/rewards) can vary wildly, the way PCs handle such rewards can create a host of issues, the most common being how to divide treasure fairly. Groups should work out how their party divides treasure early on to avoid tensions mid-adventure, and GMs should watch for signs of growing resentment and offer advice as needed, keeping in mind the following factors.",
			"",
			"**By Need:** While it's easy enough to give every PC an equal share of the coins found or gained by selling art, jewelry, and easily liquidated items, desirable magic items and other unique treasures pose their own problems. If the group finds an item that would be beneficial to a certain character, most groups will allow that character to use it, for the good of all. If two characters want the same item, they can resolve who gets it by determining who would receive the greater benefit. Should this prove unclear or even, the players can determine who gets it by whatever method pleases them-high die roll, sharing the item, or even paying the other person for the privilege of using it-as long as the game keeps moving along. This is a simple system for the players, but relies on you providing equally useful items for every member of the party, which may stretch credulity.",
			"",
			"**By Value:** In a more complex method of handling treasure, the characters collect their loot and wait to divide it until they're safely out of harm's way. Then the gp value of all the items is totaled, and every character takes a turn choosing an item. The value of that item is then subtracted from the character's share of the overall treasure. This system ensures that characters who don't find items they want among the treasure have money to buy other items, while characters who do want treasure items have proportionately less money.",
			"",
			"**NPC Shares:** Seldom discussed, NPCs have their own motives. Does a cohort get a share of the treasure? A hireling or follower? An NPC who's tagging along? An animal companion? Before splitting up treasure, the entire group-and any avaricious NPCs-should be on the same page about where the loot goes in the end (and such issues can conveniently resolve the problem of the character with too many hirelings or cohorts)."

At the same time, a new character with his own unique reasons to pursue the party's goals can mesh easily with an existing party and might have reason to know much of the plot of an ongoing campaign.",

			"Forcing characters to cope with the loss of a party member, however, isn't the only option to dealing with in-game deaths. If a character proves absolutely vital to a game, is the hinge that keeps a player invested, or was slain through an unfair technicality, the GM might consider finding a way to return the character to life. While openly ignoring the rules can feel weak and arbitrary, the GM might concoct a special deific favor or even an adventure-worthy plot to restore the deceased character. Doing so can strengthen a party, rewarding members for their reliance on and willingness to sacrifice for one another, and even give the group new reasons to adventure, but this tactic should be used sparingly lest a group lose its fear of death altogether."

			"Alignment is easily one of the most debated topics in roleplaying, and straddles the line between descriptive element and rules element. How it is treated varies wildly; for some GMs it's merely a two-letter description, while for others it's a web of permissions and restrictions. Sorting out how this system works is important; it determines how players portray their characters, and how you as GM adjudicate certain aspects of the game.",
			"",
			"Alignment exists primarily to define and summarize the moral and ethical tendencies of characters in a game, for both PCs and NPCs, and finds its roots in the fantasy literature that inspires most roleplaying games. Many characters in such stories easily fall into the camps of good or evil, but others straddle the line and seem good in one instance and evil in the next. Additionally, the relationship and outlook of these characters toward matters of law, justice, freedom, and anarchy further divides them. Just as one character might ignore society's rules in order to do what he knows is right, another might work great evil by manipulating laws to his own ends. Alignment is summarized [here](rule/alignment), but the interpretations are endless, and ultimately lie with you as the GM at a mechanical standpoint, and with your players in how they define their characters' morality. Some gamers favor strict alignments and black-and-white judgments, while others prefer a gritty, \"realistic\" game in which morality is relative, and well-intentioned \"good\" characters are capable of terrible atrocities.",
			"",
			"Many of the debates spawned by alignment arise as the system moves beyond mere description to taking on a role that affects the game's rules. While no real-world humans can say they're entirely good or law-abiding, there exist creatures in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game that are fundamentally good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, and some magic depends on judging a character by its alignment. Because game effects are associated with an ultimately subjective system, you should make sure your players understand your interpretation of alignment ahead of time. The following are a few ways you might handle alignment in your game or use it to help players develop their characters."

			"The simplest way to view alignment is as nine literal personalities. If a character is lawful good, he always obeys the law and always does the \"right\" thing, while a chaotic evil character always shirks the law and acts maliciously. This is a system of absolutes, where free will and context mean little, everything is pre-ordained, and every creature has a path. Players who view alignment as predestination might wear alignments like straitjackets, but at the same time, they always know how to roleplay their character's reaction to situations. This proves both helpful and comforting to many players new to or ill at ease with roleplaying. This approach also renders alignment-based rules easy to arbitrate, turning every matter of determining alignment into a simple yes-no question. Problems with this method tend to arise when a game ventures into sketchier moral and ethical situations. A player might become uncomfortable when his lawful good character feels forced to obey the laws of an evil society, or might have trouble in a campaign that requires him to work with those whose alignments differ from his own."

			"Many players tend to focus more on creating characters with consistent, specific personalities rather than alignments. These players envision their heroes' backgrounds, personality traits, attitudes, and goals, and only then choose an alignment that best reflects these facets. A character's alignment then becomes a way of categorizing his personality, rather than defining him and channeling his actions. As long as the player understands the impact of his choice on gameplay, this approach works smoothly. For example, a player who chooses the chaotic neutral alignment needs to understand that certain elements within the game world will judge him based on this decision (as with any other alignment). Some temples might deny him healing because the biggest threat in the region is chaotic monsters, viewing her alignment as grounds for suspicion. This method is also problematic when it becomes too general. Accepting alignment as a broad category can render it almost meaningless and make it difficult for you as the GM to judge whether a character is acting outside of her alignment and arbitrate any game effects associated with doing so."

			"Another way to see alignment is as a series of concentric rings. In the center ring are all the behaviors that are obviously acceptable according to a character's alignment. Around that is a middle circle that covers the gray areas-actions that might be allowed under certain circumstances or are unclear. On the outside is the forbidden area of extreme actions that obviously violate the alignment. Taking prisoners offers examples of all three circles. Accepting an opponent's honorable surrender is clearly good. Torturing that prisoner for information might be in the forbidden area for a given good character. But what about threatening torture, if the PC doesn't intend to carry out the threat? That falls into the middle circle. Taking this route means players must remember their characters' alignment and act accordingly. At the same time, while this route goes far toward suggesting how characters might act in specific situations, debates might arise when group members don't see eye-to-eye about which acts are permissible. Additionally, some characters might have varying access to the gray areas of their alignment, and GMs should discuss where this line exists for characters who face repercussions for deviating from their moral code."

How this change takes shape should be determined by the player and GM. Often, some quest, trauma, rehabilitation, or other life-changing event triggers the alignment change.

Instead of springing this on a player, make it clear when an action risks violating an alignment-related requirement. Sometimes this will be seen as the voice of the character's conscience, and allow the player to refrain from the action or suitably justify it to themselves (and you) to bring it into accordance with their values."

Don't be surprised if the same player exhibits multiple traits; gamer psychology is just as complex as any other, and people are frequently a dash of this and a pinch of that.

While rivalry and good-natured butting of heads can bring an entertaining element to a campaign, outright animosity should be addressed.",
			"",
			"Three steps can often help diffuse such situations:",
			"",
			"**1.** Determine the Source: Most inter-character conflicts are intentional and have been specifically defined by the players. Such clashes aren't always negative elements, especially when they don't interfere with the game and keep a measure of levity. A source of antagonism can add to a campaign; the challenge lies in managing the intensity of the conflict and the likely outcome. Some potential sources of antagonistic conflict include alignment (good and evil; law and chaos), prejudice (against magic or certain races), moral values (caste system, role of women), political beliefs (national or guild-level strife), religion (opposing religion or non-believer), inter-party lies or theft, and xenophobia.",
			"",
			"**2.** Determine the Level of Antagonism: What does the antagonist do when confronted by the source of the conflict? Can the players (both the antagonist and the other group members) still work together when the source of tension arises? If the answer is no, then the player should reduce the level of antagonism, even if it means modifying his character concept. A group whose members can't trust each other or are unwilling to come to one another's aid is an adventuring company that's headed toward early retirement.",
			"",
			"**3.** Identify Possible Resolutions: One player should never be allowed to create a situation that's only fun for him. One of the most dangerous sources of antagonism is a character of an opposing alignment or organization whose primary goal is the destruction of another party member. No one really wins in that situation, and it's likely that the distrust carries over to the next time everyone rolls up characters. In this situation, lay out the problem clearly for the antagonist, and be polite but firm in offering to help the player modify his character or create a new one capable of working within the group."

			"The continuity expert keeps up-to-date with the latest published novels and game supplements. She can cite historical facts buried in small type hundreds of pages into a supplement, and note each diversion from established canon. The moment the new supplement hits the shelves at the local hobby shop, she has devoured its contents and wants to use it in the upcoming game session.",
			"",
			"Unless you are yourself a continuity expert, this can be frustrating. You may want to head off any problems at the pass and simply announce that your version of the setting is your own, and not beholden to any other continuity. If you're trying to play closer to canon, however, it's important that your group know what liberties, if any, your campaign plans to take with the source material. Perhaps your game makes significant changes to a setting or moves forward from a snapshot in a setting's history, meaning that certain existing or future supplements might not seamlessly apply to the campaign's version of a world. That doesn't mean you need to ignore all supplements you aren't already familiar with, merely that players should understand that you'll need time to review such information-and that whether or not you incorporate it is solely your decision.",
			"",
			"During the course of the game, the continuity expert might note deviations from canon or even continuity established during the course of a campaign. Whether this proves helpful, distracting, or completely irrelevant hinges largely on when such comments are presented. Few things can derail a GM's narrative faster than being constantly contradicted about matters of story. In these cases, it often helps to table the discussion and let the expert know that you'll discuss it after the game, or over e-mail. Above all, never forget that you control your game world, not the continuity expert or a game publisher, and what you say goes.",
			"",
			"Like a rules lawyer, a continuity expert can be a great help to a GM. Most prove eager to research elements of a campaign setting and enthusiastically help prepare for upcoming sessions. Canny GMs might find ways to have such a player research multiple useful topics without giving away the intended course of upcoming adventures. During a session, a continuity expert's knowledge can prove exceedingly useful if it has an in-character outlet- encouraging such a player to adopt a knowledgeable class, purchase tomes of relevant lore, or be the group researcher gives her opportunities to exploit and display her knowledge in character and without interrupting the game."

			"The diva is the center of attention, the focus of all roleplaying interactions that occur in the campaign world. Every conversation, introduction, and event is another opportunity for her to shine, while the rest of the group struggles to get a word in edgewise. No matter is too small or insignificant for her; she's ready for the spotlight! Unfortunately, the rest of the players are bored to tears.",
			"",
			"While having a player totally immersed in and excited about the game is every GM's goal, it should never happen at the cost of other players' enjoyment. The diva can truly shine during her turn and those encounters specifically aimed at engaging her character-but when it's someone else's turn, she needs to learn to hang back and give other players chances to take the stage as well.",
			"",
			"In combat, initiative does a good job of keeping the focus moving, but if a character monopolizes NPC interactions, a good counter during heavy roleplaying sessions is to break each conversation up into minute-long spots. You as the GM can then move around the table much like you would during a combat encounter to allow everyone a chance to interact. If the diva interrupts, remind her that this is all occurring at the same time, and that she's busy talking to that other NPC right now. If there's a single NPC and the diva is doing all the talking for the group, have him fixate on someone else or ask for an introduction to her friends.",
			"",
			"In the end, if subtlety doesn't work, you might need to be blunt with the diva in order to get the message across that everyone needs a chance to play. A diva can be a strong party leader, but shouldn't be allowed to dominate group decisions. If the other players seem to be merely following along, ask them directly for their characters' thoughts.",
			"",
			"**The Diva-Loner:** This is a particularly dangerous combination, as the diva wants to take the spotlight while doing something on her own. She might charm a young prince into a moonlit walk along the canals, or decide that she wants to go fight crime after the rest of the party goes to sleep. Whatever the rationale, the solution is the same as for the loner player type: it splits the party and creates a new story that needs to take place off-scene.",
			"",
			"Off-scene encounters can be discussed before or after a gaming session, over email during the week, or whenever other players aren't waiting. As long as the diva isn't doing something crazy or suicidal, there's no reason to punish her, but neither should you have these solo escapades reveal key plot points or allow yourself to be distracted from the rest of the party."

			"The economic heart of most pseudo-medieval campaigns is their businesses, each creating revenue for the local lord and providing specialty shops, guilds, taverns, and other structures needed by adventurers and the common folk. Players generally fall into one of two molds as entrepreneurs, each of which has an impact on local businesses. The first is the player who seeks to sell everything acquired from the bodies of fallen enemies. The second is the businessman who sees an opportunity and wants to stake his claim.",
			"",
			"For both types of entrepreneurs, the GM should follow simple rules to ensure that everyone at the gaming table is having fun. Don't let yourself get locked into rolling on charts for long periods while other players wait, or let the minutiae of the items collected slow down the game. Instead, presume the characters choose the most valuable items' and only the most valuable items-and quickly move the adventure along. While your players might be eager to loot all of the soldiers' short swords, collecting their old boots for sale later is a waste of adventuring time. If a character is big on appraising things, have him roll at the end of each session to ensure that he takes the most valuable possessions with him. Don't slow down the game determining the value of the gilt on a doorframe or the darts in a disabled trap.",
			"",
			"Next, determine how much the player can reasonably recover from the dungeon. Calculating the weight and mass of items can be tedious, but saying that everything in a dungeon is bolted down is unrealistic. The game already has rules for encumbrance, but an easier house rule might be that the character can carry one vaguely defined item (the pieces of a disabled trap, the limbs of a destroyed golem, the brasswork off a vampire's coffin) per point of Strength, with accommodations for any magic items like [bags of holding](magic/wondrous/bag_of_holding_type_1). This speeds the game along and helps prevent stopping every time the GM describes a shiny bit of room dressing. And don't forget that the character's weapons and armor count toward the total-if the entrepreneur wants that third tapestry, he's going to have to leave his sword behind.",
			"",
			"The value of mundane loot is closely tied to the magic level of your campaign, the size of the city the players deliver the goods to, the need for those goods, and the quality and quantity of the goods. Delivering 20 suits of chainmail to a sleepy village likely floods the market and earns a pittance, while that same armor in a town scrambling to arm itself would earn significantly more. As a general rule, try assuming a 10-20% payout where there is a moderate need for the items and then adjust from there."

			"The flake player is one that proves his type over a period of time. He might initially show up on time, fired up and ready to take on the world, but by the fourth game session he's apologizing for not showing up the week before. Suddenly he's showing up every third session, probably late, and looking to pick up where he left off.",
			"",
			"Now the GM has a potential conflict. While the flake has been gone, the other players have advanced their characters a few levels and he's behind them with an unresolved subplot. What should you do?",
			"",
			"First off, talk privately to the player to determine the reasons he hasn't been showing up. Sometimes life demands that we shift our attention elsewhere, and other players are generally understanding of those situations. Maybe there are interparty conflicts or a particular storyline that's been making the game less appealing. It's all about communication; no player should make other players wait 30 minutes to see if he's going to show up this week. Respecting other people's time goes a long way toward cultivating goodwill.",
			"",
			"Since any player can potentially turn into a flake, it's useful to avoid creating adventures that revolve around every player being present. It's fine to assume that a particular character participates in the adventure (run by you, if need be), but hinging everyone's fun on any one character makes it easy to be disappointed.",
			"",
			"It's good to have explicit rules for how you want to handle missing players. You might assign a penalty on earned experience if a player misses a game session, while letting him stay fairly close to the rest of the group in terms of advancement even when circumstances conspire to keep him away. This generally balances itself out over time, and everyone ends up fairly close in experience (making it much easier for you to plan encounters).",
			"",
			"To be respectful of others, try using e-mail or other electronic means to have players RSVP to the gaming session. This lets everyone know who is showing up. And if something happens at the last minute, players can contact everyone to let the group know.",
			"",
			"If a player missing out on sessions truly cripples a group, consider using NPCs to fill the same role. The rest of the party can temporarily adopt or hire these NPCs to make up for missing skills, and the NPC's wages are a small price to pay for a well-timed fireball or backstab- especially if they come out of the missing character's share of treasure."
