Since even the most magically disinclined individuals can clearly tell that the wearer is enshrouded in an illusion, a liar's robe is typically used in circumstances when it's appropriate to protect the wearer's anonymity without the wearer feigning another identity or hiding her presence.",

Once per day when casting a summon monster or summon nature's ally spell, the wearer can have the robe absorb one of the creatures summoned rather than have it appear within the spell's range. When this occurs, the robe gains a defensive aura and takes on visual aspects of the absorbed creature (such as becoming red and spiked if absorbing a demon, or manifesting flame patterns if absorbing a fire elemental). The creature does not exist outside its effect as a defensive aura of the robe as detailed below, and cannot be damaged or targeted by most spells. It is still a magical effect, and any spell or ability that could dispel or disrupt a creature summoned by summon monster can dispel or disrupt the defensive aura. The defensive aura is also dispelled if the robe enters an area a summoned creature could not enter, or at the end of the duration of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature. If the wearer takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than 5 hit points per level of the spell that summoned the absorbed creature, the defensive aura ends.",

The wearer does not change form, gain any ability score modifiers, have her gear meld into her body, or lose any abilities based on her form. She is considered to be under the effects of a polymorph spell, and cannot be under the effects of another polymorph spell or size-altering magic for the duration of the defensive aura. The abilities the defensive aura grants are otherwise determined by the type of creature absorbed. If the creature is an elemental, the wearer gains the abilities listed in [elemental body III](spell/elemental_body_3); if it's a plant, the wearer gains the abilities listed in [plant shape II](spell/plant_shape_2); if it's an undead, the wearer gains the abilities listed in [undead anatomy III](spell/undead_anatomy_3).

In addition, once per day as a swift action the wearer can cause a creature within 30 feet to spark and shimmer with electrical energy. While this does not harm the creature, it does cause the creature to emit light like a torch, preventing it from gaining any benefit from concealment or invisibility.

Created by the pactmasters of Katapesh to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in Katapesh, punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of Katapesh's government or army or to damage any structure in the city of Katapesh counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects.

			"Slave collars are popular items among drow, duergar, and other Darklands societies that require obedience and servitude from slave castes. As these collars are relatively costly, they are typically reserved for use on particularly powerful or desirable slaves. A slave collar consists of a simple ring of metal (typically brass or bronze) that latches in place with a lock. Many feature additional adornments like short lengths of chain. Each slave collar's lock is attuned to a unique key. The person who carries a collar's key is aware of that collar's wearer as if it were the target of a constant status spell. In addition, the key carrier can communicate telepathically with the wearer of the collar as long as the wearer is within 100 feet of her. As long as a slave collar is worn, that collar's key carrier automatically penetrates the collar wearer's spell resistance (if any), and the collared creature takes a -5 penalty on all saving throws against the key carrier's spells. A slave collar's lock can be picked with a successful DC 40 Disable Device check, or broken open with a successful DC 30 Strength check-either method immediately destroys the slave collar. The wearer of a slave collar takes a -10 penalty on Disable Device or Strength checks made to disable the slave collar it wears.",

Once per day the wearer can activate the talisman to summon a hellmouth, which takes the form of Jyangzipao, an eyeless, amphisbaenic underworld dragon with corroded iron scales.

The portal cannot connect to any other locations, so should the wearer of the Iron Road pass through the gate and linger in Hell for more than 10 minutes, the hellmouth closes behind him and traps him in Hell.

For those requiring more immediate boons, Hasharizi is always willing to tailor an infernal contract to meet her patron's needs.",

Riffle scrolls are treated exactly as scrolls for the purposes of deciphering the writing, activating the spell, and determining its effects (including the chances for mishaps), save for the fact that riffle scrolls do not require verbal components-they automatically function as if they were cast using the [Silent Spell](feat/silent_spell) metamagic feat. Activating a riffle scroll provokes attacks of opportunity just like casting a spell. Magical silence does not interfere with using a riffle scroll. Activating a riffle scroll requires one free hand. A riffle scroll uses the normal casting time for the inscribed spell, even if the user or creator is of a class that has increased casting times when using metamagic effects.",
			"",
			"Riffle scrolls are somewhat heavier than normal scrolls; a single riffle scroll weighs 1 pound. Each riffle scroll has an AC of 9, 5 hit points, hardness 0, and a break DC of 10. Riffle scrolls cannot be kept in standard scroll tubes; they are normally transported in flat leather cases or boxes similar to containers used to transport books.",
			"",
			"Riffle scrolls can be created by any spellcaster who has the [Scribe Scroll](feat/scribe_scroll) and Silent Spell feats. Scribing a riffle scroll is more time-consuming and expensive than scribing normal scrolls because of the greater number of pages and more complex magic involved. A riffle scroll's market price is equal to the spell level &times; the caster's level &times; 25 gp-but note that only spells that have been modified by the Silent Spell metamagic feat can be crafted into riffle scrolls. This affects the spell's effective spell level for the purposes of determining the riffle scroll's price. Effectively, a riffle scroll costs about the same as a normal scroll of one spell level higher. This also means that 9th-level spells cannot be made into riffle scrolls, because there are no 10th-level spell slots. Abilities that reduce the level adjustment of the Silent Spell feat do not affect riffle scrolls.",
			"",
			"To scribe a riffle scroll, you must use up raw materials costing half of its market price. Scribing a riffle scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price, with a minimum of 1 day of work. Although an individual riffle scroll might contain more than one spell, each spell must be scribed as a separate effort, meaning that no more than 1 spell can be scribed in a day.",

			"The Shoanti have developed numerous types of magical war paint, each providing a specific benefit to aid their hunters, warriors, and heroes in a variety of tasks. Shoanti war paint can be applied to any visible part of the body-typically the face, shoulders, legs, or arms. Applying a dose of war paint is a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Shoanti war paint does not take up a magic item slot, but you can benefit from only one color of Shoanti war paint at a time and applying a dose of a different color replaces the effects of the previous application. Once Shoanti war paint is applied, its effects last for 24 hours. Below are the eight most common colors and their effects. Black (1,800 gp): The wearer becomes cloaked in shadows and smoke, gaining the effects of a [blur](spell/blur) spell. Blue (900 gp): The wearer gains a 30-foot enhancement bonus to her base move speed. Green (900 gp): When the wearer uses [bardic performance](unknown/bardic_performance) to inspire courage, the morale bonus she grants increases by 1. Orange (900 gp): The wearer gains damage reduction 1/-. This effect stacks with damage reduction gained via a character class, such as [barbarian](class/barbarian). Red (900 gp): The wearer gains fire resistance 10. Silver (900 gp): The wearer gains a +3 deflection bonus to her AC. White (1,800 gp): The wearer gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against energy drain and negative energy. As soon as the wearer takes a negative level from an energy drain attack, the white war paint absorbs the negative level and then fades away, ending the ongoing duration of the paint's effect immediately. Yellow (900 gp): The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Perception checks.",

By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an anatomy doll cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood.",

A neverspill goblet does not dispense its contents for someone unwilling to drink from it. The magic of the goblet also keeps fluids from accidentally entering the goblet. This does not prevent poisoning (since the poisoner's addition is intentional), but means if a neverspill goblet is placed underwater and removed, its original contents remain undiluted. It is therefore possible to drink a potion from a neverspill goblet while underwater. Most neverspill goblets are made from light, portable materials such as wood or pewter, or come in larger sizes. Its magical nature does not prevent it from corrosion by acid. Liquids placed in a neverspill goblet do not succumb to the ravages of temperature or time, a fact that more than one adventurer has taken advantage of on journeys.",

			"A Chelish Crux is a cunning puzzle box that, when closed, contains an interior space far larger than its exterior would suggest. A Chelish Crux appears to be a 6-inch-diameter wooden-and-metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12). Each of the crux's 12 surfaces is carved with a different shape or rune, and when an observer looks at the item, she has the unsettling sensation that too many sides can be seen at once. Shaking or rolling the box reveals that it is hollow, as objects within rattle and shift (though no amount of shaking can damage the objects within).",
			"",
			"In order to open a Chelish Crux, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time one is traced in the correct order, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever one is traced out of order, the runes flash brightly; this burns the person attempting to open the crux and causes all faces to deactivate, forcing the opening process to start anew. Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the box to randomly establish a new activation order.",
			"",
			"A character can attempt a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box. Each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at this point, the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and deals 2 points of fire damage plus 2 points for each previous failure to the character (Reflex DC 15 half); the amount of damage resets to 2 if the activation order is reset.",
			"",
			"A Chelish Crux can be forced open with a successful DC 28 Strength check or destroyed through physical damage (hardness 10, hp 30). If a crux is forced open in either of these ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, dealing 3d6+6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 half) to all creatures and objects within the burst, including any objects held within the crux. If forced open or destroyed, the crux crumbles to ashes, and any objects it contained fall to the ground at the site of the fiery burst.",
			"",
			"When opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-footsquare flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit on the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds up again as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners (a move action). The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically with 3 consecutive full-round actions.",
			"",
			"A Chelish Crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish Crux functions as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining how long a living creature within can survive, or what happens when the box is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole ( Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 501)",

Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist-brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this \"board\" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work.",
			"",
			"To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient spirits of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the spirits by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the spirits depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The spirits reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"maybe,\" or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The spirits answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below).",

			"Communication with spirits can be a dangerous task, for many spirits are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry spirits. In some areas where the spirits are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The spirits in the area are not omniscient-the GM should decide whether or not the spirits would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically \"maybe.\" If the GM determines that the spirits are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the spirits speak truthfully or whether they lie.",

Attempts at mundane forgery also slide off the sealed document in 2d4 rounds, reverting the writing to its original state. An heirloom seal cannot be used on runes or any form of magical writing. Each seal has its own unique mark to indicate its owner, which can be magically verified with either [detect magic](spell/detect_magic) or read magic.",

The field scrivener's desk attempts to address this need. This magic desk can be folded up into a 3-inch-wide cube of lacquered wood for easy transport. Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or Medium author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere centered on the desk's location-this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course, the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties a field scrivener's desk is used solely for this effect.",

Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within.

A psychic aurascope acts in all ways as a haunt detector, but in addition, while the aurascope's bulb is touching a creature or object, the user can utter a command word to activate the aurascope, causing the vapor contained within it to rapidly shift between multiple hues for as long as it continues to touch that creature or object. The hues displayed within the aurascope relate to the touched creature or object's alignment aura, emotion aura, health aura, and magic aura, allowing the user to use the read aura occult skill unlock once per day, even if she has no levels in an occult class or doesn't have the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If the user has levels in an occult class or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, she can attempt a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + the creature's Hit Dice or the item's caster level and apply the result to all of the target's auras instead of just one single aura. The user can use this version of the read aura occult skill unlock at will; it doesn't count as her one daily use of the read aura skill unlock.",

The DC to identify a haunt's elements with a psychic aurascope is equal to 20 + the haunt's CR, which allows the user to determine one of the haunt's elements, chosen randomly.

Once activated in this manner, the codex of conversations begins recording any verbal communication that occurs within 20 feet of it, inscribing the words upon its pages in whatever language they are uttered. If the language being spoken has no written form, the inscription occurs phonetically in whichever language the book's activator specifies.

The codex can't record anything other than the spoken word, so it can't inscribe musical notes if a song is sung. It can record verbal components to spells, but the resultant verbiage is not magical and can't be used to cast the spell or be read as a scroll.

The device creates an abstraction of north, east, south, and west, as well as up, down, in, out, back, forward, past, future, and a variety of other directions that can prove helpful in navigating the planes. Despite diverse cosmetic differences, astralabes share a uniform internal design and, by and large, give consistent, shared directions. As such, many-if not most- planar cartographers utilize astralabes when creating maps, allowing travelers to navigate lands without magnetic poles or with malleable terrains as though there were one consistent north. The device keeps a constant orientation, but it does not adjust or circumvent hazards or show particular paths. Any creature not on the Material Plane who employs an astralabe while attempting a Knowledge, Survival, or similar skill check to navigate gains a +4 bonus on that check.",
			"",
			"Additionally, an astralabe can aid a traveler in preparing to travel to another plane. The device can read emanations from portals, gates, and other connections between the planes and display them upon its surface. These displays can be interpreted with a successful Knowledge (planes) check. A user must typically succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check to correctly read an astralabe, though demiplanes and stranger realms might require a higher DC or yield inconclusive results. Those who succeed learn the name of the plane beyond the portal, though not the portal's exact location upon that plane-it doesn't reveal tiers, layers, or subrealms, in the case of planes divided into multiple parts. Those who fail the check are unable to tell what plane lies beyond. Those who fail the check by 10 or more incorrectly identify what plane lies beyond, with the details of this misinformation determined by the GM.",
			"",
			"Astralabes generally don't function on the Material Plane, shutting down and emanating an aura of only faint divination. However, should one be brought within 20 feet of a portal or similar passage to another plane, it becomes active for as long as it remains nearby.

Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as focus items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another focus. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars.",

A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.",

This is a divination effect and otherwise works as per true seeing.",

If the creature is under the effects of a spell with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as per dispel magic) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it fails this saving throw, the bearer of the moonlight lantern can choose another of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger doesn't need to spend an action to do so. The target must remain in the chosen form for at least 1 minute before it can shift again.",

As a swift action, the wearer can activate the bracer, creating a nimbus of crackling blue energy that surrounds the hand wearing the electro-temporal bracer for up to 3 minutes each day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. While the nimbus is active, spells with the electricity descriptor cast by the wearer have an additional effect, chosen by the wearer as each spell is cast: the spell dazzles all targets of the spell for 1 round, the spell staggers a single target of the spell for 1 round, or the spell provides a single target of the spell the benefits of [haste](spell/haste) for 1 round. The staggered and [haste](spell/haste) effects affect only one target selected by the caster as the spell is cast, even if the spell affects multiple targets. There is no saving throw for these additional effects, but a target that avoids the effects of the electricity spell entirely (such as by negating the effect with a successful save, or by having immunity to the spell's damage) is not subject to the additional effect.

The Bloodwind willingly follows the commands of moon-beasts and denizens of Leng, but plays cruel jokes on others, both slaves and slavers alike: untying knots, raising its anchor at inconvenient times, or even folding into a box and obstinately refusing to return to ship form. The Bloodwind's favorite prank is to surreptitiously unlock a new slave's manacles to offer the hope of freedom, and then snap them shut again-preferably bloodying a finger or toe in the process.",
