A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own.

Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise.",

When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible."

For its part, a dragon turtle quickly grows to appreciate and even expect such tithes and gifts, and a dragon turtle that expects gifts but is ignored is a dangerous foe indeed.",

The coloration of the head, tail, and legs is slightly paler than the shell and contains golden streaks along the crest and spines.",
			"",
			"Dragon turtles claim vast territories in the open seas, encompassing regions often in excess of 50 square miles. Here, these dangerous beasts capsize ships that fail to respect their territories, adding the sunken wrecks and their valuable cargoes to their lairs. Dragon turtles generally make their homes in deep caves only accessible through the water, and often decorate their lairs not only with the wealth seized from ships they've sunk, but the wrecks of these unfortunate ships themselves. Their territorial natures and fondness for these types of lairs put them in direct conflict with other undersea races such as merfolk and sahuagin.",
			"",
			"Large fish, such as tuna, sturgeons, and even sharks, rank among dragon turtles' favorite foods, but being omnivores, they also sometimes feed on large undersea fields of seaweed. They certainly aren't above supplementing their diets with the passengers of ships they sink, although such feeding is not borne of any intrinsic evil or cruelty. Dragon turtles possess shells 15 feet in diameter, with their appendages stretching a few feet further, and measure over 25 feet long from the tip of their noses to the ends of their powerful tails."

Once a dragonkin forms this bond, it can't form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its bonded rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy with a range of 100 feet. When a rider is mounted on his dragonkin at the start of combat, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result.",

			"",
			"The most unusual aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin recognize other cultures' potential, and often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they seem to be one entity. The humanoid riders are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions when they are not engaged in battle, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude.",
			"",
			"Many dragonkin adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor. This, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, disgusts some true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds."

While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent.",

Creatures that draw too close to a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar, followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and pounce.",
			"",

A character with the {feat/Leadership} feat can take a dragonne as a cohort. Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger.",

Drawing near the likely path of its victims, it bursts from the sand or dives from above to catch foes off guard, preferring to attack targets that exhibit the most fear first. Before enemies can recover from the initial onslaught, a desert drake exhales a cloud of electrified dust, using its superior senses to press the attack.

			"**Ghost Touch Jaws (Su)** A drocha swarm's many biting jaws are considered to have the ghost touch special ability. This allows it to deal its swarm damage to corporeal foes, and to deal normal damage to incorporeal creatures such as ghosts, shadow demons, and even other drocha swarms.",
			"",
			"**Project Death (Su)** As a standard action, a drocha swarm can target a creature within 30 feet and cry mournful wails that fill the listener with images of its own death. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save to steel itself against this morbid onslaught. If that save fails, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save succeeds, the victim takes 4d6 points of damage. A creature that successfully saves against the initial Will save is not subject to the same drocha swarm's project death ability for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The opening of the Worldwound brought many horrors to the world, and one of the more tragic and horrible results was the elimination of the Sarkorian people. The mass deaths of these people spawned roiling clouds of unquiet spirits called drocha swarms. Each made of the spirits of hundreds of Sarkorians who died at once, these ghostly swarms reveal the screaming faces of those who once lived and thrived in this verdant land. Their lives were cut short either by the ripping open of the terrain itself or by the demons that subsequently poured forth from the Abyss. Now, these tortured swarms of spirits roam the Worldwound, alone or in packs. Drocha swarms are devoid of the goodliness and respect for nature they had in life. All these tortured souls can do is scream and torment others, and though incorporeal, their razor-sharp teeth materialize just long enough to tear at any creatures they happen across.",
			"",
			"Mostly translucent, drocha swarms contain only the faintest traces of black and green delineating the writhing mouths and rolling eyes of the faces within. The faces moan independently, creating a cacophony of voices, each shouting rage at its death or screaming for others to listen to the story of its plight. It would be maddening to pick out individual voices and follow their terrible cries. The swarm can expand and contract as necessary, pouring over enemies and draining them of the life drocha swarms were so violently denied, an action that does not seem to bring the pitiful creatures any relief from their hideous afterlife.",
			"",
			"It is postulated drocha swarms can form anywhere death has occurred on a massive scale. Before the Worldwound opened, they were virtually non-existent in the Inner Sea region, though some theorize the Sodden Lands could have their own form of drocha swarms made up of those who perished when the Eye of Abendego formed and ravaged the Lirgeni people, practically eliminating them from the Inner Sea.",
			"",
			"The dead individuals that make up a drocha swarm have lost any identity they once had and are hideously transformed; they are now horrific vehicles of undeath, created only when the conditions are right. As dead souls trapped on the Material Plane are wont to do, drocha swarms are angry and vengeful, and attack any living thing near them with impunity.",
			"",
			"Since these swarms are composed of undead spirits, once reduced to 0 hit points, drocha swarms are immediately destroyed instead of dispersing. Whether these unquiet spirits are then freed from their connection to the Material Plane and are able to pass on to the Boneyard is unclear. Many scholars believe that destroyed drocha swarms do not pass on to their final judgment and instead are flung to different edges of the Worldwound, where they slowly reform. These scholars state that the real tragedy in regard to putting these horrifying beings out of their tortured misery is that those who defeat them are not liberating the tortured souls, but rather just postponing future encounters with new drocha swarms. This theory is telling, for if drocha swarms were indeed destroyed, there would be fewer and fewer of them every year. However, encounters with these deadly swarms have shown no hint of letting up.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Drocha swarms typically stay in the area in which they died, repeatedly going over the same territory in an ostensible attempt to understand why the villages and cities in which they lived are no longer there. In contrast, some drocha swarms float all about the Worldwound attacking demons and humanoids alike. When drocha swarms attack demons, their screams and wails change tone and pitch, as if the spirits understand demons were responsible for their demise.",
			"",
			"Because of their roaming nature, these swarms infrequently encounter each other. As unintelligent undead, drocha swarms have no society. Even when swarms come across each other, they seem unaware of each other's existence - which is perhaps unsurprising since drocha swarms focus on living things.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions, drocha swarms have been reported to collide with each other. When this event occurs, a strange thing happens. The two (or more) swarms appear to merge together, the translucent cloud of screaming faces darkening and billowing out in an even more chaotic roil. The screaming faces that float within the deadly mass pass through one another in a twisted dance and the volume of their wails increases to a painfully uncomfortable level. The merged swarm pulses and continues to grow larger than the volume of the two individual drocha swarms. This horrid mass coalesces and ceases flying, coming to rest on the ground, and remaining stationary for hours at a time. During this period, living creatures can actually approach the merged swarm without the drocha swarms pursuing them, though some have reported that pseudopod-like appendages stretch out from the mass and probe the air in the direction of the living. After several hours, the wails and shrieks build to a crescendo loud enough to make one's ears bleed and the area of the swarm's fear aura doubles. Once this happens, the merged cloud of drocha swarms rapidly pulses, then dramatically contracts to the size of a single drocha swarm. It's unknown whether the two merge and take up the same space or one swarm takes over the other. Some believe the two swarms engage in a brutal battle with one another until a single swarm is destroyed. It's believed this is the only way the component spirits can be freed from their tortured existence, but what truly happens in these rare circumstances is unknown.",
			"",
			"To the few untainted individuals who still call the Worldwound home, drocha swarms are as infamous as demons for their ability to cause destruction and turmoil wherever they go. Because they are clearly not demons, however, a few stories have emerged in the hundred years that drocha swarms have existed. Some say the Sarkorians, who nervously predicted the thinness of their realm, deserve their fate for not fleeing. Others say there was no way the Sarkorians could have predicted their fates. Still others claim the Sarkorians are the victims of a greater force, which needed thousands of lives to manifest its evil nature on the Material Plane. Who is correct is anyone's guess."

			"",
			"Drochtacs are evil fey that, given their mottled skin and many limbs, are almost verminlike in appearance. These creatures move in an undulating motion, with each pair of a drochtac's feet taking turns dragging its body along the ground. Although a drochtac looks emaciated, the muscles between its ribs are powerful and allow the creature to quickly stretch its body like a spring. This enables the creature to attack targets far beyond its apparent reach, often to the shock and terror of its enemies. Unfortunately for drochtacs' prey, these vicious fey can survive in a wide variety of climates.",
			"",
			"The flesh of a drochtac contains vomit-inducing chemicals that, when ingested, cause nausea in most living creatures. For this reason, these fey creatures have few natural enemies. Rather, drochtacs are patient ambush predators that prefer to catch creatures close to their own size. Drochtacs prefer to make meals out of intelligent creatures, as they find this prey requires them to employ more advanced hunting and stalking skills than when they're hunting animals or other low-intelligence creatures.",
			"",
			"Also, despite their violent natures, drochtacs are curious creatures that enjoy talking to their victims before killing them. Sometimes, although rarely, drochtacs keep their prey alive for weeks if the victims can keep them entertained with stories (and the fey creatures can find something else to eat). When very hungry, however, they often do not even bother to kill their paralyzed victims before they start eating them.",
			"",
			"Drochtacs often stalk small parties of travelers or lost wanderers, waiting for just the right time to strike; in this way, they ensure that their hunting skills stay sharp. Their metabolisms are slow; and after gorging on a creature of suitable size, a drochtac can go for weeks without eating. When they're not hunting, drochtacs lair in secluded ravines, inside the hollows of large trees, or in caves or other places abandoned by larger predators. Drochtacs also use such places to bear and rear their offspring, turning once peaceful spots into terrifying dens of many-legged young."

A dryad who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded tree immediately becomes sickened. Every hour thereafter, she must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist becoming nauseated for an hour. A dryad that is out of range of her bonded tree for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows-eventually, this separation kills the dryad.

Some keep one or more charmed humanoids in their territory to fend off or lead away attackers. Incapacitated foes are typically dragged to the edge of the forest by the dryad's allies and left there, but evil or overtly hostile ones are killed once combat is over."

			"",
			"Duskwalkers are tall, bipedal, gray-skinned beings with a connection to Pharasma's Boneyard. They manifest directly on the Material Plane, incarnating from souls that have earned the honor of a second life. The souls that become duskwalkers have often distinguished themselves in the eyes of psychopomps as guardians of the cycle of birth and death. Other than their gray skin, their physical features bear some resemblance to those they held in their previous lives. As such, a typical duskwalker looks mostly human, other than her unusual coloration. However, duskwalkers whose ancestors belonged to other races can manifest with characteristic features such as pointed ears, hairy feet, or even feathers, horns, scales, or tails - though they rarely manifest smaller or larger than Medium.",
			"",
			"The first duskwalkers appeared as the result of a bargain between two powerful psychopomps: an olethros mother and a yamaraj. The olethros mother made the case to allow certain souls whose actions helped preserve and protect the cycle of souls, but whose lives had been cut short of what fate had decreed for them to reincarnate once before passing to their final judgment. After a long debate, the yamaraj agreed but imposed a strict limit on the number of duskwalkers that can exist at one time. Whenever this limit has been reached, dead duskwalkers cannot be restored to life. Most duskwalkers accept this limitation and appreciate that the end of their lives opens the door for new lives to begin. Some request that those mourning their deaths also celebrate the birth of a new duskwalker in the near future. The length of time it takes for a new duskwalker to be born when one dies varies, but is rarely more than a year.",
			"",
			"When a duskwalker is born, she appears spontaneously in a sanctified place with a connection to death, most often a graveyard or a temple. Duskwalkers do not experience infancy, instead beginning their lives with the appearance and facilities of a roughly 8-year-old human child. These mysterious children always appear cloaked in simple white robes, with a small satchel of food and water by their sides. Duskwalker children mature at a variable rate depending upon the support they receive. A child adopted into a nurturing family or taken into care at a temple matures at a rate similar to that of a human child and develops a healthy balance between her appreciation for life and her interest in death. While duskwalker children almost always appear near settlements, the unusual circumstances of their creation sometimes lead them to be ostracized to the point where they are forced to fend for themselves. Duskwalker children who endure such circumstances reach physical and intellectual maturity rapidly, but they struggle socially and emotionally.",

			"Duskwalker naming conventions are varied. Many duskwalkers prefer to select their own names shortly after they manifest. Duskwalkers who have a good relationship with their surrounding community choose names that follow that community's traditions. Isolated duskwalkers make up their own conventions, naming themselves after their accomplishments or values or even just selecting a string of syllables that sounds nice to them.",
			"",
			"The role of duskwalkers has changed somewhat since the beginning of the Age of Lost Omens, when prophecy failed. Prior to that time, only souls that were destined to perform roles that would serve the Boneyard's interests would be reincarnated as duskwalkers. With prophecy in disarray, however, duskwalkers began to shape their own fates. Some duskwalkers receive occasional visitations or messages from psychopomps, intended to steer them toward certain tasks, but they are under no obligation to follow this guidance. Still, because of their origins, most duskwalkers have an innate respect for the cycles of birth and death. They tend to gravitate toward positions and occupations that allow them to protect this cycle, such as hunters of the undead, midwives, morticians, and priests.",
			"",
			"Because duskwalkers are so rare, the few duskwalker communities that exist are small and form mostly among individuals united by a common goal, such as adventuring bands of undead-hunters. Many duskwalkers go their entire lives without meeting another member of their race. Instead, they usually live among whichever races are most common near the graveyards in which they manifested. Duskwalkers meet with mixed reactions from human communities. Some people look askance at their ashen appearance and the manner of their creation. Others find the way in which duskwalkers relate to death unsettling. Duskwalkers struggle to understand the fear and hesitance with which most other races speak of death, and even cheerful duskwalkers tend toward dark and morbid senses of humor. However, other communities value or even revere duskwalkers for their wisdom, skill at medicine, and proficiency at fighting undead. Duskwalkers get along particularly well with members of other races that share a planar heritage, such as aasimars, aphorites, ganzis, and tieflings, but they share a mutual distrust with dhampirs.",
			"",
			"Despite the prejudices they sometimes face, duskwalkers are typically companionable, open-minded, and accepting of people. They seek friendships and romantic relationships with others of many different races. Many duskwalkers seek to build a family with children at some point in their lives. They grow their families by adopting children from their communities, with a particular preference toward children that other prospective parents may look over. Most have no interest in sexual relationships, though, and no duskwalker is capable of bearing or siring biological children.",
			"",
			"Duskwalkers are typically neutral in their alignment, like psychopomps themselves. Those who are not neutrally aligned tend toward good alignments over evil ones. Pharasma is the most popular deity among duskwalkers, but Sarenrae and the empyreal lord Ashava also command sizable followings. Members of a growing contingent of evil duskwalkers have been rejecting their inborn nature entirely, throwing in their lot with the sahkils, who delight in such perversion. These duskwalkers can lose the abilities that help them combat undead and gain powers better suited to inflicting fear, but such choices also have a chance of altering their ward against corruption in a particularly unsettling way. Such duskwalkers inevitably find that not only can they become undead, but that their deaths all but guarantee some form of unnatural unlife after death, often coming back as a ghost without such an entity's classic inability to travel far from the place of its death."

When it feels (via tremorsense) prey walk into a square it threatens, it can deflate its body as an immediate action, causing the sand and other loose soil above to shift and slide. All creatures who were standing in the dust digger's reach must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled as long as they remain in the dust digger's reach. All creatures who were standing at least partially in the dust digger's actual space must make a DC 15 Reflex save or become entangled and fall prone - if such a creature makes this save, it immediately moves to the closest adjacent unoccupied square. If this results in more than a 5-foot move, the creature moves that distance and then falls prone. The save DC is Strength-based.",

At the fleshy center of the creature's body gapes a circular maw lined with large sharp teeth.",
			"",
			"As ambush predators, dust diggers spend the majority of their lives buried beneath the sand, waiting patiently for prey to stumble over their ambush site.",
			"",
			"Dust diggers are asexual. They reproduce by budding, splitting off young three to four times over the course of their 10-year lives-smaller versions of themselves that must immediately move away from the parent to avoid being snatched up and eaten. Dust digger young are just over 4 feet across, and can move relatively quickly through sand (their burrow speed is 40 feet). Usually, a young dust digger travels at least a mile from its parent before it settles down to create its first ambush - the amount of life in the region it has chosen as its new lair often determines whether the new dust digger thrives or starves to death, for once it digs its first ambush, it rarely moves more than a few hundred feet away over the course of its life."

Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew."

Although native to warm waters, echeneises sometimes follow trade vessels elsewhere. Because echeneises prefer murky shallows, sailors rarely notice one before it begins to slow a vessel. The sharp and sturdy spines atop the creatures' backs scrape the hulls of ships to which they are attached, so sailors lament both the short-term inconvenience and the long-term damage caused by these pests. Old boats with hundreds of scrape marks on their bottoms garner reputations as cursed, and their captains face a serious stigma when trying to recruit crews. It is true that some ships draw echeneises more than others, but apart from the ship's size there is no indication as to what else might attract the creatures.",

If successful, it attempts a psychically channeled coup de grace that inflicts 16d4+16 points of damage. If the victim is slain (or already dead), the egophage usurps control of the body as per greater possession cast on a living body, with an unlimited duration. A host body may not have been dead for longer than 1 day for this ability to function, and even successfully inhabited bodies decay to uselessness in 7 days (unless this time is extended via a gentle repose spell). As long as the egophage occupies the body, it knows and can speak any language known by the victim, and also knows basic information about the victim's identity and personality, though it has none of the victim's specific memories or knowledge. Once possessed, the host regains its full hit points-despite the fact that it's technically a corpse, it appears, detects, and acts as a living creature of its type. Damage done to a host does not harm the egophage, and if the host body is slain, the egophage emerges and is dazed for 1 round.

			"**Cult Mind (Su)** An egregore is created by the combined will of a number of cult members equal to its Hit Dice (minimum 13), and can have a maximum number of members in its cult mind equal to its Hit Dice. Each member must be an intelligent, living creature. These cultists pour their collective psychic consciousness into the collaborative creation of the egregore, granting each member a number of advantages. Creating an egregore involves a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp per Hit Die of the egregore. New creatures can be added to the cult mind only if previous members die or depart (see below). Adding a new member to the cult mind requires a ritual lasting 1 day and costing 1,000 gp. All the other members who are still a part of the cult mind must be present during this ritual or it fails. ",
			"",
			"As long as a member of the cult mind is within 1 mile of the egregore, the egregore can use any of its spell-like abilities on that member, regardless of the spell's range. If a member of the cult mind is targeted by a mind-affecting spell, the egregore can attempt a Will save as well, and the cult member uses the better of the two results. If the cult member still fails, another member of the cult mind can choose to be affected instead. ",
			"",

			"",
			"If a member of the cult mind is slain or travels more than 1 mile from the egregore, its link to the cult mind is severed, and every other member must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be sickened for 1 round. If the number of members in the cult mind drops below half of the number of Hit Dice possessed by the egregore, the egregore must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer from confusion. The egregore can attempt a new save at the start of each round to regain its senses. As long as the remaining number of members is less than half the egregore's Hit Dice, the egregore must attempt a new save each time a member of its cult mind is slain or leaves the cult mind. If the last member of the cult is slain or leaves the cult mind, the egregore dissipates harmlessly in 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotic Oscillation (Sp)** As a standard action, an egregore can weave a hypnotic pattern using its bands of light in a 10-foot radius around itself. Members of its cult mind are immune and don't count towards the spell's Hit Die limit, but otherwise this ability functions as the spell.",
			"",
			"**Light Tentacles (Su)** An egregore produces bands of light powered by its concentrated mental energy. It can cause these bands to become solid and lash out as tentacles. These tentacles follow all the normal rules for tentacles, except that they function as though they had the brilliant energy weapon special ability.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Conduit (Ex)** Any member of a cult mind can channel any psychic spells it casts through the egregore, as long as the cultist is within 30 feet of the egregore. If a cultist casts spells in this way, treat the egregore as if it were the spellcaster for purposes of the spell's range, point of origin, and other functions that depend on the caster's location. The creature casting the spell still provokes any attacks of opportunity or other negative consequences of casting a spell. The egregore takes 1d6 points of slashing damage per level of spell cast through it in this way as the energy cuts its way out of the creature, though its damage reduction applies. (A 0-level spell channeled through the egregore deals no damage to it.)",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When an especially powerful psychic leads a community of like-minded individuals, that group can pool its collective will together to create an egregore. The egregore is a powerful defender and a focal point for the psychic talents of every member of the group, granting them access to additional magical powers and a communal link.",
			"",
			"Though egregores' appearances vary, they typically have a core that resembles a mass of brains, discernible by practitioners of phrenology as bearing characteristics of the brains of those who make up its cult mind. This core projects an image that reflects the ideals for which the egregore was formed - an unblinking eye to represent vigilance, a heraldic shield for protection, or some other stylized emblem to reflect the goals of the group. From this bizarre hovering mass emerges a number of pulsating arcs of light that move in a strange unison, forming an almost mesmerizing pattern with their cadence.",
			"",
			"The synchronized synaptic pulses that emit from the egregore's cranial core manifest as elegant arcs of light leaping from one brain-shape to another in a rhythmic dance. The egregore can divert an arc outward, transforming it into a semi-solid band of light it can use to strike its foes. These bands normally pass through objects, but by concentrating more fully, the egregore can transform an arc into an even more solid form capable of manipulating objects.",
			"",
			"Typically, the sort of cult that creates an egregore is formed of a small association of individuals under the guidance of a strong-willed psychic leader, who directs the weaker-minded followers in a ritual that combines their latent psychic energy into the creation of a powerful entity to support the goals of the organization.",
			"",
			"The egregore itself is a totally separate creature, akin to the eidolons of summoners, though it seems to be a genuine living being of the Material Plane and not a true outsider. Creating an egregore requires a cult of 13 - one leader and a dozen followers. Larger cults are capable of creating more powerful egregores, with stories circulating of doomsday cults with hundreds of members working together to create an abomination, but subsequently losing control and facing annihilation from their own creation. The egregore exists only as long as the cult that created it, fading back into the psychic ether from which it spawned once the cult is no more.",
			"",
			"An egregore is 12 feet across, though the bands of light that extend out from it cause it to fluctuate between an effective size of 13 feet to 15 feet. It weighs only 300 pounds despite its vast size. The brains that make up the egregore's body aren't constructed like human brains, and are far less dense; they seem to take the form of brains only because of the conceptual link they represent. Likewise, the egregore's staring eye and bands of light are more metaphorical than physical.",
			"",
			"### Egregore Master",
			"",
			"When a larger cult creates an egregore, it is often considerably more dangerous than standard egregores. Use the following guidelines when creating an egregore master. An egregore master is created by combining the will of a powerful cult leader and his followers. While the minimum number of cultists required for the creation of a normal egregore is 13, the more members willing to surrender to the cult mind and the stronger their belief in the ideals of the leader, the more powerful the resultant being.",
			"",
			"**Hit Dice:** An egregore master always has more Hit Dice than a normal egregore, though after 13 Hit Dice, increasing its Hit Dice by 1 typically requires adding two or more cult members. An egregore master can have a cult of any size (minimum 15).",
			"",
			"**Challenge Rating:** For every 2 Hit Dice over 13 an egregore master possesses, increase its CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Size:** Once an egregore master reaches 15 Hit Dice, its size increases to Huge; at 20 Hit Dice it becomes Gargantuan, and at 25 or more Hit Dice it becomes Colossal.",
			"",
			"**Armor Class:** An egregore master has a natural armor bonus equal to half its Hit Dice.",
			"",
			"**Attacks:** For every 3 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses beyond 13, it gains one additional light tentacle attack.",
			"",
			"**Caster Level:** An egregore master has a caster level equal to its HD or the caster level of the cult leader, whichever is lower.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Magic:** For every 2 Hit Dice the egregore master possesses above 13, it adds one spell to those it can cast using psychic magic, and its maximum PE increases by an amount equal to the spell's level. An egregore master can choose a spell from any spell list, but it can't choose a spell with a level equal to more than half its Hit Dice. Egregore masters typically choose spells that enhance the powers of their cult minds or protect their members. It is very rare for an egregore master to choose offensive spells."

			"An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally, however, this link between eidolon and summoner is unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing runes that once represented their bonds burning painful scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own.",

Contemplative and fun-loving, ekekehs hold themselves up as proof that humanoids don't have a monopoly on civilization. While at home in the open ocean, ekekehs also build grand underwater cities, working magic and employing tools via the same limited telekinetic abilities that allow them to float over dry land, where their gills process air as well as water. The slow speed and limited maneuverability of this flight strikes most ekekehs as terribly boring, if not downright embarrassing, yet it is still common for residents of coastal cities to see ekekehs floating slowly through the marketplace, their belongings stuffed into specially fitted packs or dangling from broad leather utility belts.",

The first breath weapon is a 500-foot line of lighting that deals 20d10 points of electricity damage (Reflex DC 36 half). The second is a 250-foot cone of caustic gas that deals 20d10 points of acid damage (Fortitude DC 36 half). If an elder wyrm uses both breath weapons simultaneously - such as by readying an action with its impossible coordination ability - the electrical charge causes the gas to explode; rather than dealing acid or electricity damage, the explosion instead deals 40d10 points of fire damage to all creatures in a 250-foot cone (Reflex DC 36 half) and causes damaged creatures to catch fire, taking 6d10 points of fire damage each round for 1d4 rounds, unless they succeed at a second DC 36 Reflex save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Godslayer (Ex)** An elder wyrm's natural attacks overcome damage reduction and regeneration as per epic and magic weapons. As a swift action, the elder wyrm can grant its natural weapons one alignment property and one material property for this purpose.

			"",
			"**Impossible Coordination (Ex)** An elder wyrm can plan and execute a vast number of schemes in a short time. When an encounter starts, an elder wyrm rolls twice for initiative. Once per minute, it can act on both initiative counts and can use the delay or ready actions independently at each initiative. On other rounds, it uses the higher initiative count.",
			"",
			"**Myth-Drinker (Su)** An elder wyrm's bite and rend attacks deal an additional 2d6 points of damage to creatures with mythic tiers or the mythic subtype. When an elder wyrm confirms a critical hit with its bite attack against such a target, the target loses 1d4 uses of mythic power. For each use of mythic power lost, the elder wyrm either regains 2d10 hit points or can attempt a saving throw against one ongoing effect; on a successful save, the effect ends immediately. At the GM's discretion, this ability could apply to mighty albeit non-mythic divine creations, such as behemoths, demodands, titans, and outsiders whose CR is 20 or higher; in this case the elder wyrm benefits as though the target had lost two uses of mythic power.",

Once per round, the elder wyrm can perform two bite attacks as an attack action, such as when performing a charge or making an attack or opportunity. When an elder wyrm uses both bite attacks against a creature that is at least one size category smaller than it is, the elder wyrm is treated as if both heads were flanking the target for the purposes of resolving the attacks.",
			"",
			"**Tail Snap (Su)** As a full-round action, an elder wyrm can make two tail slap attacks against a single creature it can reach. If one tail slap hits, the target must also succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. If both hit, the tail's impact causes a 10-foot-radius burst of concussive force centered on the target, dealing 10d10 points of sonic damage to all creatures in the area and stunning them for 1 round (Fortitude DC 36 negates the stunned effect). The elder wyrm is unharmed by this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based",

			"Over the eons, gods and would-be divinities have unleashed countless monstrosities on the multiverse in vain attempts to create worshipers or punish oath breakers, or just out of spite. Many such beasts outlive their usefulness and run amok, defying their creators' commands to stand down.",
			"",
			"Elder wyrms were once divine avengers, granted life in order to seek and destroy rogue agents of the gods and other such abominations. After annihilating several condemned species, the dragons broke free from the gods' control. Despite this, elder wyrms have a flexible but insistent sense of justice instilled in them by their divine mandate, and acting as the judge, jury, and executioner of mighty foes scratches an existential itch. The few elder wyrms that live on a given planet spend much of their time dozing in secluded places, waking occasionally to hunt or seek out injustices to punish based on their individual interests and moods. This cycle of inactivity leaves most elder wyrms woefully ill-informed of current events, though once they have cause to pay attention, their keen intellects and powerful divinations allow them to gather and process several centuries of news in short order.",
			"",
			"Because they wake so rarely, elder wyrms often become centerpieces of local legends and cautionary tales. Especially convincing or foolhardy heroes might even seek out an elder wyrm in order to direct its vengeful wrath against a specific target, though the wyrm is just as likely to determine that the heroes are more worthy of destruction than their targets. Having two heads does, after all, make elder wyrms better equipped to see both sides of an issue and render judgment. Each head can think independently and seamlessly share control of the body, allowing the dragon to perform dizzying acts of synchronicity. Often the two heads' personalities diverge, leading to good-natured bickering and debate between the two, much to the dread of anxious onlookers.",

Embalming bears employed as guardians are designed to deliver dangerous doses of embalming fluid with strikes from their powerful claws. Few of these creatures exist, and those that do are found where alchemy is widely practiced or where mummification of pets and guardians is a part of funereal tradition. Embalming bears are often created to guard over precious treasures, but some serve less significant functions, and are merely trophies preserved by taxidermists and animated to decorate macabre halls or guard remote locations.",
			"",
			"An embalming bear is different from other animated objects in that the process of its creation includes a step that turns the chemicals that preserve the taxidermic animal into a weapon. This especially powerful embalming fluid is a deadly poison when injected into the injuries of living enemies. The main purpose of the liquid, though, is to provide the bear with a semi-fluid mobility normally not afforded to animated objects.",
			"",
			"Many embalming bears (such as the one described here) have armor plates bolted onto their bodies, typically disguised as pieces of ceremonial armor to make the creature look as if it had been used in battle. Though this is often just an affectation, some embalming bears actually are honored creatures that died in battle and were then turned into eternal servants. A typical embalming bear is 7 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.",

A creature affected by a zeal-attuned emotion ooze's compel emotion ability must succeed at a DC 20 Will save each round or repeat the same actions it took on the previous round. If it is unable to do so (such as if it made a full attack against an opponent that has moved away, or cast a spell that has been expended), it must take actions that mimic those taken in the previous round as closely as possible. Succeeding at this Will save allows the creature to act normally for 1 round, but does not free it from the emotion effect.",

			"",
			"**Empathic Healing (Su)** An emotion ooze gains fast healing 5 as long as it is within 60 feet of a creature that is affected by its compel emotion ability (or that is otherwise experiencing the emotion to which the ooze is attuned). Though an emotion ooze is otherwise immune to mind-affecting effects, it is healed by emotion effects that match its emotion, regaining a number of hit points equal to the caster level of the effect (or to the ooze's Hit Dice for abilities with no caster level). The ooze takes an equal amount of damage if it fails a saving throw against an effect that specifically counters its corresponding emotion (for instance, remove fear for fear or good hope for despair).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Truly bizarre and alien creatures, emotion oozes are made of ectoplasm that has somehow been granted the spark of life. Though they can't be categorized as intelligent, emotion oozes have a unique emotional empathy, allowing them not only to respond and react to the emotions of nearby creatures, but also to psychically shape and alter the emotions of others.",
			"",
			"Though they are carnivorous, emotion oozes prefer to seek out victims with strong emotions, on which they also feed. As a part of their unnatural biology, they gain a physiological benefit from being exposed to strong emotions. Each emotion ooze is attuned to a specific emotion, and the cause of this connection is unclear. The most commonly accepted theory is that the oozes imprint on the first strong emotion that they are exposed to or that the emotion is imprinted in the ectoplasm, though others believe that the creatures have some control over this bond, and can even change the emotion they're attuned to given enough time. In addition to their coloration reflecting their attuned emotions, emotion ooze takes on forms that befit the emotion to which they are tied, making it fairly easy for those with knowledge of the creatures to determine each one's particular emotional attunement on first glance.",
			"",
			"Creatures that encounter an emotion ooze find that it mimics their expressions and movements in an unnerving manner, sometimes even duplicating the facial features of the creature as it mimics a smile or growl. The ooze's reactions get more extreme when creatures around it express the type of emotion to which the ooze is attuned. The ooze begins to noticeably ripple, pulsing in a sympathetic rhythm and reshaping itself more rapidly than it does when it is on the search for emotional creatures. An anger-attuned ooze might form its pseudopods to look more like jagged spikes, and a despair ooze might reach out fitfully like a creature struggling to escape from a pool of quicksand.",
			"",
			"Most animals and unintelligent life forms find an emotion ooze's imitation and emotional echoes terrifying and flee as quickly as possible. Though some sentient creatures have this same reaction, others find the phenomenon fascinating, and attempt to either experiment with or capture emotion oozes, putting themselves within reach of the hungry oozes' grasp. These intelligent creatures are the most common victims of emotion ooze attacks.",
			"",
			"Pitched battles draw the attentions of emotion oozes attuned to anger, fear, hatred, or zeal. Such an ooze might join a nearby battle it senses so it can feed off the emotions generated there. The desire to continue causing and absorbing such strong feelings causes the ooze to try to prolong the battle, spreading out its attacks among multiple targets and paying little attention to creatures that aren't affected by its ability to compel emotion. In the end, the ooze's hunger might actually be its downfall.",
			"",
			"Emotion oozes often dwell in places where strong emotions were felt in the past, suggesting the creatures might have latent psychometric ability. Hatred oozes might live at the sites of massacres, zeal oozes in old temples or political offices, despair oozes in ancient prisons, and so on. If stuck in one place or deprived of emotional connections for a long time, an emotion ooze begins to lose its coloration, becoming a dull white, and eventually hardens and cracks into pieces.",
			"",
			"The typical emotion ooze has about the same volume as a human, but its composition makes it significantly lighter, weighing only around 50 pounds."

Despite their impressive physiques, emperor stags are more cautious and timid than other deer, rarely gathering in herds, and while the emperor stags are formidable fighters when cornered, their true gifts are keen senses, speed, stealth, and steady footing.",
			"",
			"Since the emperor stags are generally too alert to fall prey to ambushes, popular myth suggests that the only true way to capture one is to match its legendary endurance, chasing it for days or weeks through forests, across rivers, and up rocky slopes, until the deer or the hunter finally succumbs to exhaustion. More commonly, nobles rotate packs of dogs to herd and exhaust the elusive creatures while following leisurely on horseback, later spinning fictions of their own harrowing endurance."

Though the farmers leave when their lands flood, those who live on the edges of the flood plain, as well as those who sail the river, are still at risk of attack by these predators. Estuarine worms bury themselves in the mud during the day and emerge to hunt at night when it is cooler. The carnivorous worms eat whatever they can find, from fish and frogs, to livestock and people. They have even been known to gorge on crocodiles and hippopotamuses, after which they bury themselves for a time in order to digest their hefty meals. The lights on their heads attract small animals above and below the water, which in turn can attract larger prey. Stories are told of travelers who mistake the light for Alboras and navigate their small riverboats right into the maw of a worm.",

It is commonly believed that the worms, like the soil, harden from dehydration, but it is, in fact, a natural defense mechanism. Though they might seem to be asleep, estuarine worms remain a danger in the dry season.

Estuarine worms reproduce rarely, but birth large numbers of offspring when they do. Most of the spawn, however, are eaten by other predators long before they reach full size. When multiple worms are found together (usually because of lower-than-normal floodwater), only the alpha worm uses its bioluminescence. This sign of dominance also keeps potential prey from being drawn to multiple light sources.",

Members of the Old Cults revere estuarine worms for their connection to the star Alboras and the Great Old One who supposedly dwells there. The cultists seek out the worms during the season of shemu, when the worms are less violent and more tractable. A combination of brute force and magic are necessary to find, exhume, and contain these elusive creatures. In captivity, estuarine worms can be made to change form regardless of the season through the application or exclusion of water. The high priests of these cults also know certain spells that can trigger an immediate change. The cultists connect to their god through the worms, offering sacrifices to them and reading omens in their violent squirming. The worms serve as guards against intruders, and can also be used as weapons against the cult's enemies."

			"**Ephemeral Existence (Su)** An etiainen is a spirit of psychic energy, and manifests only when it has at least 1 PE. Once it spends its final PE, it phases out of existence for 24 hours. When it reappears, it can do so anywhere within 100 feet of where it phased out of existence.",

A creature that succeeds at this saving throw cannot be affected by memory drain from the same etiainen for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting effect. The saving throw DC is Charisma-based.",

			"#### Description",

			"Etiainens are psychic amalgams of the past and the future, given form in a wispy, indistinct shape. It is believed these spirits are projections of strong psychic emanations from the past - usually the echoes of important people or the psychic residue of heroic deeds - and that they can manifest only in the presence of the psychic impressions and energies that attend the living. Once manifested, etiainens often act in confusing or even whimsical ways, opening and closing doors, attacking and stealing memories of those nearby, and creating a general sense of psychic discontent. They continue either until compelled to stop or until they use enough of their psychic magic to wink out of existence for a short period of time, returning only when the psychic impressions and energy of the local area allow them to manifest once again to repeat the cycle.",
			"",
			"An etiainen sometimes forges an involuntary connection with a creature that allows the spirit to perform actions in advance of the linked creature, leading to bizarre cases of deja vu for those nearby. For instance, a husband might hear the front door open and the sound of his wife's familiar footsteps walking toward him, only to discover that his wife has not yet returned home-But bafflingly, when she does come home, she carries out the same series of actions.",
			"",
			"Those who manage to successfully communicate with etiainens can sometimes compel the spirits to perform small tasks, though holding their attention requires great patience. For one who manages this difficult task, these spirits can sometimes act as intermediaries and messengers, or even spies. When acting in this fashion, an etiainen often appears as a strange, silent double of the creature it is serving. Etiainens can understand speech but cannot speak, and they rely on {spell/mindlink}to communicate. Because of the chaotic nature of these spirits, such fellowships are short lived, as the etiainen might at any time flit away on some strange flight of fancy.",

If the creature would normally be immune to poison, the immunity doesn't apply, but it only needs to roll its save once. Delay poison doesn't delay her poison effects; they still occur immediately. A euryale gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against neutralize poison cast against her to negate her venomous attacks.",

			"",
			"**Profane Visions (Ex)** A euryale's prophetic visions allow her to avoid misfortune.

			"",
			"**Shattering Shriek (Su)** Whenever a euryale uses one of her sonic spell-like abilities, any sonic damage dealt by the spell increases by 1 point per die. In addition, sonic damage from her spell-like abilities bypasses the hardness of a petrified creature, and the damage is not halved when applied to petrified creatures. (A typical Medium petrified creature has 30 hit points.) A petrified creature that is destroyed by the effects of a euryale's shattering shriek explodes into a 20-foot burst of jagged stone shards, dealing 4d6 points of slashing damage to any creatures in that area (Reflex DC 30 half); this explosion heals the euryale as detailed in absorb essence above. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Snake Independence (Ex)** A euryale's snakes are independently intelligent and can attack even when she doesn't.

			"",
			"**Statue Control (Su)** A euryale can control the statues of any creatures she petrifies via her spells or special abilities as long as they remain within 120 feet of her. Petrified creatures are treated as animated stone objects. While the typical Medium animated object is almost insignificant in a CR 20 encounter, the euryale often commands these statues to move so as to provide her cover or to place them in areas where she can shatter them to deal the most damage to foes (see the Shattering Shriek ability). The euryale's control over these statues is a purely mental act that takes no action. A euryale can control a number of statues at once equal to her Charisma modifier (10 for the typical euryale).",
			"",
			"**Viper Rod (Su)** Any blunt weapon or object a euryale holds becomes a rod of the viper with a +5 enhancement bonus that uses her poison instead of its usual poison. She can flick the snake head of her viper rod to fire poisoned fangs as a ranged attack. Treat these attacks as if she fired arrows from a +5 longbow; fangs launched in this manner deliver her poison",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Euryales are powerful medusa matriarchs and among the most favored agents of Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. Long ago, Lamashtu tricked these medusa forebears with a gift that tainted and empowered them into becoming beings of madness and evil, twisting them into forms even more monstrous than their medusa sisters. Euryales delight in destroying their foes in ways they find particularly cruel, such as transforming one of a pair of lovers into a statue and then commanding the statue to destroy the still-living lover. Because of the oracular powers of these creatures, there are tales of desperate folk who seek out euryales for answers, but these tales invariably end poorly - those few petitioners who receive the answers they seek find they would have been better off never knowing. In most cases, an encounter with a euryale is destined for disaster. However, they are endlessly fascinated by poisons, so a creature that can satisfy a euryale's curiosity by teaching it new poison lore (a daunting task in its own right) can likely avoid destruction in a chance meeting. Euryales find themselves distant from medusa society, unless they hold together a cult of fawning medusas by force. While they occasionally form triumvirates among themselves, they are more likely to find companionship among like-minded zealots of other races, particularly lamia matriarchs or mariliths.",
			"",
			"Most euryales willingly embrace the taint of madness and lovingly serve the Mother of Monsters, but there are some who seek to eschew it, whether simply to be free of Lamashtu's influence and live an evil life more like that of a normal medusa, or to follow a path of redemption. These rare heretical euryales have alignments other than chaotic evil as well as additional powers gained through their struggle to control their own destinies. Typically they advance by Hit Dice, although it's also fairly common for them to take up to 2 oracle levels to improve their oracle spellcasting and to represent the curse the Mother of Monsters inflicted upon them for daring to cross her.",

As a full-round action, it can unravel the scarlet thread from around its horns, allowing the thread to be grasped by up to 8 Medium or Small creatures (or 4 Large creatures or 16 Tiny creatures). Once the participants have all grasped the woolen strand, the ez-azael flings itself from the precipice to its death as a move action while the participants continue to hang on to the thread. The fall is always fatal to the ez-azael, and it cannot be saved by any means, magical or mundane. As the ez-azael falls, the thread breaks and the portion remaining in the participants' hands changes from scarlet to pure white.

The purifying rays of this light affect evil creatures differently according to their alignments if they fail a DC 23 Will saving throw. Chaotic evil creatures that fail the save are paralyzed for 1d10 rounds, neutral evil creatures are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and lawful evil creatures are confused for 1d4 rounds.

Alternately, an ez-azael can use this ability to cast destruction on one evil target within 60 feet. This use of the spell deals 160 points of damage to the target unless it succeeds at a DC 22 Fortitude saving throw, in which case it deals only 10d6 points of damage.

			"The ways of Heaven are often unknown or opaque in purpose and meaning to mortals, and the ritual of the ez-azael is no exception. In the eternal battle between the powers of good and evil, powerful angelic beings occasionally capture a type of goat-like demon called a schir and subject it to a powerful cleansing ritual in which it is used as an offering of atonement for some mortal population to relieve them of both the physical and spiritual burdens of their sins or other acts of moral error they have committed. Upon the ritual's completion, the mortal population receives absolution and the schir is released to wander free with its new burden of forgiven mortal sin. Almost invariably, these demons die from the trauma of being used as a vessel for divine mercy. However, sometimes the ritual of clemency changes the schir in a fundamental way, in which case it transforms into an ez-azael.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"An ez-azael is a rare creature occasionally created from a specific type of demon through a redemptive ritual conducted by powerful celestial beings. Though of extraplanar origin, its new existence is bound to the pardon of mortal sins, which creates a strong affinity to the mortal world. An ez-azael is always found on the Material Plane and has the native subtype. As a being formed of mortal atonement, an ez-azael's reason for existence is to continue this role and use its special status to further free goodly mortals from their bondage to iniquity - especially the bonds imposed on them through the manipulation or temptations of evil outsiders. An ez-azael lives to die in this endeavor and has no qualms about doing so.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"An ez-azael wanders desolate areas where it can have the most impact on a needful mortal individual or community. It always travels alone, and it is entirely possible that only one ez-azael exists at a time, and that when it is slain, it simply reincarnates after another schir is ritually cleansed. The very existence of an ez-azael is anathema to demons, and the presence of one of these celestial creatures draws an ever-escalating series of attacks when demons become aware of its presence in a region. An ez-azael knows its days are numbered and always seeks to find mortals in need of redemption in the limited time it has.",
			"",
			"### Ez-azael in Ancient Literature",
			"",
			"The ez-azael is loosely based on the concept of the sacrificial goat offering mentioned in the book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Torah (Leviticus 16:8-10). The meaning of the phrase used there is uncertain, and it has been the subject of debate for theologians and religious scholars for centuries. One possible meaning is: \"the goat [ez] that was sent away [azal].\" It is this interpretation that was used by William Tyndale when he coined the term (e)scapegoat in his 1530 English translation of the Bible. Interpretations over the centuries of who or what Azazel is have ranged from a demon to an angel to a precipitous fall. This monster is, perhaps, the first version that interprets it to mean \"all of the above.\" Given its inspiration, we have specifically not tied the ez-azael to any of the faiths or deities in the Pathfinder campaign setting, so GMs can use them as they best see fit."
