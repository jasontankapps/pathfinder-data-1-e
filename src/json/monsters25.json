			"The warden jack swarm comprises thousands of Fine steel ball bearings that move in electro-thaumaturgical cohesion, making a clicking or clinking sound as it moves. Each sphere can extrude sharp spikes, which essentially transforms it into a swarm of caltrops. The creature can navigate uneven terrain, roll up hills and very sharp slopes, and flow around and between obstacles. The warden jack swarm has one severe limitation: it cannot climb a 90-degree angle. It can roll down steps but not climb them, and it can be trapped in a pit. It can sense the topology of the ground, allowing it to generally avoid pits. In this encounter, the warden jack swarm cannot scale the large rock piles or the steps, although it can roll around the rocks and up the slope alongside the steps. It can also flow through the ankheg nymph tunnels and move underground at a depth of a few feet below the current elevation. When the swarm flows underground, it reveals the location of one of the tunnels' access points, but if the PCs have not noticed the other holes, they may not know where the swarm might emerge. While underground, the swarm can determine the PCs' location using its tremorsense.",
			"",
			"The swarm is programmed to attack humanoids in a restricted area but not wildlife or other creatures. The swarm does not interpret monstrous humanoids like skum as legitimate targets-perhaps an oversight by the swarm's programmer."

			"Like the more powerful retriever, the warmonger wasp is a construct built from the protoplasmic flesh and chaotic fecundity of the Abyss itself. Partially organic and partially metallic, warmonger wasps serve demonic armies as air support in large battles. Their electricity-based explosions work well on battlefields where demons and mortals clash, as electrical attacks have no effect on demons. Warmonger wasps are grown rather than constructed, and while the procedure of crafting these constructs is beyond the ken of mortal crafters, spellcasters can conjure them to do their bidding. Warmonger wasps are only intelligent enough to understand simple commands, and even then they generally understand only commands universally associated with battlefield conditions.",

			"Although a warmonger wasp is not an outsider, it may nonetheless be conjured by either a planar ally or planar binding spell. The spellcaster must take care when doing so, however, using specially prepared incenses, the secretions of rare and violent insects, and complex diagrams drawn with expensive phosphorescent inks, lest the wasp attack the spellcaster upon the spell's completion. These components cost 15,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including the required Charisma check to browbeat the creature into servitude with planar binding, as well as planar ally's requirement to pay the conjured creature).",
			"",
			"### Massacre Wasp",
			"",
			"Warmonger wasps grow organically from protoplasmic flesh and chaos, so it's no surprise that, unlike many constructs, each warmonger wasp has a uniquely terrible appearance, and the wasps warp, twist, and mutate over time. While in most cases, significant mutations prove crippling and ultimately cause the wasp's death, in rare cases, the mutated wasp reaches a new state of evolution and becomes a massacre wasp: a more powerful version of the warmonger wasp that is capable of strategizing and leading other warmonger wasps in battlefield maneuvers. Massacre wasps usually have the advanced or giant simple template as well as either 6 evolution points' worth of summoner eidolon evolutions or other monster abilities of a similar power level and scope. Massacre wasps' static discharge works once per round instead of once every 1d4 rounds."

Tales say that a traveler can indeed see her future in the reflections of a warpglass ooze... if she can survive the creature's enchanting magic and acidic caress. In fact, creatures that look upon these ambush predators do see a warped reflection of themselves-possibly dressed as a regal knight, weeping over an open grave, or holding aloft a valuable bauble-though there is no evidence the images are founded in reality.",
			"",

Creatures that shake off the ooze's compulsion find their minds lingering on the distorted reflections as they attempt to meet-or avoid-the fate they witnessed. If attacked, warpglass oozes extrude knots of protoplasm to bludgeon foes, but they often retreat in the face of powerful opposition.

A warpglass ooze seeks out a spot where it can hide in plain sight, but with sufficient traffic to keep them sated. Warpglass oozes can subsist on nearly any sort of organic material, but they strongly prefer fresh meat to vegetation or carrion. As their preferred prey are animals and humanoids, both of whom are affected by their compelling reflection, warpglass oozes are usually found in well-used watering holes, ditches alongside well-traveled trails, and ponds near busy settlements. They generally avoid lairs near swift-moving water, as they aren't skilled swimmers and can mimic only still water. Warpglass oozes remain in their selected location as long as food remains plentiful, moving on only if prey becomes scarce or if they are harassed or threatened.",

			"",
			"Sages disagree on the origins of these strange oozes. Varisians circulate an old parable of a young fortune-teller who fell victim to her own vanity. Unwaveringly certain of her abilities, she left her caravan to commune with nature spirits, ignoring repeated warning omens from [Desna](faith/desna). When the fortune teller drowned in a flash flood, her essence mingled with the water to form the first warpglass ooze. Other folk tales posit that warpglass oozes are innocent victims of cruel fey creatures such as [bog nixies](monster/nixie) or [rusalkas](monster/rusalka) that murder charmed mortals by forcing them to stare at their own distorted image in a puddle until thirst or the elements take their inevitable toll. Academics point out that warpglass oozes are virtually unknown outside of Varisia and that Varisia's ancient history is filled with powerful wizards who mastered potent enchantments and fleshwarping magic. These scholars disagree as to whether these wizards created warpglass oozes as a weapon, as a punishment, or merely for callous amusement. Some attribute their creation specifically to Xanderghul, the runelord of pride, as every ooze's reflection is fundamentally self-centered.",
			"",
			"Most survivors who viewed their reflections in a warpglass ooze maintain that the images never came true. Furthermore, victims of multiple warpglass oozes report that the images seen in each ooze are different and sometimes mutually inconsistent (such as a victim seeing himself freezing to death in a cave and later envisioning himself being roasted alive). Sages therefore agree that warpglass oozes don't actually provide any genuine foresight, but the question remains of where the oozes obtain the substance of their alluring reflections. Reflections are always dramatic-featuring benevolent heroics or nightmarish tortures, for example- which bolsters a theory that warpglass oozes somehow show glimpses of the infinite variations a victim's life might have taken.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Though warpglass oozes thrive in nearly any environment, they frequently drift toward rural, stony areas where standing water is common. They are not unheard of in urban areas, but they rarely survive long there; larger cities don't provide the time and privacy the oozes need to lure, slay, and digest prey, while smaller villages become alarmed more quickly at missing residents and seek out threats. Warpglass oozes can survive in arctic or desert climates, although they grow sluggish in such conditions. In cold environments, warpglass oozes learn to stiffen their surface to more closely resemble a sheet of ice. Desert denizens are frequently protective of watering holes and suspicious of small, clear puddles, so warpglass oozes often lurk under stony overhangs or amid enticing hot springs.",
			"",
			"Warpglass oozes aren't intelligent enough to form true societies, although pools of oozes sometimes work together. These pools often position one or two warpglass oozes to draw in prey, while the others slowly slink around behind their victims to cut off escape.",
			"",
			"Few creatures have much use for the dangerous oozes except as near-mindless guardians. Nevertheless, some reclusive families of [cliff giants](monster/cliff_giant) atop the Storval Plateau keep and breed warpglass oozes. Able to safely handle the oozes due to their careful, patient training and resistance to the oozes' acid, these giants believe they can divine a person's fate by interpreting the reflected images and matching them with omens in the natural world."

Even when part of a nest, giant wasps tend toward solitary hunting, and it's rare to see more than one at a time."

			"Many varieties of ground wasps are parasitic, and attack large creatures as a means of reproduction, as well as in defense. Ground wasps have a paralytic poison, and once a victim has sustained dozens of stings, its body goes limp. Once its prey is incapacitated, a ground wasp swarm descends on the still-living creature and lays hundreds of eggs just beneath its skin. Some ground wasps swarm for food in a similar fashion. Mature ground wasps don't eat much flesh themselves, but they often take down prey so they can retrieve food for their growing larvae."

			"**Beacon of Jandelay (Su)** Watchers can plant a beacon of Jandelay-a six-foot-tall glowing spire of pale yellow force energy-by spending 1 minute of uninterrupted activity. When planted on a world shortly to experience an apocalypse, these beacons designate the surrounding environs as important and guarantee that the area around the beacon will be incorporated into Jandelay upon the world's destruction. Beacons of Jandelay function properly even when constructed out of phase (see phase shift below), so watchers typically place them in such a manner to prevent denizens of the doomed world from removing or otherwise tampering with them. A beacon of Jandelay has hardness 30 and 440 hit points. A watcher immediately senses if a beacon of Jandelay it created takes damage, and when a watcher plane shifts or teleports to a site that contains a beacon of Jandelay, it always arrives on target.",
			"",
			"**Inconspicuous (Su)** Despite their enormous size, watchers have an unnerving ability to fade into the background, causing other creatures to overlook or ignore them. When a creature would first perceive a watcher (see it, hear its movements, or notice it with any other sense, be it natural or supernatural), it must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or it simply doesn't perceive the watcher for 24 hours, treating it as if it were invisible and silenced from the observer's perspective. On a successful save, the creature perceives the watcher and is immune to that watcher's inconspicuous ability for 24 hours. If the watcher attacks a creature that failed its save, it breaks the inconspicuous effect for that creature automatically for 24 hours. The Oliphaunt of Jandelay automatically fails its save against the inconspicuous ability, allowing the watchers to share their home with the beast while staying beneath its notice. This is a mind-affecting effect that automatically bypasses the Oliphaunt of Jandelay's ward against command ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Observation (Su)** Watchers see and remember every sensation around them with perfect clarity, and their memory never fades. They are always assumed to have rolled a 20 on vision-based Perception checks (resulting in a 71 for a typical watcher). Further, they gain a bonus to their AC equal to their Wisdom modifier as a result of this supernatural ability to perceive threats and danger.",
			"",
			"**Phase Shift (Su)** Once per day, a watcher can shift itself out of phase with reality as a standard action; shifting back into phase is a free action. When out of phase with reality, a watcher can't be affected by effects from the plane it is watching, but it also can't affect that plane with its abilities (except for with beacon of Jandelay). However, the watcher can still observe the plane, and denizens of the plane can observe it if they overcome the watcher's inconspicuous ability. Watchers often use phase shift to observe events leading up to an apocalypse without succumbing to the cataclysm destined to destroy the world in question. Dimensional anchor or similar effects that bar dimensional travel not only prevent a watcher from using phase shift but can also force a watcher back into reality if they successfully target and affect a phase-shifted watcher. A watcher forced into reality against its will in this manner becomes staggered for 1d3 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Stasis (Su)** A creature damaged by a watcher's talon must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be slowed for 1 round, as per slow. A slowed creature (be it a creature affected by the spell of the same name, by a watcher's talon, or by another slow-inducing effect) that takes damage from a watcher's talon must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or become permanently trapped in a state of stasis, as per temporal stasis. This effect ends if the watcher who created the effect is slain or is no longer on the same plane as the victim. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The watchers of Jandelay are bizarre and enigmatic creatures, inscrutable to most mortals, particularly since Jandelay itself is so unknown. Watchers lurk in worlds on the brink of destruction in order to observe events as they unfold and to catalogue and prepare a piece of the worlds for eternal enshrinement in Jandelay. Watchers mostly perform this work unseen, regularly setting beacons and, rarely, putting objects or beings into stasis in order to bring them along to Jandelay. Watchers have no desire to accelerate apocalypses before their appointed times, but they are drawn to action when would-be heroes or saviors take extreme measures to prevent a calamity.",
			"",
			"On Jandelay, watchers move from region to region, building alabaster spires and creating other objects and edifices upon the interstitial fields, depending on their favored crafts. Left alone, a watcher might spend centuries crafting a single object, only to lose interest in its work immediately after completing the task.",
			"",
			"When faced with a particular threat or curiosity, watchers naturally organize into councils of up to five individuals. When such a council forms, one watcher is selected as an observer, and this watcher is bolstered by the presence of the others. Councils often take quite a while to come to a decision as to how to proceed, but once they do, they pursue their task with an eerie single-mindedness and efficiency that has led some observers to incorrectly infer that the speechless watchers were operating as a hive mind-in truth, they are simply obsessed with perfection and elegance of action.",
			"",
			"Prehensile filaments nestled amid the sharp talons at the tip of each leg allow watchers to perform precision motions as necessary. A watcher's peculiar brand of air walk keeps its main body upright even if all of its legs are occupied, allowing it to attack with all six legs and protecting it from attempts to trip it.",
			"",
			"Watchers stand 30 feet tall atop their insectile legs, and weigh 6 tons.",
			"",
			"### Watcher Faith",
			"",
			"Most watchers follow a dualistic faith that venerates an entity known as the First Watcher (a being that serves the role of preserver) and the Oliphaunt (which serves the role of destroyer), but other strange beliefs vary from watcher to watcher. Both the [Oliphaunt](monster/oliphaunt_of_jandelay) and the First Watcher are very real creatures. The First Watcher is a colossal watcher with the advanced creature template and unique abilities, and it is the only creature capable of birthing new watchers as they are needed. The role of First Watcher is hereditary. When a First Watcher is slain, another watcher immediately ascends in power to replace it-yet regardless of how many cycles of incarnation occur, it is always known as the First Watcher."

This special charge doesn't need to be in a straight line with respect to altitude, allowing the water leaper to leap out, up and over the rim of a boat, and down onto its prey. At the end of a water leap, the water leaper can make both a bite and a sting attack.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Water leapers are ornery hunters that thrive in lakes, swamps, and other marshy bodies of water. They eagerly ambush much larger targets. Against challenging prey, they make their namesake leap from the water, use their jagged sting to open a wound, and then wait for their victim to bleed out. Although fishermen tell tales of marauding water leapers, in reality, the creatures prefer attacking animals and other less canny prey, since intelligent creatures are both more likely to be able to halt the bleeding from the water leaper's sting and hold a grudge afterward.",
			"",
			"The average water leaper is a little over 3 feet long, not counting its wings or the length of its tail, and weighs between 8 and 16 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Water Mauler",
			"",
			"Much like many other amphibious animals, water leapers grow through several stages before reaching the their adult form. What most don't realize is that water leapers' small winged stage isn't the species's final form. Most water leapers don't live long enough to undergo their final metamorphosis, which occurs at an inconsistent age, but those that do transform into water maulers (considered by most scholars to be a rare separate-but-related species). A water mauler is a Large water leaper advanced by adding HD. It gains two claw attacks, rend (2 claws), and pounce (replacing water leap).",
			"",
			"Water maulers, unlike their brethren, are more likely to interact with creatures of other species-particularly natives of the swamp such as boggards-to create mutually beneficial alliances. They can even serve as reluctant mounts, capable of carrying their riders both into the air and beneath the waves. Such water maulers mainly enter into these collaborations to procure themselves steady sources of food, but they occasionally desire something more unusual-typically colorful items they have seen in passing."

Water orms are craftier than sea serpents, and generally inclined toward curiosity rather than violence. Nevertheless, a water orm does not hesitate to attack any creature it views as a threat to itself or its lake.",
			"",
			"Water orms are extremely long-lived. Several different variants have been reported. With sightings rare and unverifiable, it is unclear whether these are variations within a single species, or several unrelated creatures. Some are described as long-necked aquatic reptiles, some as fresh-water sea serpents, others as bizarrely elongated seals or whales, and still others as impossibly large sea horses. Most are 40 to 45 feet in length, and weigh 2,000 to 3,000 pounds."

The body and legs of a water strider are covered with a layer of water-repelling hairs, making it possible for the strider to resist the surface tension of the water. The insect stands on its front and rear legs, and pushes against the water surface with its middle legs to propel itself forward. Water striders are also excellent jumpers, launching themselves distances of up to 5 feet. Any movement on land is limited to jumping. Swarms of particularly vicious water striders commonly gather at the edges of bodies of water, attacking anything that disturbs the surface of their pools."

Patient and cunning hunters, water wraiths prefer to lie still in ponds and rivers until their prey comes within range. When an unfortunate creature does, these fearless hunters strike, their webbed claws propelling them quickly forward either on land or in water. Once their toothy, eel-like mouths attach to victims, water wraiths quickly begin to bleed them dry.",

In captivity, these creatures are deliberately kept underfed and rarely grow beyond 2 feet in length. Water wraiths encountered wild in the Mwangi wetlands, or kept on an unrestricted diet, grow to even more massive sizes.",
			"",
			"Strange superstitions are born out of water wraiths' color-changing powers. This changeability is not just an automatic defensive response, but can be a matter of self-expression, or even strategy and tactics on the part of the creature. Water wraiths often express likes and dislikes with an outward display of color: bright red is frequently associated with hunger, and dull green represents dislike or lack of interest. Some small communities in Katapesh and Osirion actually utilize water wraiths in a primitive system of jurisprudence. The authorities release the accused into a pen with the creatures, then interpret the reactions of the lizards as signs of guilt or innocence. All too frequently, the wraiths declare the accused innocent by virtue of being delicious. Water wraiths find fullblooded elves to be unpalatable, but show no aversion to their half-elven cousins. Water wraiths are not limited to changing color in response to base drives, however. Sneaky and cunning, they do not hesitate to blend into their surroundings despite their emotional state if it affords them an advantage in hunting."

Farmers have to deal with it in croplands and orchards, groundskeepers find it climbing walls like ivy, druids spot it encroaching on sacred groves, and even cave dwellers find it growing in dung heaps. Animals don't eat it because of its stench and poison, and fire is a risky way to destroy it because the weed mixes with other plants or wraps around trees or buildings.",

			"Predators of the deep desert, whirlmaws are just one of the many dangers posed to those who travel the dry wastes of inner Rahadoum. Little more than flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home nestled in shallow burrows beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as their eyes.",
			"",
			"These bizarre hunters prefer to burrow into the torsos of their victims and consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses' peripheral parts for scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it. The skeletal remains of whirlmaws' victims can be identified by the suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety.",
			"",
			"The green, gemlike eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic and dangerous treasures in the desert. It is speculated by some that these mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw's natural fire immunity, and alchemists and wizards often use them as components in creating magic items that bestow that form of energy resistance."

If forced to exit this area, the victim becomes sickened, and the next time the victim falls asleep, she vanishes and returns to the exact point where the whisperer first placed the inescapable curse upon her, as per greater teleport. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Primeval Landscape (Su)** When a whisperer arrives on the Material Plane, it can spend 24 hours in a wilderness area to lay claim to a region of up to 10 miles in diameter as its territory, which then becomes its primeval landscape. While in a whisperer's primeval landscape, the DCs of Survival checks to navigate or avoid becoming lost are increased by 20. A divination that offers guidance, such as find the path, requires a successful DC 31 caster level check as it is cast or the result is corrupted and it instead leads explorers into the whisperer's embrace. A whisperer's primeval landscape is always under the effects of a grand perilous demesne curse, as if the whisperer had cast supreme curse terrain. The total CR of hazards encountered simultaneously must be 18 or lower, rather than 15, and each individual hazard is CR 17 or lower, rather than 14. If any of the hazards are defeated, the whisperer automatically replaces them 24 hours later. A primeval landscape can be removed via remove curse or similar methods (against DC 30), as detailed for all cursed lands. Any creature that enters a primeval landscape begins to suffer increasingly vivid and maddening hallucinations. After spending 24 hours in the region, and again every 24 hours thereafter as long as it remains in the area, a creature can attempt a DC 30 Will save to resist being increasingly affected by the primeval landscape. Upon each failed saving throw, the creature moves one step down the following track. Casting greater restoration or psychic surgery on an affected creature moves it one step up the track. Miracle or wish removes all cumulative effects. Every full 24 hours spent outside of the primeval landscape, the victim moves one step up along this track. At the GM's discretion, the whisperer can choose to not to affect specific creatures or to stop their progression at a specific step. While the effects of a primeval landscape are not mind-affecting, mindless creatures and creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are immune to the effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

These fey seek out the whisperer's realm, both for the protection it provides and because they find its alien presence strangely euphoric; they often delight in leading intruders into the whisperer's grasp.",

			"The goblinoid race of bugbears infests all regions of the world, and these cruel creatures have adapted to the various climes where they make their homes. In the icy wastes, a race of albino bugbears called wikkawaks stalk the windswept glaciers and frozen mountaintops.",
			"",
			"Well adapted to the cold, wikkawaks are masters of stealth and arctic survival, and they have the ability to quell lanterns, torches, and campfires with a thought. Wikkawaks leave no trail in even the heaviest of snows, though salt sprinkled on snow can supposedly reveal a wikkawak's tracks. Of course, by the time one has discovered a wikkawak's trail, it could already be too late.",
			"",
			"Like most bugbears, wikkawaks normally lead a solitary existence, preying on isolated settlers and hunters like pale arctic serial killers. Their powerful noses can sniff out a humanoid or animal over great distances. The rank smell of fear is a powerful stimulant to wikkawaks, and an individual wikkawak hunter might stalk and terrorize a potential victim for several nights, \"steeping\" its prey in dread and terror before finally pouncing. Wikkawaks consider humanoid flesh a great delicacy, and one might freeze a dead humanoid in a remote area, only to return to its grisly cache again and again to savor the taste of the victim for weeks on end. Wikkawaks enjoy keeping mementos of their victims, and prefer fingers as trophies.",
			"",
			"Wikkawaks occasionally congregate in larger groups, either to find mates or to better terrorize a large settlement. Wikkawak pairings seldom last longer than a winter, and young wikkawaks are pushed out into the cold to fend for themselves as soon as they've grown their fur. Wikkawaks don't enjoy the company of other goblinoids, and are just as likely to kill and eat a tribe of snow goblins as they are to rule their lesser kin.",
			"",
			"A wikkawak is covered in a thick pelt of insulating white fur, and its beady eyes are a dead white color. A typical wikkawak stands just over 7 feet tall and weighs around 450 pounds."

A wild hunt monarch can summon his glaive to his hand across any distance as a free action. He can make attacks with the glaive in any square between himself and the end of his reach, even if a glaive would not normally threaten that square.

All other creatures are confused and can never receive the result of \"act normally\"; on such a result, they instead move in a random direction at full speed, as if pursuing an imaginary target.

All members of a monarch's wild hunt link gain regeneration 10; this regeneration cannot be suppressed as long as the wild hunt monarch lives.

			"**Wild Reincarnation (Su)** Once per day as a free action when a wild hunt monarch slays an adjacent creature by any means, he can attempt to reincarnate it as a wild hunt fey, even if the creature would not normally wish to be restored to life. The slain creature can resist this reincarnation if it succeeds at a DC 31 Fortitude save, but creatures slain while under the effects of any of the wild hunt monarch's charm or compulsion spell-like abilities take a -4 penalty on this saving throw. The wild hunt monarch can reincarnate the creature into his choice of wild hunt creature whose CR is equal to or less than the target's CR in its previous life. Alternatively, if the target was a humanoid or fey creature, the monarch can use the creature's own natural abilities to create a unique member of the wild hunt. Such a creature maintains all of its abilities. Its type changes to fey (do not recalculate any statistics), and it gains the wild hunt subtype. Its appearance changes to blend in with the wild hunt, granting it features such as long ears and glowing green eyes. Once reincarnated, the creature retains only faint memories of its previous life, but is now chaotic neutral and loyal to the wild hunt. A creature reincarnated in this way can be restored to its original life only via a miracle or wish-slaying the creature and raising it from the dead merely restores it to its latest incarnation as a member of the wild hunt, unless the effect of the wild reincarnation is first removed from the body via a successful break enchantment spell against a DC of 31. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

While their followers can travel on personal missions, these majestic leaders (who can be female or male, and are referred to as wild hunt queens or wild hunt kings as appropriate) can rally the hunt to follow them anywhere without question. Wild hunt monarchs set the terms of each specific hunt, depending upon the prey and their own whims. The easier the prey, the more likely a monarch is to impose rules to make the hunt more entertaining, such as forbidding anyone but his hounds from injuring the quarry, or holding back his forces to give the target creature time to rest and recover.",
			"",
			"Many members of a wild hunt monarch's following join as soon as they are born from the fey realm, but others are born out of his own prey, or come to serve him after the demise of their previous leader. Monarchs do not typically interact with their own kind, but they occasionally collaborate on an exceptionally challenging hunt, testing their wits against nascent demigods or beasts of legend.",

			"",
			"Evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic emanations of terrified creatures, will-o'-wisps delight in tempting gullible travelers into dangerous situations. In the wild lands where they're most common, will-o'-wisps favor simple tactics like positioning themselves over cliffs or quicksand where they can easily be mistaken for lanterns (especially if they can set their traps near actual signal lanterns), allowing them to lure unwary travelers into perilous situations. On rare occasions, will-o'-wisps seeking easier pickings will move into a city and take up residence near gallows or follow along invisibly behind an army in order to harvest the fear of the dying men; why the vast majority choose to remain in the swamps where victims are scarce remains a mystery. Will-o'-wisps only use their electric shock ability under extreme duress, preferring to let other creatures or hazards claim their victims while they float nearby and feast.",
			"",
			"Will-o'-wisps can glow any color they choose, but are most frequently yellow, white, green, or blue. They can even vary their luminosity to create patterns-many will-o'-wisps are fond of creating vague skull-like shapes in their glow to further terrify their victims. Their actual bodies are barely visible globes of translucent spongy material 1 foot across and weighing 3 pounds, capable of emitting light from every surface. A will-o'-wisp's light is approximately as bright as a torch, and though they do not seem to use sound to communicate with each other, they hear perfectly and can vibrate their bodies rapidly to simulate speech.",
			"",
			"While vilified by most other sentient creatures, will-o'-wisps are actually quite intelligent, if utterly alien in their reasoning. Sometimes organized into groups called \"strings,\" their society and goals remain complete unknowns to outsiders, as do their origins, though they have sometimes been known to strike bargains with those who can offer them vast quantities of appropriately frightened victims. As will-o'-wisps do not age, and are effectively immortal unless killed by violence, particularly ancient will-o'-wisps can serve as fantastic repositories of knowledge from the ancient past, although convincing one of these cruel creatures to cooperate with an interrogation can be a trick in and of itself."

			"The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of ill deeds and misfortune, preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it.",
			"",
			"Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their vanish ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them.",
			"",
			"Legends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern, moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic.",
			"",
			"Greater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years.",
			"",
			"As a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place. Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life's reward. Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by the elder witchcrow.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Witchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows most prevalent in Irrisen, where they've developed a terrible reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule) both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they find them.",
			"",
			"In witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group's success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or cast out of the flock entirely."

After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical.",
			"",
			"**Hexes (Su)** A greater witchcrow uses hexes as a 5th-level witch. Invariably, these abilities include the cackle, evil eye, and misfortune hexes, and require a successful DC 15 Will save to negate or resist. Witchcrow cackling proves especially unnerving as it sounds like extremely mocking cawing.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of ill deeds and misfortune, preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it.",
			"",
			"Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their vanish ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Legends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern, moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic.",
			"",
			"Greater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years.",
			"",
			"As a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place. Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life's reward. Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by the elder witchcrow.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Witchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows most prevalent in Irrisen, where they've developed a terrible reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule) both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they find them.",
			"",
			"In witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group's success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or cast out of the flock entirely."

Their speed and pack instincts let them use coordinated attacks, flanking, and hit-and-run maneuvers.",

			"The power and majesty of timber wolves inspire many sentient races. For civilized folk, the wolf has come to embody a primitive evil, often playing the role of a villain in fairy tales. This has earned the animal an undeserved reputation for aggression. Among northern peoples, the wolf symbolizes strength and prowess in battle. Many tribes revere wolf totems, and some even claim in their folklore to be originally descended from wolves."

A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted.

The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut.

A pair of brown-and-tan feathered wings sprouts from its back. While on the ground, wolpertingers fold these wings tight to their bodies. Fierce predators, wolpertingers hunt in packs using clever tactics. While capable of flight, they find prolonged flight taxing and tend to stay on the ground most of the time.",
			"",

			"",
			"Wolpertingers are usually encountered in temperate forests and hills, though scarcity of their favored foods can sometimes drive them to warmer or colder climes. Though they are omnivores, wolpertingers prefer fresh meat to grasses and berries. They typically hunt creatures smaller than themselves (favoring rabbits, mice, squirrels, and the like), but often take on larger predatory animals, such as foxes. Given a large enough pack, wolpertingers can even take down a solitary wolf.",
			"",
			"Wolpertingers mate only once per year, in the spring. Kits stay with their packs until they are fullgrown, but rarely remain with their birth-packs beyond a year, instead setting out to establish their own packs.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Though related to skvaders, wolpertingers are quite different beasts. Unlike their somewhat nomadic cousins, wolpertingers are aggressive and fiercely territorial. Packs stake out territories large enough for their hunting needs, and keep constantly vigilant against invaders. At the first indication of any significant threat, the pack mobilizes and attempts to kill or drive off the intruders. This territoriality extends to different packs of wolpertingers, though multiple packs have been known to coexist peacefully near one another as long as none of them violates another pack's territory.",
			"",
			"When on the hunt, wolpertingers vary their approaches, from slinking through the underbrush to flying in from above, as befits the terrain and the capabilities of their prey. When approaching from afar, they charge in quickly to get close enough to deal a forceful attack with their horns. Once in close combat, they gang up on their prey in flanking pairs. The strongest and oldest wolpertingers focus on melee, leaving the younger members of the pack to dart in for quick charges.",
			"",
			"Given their antlers, it's difficult for wolpertingers to create burrows like skvaders and normal hares. Instead, they seek shelter in naturally secluded areas as well as in the former dens of larger predators.",
			"",
			"### Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars",
			"",
			"While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat."

			"Because of the odd and usually accidental circumstances through which worms that walk are born, the process of such birth is far from standardized. Thus, the worms themselves can take more shapes than simply the most common one. For purposes of clarity, all of the variants presented below are referred to as worms that walk, even if their main components are not actually worms. These variants are created using the same statistics presented in Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2, and usually the only changes are cosmetic in nature (though see locust variant, below).",
			"",
			"Army Ants: Common in Garund's deserts and lush, tropical jungles, army ants swarm over the land like a living carpet, devouring everything they come across. A worm that walks composed of army ants likewise consumes everything in its path-including the body of the spellcaster it once was. Disturbingly, these worms that walk spend little of their time in humanoid-shaped form, preferring to crawl as a biting swarm of legs and pincers. This form of worms that walk is mostly likely to be encountered in underground-dwelling; these horrific creatures are said to include one who calls the dangerous sands of Thuvia home.",
			"",
			"Cockroaches: Cockroaches can be found in great numbers anywhere civilization stains the landscape with its refuse. Worms that walk composed of cockroaches are more likely to be found in urban areas, especially in large cities where they can go unnoticed by most, usually arising when both corpses and magical effluent are deposited in sewers and garbage dumps. A worm that walks composed of cockroaches is a creature of stealth and guile. Frequently keeping to the shadows and sewers of the city, these worms that walk broker information and engage in blackmail, augmenting their unnatural talents with strong illusion and enchantment magic. Some say that a powerful enchantress worm that walks made of cockroaches runs a guild of thieves in Absalom, but no reliable sources can say they've met her.",
			"",
			"Locusts: Found in any area that sports-or once sported-verdant plant life, this worm that walks variant has plague-like nuances and can be particularly hard to kill. Made up of ravenous locusts, these worms that walk make meals of any creatures weaker than they, and are particularly attuned to their animalistic instincts. One of these particularly appalling worms that walk is said to threaten the agriculture-rich lands of Geb, and due to the influence of Deskari in the Worldwound, a few of these creatures have been spotted in the ruins of Sarkoris.",
			"",
			"Wasps: Typically found in warm, moist regions, these worms that walk are made from hundreds of thousands of buzzing, swarming wasps. Aggressive and cruel, these worms that walk favor poison and other debilitating substances, and commonly focus their arcane knowledge on creating potent toxins. Rumor has it that one of these horrific creatures rules over a tribe of hunters along one of the winding tributaries threading throughout the Mwangi Expanse."

The first time in a round when a creature attacks a wrackworm with a melee weapon, the creature must succeed at a DC 27 Reflex saving throw or be struck by the creature's blood. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 points of acid damage each time that round it successfully hits the wrackworm with a melee weapon. A slashing or piercing melee weapon automatically takes 1d6 points of acid damage each time it damages a wrackworm. This acid damage ignores the first 10 points of a weapon's hardness. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",

This acts as a breath weapon that deals 10d6 points of acid damage and 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures in a 50-foot cone (Reflex DC 31 half); creatures that fail their Reflex saves are also exposed to the worm's poison. The material vomited forth by the wrackworm consists of all manner of ruined material-bodies, buildings, objects, vegetation, and more.

The first time each round a wrackworm is attacked by anything that resolves against its touch AC, the wrackworm gains a +30 dodge bonus against that attack.",
			"",
			"**Wrack Reality (Su)** As a move action, a wrackworm can gnaw through the walls of reality to create a vertically aligned dimensional portal. It can do so to create a portal that links an adjacent space to another visible space within 1 mile, or it can do so to create an interplanar portal between its current plane and a plane of its choice (typically at a random point on the other plane, as most wrackworms have little capacity or interest in precision travel). Once the portal is created, it remains in effect as long as the wrackworm is adjacent to it. The portal itself consists of a 10-foot-diameter hole in reality-large enough for a Large creature (or a creature with the compression ability, such as a wrackworm) to pass through. The hole does not undermine structural integrity or otherwise damage objects in the region it exists in. A wrackworm can use this hole to attack distant foes (and often does so to attack foes who use ranged superiority or flight against the worm), or crawl through the hole to reach a new location. This ability functions even in areas where planar travel does not function (as in the case of areas under the effects of dimensional lock or forbiddance) or if the effect that bars planar travel functions at caster level 20th or lower, but in such areas the ability requires a standard action rather than a move action to activate. Once the wrackworm is not adjacent to the portal, it immediately closes. A creature standing partially in the portal when it closes must decide which side of the portal it wishes to fully emerge from as it closes.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Wrackworms are a parasitic blight upon the planes that glut on the flesh of Rovagug, the imprisoned god of destruction, and their all-consuming hunger grows with every nibble of the Rough Beast's tainted essence. Rovagug himself is not harmed by the wrackworms gnawing on his flanks, but now and then, the chewing grows irritating enough that the Rough Beast gives a mighty shudder that hurls the wrackworms aside, whereupon their massive jaws reflexively gnaw holes into the underlying reality of the Dead Vault, allowing the immense monsters to burrow into other planes and spread far and wide throughout the Great Beyond. No wrackworm ever returns to the Dead Vault once it burrows out of it, and their violent emergence from the prison demiplane does not seem to undermine that reality's function as a prison, but many worry that, in time, the constant burrowing exit of the wrackworms may damage the Dead Vault enough that Rovagug himself may be able to finally escape.",

			"Each wrackworm is a towering hulk of segmented plates, an earthworm grown to titanic size. Its eyeless head is almost all mouth, with a gigantic maw filled with needle teeth. From its sides spring four long, chitinous limbs, each tipped with a razor-sharp scythe of hardened bone. At the caudal end of the worm is a long stinger like that of a scorpion, dripping with a flesh-ravaging toxin. Despite its bulk and sluggishness, a wrackworm moves with great swiftness when it wants to, darting forward to sink its fangs into a fleeing morsel or bothersome archer.",
			"",
			"The arrival of a wrackworm in a world is an apocalyptic event, made more so by its abruptness. A wrackworm rarely cares about reaching a specific destination so long as something exists therein to consume. This drive to feed on matter is not a biological imperative, for as an outsider a wrackworm has no physical need to eat. Instead, its desire to feed is driven purely by its entropic cruelty.",
			"",
			"Despite their mighty stature today, the first wrackworms were of humble origin. When the gods tore open the world and created Rovagug's prison, the Dead Vault, a vast amount of earth and stone were captured as well. The vermin infesting this soil, faced with few other options, fed upon the divine flesh of the Rough Beast. Generation upon generation of feasting on the flesh of a slumbering god has mutated these vermin into towering engines of gluttony and devastation-wrackworms.",
			"",
			"Some planar scholars claim to see a pattern in the wrackworms' boring of the planes. The treatises of these fanatical scholars posit that the worms are gnawing in precise patterns as part of a qlippoth plot to unmake the very fabric of the planes, unweaving all of reality to finish what the Rough Beast cannot as long as he remains trapped within the Dead Vault. Wrackworm infestations are also reputed to exist in the deepest parts of the Abyss, in a realm known as the Spiral Path, raising questions about a link to the demon lord Yhidothrus-himself a mighty wormlike beast.",
			"",
			"A wrackworm is 80 feet long when fully uncoiled and weighs 30,000 pounds."

			"",
			"Wraithwings are strix that were captured and killed by their Chelish enemies, and then rose again fueled by their lingering hatred. A terrible curse has brought them back from the dead to drive away invaders from their tribal land know as the Devil's Perch. Wraithwings roam the night, hunting down any non-strix within the cursed land, innocent and guilty alike.",
			"",
			"The Chelish forces that seek to occupy Devil's Perch have taken to making examples of any strix rebels they capture. After being interrogated, the captives are strung up on poles. While the strix hang there bleeding to death, their wings are broken to prevent any escape. Often, the soldiers who captured the strix warband lie in wait for anyone foolish enough to come to their rescue. This indignity kindles a burning anger within the strix that clings to their very souls. Once they have died, the bodies of the strix are dumped unceremoniously in remote locations as bait to lure strix hoping to retrieve their fallen comrades into an ambush. Dead strix tortured in this way can rise as wraithwings, but these foul creatures can be purposefully created as well.",
			"",
			"The mercilessly tightening grip of the Chelish Empire and the ever-rising number of dead friends and family push some strix spellcasters (typically oracles, shamans, and some witches) to turn to dark powers that whisper in the dead of night. Instead of giving a proper burial to the reclaimed bodies, the spellcaster takes them up a rugged crag and into a cavern where she prepares them for an unholy ritual. The spellcaster removes the broken wings from the bodies, and she places the bodies around a totem made of earth, wood, and bone. She then sews the wings into the totem and splashes them with blood drawn from her enemies. Upon the ritual's completion, the strix rise as wraithwings the following night. In addition to this ritual, a spellcaster of at least 11th level can create a wraithwing from the body of a dead strix using create undead.",
			"",
			"Wraithwings stand just over 6 feet tall, but their rotting bodies are lighter than those of living strix, weighing barely over 100 pounds.",
			"",
			"Wraithwings resemble their living strix counterparts in most ways, except for their wings. In place of their missing appendages, ghostly wings burn with a green fire. Additionally, a wraithwing's form is more bestial than a strix's, possessing long, sharp claws that can tear a victim in half. The seething rage that wraithwings feel toward their oppressors manifests in their narrow, glowing eyes. Lacking the ability to fly, wraithwings run on all fours to chase down their prey. They often hunt by ambushing their victims, climbing the rocky spires of Devil's Perch and leaping down to shred their enemies with their strong claws. Their changed physiques allow these creatures to deftly traverse even the steepest of cliffs. Wraithwings retain many of their old memories, but their overwhelming rage keeps their minds mostly clouded and focused on killing.",
			"",
			"Under the cover of night, wraithwings hunt within the areas affected by the rituals that raised them. Left to their own devices, they work their way outward from where they were created, first picking off people inhabiting lone farms and those who dare traverse the wilds after dark. Wraithwings prefer to stalk their prey, using their extensive knowledge of the area in order to drive targets into natural dead ends. During the day, wraithwings return to a hidden cave to draw strange symbols on the walls with the blood they have spilled during the previous night.",
			"",
			"On the rare occasions when Chelish soldiers manage to slay a wraithwing, few know that they must haul the battered body beyond the reach of the curse in order to prevent the fallen wraithwing from rejuvenating the following night. Most slain wraithwings thus rise again to continue their depredations.",
			"",
			"Even though these creatures are undead and no longer require food, wraithwings are consumed with a hunger for bones, specifically the bones of humans. As a result of their reanimation, this everlasting rage and hunger drive wraithwings to constantly hunt. When wraithwings track down and kill a human, they savagely strip the flesh from the body with their elongated claws. When only a skeleton remains, they crack the bones open in their mouths and suck out the marrow, leaving their victim's remains scattered in a bloody mess.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Wraithwings exist exclusively within or near the province of Devil's Perch in Cheliax. Wraithwings aren't mindless, but their thoughts are consumed with taking revenge on the invaders who have settled within strix territory, leaving little interest for socializing. Someone close to a dead strix might be able to momentarily cut through the fog of rage that twists its mind, allowing the former friend to learn what has brought his comrade back in such a dreadful form. If a strix persists in trying to prevent a wraithwing from hunting, it eventually considers the interfering strix a traitor and attack him as well.",
			"",
			"Wraithwings are often created from a strix warband that was captured during battle. The strix that was in charge of the warband when they were alive often holds onto this status even in undeath and continues to command the other wraithwings as they hunt the wilds of Devil's Perch. If a group of wraithwings is torn between different ways to go about a hunt, the leader among them bends the others to its will. Alternatively, the spellcaster that initially raised them can exert some influence over the wraithwings with verbal commands if she still retains control.",
			"",
			"Good and neutral strix avoid these undead creatures, and consider them the worst of all undead. Many strix don't admit to their existence, claiming that wraithwings are simply spooky stories told by strix parents to keep their children in line. Some strix go so far as to organize warbands to hunt down wraithwings that hunt near where they live, fearing these vicious creatures will climb up the rocky spires in which they live and slaughter them. These fearful strix communities cover the lower reaches of their roosts with downward pointing spikes to deter any creatures from climbing them. They sometimes incorporate nets or other traps to capture these creatures so that they can properly dispose of the bodies without the wraithwings rejuvenating. Thankfully for these strix communities, wraithwings are nocturnal as well, and they suffer worse in the sunlight than living strix."

			"**Addiction (Su)** A wretchghost's touch causes wracking pain in the form of 2d6 points of damage-creatures that are specifically immune to pain or unliving creatures (undead or constructs) are immune to this damage, but otherwise this damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction.

Once a creature becomes addicted to the drug, it can still take damage from the wretchghost's touch but suffers no additional effects from its addiction ability-indeed, the creature might now find itself at something of an advantage over the wretchghost because of the creature's susceptibility to addicts.

As an incorporeal shade, the wretchghost can no longer revel in this bliss, save for brief moments when it infuses living flesh with this chemical desire. Regardless of its addiction, a wretchghost looks like a cadaverously thin phantom with sunken, glowing eyes and limbs that seem to writhe and twist more like tentacles than articulated arms and legs.",
			"",
			"Wretchghosts are found most often in the types of places addicts frequent, such as the seedier districts of urban settings, where dealers in illicit substances ply their predatory trade. This might mean a sordid street corner, an ill-lit back alley, or an underground opium den. However, rumors persist of these undead wandering beyond their former haunts, tormenting people who once enabled or profited from their hateful addictions. On even rarer occasions, a wretchghost somehow arises from an obsessive attachment to an object that held significance for it when the agonized soul was among the living: a pipe, an item of jewelry, a piece of furniture, or an article of clothing. Tales even exist of wretchghosts displaying addictions to specific, still-living people.",
			"",
			"A wretchghost can become inexplicably dormant for months or even years, merging its incorporeal form with some solid object (the wall of a structure or the watery depths of a sewer, for instance). Sometimes one of these dormant undead beings emerges for a moment to emit its ravenous howl of unsated desire, only to quickly retreat back into its shelter. An enigmatic combination of factors can awaken an inactive wretchghost, including the concentrated presence of living souls, magical energies, the use of its drug of choice in close proximity, or other less discernible causes.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Wretchghosts are most commonly found in small groups-those encountered alone are almost always sole survivors of a once-larger gang of wretchghosts. It is rare but not unheard of for a pack of wretchghosts to include multiple different associated drugs. A wretchghost has little left of its former personality or ambition, but when it comes to the task of addicting the living to its drug of choice, these creatures can be shockingly cunning and sneaky, particularly in the way they use their spell-like abilities.",
			"",
			"Certain enterprising and unscrupulous necromancers or priests of religions associated with undeath have taken to keeping small groups of wretchghosts under their control for the use of their addictive touch, either treating the undead as an unlimited source of the drug's effects, or using the addictions they cause to aid in controlling other underlings. These tactics are as vile as they are dangerous, for a wretchghost that escapes such control invariably seeks out its one-time master to extract revenge as best it can."

Spawn are under the command of the wyrmwraith that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they become free-willed dread wraiths. They don't possess any of the abilities they had in life.",
			"",
			"**Divine Dispelling (Su)** When a wyrmwraith strikes a creature with one of its claws, that creature is also affected by a targeted greater dispel magic (CL 20th) that can dispel only divine spells.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic Shift (Su)** A wyrmwraith can push through the ectoplasmic veil to temporarily assume a physical form made of ectoplasm. As a swift action, the wyrmwraith can become corporeal for 1d4 rounds. It can return to its incorporeal form as a free action. Once its ectoplasmic form's duration ends, the wyrmwraith can't assume that form again for 1d4 rounds. While in ectoplasmic form, the wyrmwraith loses the incorporeal ability (including its deflection bonus to AC) and gains a +16 natural armor bonus to AC, DR 15/-, a Strength score equal to its Dexterity score, and the phase lurch ability. The AC for a typical wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form is 41. When in ectoplasmic form, its attacks are Melee bite +27 (4d6+18 plus energy drain), 2 claws +27 (2d8+12 plus divine dispelling), 2 wings +24 (2d6+6), tail slap +24 (2d8+18).",
			"",
			"**Phase Lurch (Su)** A wyrmwraith in ectoplasmic form can pass through walls or material obstacles. It must begin and end its turn outside whatever wall or obstacle it's moving through. It can't move through corporeal creatures with this ability, and its movement speed is halved while moving through a wall or obstacle. Any surface it moves through is coated with a thin, silvery mucus that lingers for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Positive Energy Transference (Su)** Whenever a wyrmwraith succeeds at a saving throw to resist positive energy damage but still suffers damage, the wyrmwraith can immediately transfer that damage to any dread wraith spawn of its choice with 120 feet that it controls. The wyrmwraith takes any excess damage beyond the spawn's hit points. Even if the wyrmwraith has no spawn under its control, when it succeeds at its save against a positive energy effect that normally deals half damage on a successful save, it instead takes one quarter damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Wyrmwraiths arise from the souls of powerful dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of moving on to an afterlife. No longer concerned with amassing wealth and power, wyrmwraiths instead brood with an unrelenting hatred of all living things. They hate other dragons above all else, seeing the existence of those living creatures as a mockery of their own.",
			"",
			"Wyrmwraiths typically haunt their former lairs or some other location where they can hide from the sunlight. They are drawn toward ancient ruins, forgotten catacombs, and other places associated with death. Litter, detritus and bones lie heaped in areas controlled by a wyrmwraith instead of the coins and gems. In the rare instances when a wyrmwraith is away from its den, the malice of its presence still lingers palpably in the cold air. Still displaying the draconic instinct to protect their homes from would-be thieves, wyrmwraiths will often create and leave behind undead guardians.",
			"",
			"Wyrmwraiths slay those who venture near their lairs, surrounding themselves with their newly created dread wraiths and any other undead they can create or control, carving out small fiefdoms populated by undead servitors. They send their minions to collect anything and anyone with knowledge or power they believe can aid them in their dark endeavors. Captured individuals who please the wyrmwraith can expect to be reborn as powerful undead while those that fail wallow in eternal torment as dread wraiths.",
			"",
			"On rare occasions throughout history, powerful necromancers or dark cults have managed to entice or coerce a wyrmwraith into an alliance. These collaborations are fleeting, as wyrmwraiths still retain a twisted shadow of their draconic pride, seeing all other creatures as beneath them. Unless compelled to work with others, a wyrmwraith turns on its allies once they are no longer useful to it.",
			"",
			"Finding a way to gain a wyrmwraith's attention is difficult because it is no longer interested in wealth or other mundane material possessions. Instead, wyrmwraiths seek knowledge or items to reverse or improve their undead condition. Their own loathing of what they have become is the only thing as strong as their hatred of the living. Yet, despite their predicament, they still fear ultimate death.",
			"",
			"A wyrmwraith blights the land with its very presence, a slowly spreading stain tainting anything it touches. Undead activity inevitably increases in any area a wyrmwraith inhabits. Unless a wyrmwraith is destroyed, its territory often becomes a lifeless wasteland for miles.",
			"",
			"Wyrmwraiths are very dangerous opponents in combat. They prefer to soften up enemies with their breath weapon and spells before closing in for melee. Wyrmwraiths target clerics, paladins, and other spellcasters wielding divine magic, both because they know divine magic possesses the greatest threat to them and because they see it as a chance to strike back against the gods for their accursed state. Wyrmwraiths care little about how many of their undead minions are destroyed in combat. They are merely pawns to the wyrmwraiths, who have the means at their disposal to create more.",
			"",
			"Wyrmwraiths appear as skeletal, ghostly versions of their former selves, their features warped by malice. No matter the size they once possessed, wyrmwraiths measure roughly 50 ft. from snout to tail. Unencumbered by flesh, they move with a silent, effortless, and deadly grace. Even wyrmwraiths' minds become changed in undeath. Already long-lived creatures when they were dragons, some wyrmwraiths have spent an even longer time as undead. Brooding and nurturing brutal hatred for the living for so long drives these wyrmwraiths insane, causing them to become reckless-or self-destructive-and to venture out into the night to rain down destruction on a nearby settlement or even an entire kingdom, knowing that they will eventually be hunted down and destroyed."

This cabal was interested in creating magical machines, so they built their tools to be small, agile, and clever. Over time, the cabal pushed the limits too far and created minions with free will, and these first wyrwoods began to question why they were involved in their masters' petty intrigues. When the wizards forced the wyrwoods to fight each other as proxies for the wizards themselves, the constructs instead killed their creators and stole the notes on how to create more of their kind, allowing them to perpetuate their race.",

All wyrwoods know how to create more of their kind, and they keep the details of their construction process secret from other creatures to make sure their race is never again enslaved.",

			"Wyverns are nasty, brutish, and violent reptilian beasts akin to more powerful dragons. They are always aggressive and impatient, and are quick to resort to force in order to accomplish their goals. For this reason, dragons generally look down upon wyverns, considering their distant cousins nothing more than primitive savages with a distinct lack of style or wit. In most cases, this generalization is spot-on. Although far from animalistic in intellect, and capable of speech, most wyverns simply can't be bothered with the subtlety of diplomacy, and prefer to fight first and parley later, and even then only if faced with a foe they can neither defeat nor flee from.",
			"",
			"Wyverns are territorial creatures. Though they occasionally hunt in small groups for large prey, they are generally solitary creatures, hunting in areas ranging in size from 100 to 200 square miles. Wyverns have been known to fight to the death among themselves for the right to hunt a territory rich with prey.",
			"",
			"Although constantly hungry and prone to mayhem, a wyvern that can be befriended (usually through a delicate combination of flattery, intimidation, food, and treasure) becomes a powerful ally. They often serve giants and monstrous humanoids as guardians, and some lizardfolk and boggard tribes even use them as mounts, although such arrangements are quite costly in terms of food and gold, for few are the wyverns who would willingly serve as steeds for lesser creatures for long.",
			"",
			"A wyvern is about 16 feet in length, half of which is tail. The average wyvern weighs 2,000 pounds."

During these conjunctions, the xanthos can use its teleport spell-like ability as interplanetary teleport to reach any other world in its current solar system, or as plane shift to reach any known plane.

The race that created xanthoi has since died off or left for remote destinations, and the remaining xanthoi have lost many of their former powers, but they still have a driving need to explore worlds and planes. Xanthoi are omnivores but can survive on vegetable matter.",
			"",
			"A xanthos memorizes geography, flora, and fauna in case its lost masters ever return.

Each xanthos has a specific interest, and its desire to examine and catalog might be inconvenient or irrelevant to an adventurer's desires.",
			"",
			"Xanthoi avoid using their abilities to interfere or help with wars, planar invasions, and natural disasters, as they believe doing so violates an ancient code limiting their actions to observation and memorization rather than influencing events. They are more likely to flee than to fight unless fleeing would leave their friends stranded or in danger.",
			"",
			"A xanthos is 13 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 15,000 pounds. Its sloping, armored back is not particularly comfortable for humanoids to sit on, but is well suited for bearing a howdah that can hold up to four Medium or Small creatures. It may accept a howdah, but doesn't tolerate being treated as a beast of burden."

			"Xenopterids are human-sized predatory insects with the insidious ability to mimic the form of their favorite prey-humanoids. Xenopterids can be encountered nearly anywhere they can find food, quickly adapting their mimicry to resemble whatever humanoids are most common in a particular region. They can bend their wings to form cowls and cloaks, and they can fold their limbs to imitate humanoids' weapons and armor. A xenopterid's eeriest feature is its mouth-a crude chitinous beak that, when closed, resembles a human face. Up close, the xenopterid's unsettling nature is obvious, but from a distance or in dim light, the creature easily passes for its prey. Because their mimicking abilities require concealment, xenopterids commonly hunt their prey at night. Once a xenopterid captures and kills a victim, it liquefies the creature's remains in order to bring the putrid slurry back to the hive where it stuffs this substance into small spherical capsules the creatures use as food. Some evil races prize these capsules, and make gruesome liquors by fermenting the contents.",
			"",
			"Xenopterids live in colonies in abandoned ruins, old castles, decrepit farmsteads, and similarly abandoned human structures. A colony typically consists of 19 to 28 sterile drones and a fertile hive king and hive queen (xenopterids with the advanced creature simple template). Each colony has only one fertile male, so xenopterids reproduce slowly. Still, the only way to destroy a xenopterid colony is to kill both the king and the queen, and neither one of them ever leaves the safety of the hive. Xenopterid drones become fiercely aggressive when defending the hive against invaders."

Larger or hostile communities that persecute or hunt xiaos often suffer from numerous unexpected fires and destructive forms of larceny and sabotage. Xiaos have excellent memories and hold grudges against those who abuse them.",

			"Xiaos are born from eggs slightly larger than a chicken egg. These eggs are covered with bluish leathery skin, and are usually laid singly or, infrequently, in pairs. A juvenile xiao begins flying within 6 weeks of hatching, and hangs from the fur on its mother's chest until that time. Those born in captivity latch on to suitably friendly and patient humanoids as surrogate mothers during development. While a xiao raised in captivity takes to flying later than those born in the wild, it otherwise develops normally, though it is likely to have less fear of strange humans than its wild kin.",

			"**Implant (Ex)** As a standard action, a xill matriarch can lay 4d6 eggs in a helpless creature. These eggs hatch in 24 hours, at which point the young consume the host from within, dealing 1 point of Constitution damage per hour per young until the host dies. The young then emerge and planewalk to the Ethereal Plane, if possible. A remove disease spell (or similar effect) rids a victim of all implanted eggs or active young, or they can be cut out one at a time with successful DC 25 Heal checks (each attempt takes 10 minutes). If the healer fails the check, he can try again, but each attempt (successful or not) deals 1d4 points of damage to the patient. Xill matriarchs can take mental control of creatures in which they have implanted eggs as a full-round action. This functions as dominate monster (CL 13th) and works at any distance, even between the Ethereal Plane and Material Plane. The host takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw to resist the matriarch's control. While dominated, the victim is immune to xills' paralysis ability. The matriarch can use greater scrying on the dominated victim at will (no saving throw). A matriarch can maintain one such link at a time; if she wants to use dominate monster or greater scrying on a different creature implanted with her eggs, she must end the effects on her current victim (though she can switch back later).",

			"",

They grow outraged with mortals who poison or pollute water and even those who befoul the air with bad smells (such as by burning garbage, casting stinking cloud, or running a tannery). Although they don't need to eat, they sometimes choose to do so for pleasure, enjoying the sort of food that a carnivorous fish or bird would consume.",

Because of their carnivorous nature, xtabays only rarely run short on nutrients, consuming the entirety of a victim's body over the course of several days following the initial process of draining its blood. Xtabays are able to devour creatures thanks to their lengthy roots, which produce a corrosive acid that breaks down and absorbs flesh and bone."

Though not the original inhabitants of these strange cities, the xulgaths zealously guard their homes from intruders. They are particularly fanatical in the defense of their central temple, a 900-foot-tall ziggurat built upon an island directly beneath Deep Tolguth's false sun. Outsiders claim that a connection exists between the sun and the temple, and attribute the xulgaths' intelligence and powers to this mysterious link.",

			"**Brain Collection (Ex)** A yah-thelgaad can store up to six brains of Small or Medium creatures and use them to enhance its knowledge and power. Each stored brain grants a yah-thelgaad a cumulative +2 insight bonus to AC, concentration checks, and Knowledge checks. A yah-thelgaad can extract a brain from a helpless opponent with a coup de grace attack, or as a standard action from a body that has been dead for no more than 1 minute. A yah-thelgaad that has fewer than six collected brains gains two negative levels for each missing brain. These negative levels never become permanent, and can only be removed by replacing one of the yah-thelgaad's collected brains. The statistics presented here assume a yah-thelgaad with a full collection.",
			"",
			"**Carapace (Ex)** The spikes on a yah-thelgaad's carapace make melee attacks against it hazardous. Any opponent attempting to attack a yah-thelgaad with a light weapon, unarmed strike, touch attack, or natural attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or take 1d6 points of bleed damage from these bristling barbs. Bleed damage from multiple failed Reflex saves does not stack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
			"",
			"**Command Disease (Su)** As a swift action, a yah-thelgaad can cause a disease or infection currently afflicting a creature within 30 feet to quicken and activate, forcing the afflicted creature to immediately attempt a saving throw against the disease's effects. Those who fail immediately suffer the disease's effects. These additional saving throws count against those one must succeed at to recover from a disease, so it's possible for a victim to be cured by succeeding at enough saving throws.

			"",
			"**Mind Storm (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a yah-thelgaad can employ its own brain as well as any brains kept in its blisters to create a powerful psychic vortex. When the creature activates this ability, all creatures within a 40-foot radius must succeed at DC 23 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. When a yah-thelgaad activates this ability, it can choose to absorb one of its brains as a swift action to cause one creature within the area of effect that has succumbed to the confusion effect to instead become stunned for 1d4 rounds. A creature stunned in this manner is confused for 1d4 rounds after the stun effect ends. A yah-thelgaad generally saves this tactic for when it's faced with a particularly dangerous foe, since the stun effect forces the yah-thelgaad to lose one of its stored brains and gain 2 negative levels. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The creature enters a state of torpor, its body curling into a tight ball as it consumes the oldest of its seven stored brains to trigger the metamorphosis. Over the course of several days of self-consumption, the neh-thalggu bursts from the shell of its old body into its new incarnation as a yah-thelgaad.",
			"",
			"While the yah-thelgaad shares many of the features of its less powerful progenitor, it is in every way a more powerful creature than it was before. While the capacity to store one fewer brain than a neh-thalggu presents some disadvantage, the yah-thelgaad gains twice as much power from a collected brain as its lesser kin does. In addition, these creatures need not limit their harvest to the brains of humanoids-any Small or Medium creature's brain will do.",
			"",
			"Yah-thelgaads are zealously devoted to the inscrutable causes of the Dominion of the Black, but they are also notoriously devout believers in that alliance's weird theology, worshiping a concept they refer to as the \"Ineffable Void,\" among other cryptic mysteries. It is not uncommon for yahthelgaads of high rank to also possess inquisitor or oracle levels, lording their authority and fanatical faith over those in their charge-the most powerful yah-thelgaads often take levels in mystic theurge to combine their class-based mastery of the divine with their stolen brains' arcane lore.",
			"",
			"Yah-thelgaads often supervise the Dominion of the Black's surgical and genetic engineers on major projects, pushing those agents to attempt greater and more horrific procedures. For all their legendary cruelty, however, yah-thelgaads don't appear to gain pleasure from such experiments. Indeed, they don't seem to feel any emotions at all on their own, but rather experience such sensations vicariously through the memories of the brains they've collected. In this way, the creatures know lust, fear, hatred, and pride without exposing their own minds to the disadvantages of being susceptible to mind-affecting effects."

A gift of a yeth hound companion to a particularly successful cult is sure sign of favor in the eyes of a demonic patron. A cult with yeth hounds granted to them in this manner must take care to retain this favor, for if they displease their demonic patron, the hounds could turn on them.",

Yeth hounds range great distances from their dens during their nightly hunts, and have been known to carry kills for miles just for the comfort of consuming a fresh meal in their lair. The sight of a yeth hound loping through the sky with a body clenched in its jaws is unsettling indeed."

Four thick appendages extend from a yithian elder's body, stretching to a length of almost 10 feet or retracting until they nearly disappear.

The fourth appendage, atop the cone, bears the creature's round head, which holds three large eyes spaced evenly around it.

Cooperative subjects who share what they know of their own worlds can move with a certain amount of freedom about the yithians' cyclopean cities. Even those who are forced to exchange their minds with yithians can, if well-behaved, learn a great deal about their hosts' culture, which is strictly organized, largely free of crime, and almost entirely focused on the exploration of science and art, though yithians possess a bizarre aesthetic in keeping with their alien natures and nearly unlimited knowledge.",

Many Yolubilis herons stand in water long enough that they grow algae on their legs, deepening the illusion of a tree growing along the riverbank. Some travelers have reported Yolubilis herons stitching fallen foliage into their feathers to complete their attempt at camouflage.",

Powerful savage tribes corral these beasts and unleash their carnage on the battlefield.

While its powerful jaws and claws are equally capable of taking down opponents, the yrthak generally prefers to wheel through the sky on its membranous wings, firing bolt after bolt of sound into its prey, and exulting in the thrill of the hunt. An adult yrthak is 20 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.",

To accomplish this, they haunt the people and places they knew in life in search of fresh victims for their painful grasp. Regardless of whether she received a proper burial or not, a yurei always appears dressed in the remnants of funereal clothing, with her face obscured by long black hair. Often, the restless spirit seems to be dripping wet or caked with mud or filth, or displays other distressing signs of neglect. Her body can also appear contorted or disjointed, reflecting the pain that twists her very existence.

A single herd can range over a spread of tens of thousands of square miles in a year, devouring all the grass and small vegetation in the region, trampling what they can't eat, and forcing other creatures-including humanoids-to move elsewhere or suffer the same fate.",

			"**Fighter Training (Ex)** Zanas treat their Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats and other abilities. They are proficient with the longsword, the longspear, heavy armor, and all shields (except tower shields).",
			"",
			"**Instant Armament (Su)** As a swift action, zanas can instantly equip themselves with magical armor and weapons. This grants a zana a +8 armor bonus to AC. A zana's weapon can take one of two forms, which the zana can switch between as a swift action: a +2 keen thundering longspear or a +2 keen thundering longsword and light shield. When wielding the shield, the zana gains a +3 shield bonus to AC. This armament is a manifestation of the zana's life force and disappears if the zana is killed. A zana can dismiss these armaments as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Petrifying Glance (Su)** As a standard action, a zana can target a creature within 30 feet with a petrifying glance. The target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or be turned to stone permanently. A zana can use this ability a number of times per day equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The zana can later touch the petrified creature to return it to normal as if they had cast stone to flesh. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Protective Aura (Su)** All allied creatures within a 10-foot radius of the zana are immune to charm and fear effects.",
			"",
			"**Sitebound (Ex)** A zana is bound to the mountain they call home and can never stray beyond its foot. Each day the zana spends away from the mountain, they must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage that cannot be healed until the zana returns to their mountain. Eventually, any zana separated from their mountain dies from this damage.",
			"",
			"**Unearthly Grace (Su)** Zanas are imbued with unnatural grace. A zana adds their Charisma bonus as a resistance bonus on saving throws and as a deflection bonus to AC.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"From Cheliax to the Mwangi Expanse to far-flung Tian Xia, nearly every culture on Golarion has legends about fierce and beautiful fey warriors who defend their wild, lofty homes and the innocents who visit them. These wondrous, protective spirits are called zanas, the guardians of the mountains.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Zanas are both male and female, possessing the ability to shift from one gender to the other. Each zana has a unique identity in either form, but both forms have the same strength and skill. They sometimes favor one identity over another, but often use both to confuse others, making visitors think that the mountain is populated by more than one protective spirit. If zanas are familiar with a visitor, they might playfully shift between forms without warning, just to see what kind of reaction they can get.",
			"",
			"Zanas most closely resemble half-elves, though they are rarely mistaken for members of a humanoid race. Poets who write of them have said they embody the best physical qualities of many races in one being. Zanas tend to be tall and athletically built with slightly pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes. They are usually clad in light clothing or wear no clothing at all. When threatened or moved to defend others, they can conjure forth armor and weapons with but a simple thought.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A zana calls a single mountain home, though not all mountains host one. Why one mountain hosts one of these fey and another will not is a mystery. Those mountains that do are known as places of power, but also places of peace where one shows respect to nature and is kind to children for fear of the spirits' reprisals.",
			"",
			"Zanas follow those who travel on the mountainside. If they determine the travelers are worthy, or if bribed with milk, sugar, and other good foods, zanas may reveal themselves and serve as teachers or guardians. Sagas have been recounted of noble scions retreating into the mountains for decades after their houses fell, only to return to the world with impressive fighting skills. Zanas have been responsible for at least some of the cases in which those stories are true.",
			"",
			"Zanas tend to be secretive, but are sometimes found lounging in pools or gently running streams. They are usually good-natured, especially if approached peacefully. They might even be persuaded to assist their visitors if they deem the cause worthy. In particular, they always help children in need. Many lost children have returned to their families and told of a powerful man or woman who protected them from monsters or \"bad people\" and then helped them find their way home.",
			"",
			"Those who invade a zana's territory with the intent to harm the land or people under the fey's protection find they face a dangerous foe. When hunters discover strangely realistic \"statues\" on a mountain's slope, they know that hapless fools somehow managed to enrage a zana, who can petrify enemies with a single glance. When thunder rolls down from certain mountains, the locals say that zanas are battling enemies with their magical weapons.",
			"",
			"Zanas are related to bardhas-the \"white ones.\" While zanas are spirits of mountains' sides and peaks, bardhas dwell underground and are even quicker to anger. The two kinds of fey may work together if they discover derro, the bardhas' hated enemies, using tunnels beneath a zana's mountain to carry out raids on the surface world. Most of the time, however, zanas simply wander the mountainside, enjoying its majesty and watching for signs that a creature needs protection.",
			"",
			"### Notable Zanas",
			"",
			"The following are a few zanas of the Inner Sea region.",
			"",
			"Eilia and Leimrin: Mount Aremetrus and Gristleknob in Ustalav lie on either side of the Cauldheart. Some believe the same zana guards both mountains, but in truth, Eilia and Leimrin are twins, torn asunder by the eldritch forces that created the strange valley between them. The fey often seek goodhearted adventurers to take gifts for one another across the Cauldheart, through which the zanas cannot pass.",
			"",
			"Marovania: The zana of Arazlant Mox on the isle of Kortos is especially powerful. Marovania may have been changed by the magic that lifted the island above the waters of the Inner Sea, for the zana has the skills of a great warrior and the magic of a mighty sorcerer. Marovania considers all of Kortos to be part of their mountain and can go wherever they wish-even entering Absalom-as long as the zana never leaves the island's shores.",
			"",
			"Rhyadid: Mount Anantisha, in the Menador Mountains, is said to hold the source of the Katharevousa River. The mountain's zana, Rhyadid, is hated and feared in Egorian because they help escaping slaves cross from central Cheliax and pass downriver to Kintargo. Rhyadid is strongly connected with the mountain's wild animals and wages war on Chelish forces who dare enter the zana's domain."

			"**Freeze (Ex)** A zarxorin that has used its hill retreat ability appears to be a large earthen mound with a ring of standing stones around its crown, and it can take 20 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a hill or rock. A zarxorin that has spent at least 10 years within its hill becomes covered with vegetation and nests for wildlife, gaining an additional +10 bonus on this Stealth check until it ends its hill retreat.",
			"",
			"**Hill Retreat (Ex)** As a move action, a zarxorin can withdraw its body into the hump on its back to protect itself from danger and increase its connection to deep power within the earth. The zarxorin gains a +8 bonus on saving throws and to CMD against drag, bull rush, pull, or push attempts and against any other effect that would physically move it from its position. The zarxorin also gains a +8 enhancement bonus to its natural armor, although this benefit does not apply against attacks made by creatures that the zarxorin has swallowed whole. While in its hill retreat, a zarxorin cannot take any action except to end the retreat or to use its joggle ability. The zarxorin recovers 1 point in its menhir focus pool for each year it spends using this ability. The zarxorin can end its retreat as a move action.",
			"",
			"**Joggle (Ex)** As a full-round action, a zarxorin can rapidly shake its bulk to scatter its foes and churn the ground; all creatures in the zarxorin's space or adjacent to it that are at least three sizes smaller than the zarxorin take 5d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 40 negates); creatures that take damage from the zarxorin's joggle are pushed to the nearest unoccupied square and fall prone. The zarxorin's space and all adjacent spaces thereafter become difficult terrain. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Menhir Focus Pool (Su)** The standing stones on a zarxorin's back gather latent power from the earth into a menhir focus pool that the zarxorin can use to create a variety of powerful effects. The pool contains a maximum number of points equal to the zarxorin's Hit Dice (28 for most zarxorins), although a zarxorin is typically encountered with only 1d10+10 points in its menhir focus pool due to the slow rate at which they are recovered. A zarxorin can spend these points as noted below, but cannot spend more than 2 points from its menhir focus pool each round. A zarxorin can recover points in its menhir focus pool only through use of its hill retreat ability. The save DCs are Strength-based.",
			"",

			"- As a swift action, a zarxorin can expend 1 point from its menhir focus pool to calcify a creature that it has swallowed whole, as per flesh to stone (Fortitude DC 40 negates).",
			"- As a move action, a zarxorin can spend 2 points from its menhir focus pool to unleash a blast of power that deals 20d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures in a 300-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 40 half) other than the zarxorin; creatures that take damage from this effect are slowed (as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds.",
			"",
			"Stony Stomach (Ex) A zarxorin's stony interior makes it difficult for creatures it has swallowed to escape. Its stomach gains a +4 bonus to AC and has double the normal hit points when determining the success of a creature attempting to cut its way free.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A zarxorin is an immense, humanoid-shaped elemental with a vast hummock of rock and earth across its back like an enormous shell. Several weathered menhirs protrude from its back, resembling a circle of standing stones. The creatures are prone to long bouts of hibernation, during which they connect to the ley lines and energy sources of the deep earth and slowly gather power in their standing stones. A hibernating zarxorin is often mistaken for a hill, its standing stones believed to be evidence of some ancient, sacred site. Humanoids can live peacefully near one of these \"druid hills\" for decades, only to be flabbergasted when the hill suddenly rises up and lumbers away.",
			"",
			"Zarxorins engage in short stretches of exploration between their long rests, treading doggedly across mountain ranges or through underground caverns. They are by nature pugnacious, likely to swat away anyone in their path, and they rarely back down from a fight. Although zarxorins have no need to eat, they have a vast, stony stomach and can swallow smaller creatures whole, grinding them up within their cavernous bellies.",
			"",
			"A zarxorin is 75 feet tall and weighs more than 10,000 tons.",
			"",
			"Zarxorins originate in the Plane of Earth, but many have migrated to the Material Plane through planar breaches. They prefer to inhabit hilly regions on the surface or massive caverns underground, where their titanic bulk can nestle within sunken valleys along ley lines. Zarxorins pull their bodies into the massive humps on their backs to rest, becoming indistinguishable from an ordinary hill capped with standing stones. When in this pose, zarxorins feel a peaceful connection to the energy sources that flow deep within the earth, restoring their energy. Once the zarxorin can draw no more energy-often after decades-it rises up to find a new resting place.",
			"",
			"Although its heavy tread shakes the ground, knocking over trees and setting rockslides in motion, a zarxorin has very little further impact on its environment. While at rest, it serves as a place for plants to root and animals to nest; when it wakes, it simply shakes these creatures off before moving on. Despite featuring an enormous mouth with jagged stones for teeth and a belly filled with grinding rocks, a zarxorin does not need food and generally only swallows troublesome attackers who won't get out of its way or who wake it from hibernation.",
			"",
			"An angry zarxorin can discharge the energy stored within its back-menhirs against its foes, either by channeling power through its stony body or by blasting the energy through the air. A zarxorin's menhirs cannot be removed without causing the creature great pain, as with pulling a healthy tooth, but they grow back after several centuries if removed.",
			"",
			"Zarxorins are effectively immortal, and some have been wandering through the Darklands and across Golarion for millennia.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Zarxorins prefer to be left alone, particularly while they are hibernating. Despite their connection to ley lines and natural forces, zarxorins feel no particular connection to druids, shamans, or powerful nature spirits. When zarxorins encounter one another, they share stories of their travels slowly, over many days, and then depart peacefully. Zarxorins are not particularly bright, and might be convinced to ally with another creature in exchange for directions to a magic-rich place to rest. They are generally too powerful to fear any other creatures, but great elemental rulers have been known to bully zarxorins into temporary service, creating an army of towering hills."

The souls of these forsaken priests were unable to pass on, and they now prowl the site of their deaths as incorporeal undead known as zealot wraiths.

As such, zealot wraiths pose little threat to those living souls who shared their faith but who did not succumb to the same tragedies that resulted in the wraith's creation, leaving the undead ironically impotent in the temples and holy sites they frequently haunt.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Zephyrs are nature spirits tied to the weather. Some more social zephyrs enjoy cavorting with athletic mortals, but their wanderlust means that their good graces last at most a matter of months before they vanish for at least as long, seeking new horizons and racing storms. Zephyrs are seen by some as minor divinities of weather or as servants of Gozreh or the Eldest.",
			"",
			"When attacked or provoked into aggression by a perceived offense, a zephyr uses its breath weapon to scatter foes and then takes advantage of its mobility to trample or pounce on whichever enemy seems most isolated or physically imposing. A zephyr uses its spell-like abilities to prevent foes from regrouping. True to its proud fey nature, a zephyr rarely admits defeat without planning to turn the weather against an adversary at a later time as part of a vengeful ambush.",
			"",
			"A zephyr in its equine form is the size of a large horse and weighs over 1,000 pounds. A zephyr in its humanoid form usually stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs around 400 pounds, possessing an athletic build with feathered wings spanning 15 feet.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Zephyrs are spirits of the sky and storm who sometimes slip through from the First World in places where long-lasting weather patterns scour the land. These fey reproduce sexually, but require a strong thunderstorm or another extremely high-energy system for successful conception. Zephyrs are known to have brief dalliances with mortals, a fact that has made them possible ancestors of humanoid sorcerers and bloodragers with the fey or stormborn bloodlines. Amorous zephyrs usually test potential paramours with challenges of physical skill and endurance such as races or wrestling matches. Because they draw nourishment from the places where warm and cool air mix, zephyrs travel seasonally, always dashing after these roiling weather systems. These fey can live for thousands of years, wasting away only when they are imprisoned for decades or when the climate around them has shifted to become unrecognizable or stagnant.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Zephyrs roam across the world to anywhere they can see the sky, but these free-spirited fey favor windswept plains, deserts, lonely mountain peaks, and stormy coastlines. These creatures have been spotted all along the Inner Sea's shores, and they appear to be plentiful near the Eye of Abendego. High stone ruins near vital trade routes or sensitive farmlands feature reliefs and sculptures depicting both bounty and misery brought by a zephyr's tempestuous idea of fun. Many settlements throughout Cheliax and other longstanding civilizations once left offerings to zephyrs in places such as these a few times a year in order to reduce the risk of troublesome storms. Such offerings might include hyacinths or other eyecatching flowers, fragrant fruits, charred meat, jewels, and works of art celebrating the beauty and strength of horses, humans, and storms. Though not a common event in current times, these donations are still arranged by sailors, farmers, travelers, and worshipers of Gozreh or the Eldest.",
			"",
			"While some zephyrs do serve the deities of weather, nature, and storms, other zephyrs regard such deities simply as powerful spiritual peers. Those zephyrs worshiped in their own right by mortals usually turn an eye on their faithful at most once or twice a year, whether out of pleasure or offense. A source of deep insult to a fickle zephyr might easily seem innocuous to mortals and could include damaging flowers that the zephyr favors, erecting tall structures (especially windmills), or any magical manipulation of the air or weather.",
			"",
			"### Other Zephyrs",
			"",
			"In addition to the relatively common breed of zephyr presented above, sometimes called a thunderstorm zephyr, there exist others with slightly different abilities and behaviors.",
			"",
			"Blizzard Zephyr (CR 12): Blizzard zephyrs dwell in cold climes, although they often follow their namesake storms south on wintry winds. A blizzard zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals cold damage as it blasts its enemies with snow and ice that knock enemies prone instead of blowing them back. A blizzard zephyr has immunity to cold rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use polar ray once per day and diminish plants three times per day instead of chain lightning and plant growth.",
			"",
			"Sirocco Zephyr (CR 12): Sirocco zephyrs come into the world in places such as northern Garund and the Cinderlands of Varisia that are rife with hot, dry winds; sandstorms; and volcanic eruptions. A sirocco zephyr's breath weapon is a 90-foot cone that deals slashing damage and blinds enemies for 1d4 rounds instead of blowing them back. A sirocco zephyr has immunity to fire rather than immunity to electricity, and has electricity resistance 10. It can use diminish plants three times per day and sirocco (DC 21) once per day instead of chain lightning and plant growth.",
			"",
			"Whirlwind Zephyr (CR 13): Whirlwind zephyrs are the rarest of their kind, born from magical storms and tornadoes found almost exclusively on temperate plains or on hurricane-wracked coasts such as those around the Eye of Abendego. These zephyrs have the advanced creature simple template. A whirlwind zephyr also gains the [whirlwind](umr/whirlwind) universal monster ability (1/day, 10-60 feet high, 2d6+7 damage plus 2d6 sonic, DC 25) and can use ice storm once per day instead of fog cloud and plant growth."

Zhen worms normally restrict themselves to modest prey such as rodents and lizards, but a hungry worm may attack Small or even Medium prey.",
			"",
			"A zhen worm has no mouth or digestive tract. Instead, it absorbs nutrients and secretes waste through thousands of tiny orifices along its body. The mucus coating its body slowly dissolves organic matter. Over a matter of days, a zhen worm wrapped around a corpse reduces it to nothing but bones and a foul-smelling slurry.",

If left on for at least 3 days, the distillate dissolves away hair, nails, and skin, while leaving muscles and organs untouched. If not thoroughly washed away with wine or a similar alcoholic liquid, zhen distillate leaves behind a foul aftertaste. A flask of zhen distillate weighs 1 pound, costs 50 gp, and preserves the corpse of a Large creature. Each step up or down from Large doubles or halves, respectively, the amount of distillate needed. The mucus harvested from a single zhen worm can be processed into one flask of distillate with a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check."

The zhyen grows legs where its elemental half used to be and goes completely bald, and its skin assumes a duller, more human-like color and texture. The resulting creature is a petty genie-creature called a jocta. The change frees the jocta from whatever binding spells enslaved its as a zhyen; most immediately flee before they are bound again. Most jocta are chaotic neutral or neutral evil.",

A jocta may be summoned like a zhyen or even bound as a familiar, but it is sullen and uncooperative, enjoying nothing more than returning to a former \"master\" and snatching a few items of value or sentiment from him before slipping off once again."

If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Tied to the dark forces of nature and unholy magic, zuvembies employ fear and the wild creatures of the land to take their vengeance upon the living. Zuvembies appear to be withered, animate corpses but possess ruthless minds and blasphemous vigor. Revenge fuels a zuvembie, a hatefulness directed toward those who wronged it in life. Yet even when the last one who maligned it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the relatives of the target of its original hate.",
			"",
			"Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie.",

			"Zuvembies stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weigh over 100 pounds."
