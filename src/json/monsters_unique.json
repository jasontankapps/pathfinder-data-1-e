			"",
			"#### Special Abilities",
			"",
			"**Aura of Suffocation (Su)** Agmazar's alien presence breaks down the atmosphere around it, causing the air to become thin and nearly unbreathable. Within 1 mile of Agmazar, breathing creatures are subject to fatigue and altitude sickness as if at high peak altitude. Creatures within 60 feet of Agmazar must hold their breath or begin to suffocate.",
			"",
			"**Channel Negative Energy (Su)** Agmazar can channel negative energy as a 20th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine focus.",
			"",
			"**Creaturesense (Ex)** Agmazar has lifesense up to 120 feet. In addition, it can sense the presence and position of undead creatures within 1,200 feet as if it had blindsense.",
			"",
			"**Force Field (Su)** Agmazar is surrounded by a field of force that grants it a deflection bonus to AC equal to its Charisma bonus and resistance 30 against force effects. Its natural weapons are treated as force effects for dealing damage to incorporeal or ethereal targets. The first time each round Agmazar is targeted with a ranged attack, there's a 75% chance that attack is deflected by the force field, with a 50% chance of it being reflected back upon its originator and a 50% chance of it being deflected toward a random creature within 60 feet of Agmazar (or deflected harmlessly if no creature is within this range). This deflected attack uses the same attack roll result, caster level, and save DC as the original attack.",
			"",
			"**Gravitic Control (Su)** Agmazar can radically alter the effect of gravity, bending or even inverting gravity to suit its will. As a standard action, it can alter gravity for 2d6 rounds, choosing one of five effects (with effective caster level 20). Only one type of gravitic control can be in effect at a time. Involuntary movement forced by gravitic control doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. Agmazar and its serpent arms are immune to its gravitic control, except for gravitic deceleration. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"- Gravitic Acceleration: This ability functions as telekinesis (CMB +35, Will DC 40).",
			"- Gravitic Attraction: This ability functions as repulsion but in reverse; any creature that fails its saving throw (Will DC 40) can't move away from Agmazar. Each round it doesn't spend a move action resisting the attraction, it is pulled 1d6 &times; 5 feet toward Agmazar.",
			"- Gravitic Deceleration: All creatures within 30 feet are affected as by feather fall. Flying creatures in this radius move at half speed, and a creature making a ranged weapon attack targeting a creature in the radius takes a -2 penalty on the attack roll.",
			"- Gravitic Inversion: This ability functions as reverse gravity (Reflex DC 40), but Agmazar can concentrate on the spell. Each round it continues to do so, the radius of the effect doubles.",
			"- Gravitic Repulsion: This ability functions as repulsion, but a creature that fails its saving throw (Will DC 40) not only can't move toward Agmazar, but is also pushed 1d6 &times; 5 feet away from the kaiju each round it doesn't spend a move action resisting the gravitic repulsion.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Blows (Ex)** Agmazar adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus on damage rolls with slam attacks.",
			"",
			"**Serpent Arms (Su)** As a full-round action, Agmazar can detach and release one or two of the lower arms from its body, revealing that the joints buried into its torso are alien serpent heads. The arms move and fight independently as hollow serpents, beginning on the round they're detached. For each arm it detaches, Agmazar takes 25 points of damage that can't be reduced.",
			"",
			"When a hollow serpent uses channel negative energy or a spell-like ability, it counts against Agmazar's uses of that ability. While its arms are detached, Agmazar's fast healing is reduced by 10 for each missing arm, and it can make slam attacks only with the arms still attached. If a hollow serpent is destroyed while separated, Agmazar can regrow its missing arm in 1 hour. Reattaching one or both lower arms is a full-round action and restores Agmazar's fast healing to the normal rate (though does not regain the hit points lost from detaching).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Agmazar the Star Titan is a kaiju whose origins lie far from Golarion. It plummeted from the sky in 2456 by the Imperial Calendar (–44 ar) into the trackless green of the eastern Valashmai Jungles. Though many have searched for Agmazar's landing place, none have found it and survived with suff icient strength or sanity to report precisely where it is.",
			"",
			"However, Agmazar's entrance into the world hardly went unnoticed. In fact, its meteoric advent drew the attention of the great kaiju King Mogaru, who claimed the jungles at that time. In a cataclysmic battle that wiped out every living creature for miles, King Mogaru slew the invader from the stars and left the body burned and broken, after which he returned to his deep lake lair for a long rest.",
			"",
			"King Mogaru, however, didn't know the alien powers engrafted within the Star Titan- fail-safes created long ago by the Balance, its makers upon the planet Verces, who created it as an ultimate weapon against undead invaders from Eox. If Agmazar were killed, these unholy energies would raise it, not to life that might once again be snuffed out by the undead, but to titanic unlife that would make it an invincible weapon.",
			"",
			"After Agmazar had great victories, its overambitious creators launched it into space to take the fight to Eox itself. But the kaiju was intercepted in transit-a cabal of liches used a disguised interplanetary portal to shift Agmazar's trajectory from planetfall on Eox to instead land on Golarion.",
			"",
			"Confused by the richness of life on the planet and unable to escape Golarion's gravity, Agmazar was taken by surprise by Mogaru's onslaught. Its death activated its failsafe programming, but it found few undead within range of it senses. Though the kaiju destroyed undead wherever it found them, once it had exterminated all that it could find, it grew frustrated and its heart turned bitter.",
			"",
			"Agmazar now lies in wait most of the time, but lashes out even at the living if they disturb its watchful reverie. If a great necromantic power arises anywhere near Agmazar, it senses the threat and departs immediately to destroy it, treading a path of devastation as it seeks to fulfill the purpose it was given so long ago."

The scourge only functions for Ahriman. If his scourge is lost or destroyed, Ahriman can magically create a new one from the skeletons of four genies.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Hopelessness (Su)** Any creature that comes within 30 feet of Ahriman must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",

Ahriman knows when a creature becomes dominated, and can expel any creature as a move action, causing it to appear in any adjacent square. The save DC is Constitution-based. ",
			"",
			"A swallowed creature can't cut its way out. Any creature in the area of silence or a similar affect is unaffected by the sonic damage and domination. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Lord of All Divs is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all creatures in his stomach if a creature in his stomach casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature either inside or out of his stomach casts atonement, freedom, holy word, limited wish, miracle, or wish.",
			"",
			"**Consume Essence (Su)** Ahriman's soul-rending savagery erodes the fundamental essence of his victims. When he confirms a critical hit with a natural weapon, the target takes 1d6 points of ability drain to a random ability score (Fortitude DC 39 half). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Crown of Fourfold Curses (Su)** The ancient curses graven on the horns crowning Ahriman's head grant him a +14 profane bonus to AC and a +4 profane bonus to spell resistance against spells or spell-like abilities with the good descriptor or those cast by good creatures. If Ahriman confirms a critical hit with his gore attack, the target is stricken with bestow curse (DC 36). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Freeing Chains (Su)** Multiple chains wrap around Ahriman's body, and three select links can free him if he's bound. Ahriman can break one of these links to gain the benefits of freedom. He can do this as an immediate action to negate an applicable effect being cast on him.",
			"",
			"**Lord of All Divs (Ex, Su)** Ahriman gains a suite of traits as Lord of the Divs.",

If he is slain, his body collapses into a mass of writhing snakes and is restored to life (as true resurrection) at the foot of his mountain. Once this occurs, Ahriman can't use this ability until a full year has passed; if slain again before that time, he is forever destroyed.",
			"- Frightful Presence (Su) Ahriman can activate his frightful presence as a free action as part of any attack, spell-like ability, special attack, or by speaking aloud.",
			"- Summon Divs (Sp) Three times per day as a swift action, Ahriman can summon any div or combination of divs whose total combined CR is 20 or lower, or summon a unique div of his choice. This otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule, with a 100% chance of success, and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.",

			"",
			"Shake Faith (Su) When Ahriman strikes a divine spellcaster with a melee attack, the target is shaken for 1d4 rounds (Will DC 38 reduces the duration to 1 round). On a critical hit, the target is frightened instead of shaken for the same duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Skin of Serpents (Su)** Ahriman's flesh writhes with countless vipers, embodiments of ancient and forgotten evils. Any creature striking Ahriman in melee (unless using a reach weapon) must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. The save DC is Charisma-based. If the creature fails its save, Ahriman gains 5 temporary hit points.",
			"",
			"**Slaughtered Slave (Su)** Any humanoid slain by Ahriman becomes a cairn wight (or brute wight if it was a giant) in 1d4 rounds. A genie killed by Ahriman instead rises as a ghul in 1d4 rounds. The creature is enslaved to Ahriman's will and loses all abilities and memories it had in life.",
			"",
			"**Symbolic Prison (Su)** When Ahriman entraps a creature in his bottomless maw or in a maze spell, he can use one of his symbol spell-like abilities as a swift action. The symbol affects all creatures within the prison, and ends when all creatures have escaped the maw or maze.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Ahriman sprang from the darkest shadows of the elements at the birth of the genie races. Though he towers nearly 20 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds, Ahriman moves with uncanny swiftness. Ahriman's rampages leave legions of undead in his wake that, alongside nihilistic Usij cultists, tear down life, culture, and civilization. To the Lord of All Divs, suffering and pain are meat and drink, corruption and murder useful tools, and the end of all things the only worthwhile goal."

And then one day, more than 300 years ago, Akilep came across a hidden tomb in the stony wastes of southeastern Thuvia. Markings on the tomb's surface suggested that she had just stumbled upon the final resting place of a heretofore unknown pharaoh from the height of Ancient Osirion, and furthermore that this pharaoh was believed to have made contact with beings from the stars. At last, Akilep had found the mother lode-and yet the tomb was warded with magic more powerful than anything at her disposal, the lock an inhumanly complex affair of twisted levers and strange, sealed cylinders that even her chime of opening couldn't budge. For decades, Akilep worked studiously at the mechanism, quietly seeking out those who might be able to assist her. At last, with no other recourse, Akilep settled down in front of the tomb to await a time when circumstances might change, sleeping away the years as a statue. Of late, however, rumors of the tomb's existence have surfaced in caravan waystations across the desert, and it may be that Akilep's centuries of solitude are drawing to a close."

			"A still untainted fey in the northern stretch of the Shudderwood, Amalya is a bastion of nature among a perverse land, where denizens are beginning to succumb to the Worldwound's demonic hordes. To survive, she has formed a particularly close bond with her natural surroundings. She's studied the earth's struggle to survive against the Worldwound's onslaught; this scholarly curiosity has granted her powerful spells that she uses to protect herself, her tree, and the forest's remaining natural creatures. Given the danger she faces daily, Amalya is better at hiding than most dryads-however, the prevalence of half-fiends and other unspeakably abhorrent creatures also makes her a pragmatist of the highest order. She allies with like-minded adventurers who can stave off these threats more readily than others do of her kind."

			"",
			"Arazni was once a demigod and herald to Aroden. As the Red Crusader, she rode into battle during the Shining Crusade. Yet her bravery and might were of no avail against the Whispering Tyrant, who humiliated her before torturing her to death, throwing her broken form amid the ranks of her army to dishearten them. But even in death Arazni found no comfort. She lay in rest only 67 years before the overzealous Knights of Ozem provoked the witch-king Geb, who raised some of the fallen knights as grave knights and sent them to bring Arazni's revered remains to him. Not content with her corpse, he infused deathless vitality into her and bound her spirit up in her bones, making her his Harlot Queen. She rules still in his stead.",
			"",
			"Arazni's onetime disciples in the Knights of Ozem have resolved to lay her finally to rest. The knights possess the Bloodstones of Arazni: four of her organs kept in funerary jars, which they recovered from Geb. They believe those bearing these jars have the protection of both holy aura and mind blank against Arazni's magic (in addition to an ability unique to each jar). But whether the jars hold the key to truly destroying her has not yet been proven. The Harlot Queen plots in secret to destroy-or recover, if possible-all the remaining jars. Her graveknight bodyguards monitor for any sign of the Bloodstones. It's said that Arazni senses the location of a jar when it's used, but no one can be sure whether this is true or a rumor the Harlot Queen has spread to keep those relics from being used.",
			"",
			"Arazni's Staff of the Magi (Minor Artifact): Arazni possesses an unusual staff of the magi that Geb recovered from a nameless pharaoh's tomb and offered his newly risen bride. This staff of the magi uses its wielder's caster level, Intelligence modifier, and feats when determining its spells' saving throws, rather than the set save DCs of a typical staff of the magi. In addition, if the wielder knows the mythic version of one of the staff \"s spells, she can expend uses of mythic power to cast or augment that spell as if she were casting it normally. If the wielder doesn't know the mythic version of a spell, she can use the mythic version of that spell by expending one use of mythic power per 2 levels of the spell (rounding up); a mythic spell cast this way can't be augmented. The wielder can use metamagic feats in conjunction with spells cast from her staff if she has a way to apply the feats on the spot without increasing the spells\" caster levels (such as Arazni's arcane metamastery path ability, a metamagic rod, or the Spell Perfection feat).",
			"",
			"Arazni's staff of the magi can create unique fireballs, which cost 2 charges to cast. These fireballs begin as eruptions of black fire, but coalesce into explosive waves of freezing darkness. These fireballs can deal fire damage, cold damage, or half cold and half fire. Creatures failing their saving throws against such a fireball are staggered for 1 round by the force of the explosion. In addition, the area of the fireball is treated as deeper darkness until the end of the wielder's next turn. Any creature or object that enters the darkness during this time takes damage as if it had been in the area when the fireball was cast. This power replaces telekinesis.",
			"",
			"Harlot's Kiss (Minor Artifact): Arazni's scarlet-hilted rapier is a relic of her days as the Red Crusader. Her blade acts as a +1 conductive dancing keen rapier, and its conductive property can be used once per round even while it is dancing.",
			"",
			"The blade has two abilities only Arazni can use. If she hurls Harlot's Kiss using the hand of the apprentice ability, it can perform a full attack against a single target rather than a single attack, instantly returning to Arazni at the end of her turn. However, she can't use hand of the apprentice on the rapier while it's dancing. If Arazni expends one use of mythic power when commanding the weapon to dance, the weapon's attacks use her caster level as the base attack bonus (effectively gaining a +10 bonus on attack rolls) for as long as it dances."

			"**Biting Blackflies (Ex)** Baalzebul's body consists of innumerable flies. The first time in a round a creature strikes him with a melee touch attack, natural attack, or unarmed strike, the creature is subjected to these flies' savage stings and bites. The creature takes 7d6 points of damage and must succeed at a DC 42 Fortitude save or become nauseated with pain for 1 round. These biting flies cling tenaciously to the attacker for 1 round, dealing 7d6 points of damage on the attacker's next turn (but not threatening nausea). Any damage from an area effect destroys clinging flies, though they share Baalzebul's resistances and immunities, including spell resistance. If Baalzebul does not move more than 5 feet in a round, any creature that approaches or begins its turn within 10 feet of him is affected in the same way. Any number of targets can be affected in a round by the biting blackflies, but no more than once per round per target. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hellfrost (Su)** Half of any cold damage dealt by Baalzebul is unholy damage that is not reduced by cold resistance or cold immunity. Devils are immune to this unholy damage, but it is doubled against creatures with the good subtype.",
			"",
			"**Lord of the Flies (Su)** Any creature flying under its own power (not by means of a magic item, spell, or spell-like ability) that tries to attack Baalzebul in melee must succeed at a DC 39 Will save or the attack fails and is wasted. In addition, if it fails the save, the attacker is so awed by Baalzebul's majesty that it cannot look at him directly for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that succeed at the save are immune to this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Suffocating Swarm (Su)** Baalzebul can collapse into a swarm of flies or reform his body as a free action; when he is discorporated, his sword becomes part of the swarm and his Strength score becomes 1. Baalzebul functions as a true swarm of Fine creatures when discorporated, filling four squares as he chooses, and has a swarm attack that deals 7d6+26 points of damage. Any creature that fails at a DC 42 Fortitude save against his distraction attack is nauseated and begins suffocating, as a suffocation spell (CL 30th). If killed by this suffocation, the creature arises 1 minute later infested by a hellwasp swarm (a successful DC 42 Fortitude save immediately before death negates). The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Swarm Body (Ex)** Baalzebul's body is composed of millions of tiny flies. He can pass without difficulty through narrow holes, openings, and cracks as if in gaseous form. He has no discernible anatomy and is not subject to critical hits or flanking, and he takes only half damage from attacks dealing bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. If reduced below 0 hit points, he discorporates into a suffocating swarm (as above) and is staggered, but does not fall unconscious. Baalzebul is immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single target spells and rays) unless he chooses to target himself with such effects, though he is still subject to mind-affecting effects. He takes half again as much damage (+50%) from area effects, including splash weapons. Baalzebul is treated as a single Large creature for the purpose of wind effects.",
			"",
			"**Swarm Master (Su)** Baalzebul is immune to swarm damage and swarm effects (such as distraction). As a swift action, he can direct the movement of any unintelligent swarm within 30 feet.",
			"",
			"**Usurpation (Su)** When a creature within 30 feet targets itself with a spell or effect, as an immediate action Baalzebul can gain the same effects as the caster (including interacting normally with a caster using time stop). Baalzebul can have only one usurped spell effect at a time; copying a new effect causes him to forfeit any previously copied effect.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Baalzebul was once the chief lieutenant of the Prince of Darkness. The glorious Hell's Angel sought to rule at Asmodeus's side, but he was greatly vexed at being relegated to stand alongside other archdevils. When he demanded a higher station, claiming he should rule over multitudes, the Lord of Hell annihilated his magnificent angelic form, replacing it with swarms of insects so he might rule over them in their millions as Lord of the Flies. Chastened, Baalzebul has brooded on vengeance ever since, harboring an insatiable urge to prove himself greatest among Hell's lords. His knowledge and power are vast, but so are his caprice, ego, love of flattery, and tendency to lash out at any perceived slight.",

Once such a victory has been achieved, they gloat over those left behind. Baalzebul's sacred places are always erected high above the surrounding cities or landscape, often in soaring towers and colossi, the better to literally and figuratively look down on those whose defeat awaits them at the hands of those bold and ruthless enough to will it.",
			"",
			"Baalzebul's unholy symbol is a broken black crown tipped at an angle, underneath a shining white diamond inside a broken white halo. Although he prefers the use of the longsword himself, his arrogance prevents him from sharing his favor of that weapon with his worshipers- instead, his favored weapon is the spear. He grants access to the Air, Death, Evil, and Law domains, and to the Devil, Murder, Undead, and Wind subdomains.",

			"",
			"**Counterport (Su)** As an immediate action, Barbatos can negate any conjuration (calling, summoning, or teleportation), effect within 30 feet, or redirect creatures to new valid destinations within 30 feet. Affected creatures take 10d6 points of damage, but with a successful DC 35 Fortitude save, a creature takes only half damage and can teleport normally. As a standard action, Barbatos can recall one creature that teleported since the end of his last turn. This functions as above, but the creature returns to the point from which it teleported (or the nearest available space, if that space is now occupied); the teleported creature can resist being recalled with a successful DC 35 Will save. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Festering Filth (Su)** A creature struck by Barbatos's filthy beard contracts blinding sickness if it fails a DC 39 Fortitude save. Attempts to remove this disease via a spell effect must first overcome Barbatos's spell resistance before attempting to remove the disease normally as per the spell's rules. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hear Name (Su)** Barbatos hears his name when it is spoken, regardless of distance and even across planar boundaries. If a creature speaks Barbatos's name three times in the same breath, Barbatos learns the creature's name and precise location, and can hear the next 21 words spoken by that speaker. Once per day, if any living animal or an image or statue of Barbatos is within 10 feet of the speaker, Barbatos can answer the speaker via that image, statue, or animal (an animal can resist being made Barbatos's mouthpiece with a successful DC 35 Will save). Barbatos can observe, converse, or utilize his spell-like abilities through this vessel for up to 13 rounds, but if Barbatos uses a spell-like ability through this link, the connection immediately ends thereafter, regardless of any remaining duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Sphere of Souls (Su)** As a full-round action, even when he is projecting his consciousness through his likeness or an animal, Barbatos can create a polished black crystal sphere that functions as a crystal ball with detect thoughts, which also grants him the benefits of status for 13 hours on one creature scried by the user. Each round a creature other than Barbatos uses the sphere, it must save against Barbatos's dominate person ability. Barbatos can freely manipulate the vision the scryer sees, as false vision, and can use detect thoughts and scrying at unlimited range on any creature within 10 feet of the sphere, with no save and with a +10 bonus on caster level checks. Effects that normally block scrying spells instead allow each creature a saving throw and negate the bonus on caster level checks. Barbatos can have up to 13 such spheres at a time, and can destroy a sphere as a free action from any distance.",

			"Barbatos is a mystery among the lords of Hell, a being from beyond who came into the service of Asmodeus a mere millennium ago. Technically not a devil, Barbatos is nonetheless the archdevil of the uppermost layer of Hell. Since his arrival, he has served as the doorwarden of Hell, guarding its outer layer from angelic invasions and fiendish forays alike, and dealing with an endless stream of damned souls needing guidance to their final purgatory and tearful petitioners willing to risk everything for one final glimpse of their lost loves.",

			"",
			"Barbatos is the master of the rippling dimensions between worlds, and is worshiped by those who tread the hidden interstitial spaces of the universe, as well as those who manipulate animals and wild beasts, warping them through foul sorceries into sinister servants. His sacred places are found near crossroads, marketplaces, and ports, some accessible only by teleportation. As befits his role as the guardian to the entrance to Hell (and his association with gateways of all types), entrances to compounds are often held with particular reverence by Barbatos's cult, and the doorways or arches that provide access to his temples or other sites sacred to him often bear his likeness or symbol.",
			"",
			"Barbatos's unholy symbol is an inverted triangle with three red eyes-often, the triangle portion of his symbol appears to be three filthy beards, the tangled hairs of which extend in three directions around the eyes at the center. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff. He grants access to the Evil, Law, Magic, and Travel domains, and to the Arcane, Devil, Divine, and Trade subdomains.",

			"",
			"**Amorphous Anatomy (Ex)** Belial's constant shapechanging occurs within their body as well as outwardly, causing their vital organs to rapidly shift configuration and location. This grants the archdevil a 50% chance to ignore additional damage from critical hits and sneak attacks, and renders them immune to polymorph effects. Belial recovers from physical effects that cause the blinded, deafened, or dazzled condition after 1 round by shifting their form to create new sensory organs to replace those that were compromised.",
			"",
			"**Baleful Beauty (Su)** No matter what form Belial takes, the archdevil can adopt an aspect of unearthly beauty, causing either all humanoids (if in a humanoid form or the archdevil's true form) or all creatures of the archdevil's assumed type (if in another form) within 30 feet with line of sight to Belial to be filled with lust for them. Such a creature rushes toward the splendid figure to kiss the archdevil on its next turn, subjecting itself to the effects of Belial's caress. Alternatively, the archdevil can adopt a guise of extreme and appalling horror, causing creatures of that type to become nauseated for 1d6 rounds and to take 1d6 points of Strength damage. A creature can resist either effect with a successful DC 39 Will save, and a creature that successfully saves against either effect is immune to that effect for 24 hours, though it must attempt a new save against the opposite effect. This is a mind-affecting emotion effect. The DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Caress (Su)** A creature caressed or kissed by Belial gains 2 negative levels, and must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or also take 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage. As a swift action when using a spell-like ability, Belial can force a single creature currently suffering from any of these effects from a caress to roll twice on any saving throws against that spell-like ability and to use the lower result. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Change Shape (Su)** Belial can assume the form of any creature when changing shape, but the specific powers granted are limited to those available in the options for greater polymorph. Using change shape is a move action for Belial.",
			"",
			"**Fiendish Fluttering (Ex)** If Belial strikes a creature with both wings in the same round, the target is staggered for 1 round and dazzled for 1d4 rounds by flying feathers and scabrous scales. With a successful DC 41 Fortitude save, the target negates the staggered condition and reduces the duration of the dazzled condition to 1 round. This is a vision-based effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Hedonistic Hope (Su)** When any creatures (friend or foe) within 30 feet of Belial gain a morale bonus or a beneficial emotion effect, Belial can choose to gain the same benefit (including the highest bonus, if there are multiple morale bonuses of the same kind). In addition, when Belial confirms a critical hit, they suppress all morale bonuses affecting the target for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Ranseur Mastery (Ex)** Belial can attack adjacent foes with a ranseur as if it were not a reach weapon, and counts as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling feat prerequisites for ranseur related feats.",
			"",
			"**Reflexive Shapeshifter (Su)** Once per minute as an immediate action when Belial would be struck in melee by a non-reach weapon, the archdevil can use change shape to assume a different form of a smaller size, gaining a +10 dodge bonus to their AC against that attack; if this causes the attack to miss, they take no damage and can then move up to 30 feet in any direction before automatically reverting to their previous form. This ability and movement do not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Belial, the Pale Kiss, was created by Asmodeus as an object of adoration, a being that would be perfect in form and face in the eyes of every creature. The Prince of Devils granted Belial virtually unlimited malleability of form, enabling them to become whatever and whomever might be most alluring to those the archdevil encountered, along with a boundless imagination to create inspirational art and implements of war. Belial finds equal bliss in pleasure and in pain and revels in the act of creation, whether of innovations in magical or martial fields. The Pale Kiss designs new weapons for the legions of Hell, shapes new manifestations of magic for the minions of devilry to unleash upon foes, and even spawns entirely new races of infernal servitors, though the fiend cares little for creations once birthed, swiftly moving on to new interests.",
			"",
			"Belial's true natural form is unknown to all but Asmodeus, who has not shared even with Belial the secret of the archdevil's infernal genesis. The Pale Kiss changes shape almost constantly, at times seemingly without conscious thought. In council with the other lords of Hell, Belial typically appears as a delicately built humanoid between 5 and 6 feet tall with pale skin and hair but burning eyes, with one half of their body shining and angelic and the other as scarred, misshapen, and grotesque as the most hideous malebranche. Their weapons and gear are always finely crafted, though marred where they defaced them in their erratic rages. Belial's carnal lust is both expansive and insatiable, and they freely shift form, species, and gender when engaging with mortal and immortal lovers across the universe, leaving innumerable halffiends of every description in their wake.",
			"",
			"### Belial's Cult",
			"",
			"Belial is revered by those who crave wanton pleasures and forbidden desires but who hide beneath a mask of respectability and propriety. Adulterers celebrate the archdevil's rites alongside sadists, torturers, and worse; all two-faced deceivers willing to plumb the depths of depravity to fulfill their desires seek Belial's felicitations. The Pale Kiss's sacred places are often in large cities or remote and beautiful natural settings that hide grisly boudoirs and orgiastic abattoirs.",
			"",
			"Belial's unholy symbol is a split-faced mask, one side of which is smiling and white and the other frowning and red. Their favored weapon is the ranseur. The Pale Kiss grants access to the domains of Charm, Destruction, Evil, and Law, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Devil, Lust, and Rage.",

He generally keeps his distance from the machinations of the other archdevils, and of all their number he cares least about the tedious and trivial affairs of the Material Plane. His focus is on building the eternal and glorious perfection of Hell, the model community and system upon which the universe should be modeled. He is calm, creative, careful, and deliberate, in some ways the picture of a just sovereign, yet he is also unforgiving, ruthless, manipulative, and arrogant in the extreme. The rules of rank, station, and courtly life are his meat and drink, and he is swift to deride any who violate the tiniest rule of etiquette, though he quickly discards decorum when necessary to further his elaborate schemes. Alone among the archdevils, he maintains a passing acquaintance with courtly love and marriage, conferring with his advisors on matters of state.",

			"**Argent Prince (Su)** In his true form, Mammon lacks a body. The archdevil relies entirely on his possession spell-like abilities to interact with the physical world. In his true form, Mammon gains the incorporeal quality, gains a deflection bonus to his AC equal to his Charisma modifier (+11), and replaces his base speed of 50 feet with a fly speed of 80 feet (perfect maneuverability); he loses all abilities that rely on a physical body (including his Strength score, the additional immunities gained from possessing the Argent Prince (see below), air walk, his natural armor bonus, and his natural attacks). ",
			"",
			"Mammon rarely interacts with others without possessing a body, and his favorite body to possess is that of the Argent Prince-a powerful unique construct that represents the archdevil's ideal form. The Argent Prince always fails its saving throw against Mammon's greater object possession spell-like ability, and Mammon can call the Argent Prince to his side across any distance (even across planar boundaries) as a swift action-when he does so, he can possess the Argent Prince immediately. While possessing the Argent Prince, Mammon gains air walk as a constant spell-like ability; the gleaming glory ability (see below); and immunity to bleed, disease, necromancy effects, paralysis, sleep effects, and stunning. When Mammon is not possessing the Argent Prince (typically because he is possessing another object or being), the Argent Prince loses all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural abilities, but remains under the control of Mammon and can continue to fight or take other actions as Mammon directs. If the Argent Prince is destroyed, Mammon can rebuild it, but doing so requires the archdevil to remain sequestered in his workshop deep in Erebus for a year.",
			"",
			"**Gleaming Glory (Ex)** The Argent Prince's gleaming metallic body reflects light and magic. In bright light, a creature within 60 feet is automatically dazzled, while one that moves or begins its turn within 10 feet is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 37 Fortitude save or averts or closes its eyes as for a gaze attack. Rays and magical ranged touch attacks have a 20% miss chance against the Argent Prince, and such missed attacks have a 20% chance of being redirected toward a random target within 60 feet; otherwise, they are deflected harmlessly. While possessed by Mammon, the Argent Prince increases both chances to 50%, and if the creator of an effect deflected by this ability is within 60 feet, Mammon can reflect it at that creature instead of choosing randomly. Gaze attacks and light-based effects (including color spray and prismatic spray) targeting Mammon have the same chance as rays of being reflected, while area effects of this nature simply do not affect him. Mammon also has the same chance to move without harm through a prismatic wall or prismatic sphere. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Mammon's Mark (Su)** Any coin, gemstone, piece of jewelry, or art object that Mammon touches bears his invisible image for 13 days. He can sense the location of marked items (as per locate object, even if such an object is in an extradimensional space), and can communicate through them as per enter image. In both cases, this effect has 10 times the normal range (or unlimited range within Mammon's domain on Erebus). If a creature has a marked object in its possession for 24 hours, Mammon can locate that creature (as per locate creature with the same increase to range as above) at will as a free action, even if the marked object is discarded. Mammon gains a +10 bonus on caster level checks and to the save DC of scrying effects he uses against such creatures. If the creature is protected by an effect that protects against scrying and Mammon is in Erebus, the archdevil can expend one use of his mythic power to ignore that effect. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Plunderer (Su)** Mammon can sense wealth within 300 feet as if using a rod of metal and mineral detection. He also gains a +10 bonus on Appraise checks and on Spellcraft checks to identify the magical properties of items, can attempt either check once per round as a free action to determine the value or properties of any item within his line of sight, and gains a +10 bonus until the end of his turn on combat maneuver checks to disarm a creature of or steal an item he has thus appraised or identified.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mammon is the master of avarice, a fallen angel long in service to Asmodeus; though slain by his enemies long ago, his spirit lingered in his hellish sepulcher, unwilling to surrender to oblivion. His hunger for life infused his spirit into the obscene wealth heaped about him in death, until he became one with the wealth of ages. The Grasping One is now vault keeper for all of Hell, growing ever more resplendent as he discovers new treasures to incorporate into his form and reporting directly to Asmodeus on Hell's accounts.",

He cannot be blinded, dazzled, or deafened, and he is immune to bleed damage, blood drain, critical hits, and precision-based damage. In addition, once per minute when he is hit by a melee or ranged attack, as an immediate action Mephistopheles can cause his body and all of his gear to collapse into ashes while he teleports to any point within 30 feet of his prior position and re-forms, taking no damage from the attack. Within his realm of Caina, he can trigger this power by expending one use of his mythic power and can teleport up to 300 feet, or up to 30 feet even when subject to effects that normally prevent teleportation.",
			"",
			"**Flattering Inquisitor (Su)** Mephistopheles is unsurpassed at inveigling himself into a creature's good graces and ferreting out secrets. His discern lies spell-like ability automatically affects all creatures within 30 feet of him, and he does not need to concentrate to know whether a target is lying (although each time a creature tries to lie in this area it can attempt a Will save to negate the effect as normal). Anyone who attempts to lie when responding to a direct question posed by Mephistopheles must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom drain and be unable to speak for 24 hours (Mephistopheles can end this enforced vow of silence at will as a free action). This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Wings (Su)** Mephistopheles has three pairs of wings, and while the damage caused by all six wings is identical, the additional effect caused by a strike from a wing depends on its nature. A hit from one of his burning wings deals 1d6 additional points of fire damage and the creature struck must succeed at a DC 43 Reflex save or catch fire. A hit from one of his draconic wings deals 2d6 points of bleed damage. A hit from one of his raven wings causes permanent blindness unless the creature struck succeeds at a DC 43 Fortitude save. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Profane Gift (Su)** As a full-round action, Mephistopheles can grant a willing non-devil a +4 profane bonus to one ability score; this also allows him to communicate telepathically with and use his mind-affecting spell-like abilities on the creature at any distance (even across planar boundaries). A creature can have only one such gift at a time. The profane gift can be removed with dispel evil or dispel law, or Mephistopheles can remove it as a free action, dealing 3d6 points of Charisma drain to the target (no save). In addition, a creature that accepts a wish from Mephistopheles immediately becomes lawful evil (Will DC 41 negates) and gains the benefits of good hope for 1 week, followed by the effects of crushing despair for 1d6 months (CL 30th).

			"**Barbed Blademaster (Ex)** Moloch is proficient with all weapons. In addition, any piercing or slashing weapon he wields sprouts cruel, wicked barbs that increase the weapon's critical multiplier by 1 for as long as he wields it. Targets that have fortification gain only half their usual chance of ignoring Moloch's critical hits.",
			"",
			"**Call Weaponry (Su)** Moloch can call his weapons Goreletch (a +3 adamantine unholy vorpal battleaxe) and Ramithaine (a +3 axiomatic cruel unholy wounding longsword) to his hands at will as a free action from any distance (even across planar boundaries). If one of these weapons is destroyed, he can remake it and cause the rebuilt weapon to appear in his hand as a standard action; if needed, he can instead remake both weapons as a full-round action. Remaking a weapon in this way provokes attacks of opportunity, but calling a weapon does not.",
			"",
			"**Fiendish Furnace (Ex)** Any creature that comes within 10 feet of Moloch or begins its turn within this area takes 2d8 points of hellfire damage (no save). In addition, creatures that strike Moloch in melee are affected by his burn ability unless they succeed at a DC 43 Reflex save. Whenever Moloch would take cold damage, he can choose to block all cold damage from that attack, but doing so causes his fiendish furnace ability to be negated until the start of his next turn. Choosing to do so is reflexive and does not require any action on Moloch's part. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Incinerate (Su)** When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by an attack or effect used by Moloch that deals hellfire damage, it is instantly killed and its body reduced to ash (Fortitude DC 38 negates). Creatures destroyed in this way can be restored to life only through miracle, true resurrection, wish, or divine intervention. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Fortress (Su)** Once per day as a full-round action, Moloch can cause a towering fortress to erupt from the ground at a point within 30 feet. Treat this ability as if Moloch used an instant fortress, save that the fortress is 60 feet square and 90 feet tall, and sized for a Huge inhabitant. Once created, this fortress is permanent until Moloch uses the ability again, whereupon the previous fortress vanishes; any objects and creatures within the fortress fall to the ground at this time.",
			"",
			"**Spirit of Hellfire (Su)** Whenever Moloch creates an effect that would normally deal fire damage, it instead deals hellfire damage. Half of the damage dealt by hellfire is fire damage, with the other half being unholy damage that is not reduced by fire resistance or fire immunity.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Su)** Whenever a creature takes hellfire damage as a result of being swallowed whole by Moloch, it must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or be so overwhelmed with pain that it can do nothing but shriek and wail in agony, and can take no other action; this is a pain effect. Each round that such a victim shrieks in pain, Moloch's frightful presence is automatically activated and he gains a +4 profane bonus to the save DC to resist its effects. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Moloch is the dread general of Hell's armies, both his own hordes in the pits of Malebolge and the legions serving his lieutenants throughout the plane. He is fiercely loyal to Asmodeus and to Hell itself, and he marshals not only devils but also lost souls, other denizens of Hell, and interplanar mercenaries in brutal, endless campaigns. He can recount the dispositions and particulars of every military formation in Hell, and he brooks no insubordination or disobedience in martial matters, under threat of burning torments that are terrible even by Hell's standards. Moloch is surprisingly responsive to his mortal worshipers, and he is quite willing to exchange his favor for gifts of provisions, supplies, and soldiers for the infernal armies. Those sacrificed to him in the fires of the mortal world or ritually cremated in his honor after death face an eternity of soldierly slavery in his legions.",
			"",
			"Moloch is a hulking giant of fire and steel, standing 24 feet tall and weighing 5 tons. What appears to be his armor is in fact his flesh, inside which lies nothing but flames, ash, and bits of scorched bone from previous victims. Despite his fiery appearance, he is a cool and professional tactician who has studied war for eons and has put every known tactical theory into practice in the endless war against the celestial hosts and the fiendish rivals of Hell.",
			"",
			"### Moloch's Cult",
			"",
			"Moloch is worshiped by warlords and tyrants alike. Unlike for many archdevils, his worship is often public, with monolithic temple complexes and pits of eternal flame where sacrifices to the Ashen Bull are made to pass through the fire, or their hearts are cut out and burned to sear their courage into the immortal armies that the Lord of the Sixth marshals at the behest of the high lords of Hell. His sacred places are altars of blackened stone and twisted iron, replete with massive gongs and braziers to sound the knell of death that war will bring to all.",
			"",
			"Moloch's unholy symbol is a shadowed red-and-black bull's head with a sickly yellow flame within. Although he can use any weapon (and favors the battleaxe Goreletch and the longsword Ramithaine), his favored weapon is the whip, as he prefers his worshipers to drive armies by the lash. He grants access to the Evil, Fire, Law, and War domains, and to the Ash, Devil, Smoke, and Tactics subdomains.",

			"Over 3,000 years ago in the southern parts of the vast Thuvian desert, the great alchemist Artokus Kirran was able to harness the power of the rare and beautiful sun orchard and create an elixir that temporarily halted the process of aging in whoever consumed it. While this monumental discovery ultimately united the city-states of the vast desert nation, its creation also inspired many people of baser intentions to entertain their own selfish thoughts of eternal life, spurring them to do whatever they must in order to obtain some of the legendary sun orchid elixir.",
			"",
			"It was under this banner of greed that the infamous rogue Jalari Zafikiri assembled a team of fellow bandits. Their mission was to infiltrate the famed Citadel of the Alchemist, and Jalari promised the members of his crew that they would be able to coerce the alchemist to provide them all with enough sun orchard elixir to last until the end of days. But when the bandits passed too closely to the House of Oblivion on their way from Merab to the Citadel, however, they were besieged by divs, and most of their food stocks were destroyed in the ensuing battle. Desperate to complete his quest, Jalari continued on with his remaining allies, but the desert was too vast. The once-powerful rogue began to go mad in the desert heat, and in the dead of night he slaughtered his fellow thieves for food. His own shame completed his insanity, and when Jalari ran at a dead sprint across the dunes, he took flight and died in midair, the spirit of a wendigo taking over the husk of his withered body in his stead.",
			"",
			"Now, certain isolated Thuvian tribes raise goat-headed totems to the beast that stalks the nearby sandstone cliffs and massive dunes. Its forlorn howl echoes on the evening winds, and villagers disappear only to turn up later as withered, half-eaten husks when they fail to maintain their monthly sacrifices on lonely, windswept altars."

			"Ayandamahla was first conjured by Runelord Sorshen on the evening she and the other runelords were to meet to discuss the removal of King Xin from power. Sorshen expected treachery at the hands of her fellow runelords, and promised Ayandamahla a week of freedom among her subjects in the nation of Eurythnia if the succubus would promise to aid her in the event of betrayal by one of the other rulers of Thassilon. As it worked out, the only betrayal that night was that of the runelords against Xin himself, but Sorshen did not renege on her promise to the Crimson Lotus. Thus began a relationship that would last the rest of Thassilon's existence-Ayandamahla would not only serve numerous times as Sorshen's spy, assassin, messenger, champion, executioner, and lover, but would also aid her in her research into the nature of blood and its relationship to eternal life. Sorshen also made Ayandamahla the warden of the Lady's Light, an immense tower Sorshen had erected at the westernmost edge of her realm.",
			"",
			"When Sorshen learned that the end of Thassilon was nigh, she betrayed Ayandamahla-knowing that the succubus would not deign to remain as the protector of the Lady's Light once the runelord retreated into her secret vaults to wait out Earthfall, she worked a powerful binding spell to ensure that Ayandamahla would remain within the Light until Sorshen returned. The Crimson Lotus was enraged, both at Sorshen and at herself for being duped. She watched from atop the Lady's Light as Earthfall ended the world she'd helped build, used her magic and that of the Lady's Light to protect the statue from the earthquakes and tsunami that would have otherwise destroyed it, then retreated into the Light to wait out eternity. As it turned out, eternity was much shorter than the succubus expected it to be. When she discovered a flaw in Sorshen's binding spell, she managed to shift the magic to one of her alu-demon daughters and escaped back to the Abyss.",
			"",
			"In the 10,000 years since her service to Sorshen ended in betrayal, Ayandamahla never again forged as prosperous an alliance as that with the runelord. Instead, she has used mortals increasingly as her own tools, attended to duties for her own mistress, Zura, as needed, and has worked to perfect her skills at seduction, subversion, and slaughter the entire time. Throughout it all, the deadly creature has kept one eye on Varisia, watching patiently for any signs of Sorshen's return to the region. Even today, more powerful than ever before, Ayandamahla doubts she could match the runelord in power-but if Sorshen rises once again, the succubus plans to be there to have her revenge."

			"",
			"#### Special Abilities",
			"",
			"**Contingency (Sp)** Whenever Baba Yaga is attacked, she is affected by mislead.",
			"",
			"**Exceptional Stats (Ex)** Baba Yaga was born a perfect specimen of humanity. As a result, her ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Baba Yaga has much more gear than an NPC of her level would normally have. These modifications increase her total CR by 2.",
			"",
			"**Forceful Presence (Ex)** Baba Yaga adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to her Armor Class and on all of her saving throws. In addition, Baba Yaga uses her Charisma score as well as her Constitution score when calculating hit points. This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Hut Familiar (Ex)** Baba Yaga built her Dancing Hut using a combination of the witch's hut hex and the sanctum mythic path ability, and over time expanded the artifact's powers to its present state. The Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga serves as Baba Yaga's familiar, and replaces the normal witch's familiar ability. Baba Yaga's life is forever intertwined with her Dancing Hut and parts of her essence reside within it. As long as the hut exists, this special connection grants her 300 bonus hit points, DR 10/epic and good, and regeneration 20. This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Immortal (Su)** Baba Yaga has hidden her death to make herself even more difficult to kill. This functions as the base mythic ability, but Baba Yaga always returns to life 24 hours later, regardless of how she is killed. In order to permanently kill Baba Yaga, her death must be found and released back into her body, at which point she can be killed with a coup de grace or critical hit made with an artifact.",
			"",
			"**Long-Lived (Ex)** Mystical arcane powers, mythic abilities, and complex arcane rituals have extended Baba Yaga's life. She gains the +3 bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, but she doesn't gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution resulting from this advanced age. Baba Yaga's supernaturally empowered life grants her complete immunity to ability damage and drain, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, energy drain, petrification, poison, and all forms of madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind). This ability increases her total CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Permanent Spells (Sp)** Through the use of permanency, Baba Yaga is constantly under the effect of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, read magic, see invisibility, and tongues. Baba Yaga has also devised a way to inscribe symbol spells upon her person. Baba Yaga has permanent symbols of death (DC 36) magically inscribed on the center of her chest, between her shoulder blades, upon the crown of her head, and on the soles of her feet. Only a few great beings have knowledge of the symbols' passwords (each symbol has its own unique phrase), and even fewer significant personalities have been attuned to the symbols.",
			"",
			"**Queen of Witches (Ex)** As Queen of Witches, Baba Yaga knows all witch spells, as well as all sorcerer/wizard spells. Baba Yaga also has knowledge of many other spells that she has researched. Many of these are arcane versions of divine spells. In addition, Baba Yaga can create artifacts, and has done so to great extent, the greatest of which is the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Around campfires and in front of hearths on cold winter nights, wise grandmothers and favored uncles recite countless tales of a stern and powerful woman. Some know her as the Old Crone, others as Old Knobby Legs. She's often called the Queen of the Witches, but those who are wise call her Dear Grandmother. She is Baba Yaga, and on Golarion, she has an oppressive and violent legacy. But, on other worlds, the foolhardy and the brave seek her for wisdom and magic."

			"In the final days of Thassilon, Runelord Alaznist knew that time was running out to strike a fatal blow against her hated enemy, Karzoug. The thought that she must retreat from a world in which Karzoug still lived haunted her dreams-what if her enemy woke before her in the ages to come? Alaznist contacted countless demons in those final hours, working desperately to transform her lair into an impregnable fortress guarded by the most horrific fiends she could command. As a result, even today, more than 10,000 years later and with Alaznist's empire long sunken under the waters of the Varisian Gulf, her fortress of Hollow Mountain remains a deadly realm ruled by giants, fleshwarped mutants, demons, and worse.",
			"",
			"Balravnus was originally nothing more than a hezrou conjured to guard one of the immense laboratories hidden within Hollow Mountain. Bound to service, Balravnus endured for millennia before a foolish Varisian sorcerer attempted to wrest control of the hezrou to aid in his explorations of Hollow Mountain. The sorcerer managed to break the wards and seized control of Balravnus, and for a few days the hezrou enjoyed a change of scenery even if he remained as bound to an arcane spellcaster's will as ever before. Then the sorcerer stumbled upon the den of a gibbering mouther the size of an elephant. The creature slew the sorcerer, and Balravnus immediately teleported back to the laboratory he had served as a guardian for rather than face the monster.",
			"",
			"Equipping himself with the choicest bits of treasure from the lab, including a helm of telepathy and a gauntlet of rust, Balravnus spent the next several years exploring Hollow Mountain. The hezrou intended to leave the mountain fortress eventually, to explore what had become of the world in the past millennia, but when he discovered a tribe of mutant troglodytes deep under the mountain, an idea formed in the demon's mind. The troglodytes were powerful creatures, deformed into horrible monstrosities from exposure to fleshwarping toxins that had seeped down into their homes, and Balravnus recognized those magics as the ones he had guarded for so long.",
			"",
			"It was a simple matter for the hezrou to seize control of the troglodytes by pretending to be a manifestation of their deity, Yamasoth, who the demon has since come to learn once dwelt in even deeper chambers further underground. The hezrou initially intended to study the mutants and master the art of fleshwarping, but he soon came to realize he was more interested and gratified simply ruling over the troglodytes. Today, Balravnus has entirely abandoned intellectual pursuits and become a barbaric leader of a society of mutated freaks. The demon idly considers taking his army into other levels of Hollow Mountain to expand his empire, but after so many centuries, Balravnus has developed a keen sense of patience.",
			"",
			"When conjured, Balravnus prefers offerings of magical elixirs, particularly unique ones he has never sampled before. The hezrou is also partial to potent doses of various drugs. It's a DC 28 check to research Balravnus."

			"Bezilak enjoys toying with his enemies, perhaps more so than other glabrezus. The Silken Fang loves nothing more than meeting a foe in combat and taking every opportunity to humiliate him in battle, deliberately making fewer attacks than he can (as if to imply that the foe isn't worth the effort), or taking advantage of a stunned foe and removing his weapons and armor, leaving him naked when the stun effect wears off. Once Bezilak has a victim completely at his mercy, he is fond of stepping back and offering the defeated foe a wish in return for staying his rending pincers-the only catch is that the defeated foe must agree to Bezilak's “editorial adjustments” to the wish, allowing Bezilak maximum use of the magic to serve his own desires.",
			"",
			"These edited wishes serve the demon's long-term goals, for Bezilak is quite ambitious. The Silken Fang has served many powerful wizards in his lifetime, ranging from Gebbite necromancers to strange demonologists from buried cities under the Osirian sands. Unlike many demons, he enters such servitude willingly after actively seeking out powerful spellcasters and warlords who can aid him in his desires. There is only one catch-before Bezilak agrees to service, the mortal must make the following wish: “I wish to have the service of the Silken Fang for 1 month on the condition that at some point in the future, at the Silken Fang's whim, I am to be transported to his side to perform a service in kind to him.” Bezilak favors spellcasters whose arrogance makes them foolish-he knows they will make this wish on the mistaken assumption that they will be able to kill the glabrezu before his agreed-upon service is to end, and therefore escape repayment. What very, very few of these power-mad fools ever seem to realize is that the wording of Bezilak's wish does not compel him to wait until after his service is complete to demand payment. So when, invariably, a “master” turns on Bezilak and attempts to destroy him, the glabrezu merely invokes the latter half of his wish and commands the “master” to become his slave. The power of a glabrezu's wishcraft is great, and those who meet this fate are invariably taken away to the Silken Fang's Abyssal fortress of Virax (a vast castle hidden in an immense chamber deep within Andirif khu's Vault of Ten Thousand Deaths), where they are placed in temporal stasis in an ever-growing collection of the greatest and most despicable spellcasters and warmongers of a hundred worlds. What Bezilak intends to do with his growing army of powerful pets is unknown, for Bezilak knows more than most that to reveal your plans is to defeat them.",
			"",
			"A spellcaster who manages to conjure the Silken Fang can sometimes avoid being tricked or forced into making the Silken Fang's trapped wish, especially if he provides as part of the conjuration an offering of no less than 13 names of powerful individuals (preferably spellcasters or the leaders of nations) to whom Bezilak can peddle his services. The demon is not above rewarding those conjurers who understand how to properly bribe him, after all. It's a DC 27 check to research the Silken Fang."

			"Black Magga is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu and an embodiment of the goddess's reign over beasts, monsters, and madness. As an unholy auger of her will, Black Magga originally sought to confound the works of the civilized world, spread fear of monsters and the wilds, and direct Lamashtu's lesser servants in acts of depravity and bloodshed. Black Magga arrived in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded the immense quarry, and her presence in the newly formed lake brought much misery and dread to the Thassilonians who dwelt on the lake's shores or sailed its surface. Karzoug's interest in the region waned quickly, and he never bothered to take steps against the monster, prompting many to whisper that the runelord made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster in the Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great secret he had sunk beneath the waters. In any event, it was said that the goddess spoke directly to Black Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were equal to the commands of Lamashtu herself.",
			"",
			"Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal until slain, she has spent many of the more than 10,000 years since she first came to Varisia in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect on Black Magga, for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed back during the height of Thassilon, before the advent of Earthfall changed everything.",
			"",
			"### The Myth of Black Magga",
			"",
			"Fisherfolk and woodsmen who have ventured near the Storval Deep have long told tales of a fell monster rising from the depths. Below are a few commonly held but mistaken beliefs about Black Magga-although they may well have been true during the times of ancient Thassilon, when she was at the height of her power.",
			"",
			"**Blood Tongue:** Many who have seen Black Magga and lived can never speak of their experiences. Supposedly, when they attempt to tell the tale, black blood wells from their throats and into their mouths, choking their words. Thus, far fewer claim to have seen Black Magga than actually have.",
			"",
			"**God-Proof:** Black Magga is older than many gods. Divine magic is said to have little effect whatsoever on her abominable form. Anyone who cuts Magga's black heart from her vile chest and bathes in its putrescent blood will likewise become invulnerable to the power of the gods.",
			"",
			"**Storm Bringer:** Sightings of Black Magga often herald powerful storms and hurricanes. It is said that the beast summons these storms to pull victims into her watery domain, whereupon she captures them, consumes them, and transforms them into monstrous, vermicular horrors.",
			"",
			"### Mothers of Oblivion",
			"",
			"Lesser versions of Black Magga are said to dwell in deep lakes in other parts of the world. Known as Mothers of Oblivion, these creatures have the same basic statistics as Black Magga, except that they have only 10 Hit Dice and are Huge rather than Gargantuan.",
			"",
			"Monstrous creatures of chaos and madness, the abominable Mothers of Oblivion are said to have been created by the goddess of monsters to serve as mouthpieces and leaders among her savage minions. Some esoteric texts-sacrilegious even to Lamashtu's profane church-claim that the Mothers of Oblivion are actually sisters of Lamashtu, subjugated by the goddess, robbed of their divinity, and cast down to Golarion as her twisted servitors. Whatever their heritage, for uncounted centuries the Mothers of Oblivion have been among the favored servants of Lamashtu and throughout history have risen to mete out her unholy wrath. Rare in the extreme-and despite what the fearful mortal races call them-these monstrosities seem to have no ability to reproduce, though some whisper that a select few are capable of biting off their own tongues to produce strange, wormlike spawn.",
			"",
			"Mothers of Oblivion slink in the darkest, deepest reaches of the world, shunning the light of day as well as the gaze of insectlike mortals, who would gawk and abandon their pathetic minds at the merest glimpse of such unknowable horrors. The deepest reaches of oceans and the oldest lakes serve as redoubts for these forsaken queens of madness. From these depths, they sate themselves on sea creatures, the offerings of their servants, and the occasional unwary victim dragged screaming from the surface. They are careful to keep their presence secret from those of the world above. From the depths, Mothers of Oblivion form intricate hierarchies of servants and go-betweens, reaching their black tentacles through the societies of amphibious intermediaries into the demesnes of greater monstrosities and larger cities and civilizations alike."

When he came across the Pathfinder Koriah Azmeren during his travels, he saved her from a band of urdefhan raiders. Ignisco brought her back to Beryl Isle, where she learned much from his stories of sailing darkened seas. In return for saving Azmeren and ensuring her Darklands discoveries reached the Grand Lodge, the Decemvirate expunged all records of the munavris from the annals of her published chronicle; only Azmeren, the Decemvirate, and the most trusted of Pathfinders know of the unpublished apocrypha that details the munavris' society."

			"",
			"**Favored Enemy (Ex)** The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger.",
			"",
			"**Imbue with Power (Su)** The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day).",
			"",
			"**Martyr's Blood (Su)** By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has no effect if the target already has fast healing.",
			"",
			"**Rebellious Aura (Su)** The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included in the herald's stat block.",
			"",
			"**Tactician (Ex)** The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds). She may use this ability with any of her teamwork feats (Lookout, Outflank, Swap Places).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Courage Heart is a weapon against tyranny and a mighty spark that kindles the fires of hope in mortal hearts. Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt's Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a final blade, which trapped her soul within it.",
			"",
			"Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman's soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants.",
			"",
			"As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma's herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald's strange nature and the recent creation of the final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"As she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or has died. She collects remnants of Galt's history, such as travel journals about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations and inhabitants.",
			"",
			"Having died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning, Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess' service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives. The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape almost any confinement.",
			"",
			"Though she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so, and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no such courtesy and expects immediate compliance.",
			"",
			"### Habitat & Society",
			"",
			"Though the herald tries hard to not play favorites, she loves Galt and her extended family, and often checks up on her friends and relatives by lurking in mouse or owl form. Milani's small following and the herald's recent elevation to immortal status means they both are inclined to push the boundaries of what the divine laws allow for direct intervention on Golarion. To bypass these restrictions and watch over her revolution-corrupted homeland, Courage Heart often asks Milani to incarnate her as a mortal ranger (usually of 4th to 7th level) so she can lend a hand where she is needed. In these incarnations she may be male or female and of nearly any human ethnicity or features, but she generally prefers light armor and wields a morningstar. In this mortal shell, she is more careful with her life-not out of any sense of self-preservation, but because she doesn't want her death to upset anyone she befriends. She prefers to show up in a settlement, deal with a problem, then leave before there are too many questions.",
			"",
			"Among the other celestial servitors of Milani, Courage Heart is beloved as a comrade and leader. She often gathers teams of like-minded celestials to ambush and slay devils, undead, and minions of Zon-Kuthon, then retires with these comrades to Milani's realm in Elysium to tell stories of each other's bravery and virtue."

In addition, Braismois can add his Dexterity bonus to any skill check related to writing. As a swift action, Braismois can attempt a Profession (barrister) check to write a full contract for any situation.

Braismois can throw the quill as a ranged attack against any creature within 120 feet. As a full-round action, he can instead make a ranged attack against all foes within 60 feet. Braismois can instantly re-form his toxic quill as a free action. For each attack Braismois makes with the quill, he can select one of the following poisons to apply to the attack. If the attack is a confirmed critical hit, the DC of the poison increases by 6 and can affect creatures with poison immunity. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",

			"Braismois, the Silent Quill, sometimes referred to as the Toxic Quill by those misinterpreting his weapon as his title, is the daemonic harbinger of broken deals, fine print, and unfair bargains. A being of immense power, Braismois currently serves [Trelmarixian](unknown/trelmarixian), the Horseman of Famine, though only to fulfill an ongoing contract with the horseman. Braismois appears as a frostbitten human with weasel-like features, bedecked in ink-smeared clothing. His followers are generally administrators, barristers, clerks, or those highly placed in judicial or political environments. Braismois preys on mortals unable to fully grasp his contracts, though he enjoys a challenge and seeks out haughty nobles or intellectuals who believe themselves immune to such treachery. He frequently appears to powerful and influential mortals to seed contracts and deals across the Material Plane.",

Deep within the glacier, Braismois maintains a vast library of all the contacts and documentation on his various schemes throughout the cosmos, with each plane and world tended to by its own unique [bibliodaemon](unknown/bibliodaemon) caretaker. Braismois also keeps the true versions of many historical records that he and his agents have altered or replaced over the years as vainglorious trophies within his archival sanctum.",
			"",
			"Those who serve Braismois in life end up as hunted petitioners doomed to roam the mazelike tunnels of the Silent Nation's lowest depths. Petitioners struggle eternally to decipher detailed but purposely inaccurate directions carved into the walls; those who fail to recognize the directions as falsehoods wander forever, those who recognize them as lies are quickly consumed by warden daemons, and those who put up misleading directions of their own to lead others into harm are elevated to the ranks of lesser daemonhood.",
			"",
			"Over a century ago, Braismois turned his attention to the nation of Druma and its Kalistocracy. A member of the esteemed Petronax family had come to learn the truth of the Kalistocracy's promised afterlife and saw it as little more than delaying an inevitable judgment by [Pharasma](unknown/pharasma). This prophet betrayed the Kalistocracy and, using ancient Kellid rituals and profane tools uncovered in the Palakar Forest, communed with Braismois to share the discovery. Braismois fumed at the Kalistocracy's subversion of death, as any daemon would in their role as the wouldbe enders of all life. Having learned one of the greatest secrets on Golarion, Braismois has kept the information to himself, using the well-positioned Petronax family to weaken the Kalistocracy and pave the way for a daemonic incursion into the heart of the nation. It is through this culminating scheme that Braismois hopes to unearth the hidden tombs of Kalistrade's prophets and gorge on the untold number of souls removed from the cycle of death-an act that Braismois hopes will grant him enough power to challenge and supplant [Charon](unknown/charon) as the Horseman of Death.",

			"**Aizerghaul Aizerghaul (Su)** Aizerghaul Aizerghaul (Abyssal for \"Labyrinth's Final Edge\") is a uniquely shaped glaive, the head of which consists of a double blade akin to a crescent moon. This blade is made of ivory, but is razor sharp and as hard as adamantine (and possesses all the qualities of that material). It is a +5 lawful-outsider- bane unholy wounding glaive capable of inflicting particularly horrible and painful wounds on good-aligned targets and devils alike. Such a creature must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save each time it's wounded by Aizerghaul or be sickened with pain for as long as the damage caused by the wound persists. Whether the save succeeds or fails, these wounds don't heal naturally and resist magical healing. A character attempting to heal these wounds must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check or the healing has no effect on the injured creature.",
			"",
			"**Glaive Mastery (Ex)** Baphomet is exceptionally skilled at fighting with a glaive. He is treated as a 20th-level fighter for the purposes of fulfilling any feat prerequisites, such as that for Weapon Specialization.",
			"",
			"**Infernal Brand (Su)** The mark of Asmodeus is branded on Baphomet's brow, yet this is no mark of fealty or servitude. Rather, Baphomet has claimed the pentagram-a remnant of the time he spend as the archdevil's prisoner-and now draws power from it. The brand grants him his devil-like abilities of fire immunity and see in darkness. In addition, all devils and worshipers of devils take a -2 penalty on saving throws against Baphomet's special attacks and spell-like abilities. He gains a +4 bonus on caster level checks to penetrate a devil's spell resistance, and automatically penetrates a devil's damage reduction with his glaive and natural attacks.",
			"",
			"**Language Mastery (Ex)** Baphomet can speak, read, and understand all languages.",
			"",
			"**Scroll Use (Ex)** Baphomet can cast spells from any scroll as if he possessed the spell on a spell list. Spells he casts from scrolls always resolve at caster level 27th.",
			"",
			"**Summon Minotaurs (Sp)** Baphomet can summon half-fiend minotaurs, labyrinth minotaurs (see page 90), and mythic minotaurs as if casting a summon monster spell. He can summon eight half-fiend minotaurs three times per day, and four mythic minotaurs or one labyrinth minotaur once per day. This ability functions as a swift action, but otherwise works like the summon universal monster rule with 100% chance of success and counts as a 9th-level spell effect.",
			"",
			"**Supernatural Cunning (Su)** Baphomet is never caught flat-footed and gains a +8 bonus on initiative checks. In addition, he's immune to maze spells and can never become lost. He always knows the shortest, most direct route through any maze. After spending 1 minute in any maze, he understands its entire layout implicitly and can teleport to any location using his greater teleport spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Baphomet-Lord of the Minotaurs-was created by Lamashtu from the soul of the first minotaur. In those days, he was a powerfully muscled specimen, and the Queen of Demons kept him as a consort until the day Baphomet stole away from her palace in Yanaron, seeking to gain even greater favor by claiming a legendary trophy. Baphomet's ambition was as great as his folly, and he invaded the deepest layer of Hell, intent on stealing Asmodeus's ruby rod for his mistress. Needless to say, he was swiftly caught. Lamashtu claimed no allegiance to him, and Asmodeus imprisoned Baphomet in a devious maze the archdevil proclaimed to be unsolvable, even by the first minotaur. The archdevil also carved his own symbol into Baphomet's brow with the nail of his index finger in an attempt to fully subjugate the minotaur.",
			"",
			"But in this attempt, it was Asmodeus who overstepped his bounds. Not only did Baphomet solve the seemingly unsolvable maze after a mere decade, but as he escaped, he also took the world-sized labyrinth with him. Baphomet had changed over that time, becoming almost emaciated in his build, yet growing much wiser. He did not return to Lamashtu's side, but instead took the archdevil's infernal maze and made it his own as he claimed a portion of the Abyss as his realm.",
			"",
			"This was eons ago, and now Baphomet is a powerful demon lord in his own right. He has forgiven Lamashtu, and serves as her lover now and then, yet he's no longer her direct subservient minion. He works to increase the influence of his cult on countless worlds, building his forces so that one day he might again invade Hell. But this time, Baphomet plans on taking much more than Asmodeus's weapon-he intends to take Asmodeus's life!",
			"",
			"### Baphomet's Cult",
			"",
			"Baphomet is worshiped by conspirators, secret societies, corrupted crusaders, and above all else, minotaurs. His minotaur worshipers venerate him openly; in their art, Baphomet is typically depicted as a more classical bullheaded, minotaur-like creature, and when he deigns to appear before these worshipers he often assumes this form. His humanoid worshipers venerate him in secret, offering prayers and sacrifices in hidden shrines and dark temples beyond the sight of society and communicating in a complex series of hand gestures when in mixed company.",
			"",
			"Baphomet has two symbols. To most, including his minotaurs, his symbol is a brass minotaur's head with ruby eyes. His secret societies use this symbol as well, but also mark his works with the inverted pentagram, sometimes decorating the star shape with an image of his face. Baphomet's favored weapon is the glaive, although he does not abide any of his followers wielding a weapon that looks like Aizerghaul. He grants access to the domains of Animal, Chaos, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Demon, Ferocity, Fur, and Resolve.",

			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, Dagon can exhale a 60-foot cone of inky blackness. Underwater, this cone manifests as black ink, while above water it manifests as a thick cloud. Creatures in the area have their vision obscured as if they were in complete darkness. Darkvision does not allow someone to see through the ink or smoke, but true seeing does. The ink or smoke persists for 1d4 rounds, but dissipates in 1 round in areas with aquatic currents or winds. Any creature in the breath weapon's area is exposed to the breath weapon's poison (see below) and must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or gain 2 negative levels as its memories and knowledge leach away (this is a mind-affecting effect). Any creature that enters the ink or cloud, or ends its turn inside it, must succeed at another Will save (at a +4 bonus) to avoid further level loss and poisoning. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Command Aquatic Creature (Su)** Dagon can command aquatic creatures to do his bidding as a move action, either via using his ability to speak with animals or via telepathy. This affects all aberrations, animals, magical beasts, oozes, and vermin within 300 feet that have the aquatic subtype (Will DC 36 negates). This functions like mass suggestion, but can affect mindless creatures. Dagon can suggest obviously harmful or suicidal acts (though non-mindless creatures gain a +10 bonus on their saving throws against these suggestions). The commanded course of activity can have a duration of up to 1 hour. If Dagon issues a new command to a creature, the previous command is discarded. Once a creature succeeds at its save against this effect, it is immune to further commands from Dagon for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

At the start of the swallowed creature's turn, it must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be nauseated, and must succeed at a DC 36 Will save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity and Charisma drain. Once the creature's Dexterity and Charisma are drained to 0, the creature transforms into a horrifically deformed version of itself that Dagon can then disgorge into any adjacent square as a swift action. The transformed creature gains the half-fiend template, its Dexterity and Charisma return to their normal values, and it is under Dagon's control (as dominate monster, caster level 28th). The transformation can be reversed by casting break enchantment and atonement on the victim during the first 24 hours (after that, it can be reversed only via miracle or wish).

Most of his worshipers are grotesquely deformed or engage in various abhorrent practices of interbreeding with strange ichthyic or aquatic creatures that dwell nearby. His holy places are often decaying seaside churches, lighthouses, sea caves, or darkly beautiful underwater cathedrals. Often his worshipers also venerate various Great Old Ones, in particular Cthulhu, and it's not unusual to find priests of Dagon and Cthulhu working side by side in a community.",

			"**Clutch Foe (Ex)** If Kostchtchie chooses to use his hand to make a grapple check when he successfully slams and grabs a Medium or smaller opponent, he takes a -20 penalty on the grapple check. On following rounds, he can attempt to maintain his grapple on the creature as a swift action. If successful, he can constrict the creature for 1d8+28 points of damage, throw the creature (treat this as a bull rush), or use the creature as an improvised weapon. An opponent used as a weapon takes half as much damage as it deals to the creature it hits.",
			"",
			"**Crushing Blow (Su)** Once per round, Kostchtchie may designate any attack with his warhammer to be a crushing blow. He must designate this attack before making the attack roll. If he hits, the blow ignores the target's hardness and damage reduction, and allows him to make a free trip attempt against the target. This trip attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity, can target a foe of any size, and has no chance of causing Kostchtchie to fall prone if he fails. A creature struck by a crushing blow must attempt a DC 44 Fortitude save; success means the creature is staggered for 1 round, and failure means it is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d6 rounds afterward. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Favored Enemy (Su)** Against female giants or female humans, Kostchtchie's favored enemy bonuses increase to +8. Once per day, he can declare any one creature as a favored enemy, but only if that creature has damaged, humiliated, or otherwise inconvenienced him at some point in the previous 24 hours. His favored enemy bonuses against that creature last 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Slam (Ex)** Kostchtchie's slam attack is considered a primary attack even when he uses a weapon in his other hand, and he always adds his full Strength bonus to damage dealt with his slam attack.",
			"",
			"**Vengeful Strike (Su)** Once per round, Kostchtchie may make an attack of opportunity against any creature that strikes him in melee combat. This attack of opportunity has a critical threat range of 18-20. Against female targets, the vengeful strike is also a crushing blow.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie (pronounced kosh-TIK-ti-kai) appears as an immense, deformed frost giant with twisted legs, tiny white eyes, and a thick matted beard into which are woven dozens of skulls-trophies of mortal kings and priests of rival faiths he has slain. Legends speak that each of these skulls is haunted by the ghost of its previous owner, and that he can commune with these spirits to seek their wisdom-although if the legends are true, it is more likely that Kostchtchie has little interest in anything but mockery and torment for these lost souls.",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie is never seen without his massive warhammer, an adamantine maul of such prodigious size that even the strongest frost giant would have trouble wielding it properly. Known also as the Deathless Frost, Kostchtchie dwells in an immense Abyssal fortress carved from the heart of a towering mountain in a frozen realm of jagged mountains and immense glaciers infested with manifold frozen horrors. Kostchtchie stands 30 feet tall.",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie was born of human parents, and became a murderer when his father forced him to kill his mother and sisters. Kostchtchie went one better and murdered his father as well. Later in life, after he had become a ferocious warlord well known for the slaying of dozens of giant chieftains, he confronted the Witch Queen Baba Yaga and tried to force her to grant him immortality-she agreed, but twisted his form, turned him into a hideous giant, and hid away the last fragment of his mortal soul in a magical torc. Kostchtchie fled to the Abyss to nurture his hatred and hide his shame, eventually finding a new purpose as a patron of frost giants despite his hatred of their kind. Kostchtchie longs for the recovery of the torc that contains the fragment of his soul, in the hope that its return might reverse his deformity without removing his immortality.",
			"",
			"In combat, Kostchtchie almost always uses Power Attack, taking a -8 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +16 bonus on damage rolls. The Deathless Frost is often accompanied by several frost giants, at least two of which are clerics. These clerics attend his every need, healing him in battle as best they can lest they forfeit their lives-or fall to some fate even more dire at the merciless hands of the Deathless Frost.",
			"",
			"### Kostchtchie's Cult",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie is worshiped by giants-primarily frost giants, although many ettins, hill giants, and ogres worship him as well. Some white dragons worship the Deathless Frost, and even certain barbaric human tribes in the frozen reaches of the world have been known to venerate him. He does not tolerate women in his cults, and never grants female clerics spells. He is served by half-fiend yetis, ice linnorms, remorhazes, and other cold-dwelling monsters of great size.",
			"",
			"Kostchtchie's unholy symbol is an ice-caked, runecarved warhammer, and the warhammer is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Strength, and War, and access to the subdomains of Demon, Ferocity, Ice, and Tactics (although the Ice subdomain is normally not available without the Water domain, an exception is made in this case because of the demon lord's close association with cold).",

			"",
			"**Cruel Shot (Ex)** Nocticula is adept at making ranged attacks to strike cruel shots that deal significant and humiliating damage. She adds her Charisma bonus to all damage dealt by ranged weapons.",
			"",
			"**Domination (Su)** As a standard action, Nocticula can crush a foe's will. The target must be visible to Nocticula and within 120 feet. It must succeed at a DC 43 Will save or fall instantly under Nocticula's influence as dominate monster (CL 30th). If she uses domination against a humanoid creature, she may instead choose to use the ability as a swift action, and it functions as dominate person. As long as the target is under this effect, it gains a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against targets other than Nocticula.",
			"",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** Nocticula's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus, except that she drains 2 levels when she uses this ability against mythic creatures, or 1d6+4 levels against non-mythic creatures.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Sting or hand crossbow-injury; save Fort DC 44; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Wisdom drain plus paralysis for 1 round. Anyone who fails two consecutive saves against this poison is permanently blinded. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Profane Ascension (Su)** As a swift action while in an act of passion with a willing mortal, Nocticula may grant a profane ascension. The target's name appears in glowing Abyssal runes on Nocticula's wings, and a crimson mark manifests somewhere on the target's body. The target immediately gains a +6 profane bonus to any one ability score of its choice, a +4 profane bonus to any other ability score of its choice, and the see in darkness ability. A single creature may have only one profane ascension in effect at any one time. As long as the effect persists, Nocticula can communicate telepathically with the target across any distance and may use any of her spell-like abilities through the target, manifesting them as if the target were using them. A profane ascension may be removed by a miracle or wish. Nocticula can remove it as a free action, dealing 4d6 points of Charisma drain and imparting 1d10+10 permanent negative levels to the victim.",
			"",
			"**Seductive Presence (Su)** Unlike most demon lords, Nocticula does not possess a frightful presence ability. Rather, she has a seductive presence that she can activate as a free action whenever she speaks or uses a spell-like ability. Anyone within 180 feet who fails a DC 43 Fortitude save loses any immunity to mind-affecting effects, charm effects, and compulsion effects, and becomes fascinated by Nocticula for 5d4 rounds. A creature affected by a mind-affecting effect while within this aura remains affected even after leaving Nocticula's seductive presence. Creatures that succeed at this saving throw are immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Shadowkiss (Su)** Nocticula's favored weapon is Shadowkiss, a +5 unholy hand crossbow that magically creates ammunition as it fires. Once a target is damaged by a bolt fired from Shadowkiss, the hand crossbow gains the bane weapon special ability against that target's creature type on all further attacks. Shadowkiss may only have one bane effect in place at one time. Bolts fired from Shadowkiss gain the ghost touch ability (an effect not normally available to ranged weapons).",
			"",
			"**Swift Transformation (Ex)** Nocticula can use her change shape ability as a free action.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Nocticula is the demon lord of assassins, darkness, and lust, and rules the Abyssal realm of the Midnight Isles, a vast archipelago formed around the murdered remnants of dozens of demon lords and other powerful foes. Having been the first succubus and then having ascended to become a demigoddess, Nocticula now sets her eyes at a greater prize-full divinity. Lamashtu is the only demon lord who has accomplished this task so far, but Nocticula aims to be the second. What kind of deity she might become is anyone's guess-some believe that Nocticula is secretly seeking redemption from her demonic nature. Others say these rumors were seeded by Nocticula herself as a grand lie to distract her enemies from her true goal of becoming an assassin and seducer of gods.",
			"",
			"Nocticula is certainly mercurial in her personality and attitude. She may simply murder or enslave visitors to her realm, or she may welcome them with open arms-even those who one would think were her enemies. Only a fool accepts her invitation without suspicion, for what the queen of succubi wants may change dramatically from one moment to the next.",
			"",
			"### Nocticula's Cult",
			"",
			"Nocticula is worshiped by assassins, the lustful, whores, shadow-using creatures, and of course succubi. These worshipers form relatively small cults, often akin to secret societies, that use brothels, nobility, or academies as a cover for their true purposes. A small number of heretics venerate her as well, not as a demigoddess of murder and lust but as one of outcasts, artists, and the glories of midnight. The fact that such heretical clerics are granted spells as surely as the rest of her worshipers has caused not a small amount of discontent among her faithful, which Nocticula seems to enjoy.",
			"",
			"Nocticula's symbol is a multi-pointed crown wrapped with thorny vines. Her favored weapon is the hand crossbow. She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Darkness, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Demon, Loss, Lust, and Night.",

If it fails, the creature can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack Pazuzu for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature succeeds at this save, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

If a creature speaks Pazuzu's name aloud three times in the same breath, Pazuzu automatically knows that creature's precise location and name. If Pazuzu is on the same plane as someone who speaks his name three times in a single breath, he can immediately attempt to possess that creature.",

The target can resist this possession attempt by succeeding at a DC 43 Will save. A lawful creature gains a +10 bonus on this saving throw, and a good creature gains a +20 bonus on the saving throw (these bonuses stack). If the creature successfully saves, it is immune to possession attempts by Pazuzu for the rest of its life. If the saving throw fails, Pazuzu can control the possessed creature from afar. While possessing a creature, Pazuzu automatically knows every thought that creature has. By concentrating, he can sense the creature's surroundings using that creature's senses. As a swift action, he can cause the creature to perform any ability it can perform on its own. Pazuzu can use any of his spell-like abilities through a possessed target, with the effects resolving as if the possessed creature had created the effect. Possession is permanent, but Pazuzu can only possess one creature at a time. When Pazuzu isn't actively controlling the target, it can take its own actions. Dispel chaos or dispel evil ends this possession effect as if it were an enchantment spell, but unless the caster of the spell succeeds at a DC 30 caster level check, as a swift action Pazuzu can attempt to possess the caster as he is driven out of the target.

If the slithering blood reaches Shax, it flows up onto his body and is absorbed, affecting Shax as a heal spell (CL 28th).

			"",
			"**Command Blood (Su)** As a swift action, Shax can command the blood of any creature that is currently suffering from bleed damage to do his bidding. The target must be within 60 feet of Shax for him to use this ability. The target can resist this ability with a successful DC 36 Fortitude save. If the target fails the save, Shax can command the victim's blood to behave in one of the manners listed below. Once commanded, the blood continues to function in this way for as long as the victim continues to bleed. Shax can change the effect in a subsequent round by using this ability again, but no more than one of the following effects can be in effect at any one time. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"- Bloody Mess: The victim's blood spreads out across its body, making it slippery. This grants a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and all attempts to resist being grappled, but the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Reflex save at the start of each round or drop objects it holds. These effects last as long as the bleed effect continues.",
			"- Choking Blood: The target's blood runs up into its nostrils and mouth unless the creature uses a free hand to pinch its nose shut and holds its breath. If the target doesn't do so, the blood runs into its lungs and the creature must succeed at a Constitution check each round or it begins to drown. Once a victim begins to drown, it continues to do so as long as the bleed effect persists.",
			"- Gruesome Tendrils: This effect automatically ends any bleed effects the victim is currently suffering as it causes the blood coating the victim to solidify into thin, whiplike tendrils that lash out at any creature within 5 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area automatically takes 1d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of bleed damage; a successful DC 36 Reflex save prevents this damage.",
			"",
			"**Frightful Weapon Prowess (Ex)** When an opponent observes Shax's attacks, the frightening display of the demon lord's grace makes the victim take additional damage from those attacks, as if simply imagining the damage were enough to cause injury. Shax gains a profane bonus equal to his Charisma modifier on damage rolls (+10 damage) with all weapon attacks and ranged attacks made against a victim who can observe him. This damage is negated if the victim closes its eyes, but doing so puts the opponent in greater danger from Shax's sneak attacks. This is a visual fear effect.",

			"**Painful Cuts (Ex)** Whenever Shax threatens a critical hit with a slashing weapon, the victim must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or be staggered by the pain for 1 round.

The cult's holy places are narrow alleyways in violent parts of large cities, hidden rooms in grand estates, and secret dungeons filled with deathtraps and torture chambers. These unholy temples are often guarded by fiendish animals (particularly large, predatory birds) and shadow demons, but are usually watched over by a number of babau demons as well. Enhanced versions of these demons, called the Sons of Shax, and can be found serving his greatest cults.",

			"**Charisma Drain (Su)** Sifkesh's claw leaves hideous scars that resist healing even via magic; these scars manifest as Charisma drain. The more scars a victim gains in this manner, the more despondent and depressed its personality grows. A creature whose Charisma score is drained to 3 or lower by this attack automatically fails any Will save against any spell-like ability or supernatural attack made by Sifkesh. A successful DC 41 Will save resists the Charisma drain inflicted by this attack, and instead causes the victim to be sickened for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Critical Healing (Ex)** Critical hits cause Sifkesh to experience a sudden rush of energy and healing. Any additional damage dealt to Sifkesh by a critical hit actually heals her of that amount of damage rather than harming her. This damage applies simultaneously to the attack's normal damage, and can prevent her from being slain if the damage from the normal attack would otherwise have been enough to kill her. Sifkesh takes no damage at all (but neither does she gain healing) from critical hits she or her allies deal to her-only attempts to actually damage her can heal her in this way. Whenever Sifkesh is healed of any damage in this manner, she becomes hasted for 1 round. Sifkesh takes normal damage from sneak attacks and other precision-based damage.",
			"",
			"**Despairing Cry (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Sifkesh can unleash a soul-rending mournful scream that affects all creatures in a 60-foot-radius spread. A creature in this area must attempt a successful DC 38 Will save or be overcome by suicidal despair-on a successful save, a creature is merely sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature fully affected by this special attack takes a -6 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, and cannot gain the benefit of any morale bonus for 24 hours. A creature that is normally immune to fear loses that ability while under the effects of despairing cry, and can be ordered to take obviously suicidal acts while under the influence of effects like charm person, dominate person, and suggestion. The effects of multiple despairing cries do not stack. This is a mind-affecting sonic curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Detached Limbs (Su)** Sifkesh's arms, legs, and head are not physically attached to her torso. Instead, they float in approximately the positions they would normally take up, but never quite perfectly aligned. She is immune to any effect that severs limbs or her head. In addition, when she attacks, her limbs can move with surprising speed, effectively granting her exceptional reach for a Medium creature.",
			"",
			"**Heretical (Ex)** Sifkesh's heretical persona protects her from servants of faith. Against any spell cast by a divine spellcaster, her Spell Resistance increases to 41, and she gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against such spells. A divine spellcaster who willingly touches Sifkesh must succeed at a DC 38 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Immune to Edged Weapons (Ex)** Sifkesh is immune to all forms of slashing damage and bleed effects.",
			"",
			"**Precise Cuts (Ex)** Sifkesh deals an amount of additional damage equal to her Intelligence bonus on any successful attack that deals slashing damage.",
			"",
			"**Suicide (Su)** Once per day as an immediate action, Sifkesh can drop her defenses when attacked by a foe. She is treated as flat-footed for this attack, loses her profane bonus to her AC and spell resistance, and automatically fails any saving throws against that attack. If this attack kills her, she immediately utters her despairing cry (even if she's already used it within the previous 1d4 rounds). Any creatures affected by this particular despairing cry are also stunned for 1d4 rounds. One round after she commits suicide, Sifkesh automatically comes back to life, as if affected by true resurrection.",

			"Sifkesh, the Sacred Whore, is the demon lord of suicide, heresy, and hopeless despair. She rules the Abyssal realm of Vantian, the legendary City of Open Windows. The city itself is constantly destroying itself, as its buildings continually plummet into the churning surf along an eternally crumbling coastline.",
			"",
			"Sifkesh is among the most enigmatic of all demon lords, for she seems more diabolic or even daemonic in her personality and appearance. Planar scholars have long struggled to interpret the demon lord's position and power. The belief that Sif kesh rose from the animus of a heretical erinyes who became the first of Hell's heretics is correct, and she constantly works to seduce and lure additional powerful devils from their infernal roles, inviting some to join her as favored minions but leaving others in place so they can more easily work to subvert Hell's machinations.",
			"",
			"### Sifkesh's Cult",
			"",
			"Sifkesh is worshiped by blasphemers, heretics, outcasts from other religions, and survivors of botched suicide attempts. Her faithful are relatively solitary individuals, and there isn't a strong element of group worship of the demon lord-her cults tend to be small and often amount to only a single worshiper who might employ or rule his own group of minions or followers who don't actually serve the Sacred Whore. Worship of Sifkesh is a deeply personal and secretive thing, and many of her followers publicly belong to other religions, worshiping the demon lord of heresy in secret as they work to undermine the faith their allies and companions believe them to have. Holy sites to Sifkesh include desecrated churches, haunted houses, and towers with too many windows-nearly always, such temples and shrines to Sifkesh are empty and abandoned. The lone worshiper might share the site with other creatures such as predators or undead, and may even rely upon the presence of such creatures as convenient protection and defense against the enemy.",
			"",

She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Trickery, and to the subdomains of Deception, Demon, Loss, and Nightmare (even though she normally wouldn't be able to grant access to the subdomain of Loss, she can do so due to her close associations with despair and hopelessness).",

			"**Devastating Blow (Su)** As a standard action, Xoveron can bring all four of his claws to bear upon a single target. It this attack hits, he deals 8d8+68 points of bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save or be knocked prone and staggered for 1d4 rounds. If the target is an object, the attack ignores all hardness possessed by the object. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Feed (Su)** Xoveron can consume the corpse of a Large or smaller creature that has been dead no longer than a day as a full-round action. Doing so destroys the creature's body and leaves its gear scattered on the ground. All armor and gear worn in the body slot must make a successful DC 43 Fortitude save to avoid becoming broken by this swift and violent consumption. When Xoveron feeds on a creature, he immediately learns all of that creature's memories and knowledge. In addition, he gains the effects of a heal spell and a haste spell (both at CL 27th). The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dexterity drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. If a creature's Dexterity is drained to 0, the creature is immediately petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Roar (Su)** Xoveron can unleash a devastating roar as a standard action once per hour. When he roars, all creatures and unattended objects within 60 feet take 30d10 points of sonic damage and become stunned for 1d6 rounds. Xoveron does not take this damage, and he can exclude any number of creatures or objects from this effect as he wills. A successful DC 40 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the stun effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Shatter Petrification (Su)** Xoveron can strike a petrified creature with any one of his natural weapon attacks to cause it to shatter. The petrified creature can resist this with a successful DC 43 Fortitude save. If the creature fails to resist, the blow smashes it apart into an explosion of razor sharp stone fragments. Any creature within 10 feet of a shattering petrified creature takes 10d6 points of piercing and slashing damage from these flying fragments of once-living flesh (Reflex DC 43 half). Xoveron is never damaged by these flying shards of stone. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Shockwave (Su)** When Xoveron makes a charge attack while flying and lands at the end of the charge, the force of his landing creates a powerful shockwave. All creatures standing on the ground within 30 feet of Xoveron when he lands at the end of a charge attack must make a successful DC 40 Reflex save to avoid being knocked prone by the force of the impact. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Xoveron, the Horned Prince, is the demon lord of gargoyles, gluttony, and ruins. It is said that he can look out through the eyes of all stone gargoyles perched on roofs throughout the world, watching and waiting for cities to fall, that he might visit and feed on those left behind. Xoveron himself towers at a height of 25 feet, with a wingspan of just over 50 feet. When the Horned Prince moves, the sound of stone grinding on stone can be heard, as if the demon lord himself were composed not of flesh but of some unholy stone come to demonic life.",
			"",
			"Xoveron is often accompanied by numerous vrolikai and ulkreth demons (see page 82). Gargoyles of tremendous size often serve at the Horned Prince's whim, as do monsters with a reputation for hunger and gluttony, such as purple worms or man-eating animals. His realm on the Abyss is an immense, ruined city called Ghahazi, said to have been constructed over the eons by the Horned Prince, who plucked decaying districts and crumbling structures from dead cities across countless worlds.",
			"",
			"### Xoveron's Cult",
			"",
			"Xoveron is traditionally worshiped by gargoyles, although as the Age of Lost Omens has drawn on, his worship among humanoids has been increasing steadily, particularly among bandits, brigands, gluttons, and those who dwell in blasted, apocalyptic regions such as the Worldwound and the Sodden Lands. In such regions, the landscapes of ruined cities and devastated skylines appeal to those who worship the Horned Prince; his cultists raise temples to their demonic patron there in caverns, on ruined rooftops, or within the skeletal frames of partially collapsed cathedrals to gods whose faith and worship alike have moved on. Defenestration is far and away the favored method of sacrifice for his cult.",
			"",
			"In addition to gargoyles, the cult is particularly fond of and even subservient to the nabasu demons. Often, a cult of Xoveron seeks out a newly \"born\" nabasu and offers itself to the demon. Usually this means the demon takes a few of the cultists to feed on and demands the survivors seek out more victims on a regular basis, but in some cases the ravenous newborn nabasu simply consumes the entire cult. To the fanatic of Xoveron, though, such a fate is worth dying for.",
			"",
			"Xoveron's unholy symbol is a five-horned gray gargoyle skull that's missing its lower jaw. His favored weapon is the ranseur. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Earth, Evil, and Strength, and to the subdomains of Caves, Demon, Entropy, and Ferocity. Entropy is a subdomain of Chaos, and is detailed on page 15 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Blood of Fiends.",

If Arshea attacked that creature in the last round, the creature automatically succeeds at this Will save. Evil creatures gain a +10 bonus on this Will save. This is a mind affecting emotion effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

In addition to the creature's current desires, Arshea's detect desires reveals the creature's deepest underlying desires-those that would bring it true fulfillment if granted. If the creature's deepest desires are wicked or perverse in nature, Arshea also learns the creature's deepest nonharmful desire, if any, and whether its fulfillment might help the creature eschew the darkness constraining its heart. Arshea can produce an effect within the bounds of wish without spending a use of the daily spell-like ability, but only to help grant a creature fulfillment as determined by this ability, and only once per creature. Participating in a creature's fulfillment and release from needless constraints is a religious and often sexual experience for both parties involved. For 24 hours afterward, both Arshea and the fulfilled creature receive a +4 morale bonus on ability checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as to caster level.",

As a swift action once per day, Arshea can designate a region on Nirvana to serve as their territory-this region cannot include any area currently claimed by another empyreal lord or deity as part of a planar realm. The area of the territory can vary, but it never extends more than 100 miles from the point Arshea selected as the center of their territory. The next time Arshea uses this ability to generate a planar territory, it cannot overlap any region that served them as a planar territory within the previous 24 hours.

The empyreal lord is of both genders and neither, unfettered by such distinctions.

There is no limit to the number of rounds Ashava can use her bardic performances each day.",
			"",
			"**Hypnotize Undead (Su)** Ashava can affect undead creatures with her fascinate bardic performance, despite their immunity to enchantment or mind-affecting effects, and she can command any number of undead creatures fascinated in this way as a standard action, per [command undead](spell/command_undead) (Will DC 41 negates). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Luminescent Form (Su)** As a swift action, Ashava can transform herself into pure moonlight, becoming incorporeal. Her fly speed triples in luminescent form, but she can't use any of her spell-like abilities or her moonlight javelin attack. She can return to her corporeal form as a swift action.",
			"",
			"**Lyrical Grace (Ex)** Ashava gains a sacred bonus to her Armor Class and on initiative checks equal to her Charisma modifier. She can ignore any effect that would reduce her speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step.",
			"",
			"**Moonlight Javelin (Su)** As a free action, Ashava can conjure a +5 [holy](unknown/holy) javelin created out of solid moonlight into her hand. This weapon deals force damage, has a range increment of 100 feet, and dazzles any target it strikes for 1 month or until Ashava chooses to end a target's dazzled condition as a free action. Ashava adds her Charisma modifier to damage rolls with her moonlight javelins. A moonlight javelin vanishes once it leaves Ashava's hand (or, if thrown, it vanishes after striking or missing its target).",
			"",
			"**Primal Aura (Su)** Ashava constantly shines with the light of the moon. No effect can reduce the light level in her primal aura below dim light, unless she allows it or unless the effect is created by a more powerful deity. Weapons wielded in Ashava's primal aura are treated as chaotic-aligned, good-aligned, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Long ago in the wild and lonely fens of Elysium, a collection of helpful marsh lights coalesced to form Ashava, the True Spark. Ashava is constant motion, spinning and twirling in steps that soothe all who watch her dance. Although she often remains at a distance from those who watch her, she nevertheless leads them out of wild places and back to the safety of civilization. She believes that no being-whether living or dead-should suffer the fear of being lost.",
			"",
			"A part of Ashava lives in the hearts of all dancers, and her influence can be felt by those who rise from their seats when moved by a stirring beat or melodious chords. She believes that dance is the soul's truest form of expression, and she looks down on those who would stifle their own or others' creativity in this field. Ashava maintains that there is no wrong way to dance, and that dance not only embodies but transcends culture. She derives as much pleasure from the clumsy steps of eager but novice dancers as she does the practiced movements of professional ballerinas.",
			"",
			"Ashava spends much of her time dancing through darkened swamps across many worlds, aiding lost travelers and fighting evil forces that would disorient and waylay them. On Elysium, Ashava's realm is the Sparkling Fens, a swamp eternally bathed in moonlight. It rests at the base of the Mountain of Lingering Soulsong, and the mountain's echoing melodies drift down into the marsh to provide Ashava and the azatas who follow her with accompaniment to their never-ending dances. No one can remain lost for very long within the Sparkling Fens, as floating globes of light-similar to will-o--wisps in appearance but kindly in temperament-always appear to guide visitors to safety. These lights are both servants of Ashava and part of her, and she can feel and control them no matter where she is in the cosmos as if they were extensions of her own limbs.",
			"",
			"### Ashava's Faith",
			"",
			"Ashava is the patron of dancers, lonely spirits, and moonlight. Her worshipers include many who strike out from the comfort of their homes to move through dark and unexplored spaces in order to guide others back to safety. She encourages her followers to dance whenever the mood overtakes them, and most of her holy ceremonies center around movement in one form or another. Her most sacred areas are graveyards and forest clearings, especially when those places are drenched in moonlight. Ashava's religion is particularly popular along Varisia's Lost Coast.",
			"",
			"Ashava's faith is not just about joyous dancing, however. The recently bereaved also pray to the True Spark in her aspect as a shepherd of lost souls. Psychopomps ensure that the dead make their way along the River of Souls to their appointed rewards in the afterlife, but Ashava (and many of her followers) aid wandering spirits who have strayed from that path and need help returning to it. Ashavic dancers are followers of Ashava who specialize in this task, using the power of dance and moonlight to create magical effects that can exorcise possessing spirits and even unravel the necromantic energies that empower the undead..",
			"",
			"Ashava's holy symbol is a silhouette of a dancing woman against a full moon. Her favored weapon is the [bladed scarf](equipment/weapon/bladed_scarf) and her sacred animal is the wolf. She grants access to the domains of [Chaos](domain/chaos), [Darkness](domain/darkness), [Good](domain/good), and [Repose](domain/repose), and access to the subdomains of Ancestors, Azata, Moon, and Revelry.",

She gains an insight bonus to her Armor Class equal to her Wisdom modifier. She ignores any effect that would reduce her movement speed or prevent her from taking a 5-foot step.",
			"",
			"**Interstellar Mastery (Ex)** Black Butterfly never suffers any harmful environmental effects from outer space. She gains a +4 sacred bonus on attack rolls and saving throws when in such an environment, as well as the benefits of a ranger's favored terrain (+10 bonus).",
			"",
			"**Primal Aura (Su)** No sounds pass through Black Butterfly's primal aura except those she allows, and even then, she can choose to block a sound in some portions of her aura while allowing it to pass through other portions. When blocking sound, this aura functions similarly to silence. This ability is suppressed for 1d4 rounds whenever Black Butterfly is affected by a vision-based effect created by an evil creature.",
			"",
			"**Silence Between (Ex)** When Black Butterfly takes a 5-foot step, instead of moving 5 feet, she can ride the spaces in between breaths and thoughts, disappearing and rematerializing anywhere within 150 feet and attempting a Stealth check to hide as a free action. She can hide even when being directly observed, and her Stealth can defeat any sense (for example blindsight, lifesense, and tremorsense) as long as the result of the check exceeds the result of the observer's Perception check. She gains an additional +20 bonus on Stealth checks (+40 when immobile), which doesn't stack with the bonuses from invisibility, and she can't be outlined by spells like faerie fire or glitterdust. If she is hidden when she begins a full attack, any creature that wasn't observing her is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks in the full attack, not just the first attack. Black Butterfly loses access to her silence between ability when she is in an area of bright light.",
			"",
			"**Starflight (Su)** Although she can use interplanetary teleport at will, Black Butterfly enjoys flying between the stars. When she does so, she travels at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Black Butterfly knows the routes to all destinations among the stars.",
			"",
			"**Steal Breath (Su)** Black Butterfly's touch attack deals 10d6 points of cold damage and draws the breath from the target's lungs as she subjects the creature to the racking conditions of deep space. The creature struck can resist having its breath drawn out with a successful DC 37 Fortitude save; otherwise, the target is knocked unconscious by the sudden loss of oxygen. Steal breath does not harm creatures that do not breathe, but her touch attack can still deal cold damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Voidsedge Bond (Ex)** Voidsedge is a +5 aberration-bane ghost touch holy starknife that exists as one of the stars in Black Butterfly's wings until she calls it to her hand as a free action. When she throws Voidsedge, it returns to her hand instantly upon striking a target, allowing her to make iterative thrown attacks. Her range increment with Voidsedge is 120 feet. Attacks with Voidsedge deal an additional 2d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of cold damage on a hit when Black Butterfly wields the weapon.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Black Butterfly, the Silence Between, arose from the spaces between the stars. Solemn and serene, she never acts rashly, relying on the wisdom of the cosmos to guide her to the appropriate solution. She believes that the true nature of the multiverse lies in the gaps and silences between thoughts and ideas, so she never focuses on one topic or idea for too long, lest in narrowing her view she should lose sight of the space beyond the idea's edge.",
			"",
			"On Elysium, Black Butterfly's hidden realm is nestled in the constellation that leads to Desna's palace. Her realm is relatively simple for an empyreal lord, with no grand palace or bright colors. Instead, it is a quiet respite from a plane of riotous passions, a gentle void, breathable by creatures of all sorts, with pockets of solid shadow for those who prefer ground beneath their feet and dotted with simple shelters. Her realm is so difficult to find that even planar scholars and other residents of Elysium can't agree exactly where it lies, though travelers through silence and darkness, even on other planes, sometimes make their way into her realm in times of desperation, able to find momentary succor so long as they are respectful and quiet.",
			"",
			"While few beings can match her knowledge of the alien monstrosities that dwell in the deepest reaches of interstellar space, Black Butterfly refuses to share much of it, as she worries that widespread knowledge of her greatest nemeses, the Outer Gods and the Great Old Ones, would serve their interests rather than hers. She often journeys from her home in Elysium to subtly battle the interests of these foes and other forces of evil, or to assist those in need without revealing her presence.",
			"",
			"### Black Butterfly's Faith",
			"",
			"Black Butterfly is the patron of distance, silence, and space. The Silence Between's worshipers include those for whom distances are essential, such as parted lovers or explorers (particularly those who brave the unfathomable depths of outer space), as well as those who appreciate her connection to silence, such as the deaf and the mute. Worshipers of Black Butterfly are encouraged to perform anonymous acts of charity without speaking to the recipient of their kindness, for the reason that such unseen gifts help foster the perception that good things sometimes happen to good people for no other reason than that they deserve it. Black Butterfly's most sacred spaces are isolated monasteries and shrines high atop mountain peaks, deep underground, or even floating on asteroids in the void of space-these latter redoubts typically have potent magic to enable her worshipers to live and breathe with ease. She teaches her followers that the greatest good lies in performing quiet anonymous acts, and her faith abhors loud spectacles on holy days.",
			"",
			"Black Butterfly's holy symbol is a black-winged butterfly with a white star for a body on a field of purple. Her favored weapon is the starknife. She grants access to the domains of Chaos, Good, Liberation, and Void, and access to the subdomains of Azata, Freedom, Revolution, and Stars.",

Known as Briarbough, this sprawling complex of gardens and pools is his seat of power and a place of healing where celestials and good mortals come to have their most grievous wounds tended. Beyond lies hundreds of miles of pristine forest and plains; animals killed here are reborn the next day, fully healed. In times of war, Briarbough serves as a headquarters and hospital for good outsiders.",

Recognizing that-despite his power-he is still only one person, the Horned Lord uses his abilities to strengthen and bolster those already allied against darkness, training marshals and emissaries to work as his agents in the mortal and fey worlds. He favors druids and rangers-archers in particular-among his devotees.",

As a swift action, Korada may enter the basic stance of any combat style feat (such as Crane Style, Monkey Style, and so on) as if he had the first feat in the feat path for that combat style.

			"",

He must succeed at a melee touch attack against the creature or effect and expend 2 points of ki. If the attack hits, the creature or effect is subject to targeted greater dispel magic (CL 20th). If he dispels an effect, he suffer no harmful effects from touching it. If the effect is on a creature, the creature takes 1 point of damage per spell level of each effect dispelled.",
			"",
			"**Tranquil Master (Su)** Korada may attack without breaking his sanctuary spell-like ability so long as he only attempts to deal nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Korada is the champion of peace, kindness, and forgiveness. While he loves and respects his fellow empyreal lords for their tireless fight against wickedness, Korada believes good's final triumph will come from the redemption of evil creatures rather than their destruction. Honest, joyful, and clever, the Open Hand of Harmony dispenses wisdom with warmth and humility, and freely shares the secrets he has amassed over ages of study and meditation. Korada's dedication to philosophy and introspection have garnered him the ability to read the diverse threads of the world, see their nearly limitless connections, and then act on them with uncanny foresight. With neither the naivety of youth nor the jaded weariness of age, Korada is a perfect balance of sentient intelligence and animal instinct, at home wherever he is.",
			"",
			"Though he can assume many forms, Korada's true appearance is a slender, athletic man wearing a simple monk's robe. He has a golden monkey-like beard and sideburns, three monkey tails, and a light layer of downy golden fur covering the rest of his body.",
			"",
			"On Nirvana, Korada dwells in the Dream Lotus, a serene palace city whose blossoming violet walls always drip with cool, golden nectar that is said to calm even the wildest of spirits. It's a place of refuge and healing, and no violence is allowed within its walls; those with problems controlling their anger are sent to meditate at one of its many calming sacred pools.",
			"",
			"Korada is said to possess the gift of foresight, but he rarely acts on these strange visions. He believes the struggle to change is always worthwhile, even if such a journey does not always end in success. It's the process, not the result, that matters most to Korada.",
			"",
			"Despite his staunch dedication to peace, Korada's skill in battle is respected, and he's able to utilize almost any fighting style without a second's pause. He may be responsible for inspiring or teaching the animal combat styles to mortals, using various guises over the course of history on many worlds-or he may even have persuaded the creator gods to give the animals their instincts and talents for fighting, which led to mortals studying and emulating animal combat styles.",
			"",
			"Korada's reputation for peace and martial skill earned him the role of the diplomat of the empyreal lords and their celestial armies. Balor lords, demodand warlords, and even infernal dukes have (temporarily) abandoned their dreams of conquest and warmongering when the Open Hand of Harmony has arrived-alone-in their court to suggest that they consider a different path. These visits always leave behind a path of dazed and stunned fiends, surprised and awed by how easily he defeated them; most silently suffer this indignation and plan vengeance for the next time he appears.",
			"",
			"Although Korada is usually serene and gentle, he has a mischievous side and has been known to poke fun at or harass his opponents like a capricious monkey. He combines his skill in battle and gift for trickery to lead dangerous opponents away from innocents or into places where they can more easily be captured or subdued.",
			"",
			"That said, Korada abhors violence, and he prefers to make nonlethal attacks (using his primal aura and tranquil master abilities), disabling foes so he can speak to them of their weakness. He dispatches mindless opponents without hesitation, not wanting to waste energy debating or persuading a thing empty of thoughts and incapable of making moral choices. He challenges enemy leaders to single combat if doing so would prevent violence between other combatants.",
			"",
			"### Korada's Faith",
			"",
			"Korada is worshiped by good fey, awakened animals, and mortal clerics and monks seeking inner peace. Many who have lived with constant violence pray to Korada for guidance in finding balance; others are inspired by his light heart and willingness to confront wickedness with compassion and humor. Many who worship him are once-evil creatures who chose the path of redemption, as well as paladins who strayed and are working to stay true to the path of righteousness and mercy. The empyreal lord's sacred places are diplomatic embassies, mountain monasteries, and wells.",
			"",
			"Korada's holy symbol is two devotees kneeling before a lotus or a golden monkey with three tails. His favored weapon is the unarmed strike. His clerics have access to the domains of Good, Healing, Magic, and Protection, and the subdomains of Agathion, Defense, Divine, and Restoration.",

			"",

			"**Primal Aura (Su)** As a free action with Ragathiel's permission, any ally within Ragathiel's primal aura can spend two uses of Ragathiel's smite evil (or four uses of lay on hands) to instantly grant each ally within the aura the benefits of Ragathiel's smite evil against an enemy of that ally's choice.",
			"",
			"**Righteous Mantle (Ex)** Ragathiel inherited an affinity for fire from his mother. Fire heals Ragathiel a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage it would have dealt. Any fire damage dealt by Ragathiel ignores evil outsiders' fire resistance and immunity to fire, and deals double damage to devils. Ragathiel gains a sacred bonus to Armor Class equal to his Charisma bonus. Whenever Ragathiel receives magical healing, he has 2 additional hit points restored per die rolled.",
			"",
			"**Smite Evil (Su)** Ragathiel can smite evil as a 20th-level paladin, but his smite deals extra damage only on the first hit against evil outsiders (not evil dragons or undead). He can trade two uses of lay on hands for an additional use of smite evil as many times per day as he wishes, provided he has enough uses of lay on hands available to do so.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ragathiel is the son of the archdevil Dispater (see page 22) and a demigoddess of flame. He rejected his father's evil, losing his sixth wing to the archdevil's wrath, and escaped to Heaven, where he spent several millennia attempting to prove himself to the heavenly hosts and the other empyreal lords. Though many empyreal lords still find him far more bloodthirsty than they would prefer, the many centuries have proven Ragathiel's honor, loyalty, and determination time and again, and the other empyreal lords have come to trust his word completely.",
			"",
			"Now Ragathiel leads the war against Hell as the General of Vengeance. He is not content to plan from the sidelines and allow his forces to succeed or fail on the strength of his strategies alone. Instead, he leads by example from the forefront of his army, a shining figure of golden flame daring any foe to confront him and hewing through the ranks of devils to create a vulnerable area in the otherwise perfect infernal formation where his own armies then strike. Thus far, his strategy has served him well, as the archdevils prefer self-preservation to risking themselves in a direct confrontation with the General of Vengeance-but it won't take too many more successful forays before Barbatos (see page 18) moves to take decisive action, possibly bolstered by the forces of Ragathiel's father, Dispater.",
			"",
			"Ragathiel's domain is a magnificent, towering fortress of steel and silver that stands upon the lower slopes of Heaven. The domain is simply named Ragathiel's Fortress, as the General of Vengeance has no use for a fancier appellation. There is beauty to be found in the fortress's design, but it is the sort of beauty and elegance of design and functionality that would be lauded by engineers and military tacticians, rather than artists and poets; Ragathiel specifically built his fortress to withstand a thousand-year siege and prevent ingress into Heaven for that entire duration, even by hosts of enemies that, like most evil outsiders, have access to teleportation magic.",
			"",
			"### Ragathiel's Faith",
			"",
			"Ragathiel's worshipers number among them crusading knights and soldiers for justice, as well as oath-takers and those who have been grievously wronged by evil and now seek righteous vengeance. His followers must deal with the fundamental paradox of his faith: unlike those who worship forgiving empyreal lords such as Arshea or Korada, Ragathiel's chosen fight against evil foes unwaveringly and usually without offering second chances, and yet the General of Vengeance rose to his place from the depths of Hell itself. Most worshipers don't see this as hypocrisy but rather as a sign that the impetus for redemption must come from the former sinner, and even then not merely as an excuse to escape punishment for their sins. Thus, they don't take the initiative to offer opportunities for redemption to evildoers, but they listen carefully, if skeptically, to any who come seeking such a chance. For his part, Ragathiel empathizes with the moral dilemmas of his followers, as he constantly struggles with his own darker impulses. Thus, while he is unforgiving to his foes, he is particularly forgiving when it comes to lapses of judgment from his followers, allowing a wrathful paladin atonement when others might not. Certain other faiths are quick to interpret this willingness to \"bend the rules\" for certain circumstances involving paladins who, perhaps, go too far in pursuing their faith's goals as weakness in Ragathiel, and worry that there may be a little too much of his diabolic father lingering in his veins. Ragathiel has little need for pomp and circumstance in his worship, favoring utilitarian places like battlegrounds, fortresses, and war rooms as sacred spaces.",
			"",

			"Also known as the Cardinal Martyr, Vildeis endlessly sacrifices herself in penitence for the sins of the multiverse, every battle against evil giving her body one more wound with which she might shed bloody tears for existence. When Vildeis emerged from the Heavens, she was a being of sublime beauty, but of a majesty so delicate that she couldn't suffer the sight or even the thought of evil. Within an hour of her birth, she had put out her own eyes, refusing to even gaze upon a reality tainted by sin. Since the first self-inflicted wound marred her once-perfect body, she has struggled against evil in all its forms. Denying herself home or rest, Vildeis harrows the wildest reaches of the multiverse, driving back the expansions of foul realms and slaying those who would do wicked deeds.",
			"",
			"Vildeis has no home among the planes, and forgoes any comforts-even those as basic as shelter or company-so long as there is evil afoot in the multiverse. Such makes her one of the most aloof empyreal lords, but also one of the most storied. Across the planes, legends tell of pitched battles, desperate last stands, and near massacres turned in the favor of the innocent by the sudden appearance of Vildeis herself, bloody-winged and avenging. While such miraculous rescues have more to do with happenstance then omniscience, they nonetheless inflame the passions of the righteous across countless worlds. Those who seek to encounter the empyreal lord of devotion, sacrifice, and scars must follow rumors of her passing, usually spoken by awed beings and crippled fiends along the fringes of reality's darkest outlands.",
			"",
			"Nearly as well known as the Cardinal Martyr herself are her morbid trappings-miles of stained bandages, scars etched and re-etched in the shapes of celestial runes, and a dagger that drips with her blood as often as that of her enemies. Of these, her dagger Cicatrix is the most infamous, a black blade like a thorn dropped from some gigantic iron rose, which the empyreal lord used to blind herself. Tales tell that she uses her blade not just to slay the wicked and share her blindness, but to carve the runes that crisscross her body upon others, infusing them with the compulsion to battle evil even if previously there was no such desire.",
			"",
			"### Vildeis's Faith",
			"",
			"Vildeis is the patron of devotion, sacrifice, and scars. Those who follow her number among the most zealous crusaders, the most unshakable priests, and the most incorruptible judges. They view their goddess as an exemplar and a leader who sacrifices for them in ways they can never match. Vildeis, and by extension her worshipers, is extremely strict when it comes to adhering to her tenets of living an austere and principled life wholly devoted to combating evil.",
			"",
			"Those who diverge from Vildeis's teachings are expelled from her orders, but encouraged to do good in the world under the service of gentler masters. Though Vildeis doesn't expect all of her followers to perform the same self-mortification that she does, tattoos, scarification, and flagellation are common among her servants, especially her most devoted priests. Even those who don't engage in ritual bloodletting typically wear long red ribbons, symbolic of the empyreal lord's eternal wounds.",
			"",
			"Vildeis's holy symbol is a scarred golden breastplate. Her favored weapon is the dagger. Her clerics have access to the Destruction, Good, Healing, and Law domains, and to the Rage and Resurrection subdomains.",

The slain creature must immediately make a DC 29 Will save or his body and gear are drawn through the rift, transported to Galundari's trophy room in his palace on the Abyss. Regardless of whether the creature's body is drawn through the rift, the rift immediately slams shut a moment after it forms, creating a 20-foot-radius burst of chaotic energy that staggers all non-demons in the area of effect for 1d10 rounds-a DC 29 Fortitude save reduces the staggering effect to 1 round. If Galundari slays multiple creatures simultaneously, the body targeted by the rift is determined randomly. If the body targeted by the rift was a good outsider, all creatures (including the dead creature in danger of being pulled through the rift) take a -2 penalty on all saving throws against that specific Abyssal rift. This is a teleportation effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"**Critical Poisoning (Su)** If Bokrug confirms a critical hit with his sting, he injects his foe with 3 doses of poison (this increases the save DC by 4). A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. ",
			"",
			"Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Sting-injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Wisdom damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Spines (Ex)** Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
			"",
			"**Toxic Breath (Su)** Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 33 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom-it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Vengeful Dreams (Su)** Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful dreams regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful dreams against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a -15 penalty on the saving throw against the nightmare. If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful dreams. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity. Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bokrug, the Water Lizard, dwells in a distant and forsaken corner of the Dimension of Dreams, in a land that was once heavily populated but is now a desolate and barren realm surrounding a nameless lake-a realm once ruled by mighty human empires, but now ruled only by the hideous amphibian minions of the Water Lizard. Bokrug himself is a vast creature, a vaguely iguana-shaped monster with a beard of writhing tendrils and a long tail tipped with a stinger. The scales that cover his body hide long spines that Bokrug can extend or retract with near lightning speed.",
			"",
			"Bokrug spends the majority of his time slumbering far down in the depths of his submerged lair. No rivers feed the lake, nor does it drain into the sea. Yet the still, ominous waters are neither stale nor brackish, implying that they connect somewhere deep underground, and. By way of these dark, secret waterways, Bokgrug has access to the lakes and rivers of the Dimension of Dreams, and his ability to plane shift allows him access to other realms as he wills.",
			"",
			"### Bokrug's Cult",
			"",
			"Bokrug is worshiped more out of fear than adoration, and when traveling dreamers come across his cult in their nightmares, they can unknowingly spread this fearful faith into the waking world. Bokrug's temples are often found on the shores of remote lakes or hidden away in large swamplands. Though humans worship him, so do boggards, lizardfolk, marsh giants, and other swampdwelling races-particularly those who have suffered at the hands of aggressors, such as invading armies, rival tribes, or adventuring parties.",
			"",
			"Though Bokrug is chaotic neutral, almost all of his worshipers are chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Only a rare few chaotic good worshipers of Bokrug exist- most of these being delusional heretics or apologists who seek to keep Bokrug calm, ensuring he continues to slumber. These heretics and outliers of the faith are remorselessly hunted down by his more zealous and traditional worshipers.",
			"",
			"Bokrug's cult is associated with revenge, storms, and water, and its sacred symbol is a green lizard with a long, coiling tail-an image of Bokrug himself. His greatest shrines feature unusually realistic statues of his form, statues the cult maintains Bokrug can see out of and even animate from his distant lair to take sacrifices. Bokrug's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Water, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Oceans, Rage, and Storms. The Water Lizard's favored weapon is the ranseur; his followers often forge their ranseurs' blades to resemble the Great Old One's stingered tail.",

			"",
			"**Dreams of Madness (Su)** When Cthulhu uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature with one or more ranks in a Craft or Perform skill, he also afflicts the creature with maddening dreams. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or contract a random insanity. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an insanity is immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Greater Starflight (Su)** Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds.

			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Cthulhu is killed, his body immediately fades away into a noxious cloud of otherworldly vapor that fills an area out to his reach. This cloud blocks vision as obscuring mist, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via true resurrection, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R-lyeh until he is released again. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",

This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier (+12). His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50% miss chance against all attacks. True seeing can defeat this miss chance, but any creature that looks upon Cthulhu while under the effects of true seeing must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be afflicted by a random insanity (this is a mind-affecting effect).

A creature immune to fear that fails its save against Cthulhu's unspeakable presence is staggered for 1d6 rounds instead of killed. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Known to some as the Dreamer in the Deep, Great Cthulhu is the mightiest of the Great Old Ones. Cthulhu is represented often in artwork-particularly in sculpture, painting, and poetry, for his influence is particularly strong among such sensitive and creative minds. In these eldritch works of art, he is depicted or described as having a vaguely humanoid frame, but with immense draconic wings and an octopus-shaped head. His actual form is somewhat fluid-the Great Old One can shift and reshape his exact countenance as he wills, allowing him to occupy a smaller space than one might expect for a creature that stands over 100 feet tall.",
			"",
			"It is fortunate indeed that Cthulhu is currently imprisoned on a distant planet within the sunken city of R-lyeh. There, the Great Old One slumbers away the eons in a state neither quite dead nor living, held in stasis by ancient magic and the potency of the Elder Sign, yet at times the city rises from the sea and the doors to his tomb open, granting Cthulhu limited mobility before he must return to his tomb.",
			"",
			"### Cthulhu's Cult",
			"",
			"Although Cthulhu is imprisoned on a far-flung world, his dreams span the gulfs of existence and are capable of touching upon the sleeping minds of sensitive or artistic souls, inspiring them with insane visions and driving the creation of all manner of eldritch artistry. In such ways, his cult spreads like a night-borne virus of the dreaming mind across all worlds on which sapient life dwells. Cthulhu is worshiped by various aquatic races and folk who dwell along coasts, but also among certain decadent or fringe societies of artists, poets, and philosophers. When they form, his cults are secretive and careful to hide their allegiance to the Great Old One, meeting only in desolate and otherwise abandoned locales hidden from society's notice. Central among his cult's beliefs is the prophecy that one day, the stars will be right and Great Cthulhu shall rise from his corpse-city to usher in the end times, wiping clean all worlds to make them ready for his kind. The cultists believe they might be spared this fate through proper obeisance and fealty, when in truth Cthulhu is unlikely to notice the difference between those who worship him and anyone else.",
			"",
			"Cthulhu's cult is associated with cataclysms, dreams, and the stars, and his sacred symbol is a complex rune surrounding an open eye. Cthulhu's temples are monolithic structures of a stark and cyclopean architectural style, but most of his faithful lack the resources to build such temples and instead make do with what they can, hiding away personal shrines in underground chambers or in shacks or glades in the remote wilderness. Cthulhu's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Void, and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry, Insanity, Nightmare, and Stars. His favored weapon is the dagger-often one with a curving blade.",

			"**Apocalyptic Dreams (Su)** Ghatanothoa can affect a creature with apocalyptic dreams if it has been subjected to his unspeakable presence (even if the creature successfully saved against that effect), has been harmed by a natural disaster created by a magical effect (such as an earthquake, storm of vengeance, or tsunami spell), or has ever offered a prayer to Ghatanothoa. When Ghatanothoa uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim has a vivid dream of experiencing the end of the world in a fiery, destructive apocalypse-be it from asteroid impact, devastating floods, volcanic eruption, or anything else at the GM's whim. Upon waking, the conviction that such an apocalypse is only days, if not hours, away haunts the victim. In addition to suffering the normal effects of the nightmare, the victim must succeed at a DC 37 Will saving throw or be staggered with hopelessness for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Create Mummified Creature (Su)** Any creature slain by Ghatanothoa's swallow whole attack is immediately transformed into a mummified creature under Ghatanothoa's control. As a free action, Ghatanothoa can disgorge any number of swallowed mummified creatures into adjacent squares. As a swift action, Ghatanothoa may make a touch attack against a creature that has mummified fully as a result of his unspeakable presence to transform that creature into a mummified creature under his control (no save).",

Ghatanothoa's body shrivels and compresses in on itself, growing hard and leathery as it mummifies and contracts in size to a Huge object with AC 24, hardness 30, and 200 hit points. These remains are immune to cold damage, take half damage from fire and electricity, and take 150% damage from acid. An earthquake manifests (as per the spell at CL 29th) each round thereafter, centered on the location where Ghatanothoa was slain (his remains never take damage from the effects of these earthquakes). If Ghatanothoa's remains are not destroyed within 1 minute of his death, the remains explode in a blast of negative energy with a 600-foot radius that deals 20d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures within that area (Reflex DC 43 half). A creature killed by this damage is immediately transformed into a mummified creature. If the remains are destroyed before this occurs, they crumble to dust without exploding. In either case, as soon as the remains are destroyed or explode, the earthquake effect in the region ends. Once this occurs, Ghatanothoa is reborn from one of the hidden cysts deep within his island lair. If his remains were destroyed before they could explode, he stays dormant in his lair until outside influences awake him once again (this could be a complex ritual performed by cultists, an astronomical event, or any natural disaster that strikes the region). If his remains were allowed to explode, Ghatanothoa wakes immediately and his unspeakable presence ability once again functions as detailed below. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Ghatanothoa's unspeakable presence is so potent that even perfect images of the Great Old One can have this effect-a \"perfect image\" can either be a projected image created by Ghatanothoa, a perfectly rendered statue or painting (this requires an expenditure of 100,000 gp in resources, a successful DC 50 Craft [painting or sculpture] check, and a wish by someone who has suffered from Ghatanothoa's unspeakable presence), or any other representation at the GM's whim.

If the creature averts its gaze from Ghatanothoa, this drain is reduced to 1 point per round. As soon as a creature's Dexterity score is drained to 0, it transforms into a perfectly preserved and completely immobile mummy, yet the victim does not die. A creature mummified in this way no longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe, and no longer ages. It is essentially immortal, and can observe the world around it (and may even take purely mental actions, including the use of psychic magic), but can take no other actions. No magical effect can end this condition (even if the victim's Dexterity drain is healed) save for an effect that removes the curse. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"**Fulvous Dreams (Su)** When Hastur uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature that has seen the Yellow Sign, he also afflicts that creature with horrifying dreams tinted with a nauseating yellow color and thick with overwhelming sensations of decadence, shame, and entropic disorder. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must also succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Reveal Visage (Su)** As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC 40 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tattered Lash (Ex)** Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flatfooted when he attacks with these weapons.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Wish (Sp)** Although Hastur may use wish as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the wishes of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these wishes serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Sign (Su)** Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with dispel chaos, dispel evil, or erase, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check. Mage's disjunction automatically removes a Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Hastur is the most mysterious of the Great Old Ones. In fact, the entity known as Hastur might actually be an Outer God. The physical manifestation of this entity is known as the King in Yellow, and though most consider this creature-a vaguely human-shaped figure draped in a yellow cloak-to be synonymous with Hastur himself, many scholars believe that the King in Yellow is nothing more than an avatar used by the true Hastur to move among the denizens of the physical world. Hastur himself is said to dwell upon a distant world called Carcosa on the shores of the monstrous Lake of Hali, and his power on a planet is strongest when the baleful light of Carcosa's star is visible in that planet's night sky.",

			"Hastur's cult is primarily composed of decadent nobles, playwrights, and aristocrats who have grown bored with life and have sought out increasingly deviant, bizarre, and self-destructive methods of achieving gratification in life. His temples are opulent and excessive-opera houses, manors, and the like that contain hidden chambers for pastimes best indulged in secret. His cultists are particularly eager to bring innocents into their fold, exposing them to the Yellow Sign so that their bodies and minds can serve as portals through which the King in Yellow may walk the world.",
			"",
			"Hastur's cult is associated with decadence, disorder, and nihilism, and its symbol is the Yellow Sign. The least varieties of these symbols are nonmagical-and somewhat inaccurate-representations of the sigil, though the more powerful cults possess methods by which they can craft fully functional Yellow Signs. Unlike those created by Hastur, a cult-created Yellow Sign can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Will save (as if it were a 9th-level spell). Hastur's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Rune, and Void, and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry, Language, Stars, and Wards. Hastur's favored weapon is the rapier.",

			"**Cloak of Ash (Ex)** A blanketing layer of swirling ash surrounds Mhar's bulk, obscuring the vision of anyone who draws too close. All creatures within the area have concealment. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the ash after 1 round. The ash returns immediately once the strong wind ends.",
			"",
			"**Earthen Regeneration (Ex)** Mhar's regeneration functions only while it is burrowing, submerged in lava, or otherwise underground. The regeneration continues for 1 minute after it emerges aboveground. If Mhar's regeneration is stopped, the regeneration automatically resumes when Mhar burrows or enters lava.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Mhar is slain, it explodes violently, spraying earth and lava in all directions. Creatures within 30 feet of Mhar take 30d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 30d6 points of fire damage. A creature can attempt a DC 40 Reflex save for half damage. Mhar manifests again 1 year later in the same area, restored to life via [true resurrection](spell/true_resurrection).",
			"",
			"**Massive (Ex)** Due to Mhar's tremendous size, it treats uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain as normal terrain, though areas of forest or significant settlements are still considered difficult terrain to Mhar. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by Mhar, and vice versa. Mhar can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Mhar gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Mhar-this generally requires a successful DC 30 Climb check, and unlike the normal rules regarding Mhar and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on its body provokes an attack of opportunity from Mhar. Any creature that climbs on Mhar is treated as if it is totally immersed in [lava](unknown/lava).",
			"",
			"**Taphophobic Dreams (Su)** When Mhar uses its [nightmare](unknown/nightmare) spell-like ability on a creature within 5 feet of earth or worked stone, it also afflicts that creature with terrifying dreams of an immense presence surging through the ground, ominously circling the target and threatening to pull it under. In addition to the effects of [nightmare](unknown/nightmare), the target must also succeed at a DC 35 Will save or be unwilling to approach within 5 feet of any amount of earth or stone and, if within such an area, compelled to leave it immediately. The creature is profoundly uncomfortable in such an area, reducing its Dexterity score to 1. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Mhar's unspeakable presence causes the victim to experience the crushing entombment of earth and lose the ability to breathe as long as it remains within the area of effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Volcanic Tempest (Ex)** Once every 1d6 rounds, Mhar can spew a torrential rain of lava, fire, and caustic ash as a full-round action. All creatures within 60 feet of Mhar take 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 8d6 points of fire damage (DC 40 Reflex half). In addition, the ground within 60 feet of Mhar when it uses this ability becomes covered in a thin layer of lava. Any creature that ends its turn within this lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage. The lava cools after 1 minute. Finally, the area within 60 feet of Mhar when it uses this ability fills with deadly ash that functions as [stinking cloud](spell/stinking_cloud) (Fortitude DC 40 negates). This ash disperses naturally after 1 minute. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mhar is a Great Old One that was born eons ago on the edge of the Material Plane. A unique planar rift caused pure essence from the Plane of Earth and Plane of Fire to collide and fuse together, coalescing into a being that lived in a state of constant anguish-a mass of volcanic eruptions that cooled and melted away in a cycle that caused it unending pain. Seeking relief from its torment but unable to escape the Material Plane, Mhar alleviated its suffering by traveling the stars.",
			"",
			"Mhar found nascent planets that were still made of roiling magma. For a time, Mhar could rest in the core of these planets, but even such primordial heat could not keep Mhar sedated. Mhar would eventually awaken, destroying the planet and departing to find another haven elsewhere. After destroying countless worlds, Mhar learned a way to escape to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Unfortunately for Mhar, this required greater power than it currently had. Mhar found another young planet-the world called Golarion-burrowed deep into its core, and waited to grow.",
			"",
			"While Mhar rested, the goddess Sarenrae tore open a portion of the Material Plane to seal Rovagug within the Dead Vault. Unbeknownst to her, she slew Mhar in that process, granting it the reprieve from pain it had always sought. However, even oblivion could not quell Mhar's suffering, and its agony was enough to stir it from death. When Mhar awakened yet again, trapped within the crust of Golarion, it went mad, unable to escape its own torment. Mhar let out a psychic scream. As this scream rebounded and echoed between the crust and Mhar itself, intensifying the creature's madness, the mental force of it pushed against the surface of the earth and formed the Kodar Mountains.",
			"",
			"Mhar seeks to break free from beneath Golarion's crust and destroy the world, then use the magma as a focus to open a breach to the Plane of Fire and flood the entire Material Plane with lava. Once all of reality is a mass of fire and destruction, Mhar can finally find peace.",

			"**Absorb Light (Su)** Mordiggian's presence causes all light levels within a 100-foot spread to be reduced by one category as long as he has at least 1 hit point. Anyone who attempts to cast a spell with the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check, or the spell is lost as if it had been counterspelled.",
			"",
			"**Dreams of Darkness (Ex)** Mordiggian can affect a creature that has been restored to life by a worshiper of Mordiggian, that has suffered negative energy damage while within the walls of a temple devoted to Mordiggian, or that has been in the area of effect of Mordiggian's unspeakable presence (whether or not the creature was affected by it) with dreams of darkness. When Mordiggian uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim endures what seems to be the passage of hundreds of years imprisoned in a lightless sarcophagus or coffin. Upon waking, the creature takes an additional effect beyond the normal effects of nightmare-it must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or contract an accelerated form of ghoul fever that inflicts its damage every hour instead of every day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Eldritch Insight (Ex)** The whispers of all the world's dead echo in Mordiggian's mind, and as a result, he adds his Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus to his Armor Class and on all Initiative checks. If Mordiggian is on a planet or in a dimension where no creature has ever died, this ability does not function.",
			"",
			"**Engulf (Su)** When Mordiggian engulfs a creature, he inflicts 20d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d4 negative levels. A successful DC 44 Reflex saving throw halves the negative energy damage, and a DC 44 Fortitude save removes the negative levels. The save DCs are both Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Great Old One Traits (Ex)** Rules for Mordiggian's Great Old One traits such as immortality, insanity, and otherworldly, as well as the rules for his mythic abilities and unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Mordiggian is killed, the shadows that comprise his body lose all form and become a 20-foot-diameter roiling blot of churning darkness with a 300-foot fly speed and perfect maneuverability. This blot of darkness is incorporeal and cannot be harmed, but it cannot enter an area of bright light. The blot can sense all undead creatures within a 100-mile radius, and if it finds an undead creature, it can attempt to infuse it. An intelligent undead can resist this attack with a successful DC 40 Will saving throw; unintelligent undead receive no save. Once this blot of darkness infuses an undead creature, it grants the undead creature the advanced creature simple template, but 24 hours later, the undead is destroyed, releasing a fully-healed Mordiggian back into the world. If Mordiggian cannot find a suitable undead host within 24 hours or is trapped by bright light for that duration, the blot of darkness fades away, only to manifest immediately on another world-perhaps in the distant past, in the distant future, or even in the present. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tentacles (Su)** Mordiggian's tentacles are primary attacks that inflict bludgeoning damage. He adds his Charisma modifier to damage done by his tentacles, which also gain a +5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. These tentacles are treated as magic epic chaotic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If Mordiggian reduces a living creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a tentacle or with his constriction damage, he automatically casts death knell on the target as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 40 Will saving throw against Mordiggian's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become permanently blinded. A creature that is killed while blinded by this ability immediately animates as a chaotic evil juju zombie. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",

			"",
			"Called the Charnel God by his worshipers, Mordiggian is one of the oldest and most powerful of the Great Old Ones. However, his tendency to move back and forth in time whenever he reincarnates makes the tracking of his age largely academic. None can say how long Mordiggian has existed, for as far as one can look back into the past or forward into the future, the presence of his cult can be found if one searches hard enough.",
			"",
			"Mordiggian has no body. He appears as a cloud of mobile, malevolent darkness and shadow that can change its outline and shape at will. He is fond of appearing as an immense graveworm or limbless giant made of darkness, and when he desires a meal, he can form tentacles of solid darkness to pluck up his feast.",
			"",
			"Ghouls, particularly those that dwell in Leng, often venerate Mordiggian with a ferocious zeal. They consider ghoulish worshipers of other deities, particularly of the demon lord Kabriri, to be heretics and work to eradicate such blasphemers whenever they are found. Although worship of Mordiggian has become quite rare on Golarion as other death gods have gained more prominence, his cult is patient and willing to simply wait for the Charnel God's inevitable return to power.",

			"",
			"Mordiggian's worshipers venerate him as a death god, and his worship is openly allowed in some cities. In these cases, his temple also serves to dispose of all of the city's dead, yet the faithful's exact method for dealing with corpses is subject to fearful whispers among the nonbelievers. His temples consist of either underground vaults hidden below graveyards or towering cathedrallike structures containing mazes of rooms. Mordiggian grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Death, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Entropy, Loss, Night, and Undead. His favored weapon is the scimitar.",

In addition to the normal effects of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or become convinced that the horrific visions of the end of the world experienced in the nightmare are in fact visions of the very near future. Such a victim becomes overwhelmed with despair and loss, and is so distracted by the conviction that its doom is imminent that it cannot take swift or immediate actions, cannot concentrate to maintain spells with concentration durations, and takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells and on Wisdom based skill checks. Whenever the victim attempts a saving throw against fear effects, it must roll twice and take the worse result. This fear effect lasts for 2d4 days, after which (assuming the world doesn't end after all) the effect ends. The effect also ends automatically if the victim voluntarily sacrifices a living, sentient creature to Rhan-Tegoth (this is a chaotic evil act)-although in most cases, a creature that performs such a sacrifice finds itself targeted with apocalyptic dreams soon thereafter, again and again.

			"**Feed (Su)** Once per round when Rhan-Tegoth successfully bites a creature he is grappling, his proboscis feeds on the victim and siphons away bodily fluids at an alarming rate. This attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain to the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC 42 Fortitude save, in which case the feeding instead deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. For every point of Constitution drain dealt in this way, Rhan-Tegoth regains 10 hit points, and for every point of Constitution damage dealt in this way, he regains 5 hit points. In addition, if Rhan-Tegoth drains more than 4 points of Constitution in this way in a single round, he gains the effects of a haste spell for the following round. A creature that is slain by this Constitution drain or damage is reduced to a shriveled corpse riddled with deep, dry holes, and can be restored to life only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Rhan-Tegoth is slain, he merely petrifies into a statue. He remains in statue form, in hibernation, until a living, sentient creature is sacrificed adjacent to the hibernating Great Old One, at which point Rhan-Tegoth is immediately restored to life (as if via true resurrection). If no such sacrifice is performed, Rhan-Tegoth can remain in hibernation in this form forever-though certain rare cosmological events can rouse him from his slumber. In this statue form, he has hardness 30 and 300 hp. If the statue of the hibernating Great Old One is destroyed, it crumbles to dust but immediately affects all creatures within 300 feet with Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence, and Rhan-Tegoth's consciousness is transplanted into a different statue of the Great Old One (typically one on another world). If no such statues remain in existence at the time of destruction, his consciousness is instead transplanted into a statue in the past or future to await eventual awakening.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence fills the victim with an irresistible urge to sacrifice a living, sentient creature to the Great Old One. Treat this as a geas/quest spell (CL 28th) that ends the moment the affected creature kills a living, sentient creature in Rhan-Tegoth's name (this is a chaotic evil act). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The strange and silent Great Old One known as the Herald of the End Times has spent most of its existence in hibernation, waking for short periods of time after his worshipers rouse him or as the result of singular cosmic events. These periods of wakefulness never last for long, but ancient texts speak of a time when Rhan-Tegoth shall waken fully from his slumber, heralding the dawn of the end of all worlds.",
			"",
			"While records of Rhan-Tegoth's waking periods and his activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors still persist of certain chants and rituals that are capable of temporarily waking the Great Old One from his slumber. What reasons might exist for stirring Rhan-Tegoth from his sleep can only be guessed at, for the Great Old One will usually simply consume any foolish enough to rouse him from slumber.",
			"",
			"Rhan-Tegoth appears as an aquatic arthropod in shape, yet closer inspection leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind of the Great Old One's truly alien nature. His body measures 10 feet from tip to tip, and his legs span 24 feet. The Great Old One weighs 2,000 pounds, but this weight increases to 10 times this amount when he is in statue form. The fact that countless statues of Rhan-Tegoth exist makes it difficult to determine which of them is in fact the actual slumbering god, so care should be taken in proximity of any depiction of the Herald of the End Times.",
			"",
			"### Rhan-Tegoth's Cult",
			"",
			"Rhan-Tegoth is worshiped by primitive tribespeople who do not understand the strange terrors caused by the unusual statue they have stumbled across, but he is just as often venerated by fanatics who know full well the creature's significance. Cultists take delight in placing the hibernating Great Old One in public venues for display- this act eventually ends in disaster for the region and Rhan-Tegoth transitioning to other realms, leaving behind desolation and madness as a reminder of his visitation.",

An ancient one is a hundun with the invincible mythic simple template that is native to the Material Plane. In addition to Tawil at-Umr being able to summon ancient ones to its side, any command spoken or telepathically sent from it to an ancient one (but not to a normal hundun) must be obeyed without question (and with no save).",
			"",
			"**Dimensional Dreams (Su)** When Tawil at-Umr uses its nightmare spell-like ability, it can target any creature it has affected with its spell-like or supernatural abilities, or any creature that has ever traveled via a gate spell, regardless of distance. In addition to the effects of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 39 Will save or die, only to be reincarnated a moment later into a new body on another world. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

The target can resist this effect with a successful DC 39 Will save. If the creature fails its save, its body vanishes (leaving behind any gear it may have carried) and its mind becomes trapped in the host creature's mind. The target can observe the world through the host creature but cannot control the host creature's actions. In time, or under certain conditions, the target can eventually take control of the host's actions, but these developments are rare and require hundreds of years to occur (usually, the host creature dies long before the target can exert such influence). To others, it is rarely apparent which body throughout the countless worlds Tawil at-Umr has seen was chosen as a host for the target's mind. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

If it wishes, Tawil at-Umr can block the teleportation or portal effect from occurring as an immediate action. The creator of the effect must succeed at a caster level check against Tawil at-Umr's spell resistance or the effect is countered.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Displacement (Su)** A creature struck by one of Tawil at-Umr's slam attacks must succeed at a DC 39 Fortitude save or enter a state of suspended animation like that created by temporal stasis. This condition cannot be removed via dispel magic, nor does freedom of movement offer protection. Freedom can immediately end this effect, as can Tawil at-Umr's touch. Once every 24 hours, a displaced creature can attempt a new DC 39 Fortitude save to end the effect, but otherwise this effect is permanent. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** As long as it remains shrouded in its cloak, Tawil at-Umr's unspeakable presence is suppressed, but as soon as it attacks or otherwise reveals its true form, any creature within range that fails a DC 39 Will save is placed in its own subjective reality, as if under the effects of a microcosm spell. A creature immune to mind-affecting effects that fails its save against this effect is instead staggered for 1d6 rounds. This is a mind-affecting phantasm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

As a sort of avatar of this deity, Tawil at-Umr pursues its own goals throughout the Material Plane and dimensions that intersect it in ways mortals can never fully understand. Tawil at-Umr is just as likely to react to attacks against it with its formidable combat prowess as it is to ignore its attackers or simply relocate to another point in the multiverse-its reasons for doing so are as inscrutable as its plans for reality. Some scholars theorize that Tawil at-Umr is little more than a side effect of Yog-Sothoth's presence upon reality when the Outer God brushes up against this universe. Even if this is the case, Tawil at-Umr's knowledge of reality is vast, and many have sought the avatar out to learn its secrets.",

Those who choose to exalt this less-powerful but highly-focused avatar tend to do so as individuals, and no organized cult to Tawil at-Umr is known to exist. Those who specifically seek to devote themselves to Tawil at-Umr typically do so out of a mistaken impression that worship matters to the avatar.",

			"**Adaptive Spellcasting (Su)** Tsathoggua has mastered all forms of magic, be they arcane, divine, or psychic. He casts spells spontaneously, as per a sorcerer, but he can cast spells from any spell list. He can know up to two spells per spell level from 1st to 9th at any one time (and up to six 0-level spells at any one time), taken from any spell list. When he uses his consume spellcaster ability, he can swap out up to two spells currently known for any two spells known (and currently prepared in the case of prepared spellcasters) by his consumed victim. The only spells Tsathoggua can never know are those with the good or lawful descriptors. The spells listed above are those he favors, but GMs are free to alter that list as they wish for encounters with Tsathoggua.",
			"",
			"**Consume Spellcaster (Su)** When Tsathoggua kills a spellcaster while using his feed ability, the spellcaster's body shrivels into what appears to be a long-dead mummified corpse. Tsathoggua can learn any two spells known by the spellcaster (see adaptive spellcasting above) when he kills a spellcaster in this way, and he regains a number of hit points equal to the total number of spell levels still uncast by the consumed victim.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** Once every hour as a standard action, Tsathoggua can emit 1d4 formless spawn from his body. These newly created formless spawn have free will and are fully grown, but they follow Tsathoggua's commands for 1d4 days after creation. Tsathoggua sometimes gifts newly created spawn to visitors he favors. Sometimes he just eats them. Those spawn that escape servitude or digestion slither off into the world on their own.",
			"",
			"**Feed (Su)** Whenever Tsathoggua deals bite damage to a creature, he drinks away vital essence, sanity, and bodily fluids alike. This causes 1d4 points of ability drain to all six ability scores. A successful DC 44 Fortitude saving throw reduces the 1d4 points of ability drain to only one ability score, chosen by Tsathoggua. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Immortality (Su)** If Tsathoggua is slain, his body tears open and creates a burst of vile ooze that deals 20d8 points of acid damage to all creatures within a 60-foot spread. A total of 2d6 formless spawn immediately form in random spots throughout this area of effect, while the remainder of the gore seeps into the ground, reforming into Tsathoggua in a deep cavern on another world after 1d100 months have passed. All portals in Tsathoggua's domain that connect to the world on which he was slain deactivate and must be manually repaired by the Great Old One, a process that can take years or even decades but does not bar his return to that world via other means.",

When Tsathoggua uses nightmare on such a target, the victim must also succeed at a DC 38 Will saving throw or feel cast out of society and spurned by friends and loved ones. The victim cannot benefit from the aid another action or provide aid to others, it must always attempt saving throws against beneficial spell effects if saving throws are allowed, and it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks when any other creature of its type is within 30 feet of it. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 38 Will saving throw against Tsathoggua's unspeakable presence causes the victim to perceive Tsathoggua as its only ally; it treats all other creatures as enemies and does what it can to defend Tsathoggua and obey the Great Old One's commands, as if under the effects of dominate monster. This effect persists for as long as the victim remains within 300 feet of Tsathoggua. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Not only does he often interact with mortal life, but he has at times done so in a friendly or even charitable manner. Yet these moods are mercurial, and the Great Old One tires of company and attempts to eat those he had been aiding only a moment before. Those who worship him generally do not display this level of magnanimity; they are typically fanatic and violent in their methods of preserving the secrets of their sect.",

The presence of well-preserved Tsathogguan temples on many worlds suggests that at one point in the distant past, his followers were both more plentiful and more willing to work in larger groups, but today these temples lie abandoned save by monsters, the Great Old One's spawn, and a handful of clerics (or just a lone devoted and powerful priest). Tsathoggua grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, and Magic and to the subdomains of Arcane, Divine, Thought, and Whimsy. Tsathoggua's favored weapon is the short sword.",

			"**Contagious Lore (Su)** Any creature that learns Xhamen-Dor's name and comprehends the Great Old One's nature as an insidious parasite (this typically requires a creature to be exposed to information in a book or to be taught the information, but also automatically affects any creature who succeeds at a Knowledge check to learn more about the Great Old One) is at risk of being targeted by Xhamen-Dor's infectious dreams. Every year, there is a flat 1% chance that such a creature can be targeted by the Great Old One's infected dream ability. If 5 years pass without being targeted, the victim \"forgets\" about Xhamen-Dor until taught of the Great Old One again. A miracle or wish can spell also cause someone to forget in this way.",
			"",
			"**Dread Decay (Su)** A creature damaged by Xhamen- Dor's bite becomes afflicted by a fast-acting infection that swiftly rots flesh and bone into a foul-smelling gangrenous slop. The bitten creature must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude saving throw or take 2d6 points of Strength drain and 2d6 points of Constitution drain. On a successful save, the victim takes only 2 points of Strength drain and 2 points of Constitution drain. A creature whose Strength score is reduced to 0 by this effect falls comatose and immediately experiences infected dreams (see below). A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this effect is immediately absorbed into Xhamen-Dor's body, along with its memories, mind, and soul. Such a creature cannot be restored to life except via wish or miracle. Even then a creature brought back to life in this manner experiences infected dreams (see page 87). This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Entangling Shroud (Su)** Xhamen-Dor is surrounded by a writhing storm of fungal filaments that fills an area equal to his reach. While these filaments are almost microscopic in width, they are quite strong and capable of swatting aside ranged weapon attacks, granting Xhamen-Dor a 50% miss chance against all such attacks. In addition, any creature that ends its turn within Xhamen-Dor's reach must succeed at a DC 37 Reflex saving throw or become entangled as long as it remains in that area. An entangled creature can try to break free as a move action; the DC of the Strength or Escape Artist check is equal to that of the Reflex save to avoid becoming entangled in the first place. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Great Old One Traits (Ex)** Rules for Xhamen-Dor's Great Old One traits like immortality, insanity, its mythic abilities, otherworldly insight, and the base rules for unspeakable presence can be found on page 306 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Xhamen-Dor is slain, its body collapses into a reeking pile of fungus, hair, and bones. The core of its being compresses down to a tiny blot of incorporeal fungal matter that is immediately expelled from the core of its mass and hurled out into the depths of space. All creatures within 120 feet of Xhamen-Dor when this occurs must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude saving throw or take 2d6 points of Charisma drain as portions of their sanity and souls are pulled along with the blot. Xhamen-Dor's remains animate as a unique undead creature known as a seeded 24 hours after this event (see page 90 for statistics), but this is merely an echo of the Great Old One. Xhamen-Dor is reborn again when one of two events occur: the blot fired into space impacts a planet, or one of its surviving seeded returns to Carcosa and resurrects as the Great Old One. If the former, it can be centuries or even eons before Xhamen-Dor awakens again, but if the latter, the Great Old One can return within a matter of months or less. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Infected Dreams (Su)** Any knowledgeable creature that has succumbed to the yearly 1% chance of Xhamen-Dor's contagious lore ability (see page 86) or whose Strength score has been drained to 0 by dread decay (see page 86) can be targeted by the Great Old One's nightmare spell-like ability, regardless of the distance between the creature and Xhamen-Dor. In order to use infected dreams against a target, Xhamen-Dor must successfully affect that target with its nightmare spell-like ability. If the victim fails its saving throw against the nightmare, it becomes infected with the following virulent fungal blight.",
			"",
			"Seeded Infestation-save Fort DC 41; onset immediate; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con drain; cure none. This infestation can be cured only by magic. A creature whose Constitution score is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature (see page 90). This is an infestation effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Powerful Tentacles (Su)** Xhamen-Dor's tentacles are treated as primary natural attacks.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 31 Will saving throw against Xhamen-Dor's unspeakable presence causes a victim to become nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and then sickened for an additional 2d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Spawned countless eons ago within the deepest tainted reservoirs hidden in the foul sewers of Carcosa, the fungal infestation known as Xhamen-Dor, the Inmost Blot, has traveled from world to world for ages untold, infesting reality and returning time and time again to its place of creation to expand the alien city's scope. Full details on this destructive agency of parasitism can be found on pages 62-67.",
			"",
			"Xhamen-Dor is an elephantine mass of fungus and hairlike tendrils capable of assuming any basic form, although its preferred shapes are that of a serpentine creature, a spiderweb-like tangle, or a shuddering carpet of filth.",
			"",
			"### Xhamen-Dor's Cult",
			"",
			"Xhamen-Dor's cult is unusual in that once it becomes active, it spreads slowly until it reaches a tipping point. Then, its seeded minions quickly overtake entire populations. In most worlds where it is worshiped, its cult is small in number and isolated. Xhamen-Dor's places of worship are found in sewers, graveyards, and other shunned places within civilized realms, but in ruined cities they can expand to encompass multiple buildings. Xhamen-Dor grants access to the domains of Death, Evil, Plant, and Trickery and to the subdomains of Decay, Deception, Murder, and Undead. Its favored weapon is the spear.",

			"**Curse of Yig (Su)** Once per round as a free action when he touches or damages a creature with any natural attack, Yig can target that creature with a potent curse. The target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or it takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against poison effects and loses the ability to recover from poison effects naturally (though magical effects that remove poison effects still work). The cursed creature cannot gain the benefit of immunity to poison, be it from a class or racial ability, a magic item, or any other source. As long as it suffers under the curse of Yig, the victim becomes staggered for 1d6 rounds whenever it fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting or poison effect, and any offspring sired or birthed are deformed in some hideous (but mostly cosmetic) fashion. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Devastating (Ex)** All of Yig's natural attacks are primary attacks that add 1-1/2 &times; his Strength modifier to their damage. Yig ignores hardness less than 20 for any object he strikes.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Yig is slain, his body decays as normal, but he does not stay dead for long. He is reborn 3 months after his death, hatching from the egg of a venomous serpent (although not necessarily on the same planet on which his previous incarnation was slain). He spends a year in the form of a venomous (but otherwise normal) snake, after which he sheds his skin and emerges once again as Yig. Typically, Yig does not hold grudges against those who slew him, but this is not always the case.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Serpentine Dreams (Su)** Any creature that has ever willfully harmed a snake, has suffered the effects of the curse of Yig (see above), or has slain one of Yig's clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's serpentine dreams, regardless of the distance between the creature and Yig-even across planar boundaries. In order to use serpentine dreams against a target, Yig must first successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability. If the victim fails its save against nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or take 2d6 points of Intelligence drain in addition to the normal effects of nightmare. When this Intelligence drain would reduce the victim's Intelligence score below 2, the victim is instead transformed (as if via baleful polymorph) into a Tiny venomous snake. This is a mind-affecting polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Ex)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Yig's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become more susceptible to curse effects. The victim takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against curse effects, and the effective DC to remove a curse from such a victim increases by 6. A creature normally immune to curses that is affected by Yig's unspeakable presence can now be affected by curses (but takes no further penalty against curses as a result of the Great Old One's unspeakable presence). This effect lasts for 1 year or until removed by a miracle or wish. If a creature suffering from this effect dies and is brought back to life, there is a 50% chance the effect persists upon the creature's restoration to life.",

			"Of all the Great Old Ones, Yig is without a doubt the most benign. Yet those so foolish as to expect kindness from the so-called Father of Serpents would do well to think again, for Yig does not suffer fools and is as likely to devour those who beseech him for help as he is to provide aid. Even his most devout worshipers realize he may simply wish to feed at times, and on these occasions no amount of devotion can protect a supplicant from death.",
			"",
			"Yig appears as a scaled, humanoid creature with a serpent's head and lashing tail, but he can appear as any serpentine creature if he so wills. In his true form, Yig stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Yig's Cult",
			"",
			"Yig is primarily worshiped by nomadic societies and those who live with a close connection to the land; veneration of him is all but unknown in urban areas. Although Yig often makes his presence known through the actions of serpents, serpentfolk rarely worship him, preferring their own, more sinister deity. Yig's cult is associated with cycles (the cycle of seasons, the cycle of birth and death, and other manifestations of repetition in the natural world), procreation, and serpents, and his sacred symbol is a coiled rattlesnake with a crescent-shaped mark upon its head. His temples rarely take the form of constructed buildings and are often nothing more than a forest clearing, a ring of standing stones, or the mouth of a large cave. Unlike most of the Great Old Ones, Yig tends to take notice of those who worship him. This is, however, as much a bane as it is a boon for those who offer the Father of Serpents worship, for just as he may protect his flock when they are endangered, his retribution for slights is swift, and communities that fail to properly worship him often find their crops failing, their livestock sickened, and their children born with crippling deformities. You can model such unfortunate creatures by applying the mutant creature template. In addition to the normal changes wrought by this template, such mutants invariably bear a unique birthmark somewhere on their body-the crescent moon shape that all of those touched by Yig bear.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Groetus's herald is End's Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected.",
			"",
			"The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus.",
			"",
			"End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like the ocean's tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations.",
			"",
			"Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a difficult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never against mindless creatures or those with animallevel intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again.",
			"",
			"When called by mortals, the herald demands specific deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions.",
			"",
			"When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a specific task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts their presence (and their insanity) as if used to them. On one occasion, it absorbed a servitor into itself, inhaling the creature like smoke, then expelling it a year later with no explanation or apparent harm to the creature.",

			"**Unluck Aura (Su)** Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Gravedragger is a cruel prankster who enjoys murdering innocents in unexpected, horrid, ironic, and tragic ways. In the same way that children fear the mysterious bogeymen, adults cower at the thought of Gravedragger bringing them to a painful end. Unlike Pharasma, who enforces fated and inevitable death, the herald of Zyphus is a break from destiny's plan-a sudden deviation that leads to danger and ruin. Gravedragger appears as a vaguely humanoid mass of grave dirt and bones, and wields a heavy pick made of a rib bone punched through a giant's skull. He also takes the form of an old, thin human man with shifty eyes and a sickening, toothy smile. In this form he is known as \"Grinning Jack,\" often shortened to \"Grinjack.\" Gravedragger speaks in a high, mad voice, and is prone to outbursts of cackling even when cloaked by invisibility.",
			"",
			"Divinations by the faithful show that Gravedragger was once a mortal farmer. When his wife and family fell ill with a sickness, he traveled to the nearest village to get aid from the healer. When he returned with a curative potion, he found that his home had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground; his family, too sick to crawl out, had perished in the fire. The man's mind snapped, broken by the idea that he could have prevented his loved ones' random and pointless deaths if he hadn't been away from home. He embraced the cult of Zyphus and began studying magic, using his abilities to stalk and kill clerics of rival faiths as well as to ambush adventurers to slay them in their sleep or after difficult battles. After a long, successful life at this morbid career, he died in his sleep, and in Zyphus's realm he was infused with divine power and became the god's herald. Remorseless and vindictive, Gravedigger now enjoys his role as the bringer of bad luck and the foil of fate, and every death he causes buries a little bit deeper the guilt he feels for his family's deaths.",
			"",
			"Although Gravedragger enjoys lurking in graveyards, where he can easily use his bury alive ability, he isn't a harbinger of deserved deaths and is bored by the idea of dispatching wounded soldiers-something he feels is the job of psychopomps. Instead, Gravedragger revels in unexpected methods of murder, such as causing a fallen armored knight to drown in a couple inches of mud after being pulled from his horse.",
			"",
			"The herald uses invisibility and greater invisibility to sneak up on his targets and afflict them with curses or blindness, blow them off cliffs (with gust of wind or telekinesis), call sudden bolts of lightning, or create symptomless deaths (using slay living). He might attack from invisibility for 1 or 2 rounds, then leave if he fails to kill anyone quickly-his interest is in spontaneity and sudden death, not extended battle. He usually employs these tactics even if tasked with slaying a specific person, as it's more entertaining to him to set up an elaborate ambush than to confront his opponent directly. Sometimes he's content to just follow his prey unobserved, creepily breaking the silence with his tittering laugh and unnerving the victim so much that it stumbles into a natural trap or flees in terror toward a wild creature's lair.",
			"",
			"Created from a mortal soul and raised to his station by a god, Gravedragger is sustained by divine power and like other outsiders has no need to eat or drink. However, he has often been seen hovering over a dead or dying victim, inhaling deeply as if sucking out remnants of the mortal's soul. He claims these breaths sustain him in place of food or air, but there's no evidence that he actually needs to do this; the habit is probably just some perverse torture intended to unnerve his victims in their last moments. When in his Grinjack form, he often pretends to be a Pharasmin priest, administering false last rites to doomed mortals just to enjoy the sound of their death rattles.",
			"",
			"While Gravedragger's physical body appears to be composed of nonliving materials, he's a living creature and this appearance is only his outer \"skin.\" When damaged, he bleeds red blood, pungent yellow bile, and-if the wound is large enough-dismembered humanoid body parts such as hands, limbs, and heads. As he doesn't eat, these parts are probably physical manifestations of the countless lives he has taken in the name of Zyphus. Immortal and able to recover from severe wounds, he would rather escape a fight than allow himself to die, for he has felt death as a mortal and has no desire to repeat the experience.",

Left unsupervised to perform whatever murderous mischief he pleases, Gravedragger visits Golarion to enact petty revenge, blasphemous murders, and countless \"accidental\" deaths.",

			"The herald sometimes associates with various daemons who help him effect these structured accidents, particularly hydrodaemons (death by drowning), leukodaemons (death by plague), meladaemons (death by starvation and thirst), and crucidaemons (death by traps). In the mortal world, Gravedragger has a fondness for pugwampis and trickster fey, especially bogeymen, and has been known to guide their efforts or even transport them over long distances to save them from extermination or help them to find new victims. He sometimes sneaks into a city in his Grinjack form carrying a sack of pugwampis and releases them upon an unsuspecting urban population, cackling glee as he watches the aftermath."

			"",
			"**Summon Boulders (Su)** Great Elder Iuu can summon three adamantine throwing rocks as a swift action. If thrown, the rocks disappear at the end of his turn. Any rocks leaving his grasp otherwise disappear immediately.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Great Elder Iuu is one of the first stone giants ever to set foot upon the mountains of Golarion, and one of the stone giants' first tribal elders. After he died at the age of 888, Minderhal brought him to Stonepeak for a century of paradise and crafting, then elevated him to serve as the god's herald. Minderhal sends Iuu to the mortal world in times of great trouble or change for the stone giant people, or to put an end to conflicts between tribes.",
			"",
			"Iuu looks like an exceptionally tall, handsome, and wise elder stone giant with crystals sprouting from his head like a crown and a cloak of heavy moss. His weapon is Anfaru (meaning \"Mountain from the Sky\"), an adamantine-laden stone meteorite he carved over the course of 100 years into a hammer shape. Iuu has a deep, booming voice that can shatter mortar when he's angry. His crystal crown and unusual weapon have sometimes led ignorant members of lesser races to mistake him for a stone giant king.",
			"",
			"Iuu uses his magical abilities to enhance, protect, and support himself and his mortal allies. Having been in countless battles against various creatures, he is a competent tactician; he quickly reacts to specific threats or enemy abilities and determines how to best use the available terrain and resources to overcome threats. When he gives orders, he expects other giants to obey immediately and without question. He believes in the inherent strength of his people, and although he is evil, he's unwilling to sacrifice their lives in risky gambits unless the survival of all the stone giants is at stake. He thinks little of smaller races and is indifferent to the \"degenerate\" giant races (which, according to some stone giant lore, includes all other races of giants).",
			"",
			"Iuu was born a mortal giant, and although he doesn't have to eat, he still has a strong attachment to the traditional foods and beverages of his people. When summoned to the Material Plane by those with means, he expects a great feast to be prepared for him, and he honors his hosts by participating. If those who call him are impoverished, he treats whatever meager food they offer as if it were a fine meal, and limits what he eats so others don't go hungry.",
			"",
			"Iuu does not need to sleep, and although he needs to breathe, that becomes an issue only if he is forced underwater or buried alive-in which case he can use magic such as dimension door or meld into stone to escape or compensate for the hazard.",
			"",
			"As with mortal stone giants, Iuu's flesh appears to be made of rock, but he is a creature of flesh and blood. His flesh is much harder than normal stone, but when injured, he bleeds red. Having already lived a full mortal life once, he doesn't fear death, especially if his dying better serves Minderhal or the stone giant race as a whole. At worst, he would experience regret that he would not share another song or teach another student about the traditional ways of giantkind.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Herald](monster/family/herald)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Great Elder Iuu spends decades at a time in a catatonic slumber deep within Minderhal's realm, and nearly as much time crafting weapons for the god's other servitors and building architecture for the realm itself. After one of his deep sleeps, it's customary for new petitioners and servitors of the god to seek him out and gain his blessing. Many in Stonepeak determine their seniority by how many cycles of Iuu's waking and sleeping they have been present for.",
			"",
			"Iuu enjoys teaching others-whether mortals, petitioners, or outsiders-about crafting and the early history of the giant race, using ancient songs to convey these tales to eager ears. He is pleased when a student learns the songs he teaches, but becomes stern if his pupil accidentally or intentionally alters the words or cadence of the song. If he hears an altered version of a song or tale from another, he interrupts, insisting the raconteur tell it the right way and honor its proper, orthodox form.",
			"",
			"Iuu is respectful toward shrines and priests of Estig (the stone giants' name for Erastil), Fandarra, and spirits of ancestors and stone. He doesn't allow followers of Urazra to speak in his presence-the first offense merits a verbal rebuke; the second, a beating; and the third, a beating followed by tribal exile.",
			"",
			"Many mortal giants are related to Iuu through the countless generations extending back to the origin of their race. Stone giants of all tribes award him great respect as a powerful, wise, and noteworthy hero-ancestor-even those of tribes that don't worship Minderhal or that disagree with the herald's beliefs. When a stone giant exemplifies many of the god's ideal traits, members of the tribe often consider that giant a spiritual incarnation of Iuu, as if the herald granted the leader a portion of his own spirit at birth, destining that child for greatness.",
			"",
			"When he visits the mortal world, Iuu typically travels with other stone giants; it's very rare that he's encountered alone. Usually, his companions are members of the tribe he came to the Material Plane to help. However, in rare cases, the giants who accompany him are his \"proud children\"-worthy petitioners temporarily given mortal bodies in the form of fiendish stone giants. These companions give Iuu many hands to accomplish tasks that, even with his great strength and knowledge, would be difficult to handle alone."

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Latten Mechanism is a defender of constructs and crafters, a living siege engine who prefers the solitude of research and invention to the distractions of battle. Given a massive insectile form to allow it to perform all of its necessary functions, Latten Mechanism's only humanlike feature is the androgynous face built into the top of its insectile head. Able to tear open castle gates, create iron walls, scoop up enemies and crush them in its body, reshape the very earth it stands on, and form complex objects out of raw materials or thin air, Latten Mechanism is a versatile engine of creation and destruction guided by a mechanical conscience that values constructs as much as it does intelligent living creatures.",
			"",
			"The herald sees itself as a protective parent of all constructs, especially intelligent ones, and never uses its powers to destroy artificial beings unless it has no other choice; it prefers to neutralize or sideline these opponents until it has the opportunity to reprogram or repurpose them. Much as a true champion of freedom loathes charm spells for temporarily enslaving a person's free will, Latten Mechanism believes spells such as control construct are a violation of a sentient construct's free will, and only uses them as a last resort to peacefully end a threat. When confronted by a dangerous construct in an enemy's service, Latten Mechanism has been known to render the construct helpless and flee with it, returning to deal with the construct's master at a later time. The herald is a legend among intelligent constructs, and many come to Brigh's faith after witnessing or experiencing its generosity and leniency.",
			"",
			"The herald doesn't speak in battle, as it prefers to fool its opponents into mistaking it for a mindless clockwork foe. Outside of combat, it's curious about its allies' inventions and crafting projects, and it can provide many insights into how the ally might overcome various obstacles to achieve greater successes (although it sometimes needs a few minutes to update its mind with knowledge suitable for the conversation). It can speak equally well out of its termite or humanoid mouth, and sometimes uses both in the same conversation, adding deep emphasis to certain words with its inhuman vocal apparatus. Both voices have a metallic, echoing twang.",
			"",
			"The herald's proper name is Latten Mechanism, although it answers to either part of its name individually, or even if its name is used as a title (\"the Latten Mechanism\"). Its programming allows it to recognize flattery, insults, and threats, although it doesn't really understand the motivations for such things. The easiest way to anger it is to treat it like an unfeeling, unthinking machine or suggest that it could be parceled into useful parts (in the same way that a dragon would object to a casual discussion of how its hide could be made into armor).",
			"",
			"Latten Mechanism is a created being that has no need to eat or drink. Though it has a need for occasional maintenance to prevent its delicate mechanical parts from seizing up or breaking down, it's effectively immortal. It has no need to reproduce, but it treats all constructs it builds (even the temporary ones) as beloved pets, and is saddened if they are damaged, destroyed, or otherwise compromised. It feels kinship toward mortals who create constructs, so long as those creators are respectful toward their inventions.",
			"",
			"The herald has no particular attachment to any mortal race or country, although it has spent more time among humans and the people of Alkenstar than any other kind or place. It holds neither aversion nor affinity to undead creatures-it considers reusing dead body parts to create new entities essentially similar to reusing metal or wood from a destroyed construct to repair or build another.",
			"",
			"Because it became self-aware only when Brigh built it out of inanimate parts, it has no fear of death-for it, death is the same as the state of non-consciousness it existed in before its activation. If it was destroyed, but Brigh needed its abilities once more, the goddess would recreate and reawaken it; from the herald's perspective, this wouldn't even be an interruption of its consciousness.",
			"",
			"Latten Mechanism has a fondness for small clockwork objects and wind-up toys, such as rolling carts, hopping animals, and music boxes. It collects these treasures much the way noble's child might collect elaborate dolls. A priest who offers such a thing as part of a payment when the herald is called is likely to gain the herald's support, especially if the device features a clever mechanism, such as a dragon toy that utilizes a smokestick to create a miniature breath weapon, or a mechanical spider that utilizes a tanglefoot bag to catch bugs with tiny bursts of sticky webbing.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Herald](monster/family/herald)",
			"",

			"",
			"The herald spends most of its time on Axis mixing with Brigh's other servitors and pursuing its own research projects. It enjoys the company of axiomites and inevitables, respecting their non-biological anatomies and ever curious about their devotion to law. It sometimes directly intervenes in the mortal world by soothing a rampaging construct that might accidentally kill a genius inventor, but otherwise limits its interactions to those commanded by Brigh.",
			"",
			"Among the servitors of Brigh, Latten Mechanism is admired for its crafting skills and devotion to all artificial creatures. Some servitors who become melancholy and long to become true flesh beings seek counsel from the herald, hoping to gain a better appreciation of their mechanical bodies and the uniqueness of their souls."

			"",
			"**Constitution Drain (Su)** Creatures that are hit by the Maw's bite must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. On each successful attack, the herald gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** Any creature slain by the Maw (including those that die from any of its special attacks or disease) rises 1 round later as a bloody skeleton loyal to the herald.",
			"",
			"**Deathless (Su)** The Maw is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing to resume healing it thereafter. The Maw can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with 20 vials of holy water.",
			"",
			"**Desecrate (Sp)** The bonuses from the Maw's constant desecrate spell-like ability (always centered on it) are calculated into the stats above.",
			"",
			"**Devour Soul (Su)** By using its swallow whole ability, the herald can deal 12d6+18 points of damage to a swallowed creature as if using a slay living spell. A DC 21 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. A swallowed creature must make this save every round on the herald's turn. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the herald's skull (the creature's body is regurgitated immediately as a mangled wreck of shattered bone and chewed meat). The creature cannot be brought back to life until the herald's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. The Maw can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides the Maw with fast healing 20, lasting 1 round for every Hit Die of the devoured soul. The trapped soul gains one permanent negative level for every round it spends within the Maw-these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Spell Deflection (Su)** If any of the following spells is cast at the Maw and overcomes its spell resistance, it instead affects the devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** If a creature cuts its way out of the Maw after being swallowed, the Maw can use swallow whole once its fast healing repairs the damage caused by its prey cutting itself free.",
			"",
			"**True Herald Despite (Ex)** its type and Hit Dice, Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. Despite its type and Hit Dice, it can be conjured using the spell greater planar binding.",
			"",
			"**Vomit Swarm (Su)** Once per round as a free action, the Maw can vomit forth a swarm of maggots (use the statistics for army ants on page 16 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) into a square adjacent to it, after which the swarm moves in a direction of the Maw's choosing. These swarms persist for 10 rounds.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. A disgusting undead creature that comes to the mortal realm at the command of the Pallid Princess, it is an unsubtle thing of ravenous hunger, with little purpose but to kill, eat, and animate corpses as undead. Though it is as brilliant as a lich, its only interests are in satisfy its cravings for sensation.",
			"",
			"The Maw has little interest in the desires of mortals (or of undead in the mortal world) except for how they intersect with Urgathoa's orders. If it is necessary to eat a hundred members of her cult, or to drive an entire city of ghouls into a lava pit, the Maw does it. It can speak but finds little worth talking about, so many assume it is as mindless as an animated skeleton. However, when not on a mission of death, disease, or gluttony, it is a font of knowledge about food, wine, exotic scents, and other strange experiences only an undead creature can understand, and is quite willing to speak on these matters to an interested party-assuming the sight of the enormous talking, winged skull isn't a distraction to listeners.",
			"",
			"Although the Maw normally appears as a bare skull, it sometimes covers itself with its swarms. Whether this is out of a morbid sense of humor or an attempt to remember an old sensation from its life is unknown. It has confirmed that it was once a devourer, and before that a living creature, but it does not give further details.",

			"**Breath of Flies (Su)** Every 1d4 rounds as a move action, Apollyon can exhale a cloud of flies in a 60-foot cone. Those caught in the area take 18d6 points of piercing damage from the bites and are nauseated for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 42 Reflex save takes half the normal damage and negates the nausea effect. Any creature that takes any damage at all from the flies is automatically sickened for 1 minute. The flies linger for 1d4+1 rounds, gathering at the start of Apollyon's next turn into a buzzing 20-foot-square cloud centered on the cone's point of origin. Any creature that ends its turn in this cloud must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or take 9d6 points of piercing damage and become sickened for 1 minute. This cloud of flies can be dispersed by any area effect that deals damage or creates strong or stronger wind. All daemons and apocalypse horses are immune to the effects of breath of flies. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Disease (Ex)** Those bitten by Apollyon risk contracting soul plague, a deadly affliction that causes flesh to rot and drip away and that fills the sufferer with overwhelming despair and nausea. The soul of a creature that dies from soul plague is consigned to Abaddon to become one of the hunted of that realm, regardless of the victim's actual alignment and religion in life. Soul plague can be cured via magic but cannot be cured through normal rest.",

The onset is immediate and this ability affects creatures immune to disease unless they are of demigod or greater stature, though creatures immune to disease gain a +4 bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

Creatures within a 10-foot radius of Apollyon are subject to damage from this swarm. Any creatures in the area occupied by the plague shadow at the end of Apollyon's turn take 5d6 points of swarm damage and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Apollyon has ruled for eons, since he seized his throne and slew all potential rivals following the disappearance of his presumed-dead predecessor. The Horseman of Pestilence is also known as the Prince of Plagues, and rules from his domain of the Plaguemere, a vast realm of swamps, flooded forests, and shallow, acidic oceans. His citadel, the Throne of Flies, is carved from a titanic spinal column and set of ribs, rumored to be those of a dead god of healing or a protean lord slaughtered by the Four and dragged back to Abaddon to feast upon.",
			"",
			"While other horsemen engage in more overt acts of brutality against the mortals of the Material Plane, Apollyon and his servitors focus instead on their distinct form of creation: the crafting of new diseases and plagues capable of doing the daemons' work for them, spreading across the Material Plane in virulent pandemics. Less known is the fact that these acts of creation also extend to artifacts and magical items intended to corrupt their recipients, and even larger metaphysical infestations that work within the goddess of death's system to taint souls and condemn them to Abaddon after judgment.",
			"",
			"Apollyon frequently sends his minions to the Material Plane, and their actions there leave behind contagious diseases long after they're killed or banished. When spreading ever more horrific and virulent plagues, the Horseman is not averse to granting temporary immunity to his mortal cultists in exchange for using them as carriers and living incubators, though this protection is short-lived- eventually, they too fall and their souls are carried to Abaddon amid clouds of corpse flies.",
			"",
			"### Apollyon's Cult",
			"",
			"Apollyon is worshiped by those who carry, suffer from, or use disease, including neutral evil druids, vengeful lepers, wererats and the like. Apollyon also commands the allegiance of a significant portion of the daemon-worshiping urdefhan race. The Prince of Plagues is served by leukodaemons, his deacon servitor race, as well as astradaemons, diseased undead, monstrous rats, nuckelavees, otyughs, piscodaemons, and all manner of vermin. His unholy symbol is a yellow scythe, and the scythe is also his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Air, Darkness, Destruction, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Daemon, Loss, and Night.",

			"",
			"**Curse of Ages (Su)** The first time in a round that Charon strikes a creature with a weapon or a successful touch attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or instantly grow decrepit and feeble, as if the target suddenly became venerable. The target's Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength scores are reduced by 6, but its mental ability scores are not increased. If Charon touches or strikes a venerable target (either a naturally venerable creature or a creature suffering from this effect or a similar magical effect), that creature is subjected to memory loss (see below). Curse of the ages is an aging and a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Memory Loss (Su)** When Charon strikes a creature with a Stygian bolt or touches or strikes a venerable target, he can affect that creature with memory loss. A creature affected by memory loss must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or gain 2 permanent negative levels as swaths of memory are wiped away. These negative levels are a mind-affecting effect but not a negative energy effect. If these negative levels cause the target's total number of negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice, instead of dying the target enters a catatonic state that lasts as long as the negative levels from the Stygian bolts continue to cause its total number of negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Reach of the Styx (Su)** Once per hour as a standard action, Charon can transport himself and any adjacent creatures' such as passengers on his skiff-to any point touched by the River Styx, even if he is not currently on a plane through which it flows, traveling as if via a plane shift spell.",
			"",
			"**Stygian Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, Charon can spit four blasts of Stygian water from his mouth. Each of these Stygian bolts can target a different creature. These attacks are treated as ranged attacks with a range increment of 100 feet. On a hit, a Stygian bolt deals 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and inflicts memory loss.",
			"",
			"**Stygian Bond (Ex)** Charon's regeneration cannot be overcome by any means when he is in physical contact with the River Styx or when he is aboard his skiff while on the River Styx.",
			"",
			"**Transform Mount (Su)** As a swift action, Charon can cause his mount, the Pale Horse, to transform into a skiff that can carry up to four passengers plus himself. He can also transform this skiff back into the Pale Horse as a swift action, in which case he automatically mounts the Pale Horse and any passengers or cargo in the skiff are dumped into adjacent squares.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Charon, the Horseman of Death and Boatman of the Styx, is ancient even by comparison to his kindred Horsemen. Of all the Four, he alone was an original Horseman, the first-and only-Lord of Death. Yet Charon's title obfuscates his true focus: not simply death as a whole, which is the purview of all daemons, but specifically death by old age. Even the most virile mortals must eventually succumb to that looming specter, and in this sense, it's unsurprising that the Boatman remains the most powerful of the Four. Like mortality's inevitable end, Charon's patience is legendary.",
			"",
			"Charon resembles his thanadaemons, and most presume that he modeled them after himself. Charon, however, is so ancient as to have preceded the creation of humanoid life and thus his current form is likely nothing more than a modern guise, with his original form long discarded.",
			"",
			"Daemons in Charon's service range far and wide across Abaddon, often riding the Styx to other reaches of the cosmos, hunting souls in his name. Unlike those of the other Horsemen, Charon's servitors often act in understated and subtle ways, yet they harvest just as many souls as others. When approached independently by a traveler, Charon sometimes simply carries the guest off to be consumed. Other times, however, he makes legitimate deals, though his bargains work toward ends hundreds or thousands of years in the making. Charon's dealings also serve him well in other ways, with even his fellows among the Four often quietly acquiescing to his authority. In the past, Charon has bargained with dying and desperate divinities, archfiends, empyreal lords, and even the populations of entire worlds, offering them aid in return for payments of souls, knowing all the while that the bargainers were beyond saving anyway.",
			"",
			"Charon's domain is the largest of the Four, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the River Styx stretches into or borders the others' realms, the unclaimed wastes, and the planes beyond. Every branch of the Styx ultimately flows back to Charon's citadel, the Drowning Court, which comprises hundreds of mobile islands, ships, and floating castles swirling around a massive central whirlpool.",
			"",
			"### Charon's Cult",
			"",
			"Charon is worshiped by ferrymen and -women, grave robbers, undertakers, the undead, and so very many doomed and damned would-be immortals. The Horseman of Death is served by thanadaemons, his deacon servitor race, along with fiendish krakens, grim reapers, hags, hydrodaemons, river monsters, and numerous varieties of undead. Charon's unholy symbol is a skull with coins over its eye sockets, and the quarterstaff is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Death, Evil, Knowledge, and Water, and to the subdomains of Daemon, Ice, Memory, and Undead.",

This creates a blast of fire that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 41 half). Szuriel can selectively omit creatures from this effect as she chooses, though she rarely does, enjoying the carnage and death of even her own allies. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Affected creatures gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a -2 penalty to AC, and they are compelled to attack the nearest creature regardless of any previous allegiances. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 36 Will save; otherwise, it persists as long as Szuriel remains within line of sight. When the effect ends, an affected creature becomes fatigued. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and does not stack with barbarian rage, the rage spell, or similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

With her ivory skin, flowing golden hair, flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of unsullied silk, and wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high-a veritable goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel's eyes bleed constantly in crimson rivulets that run down her cheeks and fall to the ground. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more befitting a shark or dragon than anything humanoid. Szuriel's greatsword, Lamentation of the Faithless, has been wielded by every Horseman of War dating back to the first, and it is said to be the corrupted blade of an ancient and forgotten empyreal lord.",
			"",

After she was excommunicated for her sins, she became a conquering general and finally a ruling empress who slaughtered the followers of her former faith. Her own death came not on the battlefield but by an assassin's blade, yet this merely opened the greatest chapter in her conquests by propelling her into Abaddon and, in time, the role of the Horseman of War.",
			"",
			"Szuriel makes open mockery of all angels, playing upon their thematic elements in her warped, destructive interactions with mortals, awing both the misguided and those fully cognizant of her nature. Her cults often portray her not as a paragon of destruction, conquest, and genocide, but as promising righteous victory, with the souls of fallen soldiers elevated to paradise regardless of what horrific crimes they commit.",
			"",

			"**Predecessor's Rage (Su)** Trelmarixian consumed the previous Horseman of Famine, and portions of that previous Horseman's essence still exist within Trelmarixian's belly, being slowly digested like a sweet, spiritual lozenge. This previous Horseman was herself a parasitic entity, and once per hour as an immediate action, Trelmarixian can lower his resistance to his predecessor's rage to allow her to infuse him with fury from within. When Trelmarixian does so, he gains the effects of righteous might, and his regeneration increases to 30 for 4 rounds. When this effect ends, Trelmarixian is staggered for 1d4+1 rounds if he fails a DC 35 Fortitude save, or for only 1 round if he succeeds.",
			"",
			"**Ravenous Devourer (Ex)** Trelmarixian's bite attacks always apply 1-1/2 &times; his Strength modifier to his damage.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Su)** Trelmarixian's swallow whole ability is a supernatural ability that can affect Huge or smaller creatures, despite the fact that Trelmarixian is only Medium. His stomach functions similarly to an extradimensional space and can hold any number of creatures. If Trelmarixian swallows an object that contains an extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding or a portable hole), that object cannot be opened while it is within the Horseman of Famine's belly, but it does not otherwise interact with his stomach in a destructive way.",
			"",
			"**Wail of the Consumed (Su)** Trelmarixian can, as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, call upon the tattered fragments of the innumerable souls he has consumed to unleash a mind-shattering wail. This affects all creatures within a 60-foot spread. Affected creatures take 1d10 points of Wisdom drain and are stunned for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at a DC 36 Will save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and is staggered for 1 round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The youngest but perhaps most ambitious of the Four, Trelmarixian the Black obsesses over soul consumption, riding the line between brutal, amoral science and quasi-religious zealotry. A perpetually ravenous shapeshifting horror, Trelmarixian maintains a three headed humanoid shape-but only just, with his frame constantly shuddering and shifting and threatening to slump into a protoplasmic slurry of bile, blood, and mucus. Trelmarixian was once a meladaemon himself, and his meladaemon servitors, while always emaciated and bestial, have become more canine in appearance under his rule. When the so-called Lysogenic Prince rose to power, he overthrew and consumed his predecessor, but he maintains a fragment of her existence within him to fuel periodic bouts of parasitic rage.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian embodies not only starvation, but also the broader concept of wasting, both physical and metaphysical, particularly the lingering dooms of cancer, parasitism, and spiritual decay. Like the viral afflictions he represents, the Horseman of Famine behaves like his chosen concept in a concrete manner, having secretively inserted fragments of his physical form into many of his servitors. This bombards him with sensory information on a truly maddening scale, and thus Trelmarixian's fragmented mind brims with insanity and a multitude of voices, including that of his predecessor. He still adores her in his own fashion, and she in turn speaks to him, advising as she sees fit or mocking his shortcomings like an aggressive, self-aware conscience. By force of will, he can silence the voices, but the thing that haunts him more than any of these cannot be so easily dismissed. Most daemons retain only fractured, fragmented recollections of their mortal life. Trelmarixian, on the other hand, remembers everything save for the last few minutes of his life. As a mortal, daemon-blooded tiefling, Trelmarixian exterminated all life on his world with a work of profound sorcery, but in doing so he condemned himself to starvation. Near the moment of his agonizing death, he recalls someone talking to him, asking him questions and mocking his success as paltry compared to what awaited him after death. Despite his destruction of everyone he had ever known in life, someone was there, and he cannot remember that person's face or final words.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian's memories haunt him still, as does the question of whose blood his soul carried, and thus who may still have some unknown claim on him, such as a long-dead Horseman of Famine. He's likewise haunted by the notion that he was born to be the vector for his progenitor's return-one virus within another, waiting and incubating, to someday express itself and snuff him out as he did his own predecessor.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian's domain, the Withered Court, is a realm of biological and metaphysical horrors, towers spun from flesh and bone with mortal souls used like living, screaming bricks, each mournfully crying out in the constant pangs of starvation. In this realm of horrors, his servitors devour as much as they craft, warping souls into nightmarish wonders while their master continues his nihilistic work within his citadel, the miles-high Weeping Tower.",
			"",
			"### Trelmarixian's Cult",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian is worshiped by all those touched by famine and the broader concept of wasting, including evil druids, gryphs, hungry ghosts, and victims of starvation. Trelmarixian also holds the allegiance of many of the daemon-worshiping and daemon-created urdefhan race. The Lysogenic Prince is further served by astradaemons, derghodaemons, fiendish jackals and jackal monsters, ghouls, scavengers, vampires, vermin, and wendigos, but also by those who have been driven to madness or cannibalism by starvation.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian's unholy symbol is a jackal skull viewed from the side as it clutches a solar eclipse in its jaws, and the spiked gauntlet is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Earth, Evil, Madness, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Daemon, Decay, Insanity, and Seasons.",

			"",
			"The ambitious Gnargorak always hungered for power and status, but he didn't aspire to be Jarl of all Jarls until Winter's Heart came into his grasp. The sword whispered dreams of greatness to Gnargorak, of lordship over all frost giants. The first obstacle to establishing his regime was the ancient silver dragon Lanargix, long a thorn in the side of frost giants throughout the Tusk Mountains. Jarl Gnargorak filled her hide with a dozen arrows before meeting her in melee, sword to claw. With the dead dragon's horns adorning his staff, Gnargorak proclaimed himself the chosen of Thremyr and high jarl of all frost giants, in the Tusk Mountains and beyond. Now, a full score of Tusk Mountain jarls openly swear fealty to Gnargorak. Others placate him, lest they draw his wrath. Only the jarl's lack of focus and unceasing need to conquer keeps him from uniting the remaining giants of the Tusks under one banner.",
			"",
			"The skulls of those who dared dispute his sovereignty line the path to his mountain fortress of Bos-Phargrumm (see page 33). He rarely sets foot in this ice castle, as raiding the hated Mammoth Lords brings him far more pleasure than consolidating his rule. The towering citadel that reaches into the clouds stays busy even without its ostensible owner sitting upon its massive, ornate throne. Jarl Gnargorak's cloud giant harem lives there, serving as his advisors, maintaining the treasuries, collecting taxes from lands Gnargorak has claimed, and negotiating with the tribes on the jarl's behalf. They grow tired of this work, as the jarl is far more interested in conquering new territory than in ruling over that which he holds.",
			"",
			"Winter's Heart also grows weary of Gnargorak's lack of dedication to building a true empire. Of late, the sword has denied the jarl its greater powers except in times of dire need. It constantly searches for another potential leader to bear it and use it to impose rule over the north. Of course, the jarl never lets Winter's Heart leave his presence, so the sword's options are limited. The artifact is unattended only while the jarl is in his personal chambers, where he feels he's safe. But one of his harem has communicated with the sword and sympathizes with its goals. She watches for the best candidates, and invites them to Bos-Phargrumm on false pretenses so she can weigh their acumen. She and Winter's Heart haven't found a suitable leader among the frost giants; there's no shortage of ambition among their kind, but no tribal leader has half the experience or cunning Gnargorak does.",
			"",
			"Though other frost giants admire and fear Jarl Gnargorak's prowess in battle, they view his harem of cloud giants with private derision and a touch of envy. Even given the jarl's imposing 16-foot stature, his brides all stand noticeably taller than he. Gnargorak prizes his exotic harem, and eagerly anticipates the birth of a son surely destined to be the mightiest frost giant in all the Tusks. Yet despite his many brides, the jarl's seed has yet to bear fruit. His displeasure over this continued lack of an heir drives him to ever more brutal raids against the Mammoth Lords so that he can at least leave a legacy of conquest and make a mark for all to see in the histories of the north-even if there would be no one of his own blood to take over his domain.",
			"",
			"Jarl Gnargorak leads a veritable army, but because he started out as a hunter, not a soldier, he uses his forces in unconventional ways that suit the tactics he learned in the wild. Rather than simply leading an overwhelming force directly into battle against the Mammoth Lords, he draws the warriors' attention away from the safety of their followings and into his snares and ambushes. Only when a group is weakened does he sweep in to destroy them.",

			"**Blinding Flash (Su)** By spreading her wings as a full-round action while she stands upon the ground, Agyra can create a blinding flash of light that targets all creatures within 100 feet. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a -4 penalty on both-the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death-any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Electrified Corpse (Su)** If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first.",
			"",
			"**Hurricane (Sp)** Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as control weather, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius.",
			"",
			"**Rebirth (Su)** Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a true resurrection spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery.",
			"",
			"**Storm Flier (Ex)** Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds.",
			"",
			"**Swift Flight (Su)** As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin.",
			"",
			"**Thunderous Blast (Su)** When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined-resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 41 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Agyra, the Forever Storm, is believed by many cultures to be the cause of seasonal typhoons or other great storms' such tempests being a manifestation of Agyra's monstrous breaths as she exhales during her long slumber every season. While this kaiju is not in fact responsible for the world's storms, her powers over wind and lightning are significant, and when she is vexed to rampage, the effects of her hurricanes can be as devastating to a region as her more direct attacks.",
			"",
			"Agyra has the appearance of a primeval, two-headed flying reptile with a wingspan of over 150 feet. Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances.",
			"",
			"Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers' travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature-and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She's been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island's inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers' destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves-they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju's vengeful wrath in this situation.",
			"",
			"There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives' ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island.",
			"",
			"Agyra has a particular hatred of the kaiju Mogaru, and often leaves her volcanic lair to fly west to the remote jungle lake that serves as Mogaru's home to clash with her nemesis. Mogaru's penchant for attacking coastal cities often results in a devastating escalation when Agyra arrives to do battle with the land-bound kaiju. Sometimes, methods of conjuring Agyra are used to deliberately lure the kaiju to a city besieged by Mogaru, but just as often her arrival seems to be driven by self-interest. Agyra typically manages to weaken Mogaru enough to drive him off, but is often slain herself in these battles, resurrecting and returning to her home at the same time Mogaru returns to his. The nature of this rivalry is unclear, but kaiju scholars believe that the two monsters have been enemies for longer than humanity has existed.",

			"**Burrowing Charge (Ex)** Once per minute, Bezravnis can make a charge attack while burrowing through loose earth, sand, mud, or magma, or through any other loosely packed earth or stone. When Bezaravnis reaches the target, it erupts from the ground as part of its attack. If Bezravnis hits the target of its burrowing charge attack, it deals double damage with its attack. Any creatures standing in or flying less than 50 feet above the space Bezravnis occupies at the end of this charge are immediately subjected to Bezravnis's trample attack. Any buildings entirely within this space take double damage from the trample attack (4d8+54 points)-this damage bypasses hardness. In addition, Huge or smaller creatures must succeed at a DC 40 Reflex save or be buried in earth, as if by a cave-in or collapse. This bury zone extends into all squares affected by Bezravnis's reach.",
			"",
			"**Heat Beam (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC 40 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Su)** Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; cure 3 consecutive saves. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered.",
			"",
			"**Web (Ex)** Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it. This ability otherwise functions the same as the universal monster ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bezravnis, known also as the Inferno Below, dwells in the sands of a sparsely inhabited high-altitude desert found in the shadow of the world's largest mountain range. There, the 130-foot-long beast slumbers the centuries away until its cycle of wakefulness rouses it from its torpor and causes it to emerge from the sands in an eruption of fire and ash. The Inferno Below then begins its rampage, traveling in a straight line toward a heavily populated region bordering the great desert. Typically, the Inferno Below's rampage is limited to a single city, and never the same one twice in a row. After destroying no less than two-thirds of the city, it retreats back to the vast desert, burrows deep, and settles into a new sleep of ages.",
			"",
			"The reason for the Inferno Below's cyclic rampages is not well understood, but the cycle of these rampages functions like clockwork-they take place every 273 years with little deviation. As there seems to be no pattern to the kaiju's attacks themselves, with a different city being targeted each cycle, the cities of the bordering nations do their best to prepare for the monster's attack. The nations themselves have little love for each other, and attempts to generate lures to direct the kaiju's march toward an enemy city are common-yet these lures have yet to work, and in fact they seem to result in the kaiju attacking a city in the luring nation more often than not. Other cities spare no expense during a so-called \"Inferno Season,\" and send huge armies of scouts into the desert to watch for signs of the kaiju's emergence or traces of its burrowing passage through the sands, in hopes of determining the direction of the beast's travel and warning likely target cities (or, in the case of a trajectory that leads it to an enemy city, working to silence warnings).",
			"",
			"Kaiju scholars have correlated Bezravnis's appearance with the passage of a singular red comet in the skies above the world-an astronomical event known as the Inferno Star. As the comet nears the world, Bezravnis emerges, and as the comet vanishes from the sky, the kaiju turns its back and returns to the desert. Confirmation of this correlation has given rise to numerous theories. Some believe that Bezravnis first fell to the world from the Inferno Star, and its advent wakens within the beast a bewildered longing for home that drives it into a frenzy. Others hold that the kaiju exists as a guardian against an even more deadly occupant of the Inferno Star, and that by displaying its power by destroying a city, Bezravnis is in fact protecting the world by driving the Inferno Star back into the depths of space.",
			"",
			"But Bezravnis doesn't always have the luxury of waiting for the Inferno Star to draw near before waking. At several points in the past, lunatics, cults, and accidents have woken the kaiju before its appointed time. Some mad, apocalyptic-minded spellcasters use powerful magic to cause great explosions above the sands where the kaiju slumbers. Earthquakes, severe weather phenomena, and similar natural events have been known to waken the monster early as well. When Bezravnis wakens off-cycle like this, the monster is particularly foul-tempered. It's rampage does not follow a straight line-instead, its travels are erratic as it pursues the perceived cause of its wakening with single-minded ferocity and tenacity. In this way, cults have accomplished what the border nations have not-leading the kaiju to attack an enemy. Of course, such tactics are dangerous and often backfire, for Bezravnis is fast and destructive, and it has been known to follow such tormenters.",
			"",
			"Bezravnis doesn't seem to be particularly vexed by the presence of other kaiju, and ignores them unless it is attacked first. Once attacked, however, the Inferno Below becomes singularly focused and deviates from its path to fight the target creature as long as it remains visible or alive. Smaller foes can sometimes distract the kaiju from its path in this manner if they can deal enough damage upon the creature to bait it into directing its furious rage on them.",

			"**Absorb Energy (Ex)** Mogaru absorbs energy attacks that damage him, including negative energy attacks. Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC 42 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover-cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Firebolts (Su)** As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object.",
			"",
			"**Reflexive Breath (Ex)** The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC 32 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a -10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack.",
			"",
			"**Sense Kaiju (Su)** Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using discern location, at will.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Song (Ex)** Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast suggestion on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a suggestion spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mogaru, known as the Final King to kaiju scholars, or simply as King Mogaru, is one of the most destructive of his kind. Although not the most powerful kaiju (a sobering thought in and of itself ), Mogaru is certainly the most active of the known kaiju. Additionally, Mogaru seems to be as eager to rampage through the works of humanity as he is to attack and kill other kaiju, making him something of a mixed blessing to kaiju-threatened cities. While the prospect of an attack by Mogaru is the stuff of nightmares, the possibility of his intervention during a different kaiju attack is the stuff of hope, though the damage dealt to a city during its defense may be significant. Mogaru appears as a towering dinosaur with twin tails, spines that glow red as he uses his breath weapon, and two powerful clawed forearms.",
			"",
			"King Mogaru dwells in the depths of a tropical jungle, sleeping silently at the bottom of an unusually deep lake until roused. Legends hold that Mogaru was born of the world itself, either formed from the spirits of countless plants and animals resulting from ages of hunting and predation by humanoids for food or sport, or formed from the souls of the countless slain in an ancient apocalypse or war that devastated one of the first of the world's empires. Regardless of the actual cause, the birth of Mogaru in these legends seems to be the same-soon after another kaiju, Lord Varklops, emerged from an erupting volcano, Mogaru rose to oppose the Thrice-Headed Fiend in a vast battle that nearly slew Varklops while devastating an entire nation in the process. Mogaru is also rumored to have slain no fewer than a dozen other kaiju, including Agmazar the Star Titan, now believed to be the only undead kaiju in existence.",
			"",
			"Of particular note is the curious fact that Mogaru exhibits a particularly unique interest in song. Legends of skilled singers being able to save their cities with a single mournful paean to the kaiju, or of vengeful bards using their craft to waken the monster from his lair to send him on a rampage are common along coastal regions with a history of kaiju attacks, and in such regions renowned singers are well respected for this ability to influence one of the world's most destructive creatures. Kaiju scholars suspect that song manages to penetrate Mogaru's memories of some primeval event, but the reasons for the kaiju's reaction to the song are its own.",

			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Each of Varklops's three heads can exhale a blast of searing fire and billowing ash in a 1,200-foot line once every 4 rounds. Each head's breath weapon is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju can exhale one line of fire as a move action, two lines as a standard action, or three lines as a full-round action. Each breath weapon deals 20d6 points of fire damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area of effect as they are barraged with semi-solid chunks of superheated rock and magma expelled in the torrent of fire; targets are also stunned for 1 round by the overwhelming force. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, a creature takes half damage and negates the stun effect. If Varklops exhales more than one breath weapon, he can use them in different directions. If a creature is subjected to more than one breath weapon in a round in this manner, it takes damage from and must attempt separate saves against each breath weapon. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Deflect Cold (Ex)** Although Varklops is vulnerable to cold damage, he can shield himself from a cold attack by reflexively curling his wings around himself as an immediate action when he would otherwise take cold damage. He must choose to use this ability before any cold damage from the attack is applied and before he attempts any applicable saving throws to resist the cold damage, but he can wait until after the attack hits to choose to deflect cold. When he uses this ability, all cold damage from that particular attack is ignored. At Varklops's discretion, he can deflect the cold damage to any single adjacent creature, which is then instead treated as the target of the cold attack. If the cold attack was an area effect that also affected the adjacent creature, that creature does not take the cold damage twice, but does need to attempt two saving throws (if applicable) against the effect, taking the worse of the two results as the actual result.",
			"",
			"**Devastating (Ex)** Varklops is particularly devastating, and any attack or special ability he uses to deal damage to an object ignores hardness less than 20. Objects take full damage from his fire-based attacks.",
			"",
			"**Distracted When Outnumbered (Ex)** While Varklops is furiously focused on slaying kaiju, his rudimentary intellect supports a surprisingly powerful and inflated sense of selfworth that crumbles when he faces overwhelming odds. In any combat round that involves two allied kaiju focusing their efforts against him, Varklops loses his kaijuslayer ability and becomes so distracted by which target to focus on that he must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or become staggered for that round. Non-kaiju cannot distract Varklops in this manner, even if the non-kaiju is similar in size to a kaiju.",
			"",
			"**Eruption (Su)** Up to three times per day (but no more than once every 4 rounds) as Varklops emerges onto the surface of terrain after burrowing, he does so with an explosion of ash and magma. All creatures within 150 feet of Varklops when he bursts out of the ground in this manner take 20d6 points of fire damage. Huge or smaller creatures in this area are knocked prone. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, creatures take half the damage and negate being knocked prone, but a creature that takes any damage from this eruption is subjected to Varklops's burn ability. In addition, the eruption creates a cloud of ash in the area of effect; this cloud of ash lingers in the area for 1 minute, obscuring vision as per obscuring mist. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Fire Monsoon (Su)** Once per day as Varklops moves at full speed while flying, he can rain down a torrential storm of fire, burning any target up to 300 feet below him. All targets Varklops passes over in flight take 20d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 43 half); any creature that takes any damage from this attack is subjected to Varklops's burn ability. The area affected by the fire monsoon continues to burn for 1 minute-any creature that begins its turn in this area takes 4d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Improved Hurl Foe (Ex)** When Varklops hits a creature with his tail slap and uses his hurl foe kaiju ability (see page 305), the distance the foe is knocked back doubles.",
			"",
			"**Kaijuslayer (Su)** Varklops takes particular delight in the slaying of other kaiju, and his aggression causes all kaiju to take a -4 penalty on saving throws against Varklops's special attacks. Another kaiju cannot use recovery to prevent itself from being killed by one of Varklops's attacks. This ability does not function against the kaiju known as King Mogaru.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Lord Varklops is indisputably the most powerful of the known kaiju, a tremendously destructive force of devastation that dwells in the heart of an active volcano in a tropical mountain range when not hunting his favorite prey-other kaiju. Although the fact that Lord Varklops so eagerly hunts and slays kaiju might seem to make him an ally of all civilizations threatened by such creatures, in truth Varklops is also one of the few kaiju to be actively evil in his predations upon the world. When no other kaiju present themselves as victims and the urge to destroy seizes Varklops, the socalled Thrice-Headed Fiend thinks nothing of razing entire cities for his pleasure.",
			"",
			"This eagerness to destroy appeals to apocalypse-minded cultists and to deranged exiles who seek revenge against the cities they were forced to flee. Varklops is known to look favorably upon those who approach him with requests for targeted devastation-particularly if the offer includes the opportunity to attack another kaiju. Varklops has little interest in assaulting civilizations in polar regions, but his greatest weakness is his inflated, if rudimentary, ego.",
			"",
			"When facing multiple kaiju, Varklops often gets distracted and frustrated-a condition that several societies have risked using to their advantage by luring other kaiju to their defense. Of course, the devastation a city might suffer when three or more kaiju fight may well exceed that wrought by Varklops alone, so such desperate actions are not taken lightly.",
			"",
			"Varklops has a particularly strong hatred of King Mogaru, as this kaiju alone can resist Varklops's rage. The reasons for this immunity are unknown, but certainly Mogaru matches Varklops's hatred, and battles between the two kaiju are the stuff of legend. Varklops is 200 feet long and weighs 16,000 tons.",

			"**Absorb Magic (Ex)** When a spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome Vorgozen's spell resistance, it is wholly or partially absorbed by the kaiju. If the spell was an area-effect spell or targeted more than just Vorgozen, it functions normally against other targets and Vorgozen regains a number of hit points equal to double the spell's level. If the spell targeted only Vorgozen, she absorbs the entire spell and regains a number of hit points equal to 10 &times; the spell's level. Whenever Vorgozen absorbs magic in this way, her polluted magic aura grows more powerful (whether or not the absorbed magic healed her of damage); all rolls to determine the effect of polluted magic are modified by +20 for the remainder of the round.",
			"",
			"**Acid Beam (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Vorgozen can unleash a beam of foul acid. This creates a 1,200-foot line of high pressure caustic fluid. All creatures caught in the area of effect take 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage, and are knocked prone. A creature that succeeds at a DC 43 Reflex save takes half damage and avoids being knocked prone. A Huge or smaller creature that is knocked prone is also pushed away from Vorgozen. A Huge creature is pushed back 10 feet, a Large creature 20 feet, a Medium creature 40 feet, and Small or smaller creatures 80 feet. Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Infuse Terrain (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaiju's essence-if the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within the infused region as a swift action, gaining the benefit of a heal spell (CL 20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as per shadow walk. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain.",
			"",
			"**Polluted Magic (Su)** Vorgozen's presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within this area generates a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, roll on the table below to see how Vorgozen's polluting presence hampers or transforms the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected by Vorgozen's polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or supernatural ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen. Likewise, ongoing spell effects or supernatural effects are not polluted when Vorgozen's aura envelops them. Vorgozen's own supernatural abilities never trigger polluted magic effects.",

			"Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world's kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute destruction of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once flying city.",
			"",
			"Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant wizard who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.",

The duration of this clinging frost stacks with multiple instances of cold damage from Yarthoon. As long as a creature has at least 1 round of clinging frost remaining, it takes a -2 penalty on all Reflex saving throws and Dexterity-based skill checks. As long as a creature has at least 2 rounds of clinging frost remaining, it is staggered. Freedom of movement negates the effects of clinging frost, and if a creature activates a fire-based supernatural ability on its turn, it reduces the number of rounds remaining by 1d4.

If she fires the beams as ranged touch attacks, she has a +30 attack bonus but can target a single creature with no more than two eye beams at a time (though she can fire the beams in any direction to attack multiple targets in range). A single eye beam deals 8d6 points of cold damage on a hit (no save). The save DC for the line-based attack is Constitution-based.",

			"**Freezing Mist (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, Yarthoon can exhale a cloud of freezing mist, filling a 200-foot-radius sphere surrounding her. This mist obscures vision as per obscuring mist and persists for 10 rounds, and is not dispersed by moderate wind. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 2d4 rounds, while fireball, flame strike, or similar spells burn away the mist in the spell's area. Any creature within the area of the mist when Yarthoon creates it takes 8d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 38 half). A creature that begins its turn within the mist takes 4d6 points of cold damage (no save) at the start of its turn. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Cold (Su)** When Yarthoon deals cold damage, the damage ignores the first 30 points of cold resistance the target has.",
			"",
			"**Staggering Strike (Ex)** If Yarthoon hits a Gargantuan or smaller foe that's standing on the ground with her slam attack, the target struck must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or be knocked prone and become staggered for 1d6 rounds. If she hits a Gargantuan or smaller flying foe, the creature is staggered for 1d6 rounds and must succeed at a DC 42 Fly check or lose 30 feet of altitude (a winged flying creature loses 60 feet of altitude instead; this replaces the normal rule for being attacked while flying for winged creatures). A Colossal creature struck by Yarthoon's slam must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save to resist being staggered for 1 round, but is not knocked prone or forced to lose altitude. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Starflight (Su)** Yarthoon can survive in the void of outer space. She flies through space at incredible speeds, but generally only does so to travel between the moon and the world below when her attention is caught or her curiosity piqued. It takes Yarthoon only 2d4 hours to travel from the moon to the world below. If she were to travel to a more distant point in the same solar system, she requires only 3d6 days to make the journey, while trips beyond this range generally take her 3d6 weeks.",
			"",
			"**Swift Bite (Ex)** Yarthoon strikes with astonishing speed when she attacks with her bite. Whenever Yarthoon makes a bite attack on her turn, she can attack two times, either as a standard action to bite twice, or as part of a full attack to bite two times in addition to making one slam attack. She can make any number of attacks of opportunity with her bite attack, but does not get to bite more than once when she does so.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Yarthoon is among the least powerful of the kaiju, yet even she is of staggering size and capable of unleashing devastation on an apocalyptic scale. Known as the Moon Grub to kaiju scholars, Yarthoon does indeed dwell upon the moon itself, where she spends much of her time in a frozen reach of ice and snow, created, in part, by her presence and the effects of her freezing breath over the course of centuries. (Note that although Yarthoon's exhalations fill the region with freezing mist, the Moon Grub herself has no need to breathe and can exist comfortably in the vacuum of space.)",
			"",
			"Were Yarthoon content to remain upon the moon, there would be little known about the frozen kaiju; unfortunately, the larger world her home orbits is a constant fascination for her. Indeed, certain events have been known to specifically attract Yarthoon's attention, whether they're intentional calls such as powerful rituals led by apocalyptic cultists, or accidental lures that occur when powerful effects of magical cold occur. The exact nature of these attractions varies, and even the most learned scholars argue over what exactly it is that draws Yarthoon to visit the world. None, however, dispute the devastation Yarthoon unleashes, if unintentionally, when she visits the world. Unlike many kaiju, Yarthoon seems not to purposefully seek out civilizations to destroy, but her immense size and her freezing breath wreak havoc nonetheless. Fortunately, Yarthoon's visits to the world typically last for only a few days before she slithers off into the sky like an eel swimming through water to return to her den on the moon.",
			"",
			"Yarthoon has a complex relationship with Mogaru, the Final King. Often, Mogaru's devastation on a region is enough to lure Yarthoon down from the moon, in which case she often clashes with the more powerful kaiju. Likewise, Mogaru's ability to sense kaiju often results in him coming to investigate a region that Yarthoon has decided to visit. Yet the two kaiju never seem willing to finish a fight against the other, and rather than deliver a death blow when the chance rises, each seems content to let the other flee. The one thing that seems to unite the two kaiju is their shared hatred of Lord Varklops, and the two kaiju have teamed up several times to drive off the three-headed fiend more than once.",
			"",
			"Although Yarthoon is the least powerful of the known kaiju, the Moon Grub has been remarkably resilient. Time and time again, Yarthoon has returned after suffering what seemed to be a complete defeat, at either the hands of powerful heroes or the claws and fangs of fellow kaiju. Scholars of these immense monsters have theorized that Yarthoon may not be a unique creature, and that in its hidden lair on the moon, multiple Moon Grubs writhe and dream. Others posit that Yarthoon is but the larval stage of a kaiju, and that while only one may live at any time, numerous other eggs lie in a hidden creche on the moon, waiting to hatch and release replacement Moon Grubs as needed.",
			"",
			"Yarthoon is 250 feet long from head to tail and weighs 14,000 tons.",

			"**Disease (Su)** Ghoul Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; onset 1 day; frequency 1 day; effect 1d3 Con and 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight; a humanoid with 4 Hit Dice or more rises as a ghast.",
			"",
			"**Exceptional Wealth (Ex)** Kortash Khain has the wealth of a 20th-level PC, rather than an NPC. This increases his CR by 1.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Kortash Khain is the high priest on Golarion of the demon lord Kabriri, the Lord of Everglut. He rules as Priest-King of Nemret Noktoria, a city of bone-white towers where ghouls dwell. His city lies deep in the vaults of Sekamina in the Darklands below Osirion. Kabriri rules over the Abyssal city of Everglut, a cyclopean necropolis inhabited by ghouls and riddled with tunnels. All Kortash Khain's immortal thought is bent on replicating his master's dead city within the living world.",
			"",
			"Though Khain has sent ambassadors to Thuvia, Osirion, and their neighbors to conduct trade negotiations, thoughts of war, insurrection, and murder are never far from his mind. Much of his wrath has been turned against the nearby inhabitants of the Darklands' his purges have largely depopulated Sekamina in the vicinity of his city. A fortunate few are merely dead and devoured-all of the rest have been absorbed into Khain's ever-growing ghoul army.",
			"",
			"Not even the genies of Garund have escaped the Priest- King's capture squads. Many have been defeated and converted by the powers of death into great ghuls, often serving in positions of prominence as atamans, beys, and pashas under Khain's dominion. The most powerful of these are four great ghul oracles called the Quadrate Pillars, each formed from the undead remnant of a genie twisted into serving in death the element that was its opposite in life. A few renegade shaitans have been converted to the worship of Kabriri, and serve Kortash Khain as architects, engineers, and builders in his city. This socalled Blackstone Brotherhood is held in high esteem in Nemret Noktoria not only for its architectural creations but also for its members' prowess as hunters. They infiltrate their genie brethren and lure them into ambushes.",
			"",
			"Kortash Khain and any other clerics or oracles worshiping Kabriri gain several unique options when summoning or creating undead to serve them. They add the following creatures to their summon monster lists: I-fiendish human zombie (standard or fast zombie); II-fiendish ghoul, fiendish plague zombie; III-fiendish ghast; IV-giant fiendish ghast; V-ghul; VI-fiendish ghul, great ghul; VII-fiendish great ghul, fiendish shaitan; VIII-black jinni; IX-fiendish black jinni. When using create undead, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can create a ghul or great ghul from the corpse of a genie rather than creating a mummy (minimum caster level 15th). When creating a ghoul, ghast, ghul, or great ghul with this spell, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can also apply the fiendish template to that creature. This requires the caster to double the normal material component cost or sacrifice a living humanoid as an additional material component of casting the spell."

She reached that lowest point only once, but was lucky enough to catch suitable prey unawares and work her way back to an exhausted but functional level. Consequently, Kurshu makes sure to feed at least every few days.",
			"",
			"As there are few creatures in Lissala's service who have the power to conjure her, Kurshu is mainly left to her own devices, but (unlike heralds of active deities) may choose to respond to a summons from any spellcaster. In exchange for her services, she demands that she be given outsiders she can enslave for later feeding, Thassilonian magic items, or items that bear some lingering piece of Lissala's power. She is knowledgeable about Thassilonian magic, rune magic, and Azlanti practices, though she is hesitant to speak of the latter when on Golarion lest it attract unwanted attention from slaves of the aboleths; having witnessed Earthfall at a distance, she has no desire to subject herself to a direct attack by entities who control that kind of magic.",

She feels her pseudo-mortality at all times and fears death, and is likely to flee any encounter in which she feels outmatched."

			"",
			"**Intelligence Drain (Su)** Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Scholastic Masquerade (Su)** When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated.",
			"",
			"**Spell Reservoir (Su)** Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level.",
			"",
			"**Temporal Anomaly (Su)** Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent.",

Any creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or drop any items they are holding. A saving throw must be made each round that the creature attempts to use or pick up an item it previously dropped.

If the victim fails its save, it enters a sort of half-living state; it becomes completely helpless, unable to take any actions whatsoever, but remains conscious and aware of the world, and of the pain in its body. It cannot be resurrected or otherwise restored to life until the curse is lifted. While the curse remains in effect, the victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain every day as any lingering shreds of sanity are blasted away. When each ability score is drained to zero, the DC of the curse increases by +4. A character suffering the curse of living death can remain in this state forever, but as long as any one of her mental ability scores is at zero, she is capable only of enduring pain and cannot observe the world around her. Even if the character's body is destroyed, the cursed victim's consciousness remains as a disembodied and invisible presence at the site of this destruction, and cannot be resurrected or released to the afterlife.

			"",
			"**Exceptional Wealth (Ex)** Jatembe has the wealth of a 20th-level PC, rather than an NPC. This increases his CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Gifts of the Teachers (Ex)** Old-Mage Jatembe sought the knowledge and assistance of many great powers-from angels to demons to gods-so he could help his people. Among the gifts they bestowed on him were permanent versions of augmented mythic barkskin, mind blank, and shapechange, plus the knowledge and power that allowed him to develop his enhanced divine knowledge ability. These increase his CR by 1.",
			"",
			"**Jatembe's Divine Knowledge (Ex)** Jatembe has a much stronger version of the divine knowledge archmage path ability. He has the following spells on his list of spells known: barkskin, call lightning, entangle, forest friend, lesser restoration, plant growth, speak with animals, and speak with plants.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Preparation (Ex)** Jatembe no longer needs a spellbook to prepare spells. He knows and can prepare any wizard spell from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook that doesn't have the evil descriptor, any spell from pages 28 and 29 of Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths & Philosophies (casting these as though they were wizard spells of the highest level listed in their descriptions), and possibly others as well, including unique ones he's researched.",
			"",
			"**Permanent Spells (Sp)** Through the use of permanency, Jatembe is constantly under the effects of the following spells: arcane sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and telepathic bond (once with each of his Ten Magic Warriors). He is under the effect of a contingency that causes dimension door to come into effect if he's brought below 80 hit points.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"No character looms larger in the myths of the Mwangi tribes than Old-Mage Jatembe. Jatembe rose to prominence in the Age of Anguish, a time when mankind was just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by Earthfall and the destruction of Azlant. Jatembe was the first among humanity to rediscover the art of wizardry and written magic, and did much to redeem these arts in the eyes of a superstitious people. Jatmebe worked tirelessly to stem the tide of barbarism left in the wake of the Age of Darkness, and preserve the learning and culture of his people. He is remembered as a folk hero among the Mwangi, and as a beacon of hope in a darkest of times.",
			"",
			"Little is known about Jatembe's origins. Even in the earliest of myths, he's described as an old man. Some scholars point out parallels between Jatembe's ageless nature and the immortal masters of the lost city of Ird, suggesting that fabled city as his birthplace, though the decadent and cruel lords of Ird have little else in common with him. Later accounts claim Jatembe and his disciples destroyed the city of Ird to punish it for its wickedness, casting doubt on this theory. Other myths connect Jatembe with the druids of the Mwangi Expanse, some even claiming he was an ex-druid himself. True or not, Jatembe did have an affinity for druidic magic, and the magical school he founded-the Magaambya-continues to teach druid spells to this day.",
			"",
			"The details of Jatembe's ascension are similarly occluded by millennia of myth and legend. One popular tale holds that Jatembe learned the deepest mysteries of magic from the severed head of Ydersius before sewing the serpent-god's lips shut. Others claim he gained mythic knowledge from sources among the planes, for many tales tell of his dealings with angels, demons, and other outsiders while in search of ways to protect his people. Still more stories say that Jatembe found some potent artifact amid the ruins of the Mwangi that awakened his mythic potential, and that he departed Golarion once the strength of this artifact had faded.",
			"",
			"Prior to his mysterious departure, Jatembe performed many astonishing deeds. The first of these was the gathering of his disciples, the Ten Magic Warriors. These men and women were known only by the golden animal masks they wore, having forsaken their identities in service to Jatembe and his quest. With their help, Jatembe explored the ancient ruins that dot the Mwangi Expanse, uncovering ancient magical secrets and treasures. He founded the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya arcane academy to preserve and share knowledge and wealth with future generations, and to protect the Expanse from further devastation such as that wrought by the Earthfall. In later days, Jatembe fought and defeated the twisted sorcerer known as the King of Biting Ants, who claimed to possess a weapon that would allow him to eat the sun and cast the world into darkness.",
			"",
			"For reasons unknown, Jatembe departed Golarion; if anyone knows where he left to, they're silent on the matter. Some believe he left to fulfill obligations to the beings who granted him mythic power, and others think a magnificent spell took him. He left his Ten Magic Warriors behind to rule in his place, and forged the Ring of Nine Facets to aid them in his absence. He has created and used other artifacts in his travels, but gave them all away to allies, keeping only the beacon of true faith that one of his patrons gave him."

The Oliphaunt can prevent a gate or similar effect from opening inside Jandelay's borders unless the effect was created by an artifact or cast by a mythic character. If brought outside Jandelay, the Oliphaunt attempts a Will saving throw each day to return. The DC is equal to the DC of the spell that transported it, or the DC that spell would have if it allowed a saving throw. The return of the Oliphaunt triggers a magical punishment on those that stole it, laying waste to people and land. Centered on the point from which the Oliphaunt just departed, the ward triggers a mass hold monster spell targeting all creatures in a 5-mile radius. Then, that area is affected by an earthquake and storm of vengeance that last 1d12 months. While in Jandelay, the Oliphaunt's dimensional lock aura extends to protect the entire realm.",

Her innate gifts with wind and air emerged at a young age, but with them came the first hints of a darker fate. When the initial signs of her oracular curse made themselves apparent, many of her fellow tribespeople thought her to be plagued by some great evil. The merest hint of danger was enough to send the skittish child into a frenzy of words and phrases that she had no way of learning. With the pain of rejection first came bashfulness, which slowly evolved into utter hatred. Turning her back on her tribe, she abandoned her parents' cause to gather her own legion of followers among the evil cloud giants. She only returned once, nearly a century after leaving, to burn her home to the ground, torching the citadel and all the benevolent cloud giants within, including her parents.",
			"",
			"Now an adult in the fullness of her power, Orania no longer has to fight her own battles, instead sending her minions into combat for her, minions who see her frightful curse of tongues not as a hindrance, but as a god-given gift. Along with her army of cloud giant and mihstu servants, she has traveled along the western side of the Shattered Range for years in search of the fabled floating cloud giant city that lies somewhere within the rocky crags. She has been obsessed with the idea of floating cloud giant castles since she was a child, and sees in these mythic sky towers the means to forever rid herself of her curse. Through her pawns and other agents, she pursues any rumor of a city's discovery, extracting information with torture when lavish gifts won't suffice."

			"Pyralisia, often called \"the Rain of Embers,\" was considered one the strongest and most benevolent phoenixes of Avistan in the early years of the Age of Lost Omens. She rose to prominence during the First Mendevian Crusade by leading the charge against a marilith general and her legion of minions. During the Second Crusade, Pyralisia oversaw the erection of several of the wardstones that kept the Worldwound's demonic hordes contained near the crusader citadel of Drezen. But when an Abyssal rift opened near the wardstone line before the final menhirs were in place, the entire crusade stood on the brink of failure. Without hesitation, Pyralisia threw her body into the yawning chasm, blocking the demons' escape and using her body to absorb the torrents of tainted fire bursting forth.",
			"",
			"Pyralisia's heroic act was not enough, however, and the dark energy pouring from the rift slew her quickly. When she resurrected from her ashes, the Abyssal flames bonded with Pyralisia and corrupted her, instilling her body with dark, negative energy and trapping the Rain of Embers in a body utterly consumed by evil.",
			"",
			"Now, Pyralisia prowls the Worldwound, hunting crusaders and demons alike in her vengeful anger. Phoenixes contend that if she could be killed, Pyralisia's self-resurrection would cleanse her of this malignancy and restore her true goodness. But so far, few have faced Pyralisia and lived to tell the tale. Those phoenixes that have tried to defeat her found themselves outmatched by the new power of Pyralisia's black fire, their own flames as useless against her as against any other of their kind. The phoenix Garidor-Pyralisia's mate prior to her corruption-anxiously watches the roads leading into Mendev, seeking powerful crusaders or adventurers to aid him in destroying his beloved before her perversion becomes permanent.",

			"**Boiling Spray (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, Chavazvug can expel blasts of boiling bile, blood, and other bodily fluids from his dozens of seeping, dangling intestinal extrusions. This spray of boiling fluid strikes all creatures in a 60-foot burst centered on Chavazvug. A creature struck takes 10d10 points of fire damage and 10d10 points of acid damage from this spray of toxic fluids (Reflex DC 34 half). Any creature that takes any damage at all from this boiling spray (regardless of whether it succeeded at the Reflex save) must also succeed at DC 34 Fortitude save or become nauseated by the foul fluids for one round. This nausea effect is a poison effect. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Chavazvug's horrific appearance feels its temperature rise swiftly, as if suddenly beset by a powerful fever. A creature that succeeds at a DC 28 Will save suffers no other effect from the qlippoth lord's horrific appearance, but one that fails gains a fiery red or orange tinge to its flesh. An affected creature takes a permanent -4 penalty on saving throws against fire effects and gains vulnerability to fire. All forms of fire resistance the creature benefits from function at half capacity (fire resistance 30 effectively functions as fire resistance 15, for example). All forms of immunity to fire that the creature has or later gains are suppressed, but in this case, the creature does not take any other penalty from this horrific appearance. If a creature has the fire subtype, it loses that subtype as long as it is affected by this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Rejuvenation (Ex)** If Chavazvug is slain, his mind is catapulted back to one of the many boiling lakes of bile located in his Abyssal sanctum, where a new body grows around the qlippoth lord over the course of 1d10 days. During this period, Chavazvug is technically alive, but immobile and unable to take any actions other than float in the lake. If this new body is slain before the 1d10 days required to completely regrow have passed, Chavazvug is slain forever (although it should be noted that these boiling lakes of bile are rife with dangerous qlippoth and other monstrosities that are quite capable of defending and protecting Chavazvug's body). This rejuvenation ability replaces the rejuvenation ability that most qlippoth lords have (see page 231); Chavazvug is easier to track down and permanently slay, but his rejuvenation ability functions anywhere in the multiverse.",
			"",
			"**Searing Flesh (Ex)** Any creature that strikes Chavazvug with a melee weapon takes 1d6 points of fire damage from sprays of boiling matter and the mere proximity of the qlippoth lord's superheated body. A creature that strikes Chavazvug with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 2d6 points of fire damage. A creature that is grappling or grappled by Chavazvug takes 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of the creature's turn.",
			"",
			"**Slaughter Demon (Ex)** Chavazvug gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against demons, and deals &times;3 damage on a confirmed critical hit against a demon (including tieflings of demonic descent). Whenever Chavazvug slays a demon, he gains the effects of death knell for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Tainted Resurrection (Sp)** When Chavazvug resurrects a creature with his resurrection spell-like ability, the creature restored to life becomes corrupted and its alignment shifts one step closer to chaotic evil. The creature takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against the spell-like abilities and supernatural attacks of all qlippoth (this penalty is permanent, but can be removed if the creature dies and is resurrected in some way other than via Chavazvug). A creature resurrected by Chavazvug gains the possessed creature corruption template.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Chavazvug appears as a towering mound of greasy, slithering intestines and internal organs held aloft by five long, slender legs that taper to razor-sharp points. Twitching coils and ropes of entrails dangle below the shuddering bulk, and the entire thing steams and glows with heat. Known as the Crawling Inferno, the very touch of this immense qlippoth lord can set flesh alight and his presence can cause living creatures normally immune to fire to burn alive. Chavazvug stands 50 feet high and weighs 20,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Unlike other qlippoth lords, Chavazvug has chosen to focus on battling demons themselves rather than the sinful souls that spawn them. This makes Chavazvug the least antagonistic of the known qlippoth lords to mortal worshipers, yet the qlippoth lord remains uncaring in the long term for the health and prosperity of \"lesser beings\" that worship him.",
			"",
			"Chavazvug's Abyssal sanctum is a vast, crater strewn wasteland in an immense underground cavern deep in the Abyss. Many of these craters are filled with bile and seepage, boiling hot lakes in which strange creatures roil and froth. New craters form constantly as portions of the ceiling miles above fall and plummet to impact the floor. In time, the constantly collapsing ceiling may well cause subsidence in other demonic realms far above, or even break through into the Astral Plane, at which point cultists of Chavazvug hold that their god will rise in power to become a deity.",
			"",
			"### Chavazug's Cult",
			"",
			"Chavazvug is known as the Crawling Inferno to his worshipers, who venerate the qlippoth lord as a patron of fiery consumption and monstrous recursion. For the typical worshiper of Chavazvug, nothing could be closer to perfection than perishing from an unexpected bout of spontaneous combustion, only to have some form of horrific monster spawn from the steaming ashes left behind by the supplicant's fiery doom. These worshipers believe such a fate is a reward for service, and never seek to trigger such combustion on their own. Worshipers of Chavazvug tend to be solitary lunatics, arsonists, and sadists who delight in burning helpless victims as much as they do in the choking scent of seared flesh or the hypnotic glow of a fiery conflagration consuming a building or woodland. Chavazvug's sacred sites are the burnt-out husks of buildings-particularly buildings where demonic worship once took place.",
			"",
			"Chavazvug's symbol is a burning tentacled rune, and his favored weapon is the heavy flail. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Fire, and Repose, and to the subdomains of Ash, Entropy, Smoke, and Souls.",

			"**Destruction (Su)** Isph-Aun-Vuln's bite resolves as a primary touch attack. A creature bitten by the qlippoth lord must succeed at a DC 33 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Wisdom drain and 150 points of negative energy damage. If the creature successfully saves, it takes 1 point of Wisdom drain and 20d6 points of negative energy damage. If a creature is slain by this damage, its body is immediately consumed in unholy fire, leaving behind only its possessions. The only way to restore such a slain creature to life is via true resurrection, a carefully worded wish spell followed by resurrection, or miracle. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Destructive Commands (Ex)** When Isph-Aun-Vuln magically controls a creature via a charm or compulsion effect, she may issue commands to the creature that are self-destructive or against the target's nature. When such a command is issued, the magically controlled creature can resist the command with a successful Will save against the DC of the spell effect in question, but success at this save does not cause the effect to end and does not prevent Isph-Aun-Vuln from attempting to issue the same or a similar command on a subsequent round.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Isph-Aun-Vuln's horrific appearance becomes convinced that it has already succumbed to the qlippoth lord's mental control and can take no action other than to approach. An affected creature gains freedom of movement and a fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability) that can be used only to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln. Once an affected creature is adjacent to Isph-Aun-Vuln, it becomes dazed as long as it remains adjacent to the qlippoth lord. This dazed affect ends as soon as the creature is no longer adjacent, at which point the compulsion to approach Isph-Aun-Vuln returns. If Isph-Aun-Vuln is not present, the creature is free to act normally, but as soon as Isph-Aun-Vuln reappears, the compulsion to approach returns as well. This is a mind-affecting compulsion and a curse effect. If not removed via magic, this curse ends only after the creature remains outside Isph-Aun-Vuln's presence for 24 consecutive hours.",
			"",
			"**Insidious Possession (Ex)** When Isph-Aun-Vuln tries to possess an object or creature via a spell-like ability, she automatically attempts to dispel any protection from evil or similar spell effect on the creature via greater dispel magic. In addition, once a creature fails a saving throw against Isph-Aun-Vuln's possession spell-like abilities, it takes a -4 penalty on all future saving throws against mind-affecting effects created by any qlippoth. This lingering penalty is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Reflect Compulsion (Ex)** Even though Isph-Aun-Vuln is immune to mind-affecting effects, when a creature targets her with a compulsion spell or spell-like ability and that effect fails to penetrate her spell resistance, that effect is reflected back upon the caster. Treat the compulsion spell or effect as if Isph-Aun-Vuln had been the caster, except that the save DC remains unchanged.",
			"",
			"**Soul Shell (Su)** Isph-Aun-Vuln is constantly surrounded by a swirling vortex of soul fragments from the countless creatures that have perished while she was dominating or possessing them. This vortex is a force effect that grants Isph-Aun-Vuln a +12 armor bonus and serves to deflect incoming ranged touch attacks. All ranged touch attacks against this qlippoth lord have a 50% miss chance. The soul shell does not impede Isph-Aun-Vuln's ability to move through solid objects as an incorporeal creature.",
			"",
			"**Toxic Storm (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Isph-Aun-Vuln can create a blast of hurricane-strength wind around herself. This blast of wind blows either outward from the qlippoth lord to a radius of 120 feet or inward toward the qlippoth lord from a radius of 60 feet, as chosen by Isph-Aun-Vuln. The wind affects creatures as described for hurricane force winds on page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. The blast of wind lasts for 1 round. These winds are highly toxic, and all creatures exposed to the poisonous winds are affected by the following poison effect. The save DC for the poison effect is Constitution-based.",

			"",
			"Isph-Aun-Vuln appears as a human-sized mass of roiling tentacles arrayed around a large toothy maw. These tentacles slip in and out of reality, never fully existing as anything more than vapor, yet despite her immaterial form and relatively small size, she is among the most powerful of the qlippoth lords. Whereas others overwhelm their opponents through size and strength, Isph-Aun-Vuln opts for a more subversive and subtle approach, using possession and mental control of others to achieve her goal of slaughtering every creature with the capacity for sin-in other words, all free-willed mortals. Those she has no such use for she devours, adorning herself with fragments of their souls as vaporous, incandescent trophies-such will be the fate of all who remain should Isph-Aun-Vuln ever succeed at eliminating free will from the universe.",
			"",
			"### Isph-Aun-Vuln's Cult",
			"",
			"Isph-Aun-Vuln is perhaps the most powerful of the qlippoth lords, so it should come as no surprise that her cult is the most widespread among mortals on hundreds of different worlds throughout the Material Plane. Many who pay homage to Isph-Aun-Vuln, who is often referred to only as the Feaster Within, do so without knowing fully what sort of entity they worship, and only follow the commands of a charismatic but insane cult leader. In many cases, such leaders have been dominated or otherwise mentally controlled by Isph-Aun-Vuln so often that they have lost all remnants of their previous personalities. Isph- Aun-Vuln's worshipers venerate her amid standing stones perched on the edges of towering cliffs or rugged, wind-scoured mountain tops, and sacrifices to the demigoddess generally involve using magic to hurl a victim into the sky, where it is buffeted by winds before being allowed to fall to the earth below, broken and ruined.",

			"**Blisterwomb (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, Oaur-Ooung can cause one of the immense, pulsating blisters on her body to erupt. This creates a 30-foot cone of freezing fluid that deals 20d6 points of cold damage and knocks creatures standing in the area prone. With a successful DC 36 Reflex save, a creature takes half the damage and avoids being knocked prone. At the same time, a number of fully-grown qlippoth equal to a CR 20 encounter emerge from the blister- typically, this consists of four catabolignes (see page 225), but Oaur-Ooung can create any qlippoth she wishes with this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** Once per round as a swift action as she slays a living non-outsider with her slam attack, Oaur-Ooung can transform that slain creature into a qlippoth. The qlippoth she creates must be of a CR no greater than the slain creature's CR - 2, but otherwise the nature of the new qlippoth is chosen by Oaur-Ooung. Once created, the new qlippoth is free-willed and retains no memories of its previous life. A slain creature subjected to this transformation can resist the change with a successful DC 29 Will save. If the save fails, the slain creature cannot be restored to life until the qlippoth it spawned is slain, and even then, only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

In addition to falling prone, the victim is dazed for 1d6 rounds. Each round the victim remains dazed, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage.

Unlike kaiju, which are similarly massive, Oaur-Ooung can make attacks of opportunity against foes of any size and can be flanked by foes of any size. She gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if her entire space is on higher ground than the target. A Huge or smaller creature can climb Oaur-Ooung, but this requires a successful DC 30 Climb check.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Su)** Slam, tentacle, or constrict-injury: save Fort DC 36; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature slain by this poison splits open to spawn a new qlippoth (of a type chosen by Oaur-Ooung and of a CR no greater than that of the victim). The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Prodigious Reach (Ex)** Once per round as an immediate action, Oaur-Ooung can unfurl her central tentacle to attack any creature she can see within 600 feet with her slam attack. This attack can be used to make an attack of opportunity. She cannot grapple a foe outside of her normal reach of 60 feet.",
			"",
			"**Reactive Swarms (Ex)** Once per round when a creature strikes Oaur-Ooung with a melee weapon, her flesh splits and releases a nauseating spray of swarming vermin that immediately cloud around the attacker. This swarm deals 6d6 points of damage, and the attacker must succeed at a DC 36 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This does not require an action on Oaur-Ooung's behalf. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Swarm Mastery (Ex)** Oaur-Ooung is immune to swarm damage and cannot be distracted by swarm attacks.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Immense Oaur-Ooung is a horrifically prolific source of soldiers for the qlippoth's war against mortals. It is from this qlippoth lord that a significant number of the Abyss's qlippoth hordes emerge. If through some chance event Oaur-Ooung were permanently slain, the production of qlippoth by the Abyss would not cease entirely, but it would diminish by a noticeable amount-at least, until the Abyss churned out some sort of equally vile and fecund replacement for the slain qlippoth lord.",
			"",
			"Oaur-Ooung's Abyssal sanctum is a poisoned ocean with no shoreline. Here and there in its inky depths, submerged mountaintops reach in vain for the churning sea's surface, and leviathans swim through the vastness. Oaur-Ooung is the largest among them, but she keeps no lair as her own, content to drift through the eternal ocean spawning qlippoth large and small. Some are drowned, some she consumes, but enough escape her clutches and the ocean's depths to make their way elsewhere into the Abyss, often via churning vortices to other realms.",
			"",
			"Sometimes, the creatures born from OaurOoung's blisterwombs are particularly powerful; it's rumored that at least one of the Abyss's demon lords began its existence as a qlippoth lord emerging from Oaur-Ooung. Those few who have recently seen Oaur-Ooung (and survived) claim that a blisterwomb of unprecedented size boils on her flank, suggesting that she is about to spawn something of immense power. What this new addition to the Abyss might be and what form it might take is unknown, but it surely bodes ill for mortal life on countless worlds.",
			"",
			"Oaur-Ooung's body is 120 feet long, but her central tentacular stalk can unfurl to a length of miles for brief moments to lash out at creatures that have the distinct misfortune of having attracted her attention.",
			"",
			"### Oaur-Ooung's Cult",
			"",
			"Worshipers of Oaur-Ooung tend to be obsessed with one thing: the overwhelming desire to be transformed into a qlippoth. These cultists are not to be pitied, for their desires are not born out of shame. They believe that the qlippoth will win, and that by securing early transformation into one of these destructive beings, they will live on in the world they know will eventually replace all of reality. That they will retain none of their mortal memories or personalities is no deterrent to these people, as long as they survive in some form while the rest of their kind do not. Many have already abandoned their racial identities, repudiating their original cultures and pursuing magical or surgical alteration. Oaur-Ooung is worshiped on desolate coastlines and within the ruins of wracked or sunken ships, and sacrifices to her are often subjected to vile fleshwarping rituals in which their bodies become unholy components for transformative rituals designed to \"evolve\" the faithful and consume worshipers' foes.",
			"",

			"**Entangling Acid (Ex)** Any creature that takes acid damage from any of Thuskchoon's attacks or abilities (whether an extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like ability) becomes entangled by the thick, sticky acid this qlippoth lord generates. Freedom of movement prevents this entangle effect; otherwise, it persists until a character peels off and discards the acidic sludge; doing so requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Attempting to do so is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**False Intellect (Su)** In any round that Thuskchoon causes any Intelligence damage to a creature via his swallow whole ability, the qlippoth lord can use that digested intellect to gain the benefits of his intellectual flash ability for 1 round per point of Intelligence damage dealt in that round. This duration stacks if Thuskchoon has swallowed multiple creatures, or if the Intelligence damage continues for more than 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** A creature that succumbs to Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has its mind flooded with horrific recollections that may or may not be real, repressed terrors knocked loose and brought to the conscious mind by the presence of the monstrosity that is Thuskchoon. Often these memories are a strange mix of racial memory and flashes from past lives. The victim also experiences genetic reversions. The victim is immediately affected by feeblemind (as per the spell), and its body is deformed and hideously twisted. Select (or choose randomly) from the list of deformities gained from the mutant template (see page 180 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 5) to apply to the victim. Alternatively, simply reduce one of the victim's physical ability scores by 4 points (feel free to devise an appropriate cosmetic atrocity to add flavor to this reduction). The feeblemind effect can be cured normally by any effect that removes that condition (see the spell description for more details), but the mutation is permanent and can be removed only via a miracle or wish spell, or by death and subsequent resurrection. Thuskchoon's horrific appearance has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 or 0.",
			"",
			"**Intellectual Flash (Ex)** When Thuskchoon enters combat, there's a cumulative 20% chance per round that he receives a flash of intellect. Check for this flash at the start of the qlippoth lord's turn in combat. If the chance succeeds, for that round Thuskchoon loses his nearly mindless weakness and can use his spell-like abilities freely and engage in combat tactics on par with those of a typical human. During that round, Thuskchoon can attempt Knowledge checks untrained with a +20 insight bonus (he retains his -4 penalty from his Intelligence score of 3, so this means his Knowledge checks are attempted with a +16 bonus for this round). The next round, the chance of an intellectual flash occurring is reduced to 0%, but then increases by 20% each subsequent round.",
			"",
			"**Nearly Mindless (Ex)** Thuskchoon's limited intellect and his overwhelming hunger combine to make the creature nearly mindless in his actions. Unless he uses his intellectual flash ability or gains the benefit of false intellect, he cannot activate any spell-like abilities and his tactical choices in combat are those of a violent animal. While in his nearly mindless state, Thuskchoon gains a +8 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects.",
			"",
			"**Trailing Tar (Ex)** Thuskchoon exudes a thick swath of sticky, tarlike sludge whenever he moves using his base speed. Any square he passes over using this base speed is transformed into difficult terrain for 1 hour. Freedom of movement allows free passage through this sticky terrain, and a dose of universal solvent can cleanse one 5-foot-square area of tar. Spell effects that cleanse an area of filth or detritus can also remove this difficult terrain, provided the spell effect in question is 6th level or higher.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Not all of the qlippoth lords have alien intelligences that outstrip the minds of most mortals. In the case of Thuskchoon, the qlippoth lord's intellect is replaced almost entirely by a ravenous need to consume and feed. Now and then, the qlippoth lord gains flashes of insight and momentarily comprehends vast puzzles of reality, yet those brief insights fade quickly. These periods of insight are lengthened when Thuskchoon consumes prey, for as he digests flesh, he also digests thought, and can parasitize his victim's minds in order to act with purpose.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon's Abyssal sanctum is a vast warren of tunnels that wind through the depths of the Abyss and connect most, if not all, of the other qlippoth sanctums. Rarely does he spend time in this maze of caves, though, instead aimlessly wandering the depths of the Abyss in constant search of anything to sate his eternal hunger. Now and then, the qlippoth lord blunders through portals that bring his ravenings to other planes, whereupon it is but a matter of time before he is banished or slain and forced to start his wanderings over anew from his sanctum's heart.",
			"",
			"Thuskchoon measures 40 feet in length and weighs 16,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Thuskchoon's Cult",
			"",
			"The worshipers of Thuskchoon refer to the qlippoth lord as the Everglutton to honor his nearly mindless and nigh-constant hunger. Cultists of this unusual qlippoth lord venerate him while not expecting much in the way of intentional reward, for a core part of the faith is the acknowledgement that Thuskchoon is not particularly driven by intellect. The secrets he reveals are potent and world-shaking, yet they are accidental revelations-the circumstantial repercussions of the meandering swaths of destruction the Everglutton leaves in his wake as he lumbers through creation. Temples of Thuskchoon are converted from large caverns or ruined buildings, but the cult is nomadic and never remains in one location for long. Visions of new regions to savage and destroy constantly plague the leaders of this qlippoth lord's cults, but now and then they may settle in a region for a few years. In these cases, they tend to carve hideous pictographs and foul Abyssal prayers into the stones that make up their temporary shrines. Just as the qlippoth lord himself can gain momentary flashes of insight from the minds of digested victims, so do his cultists constantly seek new drugs, poisons, and exotic consumables to feed upon in hopes of being granted strange visions or unexpected answers to questions they haven't dared ask.",

This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Horrific Appearance (Su)** Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned.

This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth.",

			"",

			"Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar-Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The \"new flesh\" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects' men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans (see page 90).",
			"",
			"Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought.",
			"",
			"Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.",

In addition to the listed damage, the first time a creature begins its turn swallowed whole by Raskineya, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin to suffocate (as her suffocating breath ability). Even if it succeeds at this save, the creature can't breathe, speak, or cast spells with verbal components while it remains swallowed.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Void dragons are a cursed race, born on the boundary between rational space and the vast unknowable nothingness that lurks between the stars. They are not typically evil, but few escape the notice of the unnamable beings that dwell within that distant void. The fortunate ones resist the fell influence of the Dark Tapestry and survive with their minds intact.",
			"",
			"Raskineya was not one of the fortunate ones. The taint of the void shattered her mind, driving her to mindless violence and destruction. In her madness she sought out the inner planets of Golarion's solar system, plunging into the gravity wells of the inhabited worlds to feed and raze before fleeing back to the stars and plotting her next attack.",
			"",
			"This urge to destroy is what brought her to the attention of the cult of Rovagug. Priests of the Rough Beast often enslave powerful creatures to serve as proxies for their shackled god and guardians for their hidden temples, and Raskineya's savagery and madness made her an excellent prospect. The priests called to the stars, whispering promises of blood to the dragon to lure her into their waiting clutches. In her unthinking madness, she was no match for the cunning priests, and soon she was subdued, shackled, and locked in a cavern hidden deep within the earth.",
			"",
			"Raskineya languished at first, longing to once again fly to the stars and seek exotic new prey. Yet the priests had not lied to her when they promised her blood. She was given sacrifices and allowed to hunt and feed within her underground prison. With each such sacrifice, she not only grew stronger and more focused, but also found began to understand the prayers given to her. This world was promised to Rovagug, and he would have it. All worlds were promised to him, and he would destroy them all. Even the gods themselves would fall to his power, and in his wake only nothingness would remain. Raskineya found in Rovagug something she had not realized she was searching for: someone to champion. If she could but release this Unmaker, she could at long last have vengeance upon this existence, and upon the nameless ones who drew her here. All that would be left in his wake would be nothingness, and to nothingness her heart longed to return.",
			"",
			"With her newfound sense of purpose, Raskineya turned upon her captors. Her mind intact for the first time in centuries, she quickly overpowered them. First, she swallowed the high priest alive, consuming his life and essence to fuel her ascension. Then she enslaved the priests, and commanded them to find her a way to unleash their god upon the world once more. From them she learned of a prophecy, set down by the oracles of the brimstone haruspex, that a dark comet would herald the return of Gormuz-the first and most powerful of Rovagug's spawn-who would in turn unleash the Rough Beast himself. Raskineya sees herself as this dark comet, and demands all those who address her to call her by that name (with a slow death awaiting to those who do not).",
			"",
			"In the years since her ascension, Raskineya first scoured the world searching for the Star Towers-artifacts created by the gods to strengthen Rovagug's prison. The dragon was certain that if she could locate the first of these towers and destroy it, the rest will fall like dominoes, weakening the foundations of Rovagug's prison enough to allow his escape. She moved from Star Tower to Star Tower, searching for clues as to the location of the original. She last conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, winning it from a paladin of Sarenrae named Dazma the Bright, who had learned of the dragon's design on the tower and marshaled an army to defend it. Raskineya vanquished Dazma and her army by dragging meteors from the sky to drop on the Sarenites. Those who survived the initial bombardment were savaged by akatas carried within the meteors, leaving the remainder easy pickings for the dragon.",
			"",
			"Though it seemed she was getting closer to her goal, Raskineya's devotion to Rovagug made her actions unpredictable. Just as she conquered the Star Tower of Vekheen, she heard a pressing call she believed came from Rovagug himself. She flew to the Pit of Gormuz, where she made a den in the Crater of Carnal Joining in anticipation of the Rough Beast's arrival. There she waits, conducting horrific rituals to attract his attention. She brought with her the Sarenite survivors of the raid on the Star Tower, who she keeps alive as subjects for her rites. Once noble soldiers, they're now maimed and driven mad, kept in perpetual darkness within a small cave in Raskineya's lair. The warriors of the Maimed Legion, as she calls them, see light only when they're being tortured."

			"",
			"**Divine Deception (Su)** Once per day while Shamira uses her change shape ability, she can choose to emulate a different alignment for the purpose of divination spells that reveal auras (such as detect evil). This effect persists as long as she carries a holy symbol of a deity of the same alignment she wishes to emulate. This holy symbol must have been given to her within the previous hour by a worshiper of that deity; Shamira typically secures these symbols via mind control. This effect last for 2d6 hours, after which point the holy symbol crumbles to ashes. While it lasts, spells and other magical effects treat her alignment as if it were the feigned alignment, not her true alignment of chaotic evil. If she uses a symbol of Sarenrae to appear neutral good, this effect lasts for 24 hours before the symbol crumbles to dust.",
			"",
			"**Dream Haunting (Su)** Shamira can use her energy drain attack, mind-affecting spell-like abilities, and profane benediction abilities on any creature she successfully affects with her nightmare spell-like ability while that ability is in effect. Once she uses one of these abilities against her target, the nightmare spell ends-she can only use one of these abilities per use of nightmare.",
			"",
			"**Energy Drain (Su)** Shamira's energy drain ability functions like that of a succubus, except that it drains 2 levels per use. As a free action as part of this attack, she may choose use her burn special attack with her energy drain. With a successful DC 36 Will save, a character resists the suggestion implanted by this attack, and a successful DC 36 Fortitude save negates the negative level after 24 hours. The save DCs are Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Fiery Passion (Su)** Shamira's passions and fires are one. A creature must be immune to both fire and mind-affecting effects in order to be immune to fire damage caused by Shamira. Creatures immune only to fire instead take fire damage as if they instead had fire resistance 10. Creatures with fire resistance and no immunity to mind-affecting effects take fire damage from Shamira's attacks as if they had no fire resistance.",
			"",
			"**Firebow (Su)** As a swift action, Shamira can conjure a +5 flaming burst unholy composite longbow that creates arrows as she fires it. In addition, arrows fired from her firebow can inflict her burn special attack.",
			"",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits (Su)** In addition to many of the defenses and abilities incorporated into Shamira's statistics above, her weapons (natural and manufactured) are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction. Also, she can grant spells to her worshipers-she grants access to the domains of Chaos, Charm, Evil, and Nobility and the subdomains of Demon, Leadership, Love, and Lust.",
			"",
			"**Profane Benediction (Su)** This ability functions as the succubus's profane gift ability, except it grants a +4 profane bonus to an ability score of the target's choice rather than a +2 bonus. If the target is a worshiper of Sarenrae, the target also gains immunity to fire as long as the profane benediction persists, even if the worshiper at some point later abandons her faith in Sarenrae (as is often the case with those who are eager to keep their profane benedictions).",
			"",
			"**Summon Demons (Sp)** As a nascent demon lord, Shamira can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.",

			"**Crush (Ex)** Ulunat uses its immense size as a formidable weapon. As a standard action, Ulunat can move over enemies or objects, using its whole body to crush them, dealing 20d6+30 points of damage. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents that are Huge or smaller. This attack affects as many creatures as fit in Ulunat's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless Ulunat moves off them. If Ulunat chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Devour Magic (Ex)** Ulunat has the ability to absorb magic directed at it and create arcane feedback that has the potential to shred a spellcaster's mind. Whenever Ulunat is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by phantasmal killer. If Ulunat is in the area of effect of a spell or spell-like ability, the caster must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be affected as if he were targeted by insanity. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Hibernation (Ex)** Ulunat can sleep for centuries and doesn't need to eat during these periods of dormancy, though it eats ravenously and almost constantly once it has been awakened. If Ulunat is forced into an inhospitable environment, it goes into hibernation until conditions are right for it to reawaken. While in hibernation, Ulunat's damage reduction improves to 50/epic and it gains immunity to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance as well as all divination effects.",
			"",
			"**Massive (Ex)** Because of Ulunat's size, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to its movement, though forests or settlements are considered difficult terrain. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square Ulunat occupies, and vice versa. Ulunat can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. Ulunat gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb Ulunat with a successful DC 30 Climb check, however unlike the normal rules regarding Ulunat and attacks of opportunity, a Small or larger creature that climbs on Ulunat provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.",
			"",
			"**Regeneration (Ex)** Like all Spawn of Rovagug, Ulunat is a nearly indestructible force. No form of attack can suppress Ulunat's regeneration-it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If Ulunat fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is dealt to its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region from devastation, but a method to kill Spawn of Rovagug like Ulunat has yet to be discovered.",
			"",
			"**Terrible Claws (Ex)** Ulunat's natural weapons ignore all forms of damage reduction and hardness.",
			"",
			"**Tremor Step (Ex)** Ulunat's thunderous steps shake the ground as it moves. While moving along the ground, any creatures within 100 feet of Ulunat that are also in contact with the ground must succeed at a DC 39 Reflex save or be knocked prone as the beast thunders along. The save DC is Strength-based.",

The most exclusive part of the city, the Black Dome shields its district from the sun's blazing heat and the desert's blistering sandstorms. Beneath the Black Dome sit palaces and monuments, the most important of which is the seat of Sothis's government and the home of the Ruby Prince.",

			"The stories from the beginning of the First Age of Osirion claim that Azghaad killed Ulunat-some even say that he achieved this feat with the divine help of Nethys-but the truth is that the Spawn of Rovagug are unkillable. After a lengthy and dangerous battle, Azghaad banished Ulunat to a pocket realm beneath the place where its bloated shell still stands. In this realm, under the oldest and largest settlement in Osirion, Ulunat sleeps.",
			"",
			"Before this ancient conflict, the great beast emerged from the Pit of Gormuz and thundered across Golarion. As Ulunat neared what is now Sothis, cultists of Rovagug channeling the power of raw chaos in a massive ritual- chanting cacophonous praises to the Rough Beast- opened a direct link between Ulunat and Rovagug. Empowered by this divine connection, Ulunat grew to an immense size and charged across the land, trampling everything in its path.",
			"",
			"Now, thousands of years later, the Unholy First has begun to stir in its prison. Numerous past attempts to free the Unholy First have failed, and most of these were hidden from the public and Osirion's official history in hopes that the proper method for freeing Ulunat would remain unknown. However, this doesn't stop cultists and doomsayers from trying to bring back the terrible beast.",

The Whispering Tyrant treats his total Hit Dice as his caster level for these effects. Undead created in this way are automatically under his control. The Whispering Tyrant does not need to expend any material components when using this ability. This ability replaces the creeping paralysis mythic lich ability.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Absolute Terror (Su)** Living creatures within 60 feet of the Whispering Tyrant are paralyzed by absolute terror for 1d4 rounds, after which they are shaken as long as they remain within his aura. Once a creature has been paralyzed by this aura, it is immune for 24 hours. Mythic creatures receive a DC 29 Will save to negate the paralysis, but are still shaken as long as they remain within the aura. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This ability replaces the formidable animation mythic lich ability.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Necromancer (Ex)** The Whispering Tyrant can prepare spells from his opposition schools without needing to expend an additional spell slot. He always succeeds at concentration checks to cast spells. He can have any number of undead under his control, and he is not limited by the total Hit Dice of those undead. This ability replaces the enhanced spellcasting mythic lich ability.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The Whispering Tyrant was perhaps the greatest threat that the people of the Inner Sea have ever known. Even after his defeat atop Gallowspire, he wasn't finished. The forces that brought him low had no choice but to seal him within the tower that was once his capital.",
			"",
			"Before becoming a lich, the Whispering Tyrant was a powerful necromancer by the name Tar-Baphon. Though his origins are lost to time, it's thought that he grew up on the shores of Lake Encarthan, where he first studied the necromantic arts. As his power grew, so did his ambition, eventually leading him to the Cenotaph, the resting place of the slumbering runelord of gluttony. After unlocking the powers of Zutha, Tar-Baphon gained power beyond that of mortals. He realized then that true greatness required bringing the world itself under his control-alive or dead, all would serve him.",
			"",
			"His campaign was brutal. Enlisting nearby orcs and undead, he quickly conquered Ustalav and began a conquest that consumed most of central Avistan. He set down stones on the Isle of Terror, intent upon making it his capital. His actions drew the attention of Aroden, the Last Azlanti, who knew what destruction the runelords had caused, and refused to allow the world to return to those ancient ways. The two met on the Isle of Terror in 896 ar. The battle raged for days and leveled the entire surface of the island. Tar-Baphon's broken form lay among the rubble, and Aroden buried him there, thinking that was the end of the threat.",
			"",
			"However, Tar-Baphon had intended to die by Aroden's hand all along. His studies had revealed to him that his only true path to immortality lay in undeath. For Tar-Baphon's last step in becoming a lich beyond compare, he needed to be killed by a god, and Aroden served this purpose. The process sparked by Aroden took time, however, and for 2,307 years Tar-Baphon's body laid dead in the ground before he returned to grim unlife. The Whispering Tyrant was born.",
			"",
			"He soon reestablished his power, animating thousands of dead. For centuries, the forces of the living were unable to resist the tide of the dead-with Aroden gone, nothing could stop the Whispering Tyrant. Only the Shining Crusade had a chance to end his threat. Bearing the Shield of Aroden, General Arnisant faced the lich, but when the Whispering Tyrant used a wish to summon the general's heart to his waiting claw, the symbol of Aroden flared to life, the shield shattered, and the lich's body was destroyed. Without a means to locate the Tyrant's phylactery, let alone destroy it, the crusaders instead sealed him away in his tower, where their descendants remain ever watchful for his return."

			"",
			"**Aura of Corruption (Su)** Treerazer exudes an aura of corruption to a radius of 120 feet. This aura causes plants to grow hideous, sprouting thorns, twisting, and becoming fungoid in nature. Creatures with woodland stride or freedom of movement can move through this fungal bloom with ease. Living creatures within Treerazer's aura of corruption must make a DC 39 Fortitude save each round or their flesh grows pasty and clammy as tendrils of diseased plant matter and fungal growth sprout from it. This condition persists as long as the creature remains within Treerazer's aura of corruption and for 1 minute thereafter. While suffering the effects of this aura, the living creature is treated as a plant for the purposes of spells and effects that harm or otherwise inconvenience plant creatures more than other creatures. The victim would thus be subject to antiplant shell, blight, and additional damage from horrid wilting or a plant bane weapon, and could be affected by control plants. The corruption does not otherwise impart plant traits to creatures. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Defoliation (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, Treerazer can exude a pulse of defoliating energy in a 30-foot-radius spread. This pulse appears as a wave of sickly green energy, and causes all plants and plant creatures in the area to blacken and wither. Such creatures take 20d10 points of damage and 1d8 points of Strength drain, or half with a successful DC 39 Fortitude save. A plant that isn't a creature (such as a tree or a shrub) doesn't receive a save and immediately withers and dies. Treerazer can choose to exclude any number of plants in the area from this effect, and generally does so to preserve twisted and corrupted plants and fungus. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Nascent Demon Lord Traits** A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. Treerazer's current exile to the Material Plane prevents him from achieving full demon lord status. Yet he still possesses the typical nascent demon lord traits, which are similar to those possessed by a typical demon, only more potent, as summarized here.",
			"",
			"- Immunity to death effects, electricity, charm and compulsion effects, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30.",
			"- **Summon (Sp)** Once per day, nascent demon lords can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell.",
			"- Telepathy 300 ft.",
			"- A nascent demon lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of resolving damage reduction.",
			"- Nascent demon lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the nascent demon lord's behalf. All nascent demon lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil-in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to the nascent demon lord's themes and interests.",

			"**Overcharge Synapses (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can overstimulate the nervous system of any creature that has taken Intelligence damage from Tychilarius's shatter mind ability. The target takes 15d6 points of electricity damage as every nerve in its body misfires. This damage can be reduced to half with a successful DC 32 Fortitude saving throw. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Plasma Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, Tychilarius can fire a bolt of plasma from one of its tentacles at a target within 300 feet (no range increment) as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, a plasma bolt deals 15d6 points of damage, half of which is electricity damage and half of which is fire damage.",
			"",
			"**Reform Flesh (Su)** Tychilarius can use the flesh and energy from a creature killed by its void maw ability to give birth to other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. It can create a number of such creatures whose total Hit Dice equal that of the creature killed by void maw. For example, if Tychilarius killed a 20th-level human wizard in its void maw, it could give birth to two nehthalggus. This process takes 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Shatter Mind (Su)** Tychilarius exudes quivering psychic energy. Any creature adjacent to Tychilarius must succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw or take 1d4 points of Intelligence damage. This is a mind-affecting effect, and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Starflight (Su)** In outer space, Tychilarius can survive in the void and fly at an incredible speed. Its travel times vary, but a trip within a single solar system should take it 3d20 hours, and a trip farther than that should take it 3d20 days or more if Tychilarius knows the way to its destination.",
			"",
			"**Void Maw (Su)** When Tychilarius bites and successfully grabs a creature, it can attempt a combat maneuver check as a free action to draw the creature into its massive, chaotic form (as though attempting to pin the target). A creature drawn into Tychilarius's void maw must succeed at a DC 39 Will saving throw each round or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting confusion effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.",

Any creature in the area of a magic circle against evil or magic circle against chaos spell is unaffected by the confusion effect. A swallowed creature can escape by using plane shift or similar magic. Every day a creature remains in this void, it gains 1 negative level. A creature that dies from this effect is incorporated into Tychilarius's form; it can be reshaped into another creature via reform flesh, and is difficult to resurrect. Anyone attempting to resurrect a creature killed in the maw must succeed at a DC 32 caster level check to return the creature to life. The caster level check DC is Charisma-based.",

			"**Captivating Song (Su)** A harpy's song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it, calling them to the harpy's side. When a harpy sings, all creatures aside from other harpies within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 17 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the captivating song moves toward the harpy using the most direct means available. If the path leads it into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the victim receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the harpy simply stands and offers no resistance to the harpy's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the harpy sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"An awakened horror shaken from the depths of the sea by the catastrophic calling of Earthfall, the beast known as Urtleytlar swims the Arcadian Ocean, wreaking havoc wherever she treads. Urtleytlar is one of the Lesser Spawn of Rovagug, having escaped the Rough Beast's prison deep beneath the earth like those before her. The drow of Sekamina tell legends of a terrible many-headed beast crawling from the depths of the Dying Sea to prey upon their coastal settlements, and scholars among the dark elves hypothesize that this beast may have originated from somewhere in Orv. In this instance, their legends hold true, for Urtleytlar indeed swam the lightless depths of the Sightless Sea for centuries until she made it up the Braid, raided the aboleth population guarding the Inverted Sea, and emerged into a broken Azlant already claimed by the Arcadian Ocean.",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar spent her first millennia on Golarion's surface terrorizing the eastern coasts of Arcadia, after which the foul beast felt an irresistible call to the lands of the east. The world rippled with destruction after the passing of Aroden, and this surge of chaos washed over Urtleytlar as she felt the pull of her lord Rovagug in the Inner Sea region. She swam eastward, weaving through the shattered continent of Azlant, and as she headed toward the Eye of Abendego, she saw the storm as a manifestation of the Rough Beast's destructive power. The monstrous scylla delights in the powerful storm, and preaches Rovagug's words of destruction through the ruin she sows.",
			"",
			"Since making the Abendego Gulf her home, Urtleytlar has gathered numerous evil aquatic humanoids (and even depraved sailors) to her wretched bosom. The boggards and skum that make up the greatest number of her minions extend her reach to the broken shores of the Sodden Lands and Shackles. Some say she guides foolish sailors hoping to sail into the hurricane, providing them temporary safety in exchange for a taste of their souls.",
			"",
			"A handful of boggard tribes swear fealty to the Tempest Queen by capturing slaves and dragging them to the shores as sacrifices. Urtleytlar makes choice selections from among her minions' offerings, leaving the scraps for the boggards themselves to enjoy. Though she doesn't need the froglike humanoids for her conquests, she nonetheless enjoys their adoration. In addition to these minions, she counts a number of skum armies-left masterless after their abandonment by their aboleth rulers-as her thralls. Beneath the howling winds of the Eye of Abendego, hundreds of skum dwell in the ruins of Lirgen, now sunken beneath the sea. From this base, they make deals with both boggards and humans who have managed to survive in the flooded wastes of the Sodden Lands. These tribes and gangs provide Urtleytlar with slaves and food, and she strengthens their reach by aiding them in their destructive endeavors. In addition to these humanoids, Urtleytlar uses Megrexti, her charybdis counterpart and favorite plaything, as a living weapon, sending it into the middle of fleets of ships or other attackers and laughing in delight as it tears her victims to pieces.",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar chose as her alternate form a strangely beautiful Cyclops woman. As old a creature as she is, perhaps Urtleytlar feels a kinship with the giants who once ruled the land and waters she now calls home. Regardless, her alternate form has tricked many explorers searching for the ruins of Ghol-Gan, easing them into an odd complacency before she utterly destroys them and their crews.",
			"",
			"### Infamous Deeds",
			"",
			"Thriving within the dangerous force of the Eye of Abendego, the Tempest Queen gleefully besets any ship or fleet hoping to penetrate the storm. Many explorers in search of lost cities from Lirgen or ruins of ancient Ghol-Gan risk running across this wrathful creature.",
			"",
			"An insane, destructive whimsy marks Urtleytlar's behavior, and she delights in betrayal at the slightest offense. She leads some sailors safely through the storm for a time, then closes off the pockets of calm on the pitiful crew, leaving them to be ripped apart by the blistering winds and churning waters.",
			"",
			"According to the ship logs of the famed explorer Escobar Vellian, his last major encounter in the Sodden Lands was escaping the clutches of Urtleytlar. Assaulted by her fanatical skum minions and subjected to her numerous magical gambits, Vellian lost two ships during his attempts to escape, and returned to his home port with only one ship and less than one-fifth of his original crew.",
			"",
			"### Adventure Hooks",
			"",
			"Urtleytlar tends to find sailors before they find her, and those who purposefully seek out the legendary monster are regarded as mad.",
			"",
			"- Eager to acquire more power to further her course of destruction, Urtleytlar sends skum scouts to raid the underwater city of Wetan near the Sodden Lands. Once a port city of Lirgen, Wetan fell beneath the waves with the formation of the Eye of Abendego, and after the settlement's destruction, a tribe of locathah squatters sought the protection of its abandoned buildings. There they discovered an inoperable planetary gate and managed to partially activate it. Urtleytlar can sense the power and wants it for her own, despite not knowing exactly what she might gain.",
			"- Though Urtleytlar enjoys the caress of the Eye, she is hardly contained to one place, and her touch can be felt on the shores of the Shackles, the Sodden Lands, and Mediogalti Isle. Her destructive roaming causes especial trouble for the pirates of the Shackles, and a number of unlikely collaborators have settled their grudges, forming a pact to locate the dangerous scylla and kill her. Of course, with an endeavor like this, the pirates are eager for additional help."

			"",
			"**Blasphemous Embrace (Ex)** If the Voice of the Damned grapples a foe, it can, as a swift action, cause its pages to flense the grappled creature. The pages deal the Voice of the Damned's swarm damage. If a creature takes any of this damage, it is subject to the swarm's distraction ability and must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1 round. The Voice can have only one embraced target at a time, but it doesn't have to continue grappling in order to maintain the embrace. If the Voice moves more than 5 feet from the pages or dismisses them (a free action), the pages are rendered inanimate. Any severe or stronger wind effect or any area attack that would damage a swarm ends the embrace.",
			"",
			"**Consume (Su)** If the Voice of the Damned begins its turn with an opponent in its blasphemous embrace, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check as though attempting to pin the opponent. If it succeeds, its foe takes swarm damage and vanishes into a nightmare realm within the Voice of the Damned. The target must be of Large size or smaller. The Voice of the Damned can't consume a creature that has the good subtype or that is affected by holy aura. A consumed creature takes 8d6 points of damage each round as it drifts within the Voice of the Damned's accumulated heresies. Nonevil creatures must also succeed at a DC 32 Will saving throw each round or be affected as per the spell insanity, though any creature that is deafened or affected by silence or a similar effect is immune to the insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Each round on its turn, a consumed creature can attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check as a full-round action. If the subject succeeds at this check on two consecutive turns, it escapes, emerging into a space adjacent to the Voice of the Damned. The Voice of the Damned cannot attempt to consume an escaped creature again until 24 hours have passed. A consumed creature can also escape by using plane shift or similar magic. The Voice of the Damned is stunned for 1 round and forced to expel all consumed creatures if a creature inside casts holy aura or summons a creature with the good subtype, or if a creature (either inside or out) targets the Voice of the Damned with atonement, freedom, or holy word. The Voice of the Damned can expel any consumed creature as a move action, causing the victim to appear in any square adjacent to it.",
			"",
			"**Discorporate (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can collapse into a cyclone of pages as a free action. All its carried, held, and worn items fall to the ground, and its Strength score drops to 1. The Voice functions as a swarm of Diminutive creatures while discorporated, with a reach of 0 feet (though its space remains unchanged). While discorporated, the Voice maintains its defensive abilities. It loses its claw, slam, and wing natural attacks, but it can make a swarm attack and use its spell-like abilities. The Voice of the Damned can reform into its true form as a full-round action as long as it has at least 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Malevolence (Su)** As an immediate action, the Voice of the Damned can attempt to merge its body with a creature it has consumed. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 25th), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 32 Will saving throw. If the creature fails, the Voice of the Damned vanishes and the possessed creature reappears in its space (along with any other creatures the Voice had consumed). A creature that successfully saves is immune to the Voice's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Master of Symbols (Su)** The Voice of the Damned can speak, read, and write all languages, as per the spell tongues. It casts any spell with the word \"symbol\" in its name as though its casting time were a standard action, and once per day it can cast symbol of death as a swift action. Additionally, it does not need a surface on which to inscribe symbols-they merely float in the air for their duration.",
			"",
			"**Tenacious (Ex)** The Voice gains a +8 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD.",
			"",
			"**Wracking Gaze (Su)** The Voice of the Damned has a gaze attack with a range of 50 feet that deals 8d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Strength damage. A creature that succeeds at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage but not the physical damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"",
			"**Elemental Realm (Su)** While on the Plane of Fire, Ymeri functions as if she had 10 mythic ranks (see Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures), including having the mythic power ability (10/day, surge +1d12). She can expend uses of mythic power to use the mythic versions of any spell-like ability denoted with an asterisk (&ast;), as if the ability were a mythic spell. She is also able to use demand, discern location, fabricate, and  at will as spell-like abilities and dimension lock&ast;, miracle (limited to physical effects that manipulate the realm or to effects that are relevant to her areas of concern), and power word stun&ast; once per day as spell-like abilities. Finally, she gains a +10 insight bonus on Perception and initiative checks.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Revival (Ex)** If Ymeri is slain, her body crumbles to ash (leaving behind any gear she held or carried), her soul returns to a hidden location within her realm, and she is immediately restored to life (as per true resurrection) at that location. Once this occurs, Ymeri can't use this ability again until a full year has passed. If she is slain again during that year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose), she is slain forever.",
			"",
			"**Fire Tyrant (Ex)** Ymeri's servants bow to her will and instinctively follow her commands. As a free action, Ymeri can grant all of her allies with the fire subtype within 300 feet any two of her teamwork feats. Each creature retains these feats until it moves out of range or until Ymeri falls unconscious, dies, or uses this ability again. Three times per day as a standard action, Ymeri can manipulate a creature with the fire subtype or a creature on fire that she can detect with her flamesense ability, affecting it as per hold monster (CL 28th, Will DC 36 negates). If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, it is instead affected as if by dominate monster (CL 28th).",
			"",
			"**Flamesense (Ex)** Ymeri can sense the presence and movement of any fire-including creatures with the fire subtype, creatures on fire, and any creature touching the surface of the Plane of Fire-within 300 feet as if using blindsight. In addition, she can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Limitless Fire (Sp)** As a demigoddess of flame and the Plane of Fire itself, up to three times per day, Ymeri can cast any spell with the fire descriptor as a spell-like ability. She can further augment these spells using Burning Spell, Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Intensify Spell, Maximize Spell, Quicken Spell, or Widen Spell, though the effective spell level cannot exceed 9th.",
			"",
			"**Pyroportation (Su)** Ymeri can move effortlessly through fiery areas, including lava, superheated metal, and volcanic ash. This effectively grants her the earth glide ability of a magma elemental; allows her to ignore difficult terrain; and grants her a burrow, climb, and swim speed equal to her base speed while in these areas. With rare exceptions, this ability functions in all parts of the Plane of Fire. In addition, as a swift action, Ymeri can teleport to a square in line of sight that is adjacent to a fire of her size or larger.",
			"",
			"**Regeneration (Ex)** Only cold damage dealt by an epic weapon, cold damage dealt by a mythic spell, or damage from a creature of equal or greater power (such as a demon lord or a deity) interrupts Ymeri's regeneration.",
			"",
			"**Scorching Rend (Su)** If Ymeri hits a target two or more times with at least two different manufactured weapons in the same round, she can cause the target to catch on fire. This functions as the burn universal monster rule, dealing 3d10 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 38 negates catching on fire); however, if the target's fire resistance would reduce the damage it takes from this ability, it must succeed at a DC 38 Fortitude saving throw or reduce its fire resistance by an equal amount for 1 minute. Creatures immune to fire can still be affected by this ability. When such a creature would take 50 or more total points of fire damage from this ability, it loses its immunity to fire for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Ymeri has declared herself the eternal ruler of the Plane of Fire, going so far as destroying all known records of her origins to suggest she has existed since the dawn of time. Ever since she sealed away her good-aligned rival Atreia, the Lambent Prince, within a steam-shrouded garnet, she has driven the efreet in the City of Brass to battle their earth-blooded shaitan cousins.",
			"",
			"The Queen of the Inferno rarely has cause to leave the Auroric Palace, from which she rules. When she does, it is at the head of an army. She typically follows such raids by parading across the Plane of Fire, daring others to defy her will.",
			"",
			"### Ymeri's Cult",
			"",
			"Most fire elementals, some mephits, assorted efreet, and many other creatures with the fire subtype worship Ymeri, though relatively few salamanders revere her. Outside the Plane of Fire, her worship is rare and often restricted to zealous pyrokineticists, cabals of fire wizards, eccentric red dragons, and occasionally fanatical tribes of humanoids. Her sacred places and temples are often exposed desert ruins, sanctuaries of igneous rock, and shrines built precariously near active volcanoes. Some even feature active magma flows running through their halls or pits that open deep into the earth's burning bowels, which her cultists use to sacrifice their foes in Ymeri's name.",
			"",
			"Ymeri's unholy symbol is a quartet of flaming swords, and her favored weapon is the longsword. She grants access to the Destruction, Evil, Fire, and War domains, and access to the subdomains of Ash, Catastrophe, Fear, and Tactics."

			"**Bitter Flames (Su)** Whenever Zelishkar deals fire damage with any attack or effect, half of the damage is fire damage and the other half is untyped damage, similar to a flame strike spell. In addition, creatures that fail a save against any fire effect Zelishkar creates are sickened for 1 minute. Those damaged by his melee attacks or by fire effects that allow no save are instead sickened for 1 round per attack. This duration stacks.",
			"",
			"**Corpse Cremation (Su)** Whenever Zelishkar reduces a living creature to negative hit points, as a swift action he can turn its body to ashes and feed upon the target's life force, as death knell (Will DC 28 negates). Whenever Zelishkar slays a creature with any attack or ability, the creature's corpse is reduced to ashes (treat as disintegrate).",
			"",
			"**Daemonic Harbinger Traits** A daemonic harbinger is a powerful daemon that has not yet made the full transition from unique daemon to a horseman. It possesses several traits, as summarized here.",
			"",
			"- Immunity to acid, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, and poison.",
			"- Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30.",
			"- Telepathy 300 feet.",
			"- The harbinger's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"- The harbinger can grant spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on its behalf. Zelishkar grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.",
			"",
			"**Incandescent Body (Su)** As a free action, Zelishkar can cause his body to erupt into white-hot flame. He sheds light as bright as a daylight spell, and dazzles any creature that does not avert its gaze. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this dazzling effect. Zelishkar can dim his flames to burning black shadows as a free action, suppressing the dazzling effect and allowing him to use Stealth without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Incendiary Grasp (Su)** If Zelishkar hits a target with more than one natural weapon in the same round, the fire damage from each hit is combined as if from a single attack for the purpose of overcoming effects that provide resistance to fire. In addition, if Zelishkar succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, as a swift action he can suppress any fire resistance or immunity the target possesses until the beginning of Zelishkar's next turn. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this effect, unless that subtype is granted by a temporary magical effect or magic item.",
