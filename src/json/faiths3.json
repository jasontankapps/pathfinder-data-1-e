Your new wings grant you a fly speed equal to your base speed (good maneuverability). In addition, your voice becomes sweet and melodic, with an astonishing range. You gain a +4 bonus on Perform (oratory) and Perform (sing) checks, and the save DCs of language-dependent or sonic effects you create increase by 1.

If the creature fails, it can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack you for the remainder of the round.

These supernatural winds can even deflect ranged touch spell effects (such as rays) and massive ranged weapons such as ballista bolts or thrown boulders. As a standard action, you can also direct these winds to assail a creature within 30 feet; this acts as a bull rush or trip attempt, using your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier. You can maintain this wind shield for a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, but these rounds need not be consecutive.",

You gain an extra spell slot of the highest spell level you can cast. If you prepare spells, you can prepare one spell in this spell slot every day from the Chaos or Destruction domain spell lists. You may choose any spell from the lists even if you are an arcane spellcaster, and you can change this spell selection every time you prepare spells.

Your ally must make the destructive smite within 1 round of being granted the power or its use is wasted. Your ally uses your level to calculate the power of the destructive smite.

In such situations, the faithful of Sarenrae are expected to end combat swiftly and efficiently, to avoid drawing out the pain and agony of battle. When one can end a battle without resorting to killing, the opportunity for redemption of the defeated foe still remains. The pages of Dawnflower's Mercies teach methods by which those who serve Sarenrae as soldiers can vanquish enemies in combat without killing them, and encourage those who follow the teachings held within to offer those they take prisoner the chance to be welcomed into Sarenrae's arms.",

If the attack that dealt nonlethal damage was from a scimitar, you instead regain 2d6 hit points.

The target can resist this transformation if it wishes with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). A transformed creature's type becomes construct, and it gains all traits of the construct type, including lack of a Constitution score. The transformed creature also gains the clockwork subtype, including vulnerability to electricity, but it does not gain the swift reactions trait. A transformed creature must be wound once per day with a special key (which appears as part of this transformation); as the key must be inserted into the creature's back, this requires either a successful DC 25 Dexterity or Escape Artist check or another creature's assistance. If the creature is not wound by midnight each night, it becomes immobile and helpless until wound again. A creature transformed into a clockwork doll becomes mindless, with an Intelligence score of 0. It can't use any supernatural or spell-like abilities it had prior to transforming, nor can it cast spells. It also loses all feats and skill ranks. A clockwork doll follows your commands to the letter, but otherwise it remains motionless and takes no actions on its own (unless you command it to react in certain ways, such as serving as a room guardian). This transformation can be reversed only by break enchantment, miracle, polymorph any object, or wish. If the clockwork doll is slain, the creature can be brought back to life via true resurrection. You can only have one clockwork doll under your command at a time. If you create a second clockwork doll, the first one must attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier); if it succeeds, it reverts to its previous form with no memories of the time spent as your clockwork doll, but if it fails this save, the clockwork doll crumbles to rubble and is destroyed.

Each tentacle deals damage appropriate to your size (1d6 if you are Medium). These tentacle attacks have a reach 5 feet greater than your normal reach, and you gain the grab and constrict abilities (your constrict damage is equal to the damage you deal with one of your tentacles plus 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier); you can grab a creature up to one size category larger than you this way.

When you are targeted by an effect based on alignment or patron deity, you can choose to be treated as having the alignment and faith of the creature originating the effect (you don't need to know that creature's alignment or faith to make this choice). You can also be treated as having the faith of your target or targets when using a spell or effect dependent on patron deity.

In addition, you can select feats, traits, and other options dependent on worship of particular deities as though you were a worshiper of those deities.

A nonevil and nongood target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or become staggered for 1 round, while a good target must succeed at this Will save or become nauseated for 1 round.

You can cast phantasmal killer three times per day as a spell-like ability, but rather than this functioning as an illusion (phantasm), this is a mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effect. The victim must succeed at a Will save to resist the urge to end its life. On a failure, the victim must succeed at a Fortitude save or its body's life-sustaining autonomic processes irreparably and lethally shut down.",
			"3. **Broken Angel (Ex)** Like that of your Abyssal mistress, your body has fallen to pieces. Your arms and legs do not directly attach to your body, instead floating near their original locations, while your torso sprouts angelic wings that keep it aloft. You gain a fly speed of 30 feet, with perfect maneuverability. Your limbs can disassociate briefly from the whole to attack distant targets at a moment's notice, extending your melee reach by 15 feet, and attacks against you suffer a miss chance of 20% due to the gaps between your constantly shifting body parts. You are immune to effects that cause severed limbs or that arise from severed limbs (including the beheading effect of a vorpal sword) and also to bleed effects and bleed damage. You automatically stabilize when reduced to negative hit points.",

Resolve this effect before rolling damage for the attack; this functions as phantasmal killer, and the target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 14 + your Charisma modifier) to recognize the image as unreal. On a failed save, the phantasm touches the target, which must then succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (against the same DC) or die from fear.

This illusive ghost is always veiled, even if it never was so in life.

Three times per day, you can cast polymorph any object as a spell-like ability. Unlike with the spell, you are not limited to existing forms; you could turn the target into a three-headed nymph or a centaur-like creature made only of human body parts, for example (although this does not apply to inanimate forms, such as turning a human into a sculpture of soft clay or vice versa). You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle. If the resulting form would be lethal, the target gains a +4 bonus on the save. Unlike for a normal polymorph any object spell, changes you make this way can be undone only by a wish or miracle spell or by another use of this ability.",

The blade is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The blade lasts for a number of rounds equal to your character level, though the blade immediately vanishes if it leaves your hand.

You are immune to this effect, and although you still feel hunger pangs, you no longer take damage nor are otherwise inconvenienced by the effects of starvation.",

Those who follow their ancient traditions believe that countless entities known as *wendo* move among mortals, shaping fate and guiding destiny. Though not gods, the wendo are capricious and demand worship in exchange for cooperation. Only the *wendifa*, juju oracles whose craft is passed down through oral tradition from lost civilizations, can divine what the wendo want. Wendifa lead rites and sacrifices to gain insight from the wendo and offer their followers some protection from the unforgiving forces of nature. Wendifa of great power can bend the spirits of both nature and the living to their will, earning them respect from both foes and followers.",
			"",
			"To the uninitiated, juju is a complicated system of objects and symbols for protection and power. Some even believe it to be an organized religion with a standard set of beliefs and rituals. Those with greater experience know that juju is a living, breathing faith-an ever-evolving collection of traditions transmitted by word of mouth from one generation to the next. Fetishes, power objects, and ancient sigils are the tools of worship, but they are not the heart of juju, nor are the practices of one tribe common to all. ",
			"",
			"The heart of juju is communion with the wendo through elaborate rituals designed to summon the spirits, who carry messages and entreaties to hidden spiritual entities of immense power. These rituals involve idols and sacrifice, music and dance, and the crafting of *metumbe*, detailed pictograms identified with specific wendo. The nature of these rites can range from celebrations and offerings of food to the bloody sacrifice of intelligent beings, depending on a tribe's moral tendencies. Failing to follow the precise directions of a ritual, improperly fashioning a wendo's *metumbe*, or-worst of all-allowing nonbelievers or *hen kudu* (\"lost ones\") to witness a ritual can bring the wendos' wrath, requiring even greater sacrifice to appease the spirits",
			"",
			"Juju is a highly personal faith, with each practitioner keeping to the rituals and taboos handed down from his family or tribe. Though they prefer to stay close to their wendifa for guidance, juju practitioners who travel the world follow their rituals closely, seeking guidance from the spirits while making sure to guard them from the eyes of *ben kudu*",
			"",
			"Rather than choosing a specific patron, most wendifa deal with a wide range of wendo according to their needs.

			"3. **Sculptor's Strike (Su)** The strike of your weapons causes a specified foe to calcify and harden into stone, bit by bit, eventually transforming that enemy into a favored child of Xoveron. To use sculptor's strike, you must first designate a foe in sight within 30 feet as a standard action. Once you've designated the foe, whenever you deal damage to that creature with a melee weapon (including unarmed strikes and natural weapons), the creature takes 1d6 points of Dexterity drain in addition to the normal damage. If the target succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) this drain is reduced to 1 point. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity in this way is permanently transformed into a gargoyle (as per polymorph any object, except no Fortitude save is allowed) and must succeed at a Will save (using this ability's DC) or have its mind also become that of a gargoyle (as per baleful polymorph). When a creature is transformed in this way, all Dexterity drain caused by this effect is instantly healed and the creature's hit points are fully restored. The mental change can be reversed by any effect that removes curses, but the physical transformation can only be reversed by miracle or wish. You can activate sculptor's strike once per day to designate a foe, but once you've done so, that foe remains susceptible to your ability until you or it is slain. If you designate a different foe on a later day, any previously designated foe is no longer designated and can no longer be affected by this ability (unless you designate it once again at a later date).",

On a failed save, the target painfully advances in years to the next age category. This aging can never have beneficial effects (such as if used against a true dragon). The target gains the penalties associated with the new age category to its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores, but its Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores do not increase. This advanced age effect lasts for 24 hours before it fades and the affected creature returns to its normal age. A venerable creature (including one whose age has been magically accelerated via this ability to venerable, but not one whose age is temporarily advanced from other effects, such as per sands of time) that fails its saving throw against the aging effects of this ability is instantly slain, as if via old age (though the body instantly reverts to its original age appearance upon death). A creature slain by this effect can only be restored to life via miracle, reincarnate, true resurrection, or wish. This is a curse effect.",

The affected creatures never glimpse Yhidothrus's head, and know only for the brief instant of eternity they spend in your time stop area that the world around them is fully wrapped in the coils of something more foul than they even imagined.",

But this is not to say that Zura denies her greatest followers the bliss and rapture of becoming a vampire, at least for short periods of time. Thanks to your long-standing devotion to the Vampire Queen, you have become one of those chosen few to gain this peek into a vampire's unlife without having to give up living.

If you are already a vampire and you activate this boon, you gain the advanced creature simple template for the duration of this effect.",

If you are already a vampire, your fast healing and DR both increase by 5.
