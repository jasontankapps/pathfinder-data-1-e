For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a lowgravity sphere and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low gravity plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).",

While cold to the touch, it does not harm the wearer, especially if worn over normal clothing (though it can hasten the effects of exposure in cold environments). It offers the same protection as a breastplate, except it has hardness 0 and 30 hit points. If the intended wearer is immersed in water when you cast this spell, you may form the armor around the wearer (who may be you); otherwise the wearer must don the armor normally. Attacks against the wearer that create heat or fire degrade the armor, reducing its armor bonus by 1 for every 5 points of fire damage the wearer takes; when the armor's bonus to AC reaches 0, the armor is destroyed and the spell ends. Because the ice is slightly buoyant, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Swim checks, except when swimming downward. Druids can wear ice armor without penalty."

The target gains a bonus on Stealth checks equal to half your caster level, and can use Stealth to hide from all creatures attempting to perceive it, even when it lacks concealment or cover. It can attempt a Stealth check to avoid detection from creatures using blindsight, blindsense, or any ability that functions as either (such as lifesense or tremorsense). Furthermore, the target leaves no trail and cannot be tracked unless it chooses to leave a trail. If a creature attempts to discern the target's presence or location using divination magic (including magic items with a divination aura such as a crystal ball), that creature must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the target's Stealth bonus to discern any information about the target, and on a failed check cannot do so for the spell's duration."

			"A glamered bubble surrounds the target's space, rendering her completely invisible underwater by hiding both the target and any water she displaces. Because of the bubble's size limit, this spell works only on Medium or smaller targets. Other objects and creatures within the bubble's space are also invisible while they stay in the space, which could reveal the spell's existence to a canny observer who notices fish disappearing into the bubble and reappearing on the other side. Creatures inside the bubble can see each other, which allows foes who can pinpoint the bubble's location (such as dragons) to stick their heads into the bubble in order to see the target. Any creature on the inside of the bubble that takes any action that would break invisibility pops the bubble and ends the spell early. On land, the bubble is clearly visible, acting much as invisibility does in the water. Unlike with invisibility, the inside of the bubble blocks light from escaping the bubble, meaning that light sources inside the bubble don't illuminate past its edges, but also don't reveal a telltale glow.",

			"The casting of judgment undone is not without risk. The servants of Pharasma vigilantly watch for perversions of the order of fate and death, though it can take time for them to pinpoint disruptions when they occur. After 1d6+5 minutes from the beginning of this spell's 10-minute casting time, an olethros appears within 50 feet of the caster; this psychopomp demands the caster cease casting the spell immediately and attacks if its request is ignored. The psychopomp never attempts to harm the petitioner unless judgment undone has already been successfully cast by the time the psychopomp arrives, in which case it attempts to eliminate the returned mortal as well. If the caster and returned mortal are no longer present, the olethros does what she can to track both down and exact judgment-how successful she may be depends on the GM's discretion.",

			"The caster of judgment undone can pause the spell's casting for up to 1 minute without causing the spell to fail. During this time, the caster does not need to concentrate on judgment undone and can act normally and cast other spells without disrupting the spell, but if she does not begin casting again before this 1-minute window elapses, the spell fails.",
			"",
			"It is possible to cast judgment undone without incurring the wrath of a psychopomp, but doing so requires the caster to first visit the Boneyard and seek out a powerful agent of Pharasma to gain permission to restore the petitioner to its mortal life. The details and difficulty of this task are subject to the GM's discretion, but at the very least should involve a significant expenditure of time and resources. The granting of permission to cast judgment undone is an excellent reward for a quest given to a party of adventurers from a powerful psychopomp. If the PCs exceed expectations in fulfilling this quest, it's not unheard of for the psychopomp to not only grant permission for the spell's casting, but to also provide the diamonds needed for the spell's material component, information about the required focus, or even both. Worshipers of Pharasma who cast this spell without securing permission in this manner are considered to have grossly violated Pharasma's code of conduct."

This spell grants you an insight bonus equal to your caster level (maximum +25) on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. Alternatively, you can apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack (even if flat-footed). Activating the effect doesn't take an action; you can even activate it on another character's turn. You must choose to use the moment of prescience before you make the roll it is to modify. Once used, the spell ends. You can't have more than one moment of prescience active on you at the same time."

Negative levels equal to or greater than the creature's Hit Dice are instead applied as Constitution drain (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated.

			"**Source** [Inner Sea Races pg. 193](source/inner_sea_races) Death is a natural part of life in the Inner Sea region, but it need not be final. Yet returning to life is not without its perils and peculiarities. While reincarnation is a significant part of the culture of certain races-particularly the [samsarans](race/samsaran), who reincarnate countless times over the centuries on their slow paths toward perfection and enlightenment-the use of the spell reincarnate allows any character to experience this mystical and fundamentally life-changing event. The table of random races presented here expands on the one presented with the reincarnate spell in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. At the GM's discretion, you may use the following optional table when rolling to determine what new body is generated when a reincarnate spell is cast. This Golarion-specific table excludes all races that possess racial Hit Dice, but also adds in new races that are relatively widespread and common in the region. Not all of the races presented in this book appear on the following table-[androids](race/android), for example, are beyond the scope of a reincarnate spell to create (although dead androids and [wyrwoods](race/wyrwood) can themselves be reincarnated, they have no chance of coming back in the same type of body). Others, such as [kasathas](race/kasatha) and other alien races, are not true natives of Golarion and thus lack the \"spiritual weight\" needed to be included in a table of reincarnation possibilities. Of course, a result of \"GM's choice\" gives each GM the opportunity to break these assumptions about allowed incarnations as she sees fit.  ",
			"When using these expanded tables, roll first on the Core Incarnations table. This table presents an array of familiar races. Move on to the Other Incarnations table only if directed to do so. This larger list presents a selection of less-common races from across Golarion, some of which might be familiar to the people of the Inner Sea, while others might be almost entirely alien. If the incarnation rolled has multiple ethnicities or heritages-as is the case with [aasimar](race/aasimar), [dhampir](race/dhampir), and several similar races' randomly determine which ethnicity or heritage applies to the new incarnation. Ability score modifiers remain the same regardless of the final ethnicity or heritage.",

The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.",

However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges. This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.",

This animated suit of armor still contains the unconscious (or dead) body of its former wearer and moves with a shambling gait at a speed of 20 feet.

Once animated, the revenant armor remains standing (and stands if knocked prone, doing so without provoking attacks of opportunity), and prevents the wearer of the armor from being considered helpless.
