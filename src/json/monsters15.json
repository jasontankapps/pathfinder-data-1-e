Although a shikigami is Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks an adjacent foe with a melee weapon. If a shikigami critically hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, it deals &times;3 damage. A shikigami is proficient with improvised weapons.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Shikigami are the least of the kami, yet they make up for their lowly status with their loyalty and bravery. Unlike most other well-known types of kami, shikigami are more often associated with rural and urban regions than with natural settings. These kami are the protectors of the minor works of civilization-things like milestones, waymarkers, tiny garden statues, and other relatively mundane works of art crafted by humanoid hands.",
			"",
			"No two shikigami look exactly alike, as befits a race of kami that associates with such a wide range of wards. While all shikigami have the ability to merge with their wards, these kami are also fond of spending time in their physical forms, watching over their wards either invisibly or in the form of a tiny statue. In combat, a shikigami fights with whatever objects it finds at hand. Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than they should.",
			"",
			"Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other kami, but they are quick to leave an area they see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt the virtues of nature. When they do, they generally take their wards with them. They do not engage humanoids who desecrate the environment, but their absence leaves a profound mark on the morale of perceptive villagers. Should the shikigami leave, town officials who know the function of the miniature kami are quick to change policies in their community to reflect a more naturalistic approach, hoping to rekindle the relationship between shikigami and people, lest the community fall into the disfavor of more powerful and less passive kami.",
			"",
			"Shikigami typically stand 2 feet tall and weigh 30 pounds, or 50 pounds when taking their statue forms. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, an alignment of lawful neutral, and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a shikigami familiar. Whenever a shikigami becomes a familiar, it treats its master as its ward.",

			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** When a suijin uses its breath weapon, it unleashes a pressurized blast of water that knocks over and soaks everything in its line of effect. Any creature that is struck by the blast and fails its saving throw is pushed back 10 feet as though bull rushed. For every 5 by which a creature fails its saving throw, it is pushed back an additional 5 feet. This effect also extinguishes any normal fires within the line of effect, as well as magical fires, which are dispelled as though by greater dispel magic. A suijin can choose to have its breath weapon deal nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage before using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Whitewater Barrier (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, a suijin can create a wall of turbulent water. A suijin can make this barrier however long it wishes, up to a maximum length of 180 feet, and the wall is 20 feet tall. A whitewater barrier acts as a sheet of stormy water, and any Large or smaller creature that attempts to pass through the barrier must succeed at a DC 26 Swim check or be rushed to the top of the wave and pushed back to the side it started on, taking fall damage as appropriate. It is possible to create cylindrical or square whitewater barriers to enclose specific points. This effect acts like wind wall in regard to how ranged missiles, breath weapons, gases, and creatures in gaseous form interact with it. The Swim DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Suijins are the kami of lakes, ponds, springs, and wells. When they are not merged with their wards, these spirits of nature resemble giant carp or sea serpents, usually beautiful specimens with rainbow scales. While they are as benevolent and well meaning as all other kami, suijins are often mistaken for beasts of the waters they inhabit, and are thus feared by superstitious or simple-minded creatures. Those who encounter suijins know better than to believe such unfounded fears, however, as the kami often only emerge from their wards in order to protect innocent creatures in trouble near its waters. Considered reclusive even by other kami, a suijin usually tries to protect creatures within its wards by covert means if at all possible, slowing the flow of its waters' currents or pushing struggling creatures to shore via magic. Suijins are infinitely patient, and though most enjoy helping creatures, those in more remote regions are just as content to simply exist among their waters, protecting their wards from those who would seek to defile them. The general attitude among most suijins is often one of simple acceptance of things as they are, based on the belief that all things are fluid and subject to change; even the largest lakes are bound to recede or expand, and even the most eternal kami are not entirely permanent, a point proven by the vicious oni.",
			"",
			"In its true form, a typical suijin is 15 feet long and weighs about 1,200 pounds, though numerous rumors suggest that lesser and greater suijins do exist in some parts of the world, typically residing in bodies of water that are proportionate to the kami's size and power.",
			"",
			"A suijin's particular ward is usually a good indicator of its temperament. A suijin residing in a secluded and placid mountain lake is often more calm and forgiving of trespasses than one dwelling in the heart of a turbulent river, and though all suijins typically mean well, those with more tumultuous wards are generally less tolerant of intruders within their domains. For instance, a suijin protecting a natural whirlpool within a larger body of water may not help a passing boat of traders that happens to start sinking into its depths, viewing the ship as a disturbance to the forces of nature. Those suijins who are used to seeing their waterways casually abused by the forces of civilization-as almost all cities in some way impose upon or corrupt the rivers and streams that flow near them, and even farming communities may pollute with manure and runoff- can be much more hard-hearted.",
			"",
			"Suijins in isolated areas care far less about the mortal world than those who interact with it on a daily basis, so the attitude of a suijin dwelling within a mountain stream is often far different than that of one residing in a regularly visited pond. Travelers can earn the approval of a suijin by placing minerals or gemstones within its ward, and those who pollute the waters or use it for evil (such as by executing innocents via drowning) are quick to encounter a normally calm suijin's fearsome wrath. Unusual floods and droughts are both signs of a suijin's displeasure with a nearby development's effects on the surrounding waters, and wary villagers are careful to appease a suijin and change their destructive ways, lest they feel the full brunt of the powerful water kami's righteous wrath.",
			"",
			"Those suijins who continually fail to protect their waters from troublesome residents or visitors are often quick to fall out of favor with their kindred, and the wards of these kami often become treacherous during the time in which a corrupted suijin makes its gradual transition toward becoming an oni.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Kami](family/kami)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A suijin can occupy virtually any body of water, whether it be a stream up to several dozen miles long or a lake no more than a single mile in diameter. A particularly social suijin might choose to occupy the aqueduct of an urban development if the inhabitants are especially conscious of their impact on the surrounding environs, and such settlements recognize and appreciate the blessing of the benevolent resident, as a suijin cleans and purifies the waters it inhabits.",
			"",
			"Suijins are solitary kami, and rarely go out of their way to band with others of their kind, preferring instead to protect isolated bodies of water. This form of aloofness isn't out of fear of or apathy for other kami; instead, suijins merely adhere to a loosely established territorial pact, knowing that their powers are more valuable when spread throughout regions, rather than concentrated on particular bodies of water. When suijins do interact with one another, they do so at points where two bodies of water meet, such as estuaries and deltas. If two connecting bodies of water are especially healthy and the suijins residing in them are entirely undisturbed by forces of corruption, it is said that the water kami celebrate nature in a sort of bonding ritual. The rare event can be seen as motes of blue and green light whirling in the shallows of the adjoining water, and scholars speculate that this event may symbolize the creation of a new suijin."

			"**Touch of Ages (Su)** When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"**Head Bowl (Su)** The basin atop a kappa's head contains water from its home river or lake. The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at its first opportunity.",

			"#### Description",

			"A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid turtle. It dwells in fresh water, preferring a stream or river to a lake or pond. It has a small shell on its back, a blunt face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short claws. A typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can vary toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow basin in the top of its head, in which the creature carries water from its home at all times.",
			"",
			"Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those who pass near or swim in their home. Kappa pranks are usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking under robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an aquatic predator. A kappa might also challenge others to grappling matches, hoping potential foes underestimate its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be dangerous, attempting to drown mounts, animal companions, or even people who enter its home waters. The most degenerate kappas have been known to drown bathers and eat them.",
			"",
			"Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures have a few weaknesses. First of all, kappas love cucumbers and horseflesh. If plied with such treats, a kappa is likely to not bother intruders, and might even be convinced to offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks, it is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa confronted with a verbal rebuke rather than combat quickly and almost shamefully apologizes for its pranks, begging for forgiveness.",
			"",
			"If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains stationary and pleads for help, continuing to fight only if forced to. An opponent who refills the kappa's head bowl after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude. Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry flasks of water with them when they are forced to travel far from their home-most kappa don't think this far ahead."

Though not mindless, they have no inclination to build civilizations or even settlements, living in roving gangs or nomadic tribes. The tools they use in their more humanoid appendages are always scavenged, usually from victims, and are discarded when broken or of no more immediate use. Pursuits such as crafting, learning, and diplomacy are a waste to them; they see these as the activities of food-creatures not strong enough to see the world as it is-a stage for domination, feeding, and spawning. Even when these brutes band together, it is usually to spawn or to face sources of food that are too strong for only one or two karkinoi alone.",

They make such attacks night after night until the settlement is destroyed or the resistance becomes too fierce, at which point the horde disbands and each karkinoi makes its own way in the sea. While karkinoi can walk on land, they do not enjoy long periods away from the sea, as they dry out, crack, and eventually suffocate. Coastal raids are part of the karkinoi breeding cycle. The corpses that they drag off into the ocean are tethered to masses of eggs, and serve as food for karkinoi spawn. The spawn develop a taste for land-meat and crave it, ensuring the next generation of hungry raiders.",
			"",
			"While karkinoi rarely ally with other creatures, they are easily swayed by aboleths promising destruction and raw power. In return, the aboleths gain expendable, fastbreeding shock troops and guardians. Some scholars believe this race was actually created by aboleths in ancient times, but were later turned loose in the ocean because skum made more reliable slaves than karkinoi brutes."

The taste of that first meal imprints itself on the karkinoi spawn, pushing these creatures to become savage marauders when they mature.",

This suppressive magic has slowly deteriorated with each passing century, and as it has, kasthezvis have drawn strength from the ancient words contained within. They are now capable of issuing powerful, silent utterances that can level entire buildings. Given time, there is no telling the extent of their power.",

Most caulborn agree that the kasthezvis' bone crowns act as magical dampeners and allow the kasthezvis to speak powerful words without imploding, but no one has ever managed to acquire an intact crown for study.",
			"",

			"Kasthezvis have complete contempt for all living things and show only the barest respect for those more powerful than themselves. Yet theirs is a patient, meticulous evil. Kasthezvis are extremely cautious when speaking words of sundering or making their clandestine trips to spy on the surface world, knowing that their power is greater if no one knows they exist. When kasthezvi visit the city above, they disguise themselves as mute beggars or pious, quiet Sweettalkers. Few notice that they make no sound, and those who discover these spies' unnatural silence typically vanish in fatal \"accidents\" beneath the city. The purpose of kasthezvis' espionage is unknown. Some caulborn speculate that the kasthezvis are preparing to collapse the entire city in a single, silent cataclysm; others believe they seek to refine the ancient words that give them power or to discover a process by which they can procreate among the fecund surface dwellers.",

In exchange for knowledge of the ancient city and snippets of powerful words and phrases, Runelord Kaladurnae trained a select few kasthezvis in wizardry. These powerful runespeakers still live, but are cursed with greed. They hoard their arcane knowledge and venture from their lairs only when enticed by the prospect of learning new secrets. Kaladurnae also taught the kasthezvis to write. Kasthezvis cover their austere lairs with runes, scratches, and ancient Thassilonian letters, occasionally mixed with silent [explosive runes](spell/explosive_runes) inscribed by their runespeakers. These writings would be the greatest source of knowledge about the kasthezvis' history, culture, and motivations-if anyone could locate and decipher them. Aside from these writings, Kasthezvis communicate using a unique sign language known only to their kind, in which they use their entire bodies in an inhuman display of contortions and jerking limbs.",

			"Brilliantly beautiful but nearly as elusive as the breeze, the caterpillar-like katroome is a little creature with an enormous ego.

In turn, they expect to be treated with the respect such a position deserves. To those unfamiliar with a katroome's ways, the creature might come across as overbearing or imperious. Even to those who might compliment its beauty, a katroome might condescendingly issue a correction: \"I'm not beautiful,\" one might say, \"I am *regal*.\"",
			"",
			"Travelers typically encounter katroomes because the creatures are curious about any visitors in their realm. If the travelers seem innocuous and prove that they understand a katroome's internalized hierarchy of the area, the katroome might aid them with information. If the travelers are wicked or have disrespected the katroome or its home, the creature might stalk them, using its compulsion abilities and its natural webbing to play malicious pranks on the party.",
			"",
			"In addition to katroomes' self-assigned roles as protectors and emissaries of the forest, they are also rather avaricious, although they'll never admit it. Katroomes love savory culinary items that might appeal to a typical human. They are also enamored of magic, particularly wondrous items. A katroome might descend from its verdant perch to approach a traveler on the pretense of asking her intentions, when in reality, the katroome is merely curious about the shiny brooch on her cloak.",
			"",
			"A 5th-level spellcaster can gain a katroome as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat, although the katroome usually believes that the caster is the true familiar."

Kawa akagos' thorn-tipped fangs excrete a paininducing sap that mimics the feeling of intense, burning heat. Though they prefer to fight in water, kawa akagos usually ambush from land, using their dangerous sap to drive would-be prey toward the nearby rivers or streams that will soothe the painful effects of their fangs. Once the victim immerses itself, the plant creatures swarm their target if attacking in numbers, or a single plant strikes from the depths to wear down the victim. Although a kawa akago has no respiratory system, it's body is rife with pockets it can fill with air and expel as necessary. This network of hollow chambers allows the creature to speak on the rare occasions it wishes to communicate, and is the source of the creature's terrible wail, which is capable of breaking bones and shattering glass. The sound is often described as similar to the simultaneous mournful cries of a dozen children in serious distress.",

They gain the advanced and giant simple templates as well as the psychic magic ability, with spells that vary but generally include magic that can lure their desired prey into their waiting maws.",
			"",

There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a kech's flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds.",
			"",

Keches are as cruel as they are stealthy, and most jungle villages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed.",
			"",
			"A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4 levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained guard apes among them.",
			"",
			"Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids."

			"**Yellow Sign Affinity (Su)** When the keeper of the Yellow Sign stays within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours, it gains a +2 profane bonus to its Armor Class and a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. An active Yellow Sign is either one that was created by Hastur or by the [Yellow Sign](spell/yellow_sign) spell. If the keeper leaves this range, it loses the bonuses immediately and can regain them only after once more staying within 1 mile of an active Yellow Sign for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign is the undead form of a cultist of Hastur who willingly sacrificed his soul to rise as his god's servant after death. A quiet but relentless champion of the Unspeakable One, a keeper brings anxiety and woe to the lives of any infidel who comes too close to the secrets of its master. Like a vampire, a keeper can easily pass for a living human, if it so wishes, although it tends to have a pale, unhealthy look and a swollen face that can give away its true nature to those who know what to look for. Feeble and sluggish in the sunlight, a keeper can easily be mistaken for a sickly vagrant or even a leper if seen in the open during the day. In the darkness, however, a keeper grows supernaturally strong and attentive, and its eyes glow with a malignant, yellow luminescence.",
			"",
			"A keeper's primary purpose is to haunt and persecute unbelievers who witness the Yellow Sign or, worse, have a document or item that bears the dreaded symbol, such as a copy of The King in Yellow or another artifact of Hastur's cult. Against these favored victims, the keeper uses dream to create a sense of anticipation and awareness of its victim's forthcoming doom. Although a keeper's actions are mainly motivated by a sadistic eagerness to spread pain and misery, the creature can also perform special duties on behalf of a cleric of Hastur, such as slaying her personal enemies or harassing cultists she considers unworthy. These monsters also have an odd, morbid attraction for art in all its forms, favoring bizarre and decadent creations. Since a keeper's energy drain ability can cause its own destruction, one interested in prolonging its own existence uses its touch attack sparingly. Typically, a keeper switches to touch attacks when it faces heavily armored adversaries otherwise difficult to hit, when it is reduced to half hit points (and therefore already facing destruction), or when it simply feels the urge to \"taste\" the energy of a victim, usually one with artistic talent (such as anyone who demonstrates particular skill in the areas of Craft or Perform).",
			"",
			"As undead creatures, keepers of the Yellow Sign do not reproduce, though their existence in a given area can signify the presence of a cult of Hastur. Interacting with such creatures can sometimes influence other followers of the King in Yellow to undergo the transformation ritual and become keepers themselves. Keepers do little to proselytize and do not seek out potential converts to their faith or possible additions to their ranks. Rather, they are singularly focused on preventing evidence or knowledge of Hastur's cult from spreading to unbelievers, pursuing anyone who has seen the Yellow Sign, has an artifact bearing the powerful symbol, or has intimate knowledge of a cult's activities or plans.",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign does not need to eat, drink, or breathe, but it nevertheless has an urge to consume the energy of those who show particular talent in the arts. When using its energy draining abilities to sate such a hunger, the keeper typically drops its normally dour demeanor in favor of one of ecstasy and satisfaction, a small hint at Hastur's predilection for decadence and depravity. The keeper generally regains its composure immediately after it is done draining its victim's energy, though in rare cases a keeper might become so enraptured by the experience that it does not stop before its victim dies, thus putting itself in danger of self-destructing as the essence of life drained from its victim overwhelms it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"A keeper of the Yellow Sign can be found anywhere there are active cults of Hastur or in ruins where a cult once existed, especially those locations marked by a Yellow Sign. Keepers rarely travel far from the site of their creation, preferring to live reclusive, solitary existences in nearby communities. They seldom congregate with others of their kind, except when multiple keepers serve the same priest of Hastur. The undead retain their memories of life, and those rare independent keepers that share the company of other keepers often knew one another in life-likely they came from the same cult of the Unspeakable One and took part in the same transformation ritual. Despite this connection, however, even paired keepers yearn to be alone with their despair and insanity-wracked thoughts, coming together only for protection from outside threats or to overpower potential targets that are more powerful than a lone keeper could handle.",
			"",
			"In the communities where they reside, keepers are often mistaken for vagrants, mendicants, and diseased beggars. They often sit on unoccupied stoops, on public benches, or in gutters, muttering to themselves for hours on end, all the while watching passersby for indications that their neighbors may have witnessed the Yellow Sign. When offered charitable help by kind souls who encounter them, keepers of the Yellow Sign typically flee rather than risk giving away their true nature, which leads to the common belief that they are simply mad and either unwilling to receive aid or incapable of accepting it. Other times, they take on jobs that the general populace deems unsavory or macabre, such as gravedigger or hearse driver. They can observe potential targets from afar in these roles, lurking in cemeteries or churchyards and turning their unnerving gazes on the targets of their ire.",
			"",
			"By remaining on the fringes of society, however, a keeper of the Yellow Sign can exist unheeded in a single settlement or region for generations, as most residents pay so little attention to it that they fail to notice that the creature never ages or dies. As such, some keepers are old enough to remember past millennia-yet, they are rarely sane enough or willing enough to recount their knowledge to anyone but the most devout and powerful members of Hastur's faith."

A captivated creature can take no actions other than to move toward the kelpie and defend itself, even if it is drowning. A victim within 5 feet of the kelpie simply stands and offers no resistance to its attacks. This effect continues as long as the kelpie is alive and the victim is within 1 mile of the kelpie.

			"Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dreamrealms in search of plunder, danger, and glory.",
			"",
			"The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb.",
			"",
			"The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful.",
			"",
			"Kelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can \"swim\" in any direction, including underwater, it may be found on the surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the ocean. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to retreat deep underwater (assuming its foe cannot easily follow) or use teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Many loot caches on the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory for later counting.",
			"",
			"When called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services, preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous, voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets, though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious shipwreck in a cove.",
			"",
			"The ship is fully mobile in waterlike environments on other planes, including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the \"waters\" of the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watery parts of the Abyss, though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in the terrain that would trap it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject fear of punishment for any perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her.",
			"",
			"Though the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to Pharasma's Boneyard."

			"",
			"While kerakinsis can maneuver gracefully in powerful storms, they lack the ability to fly without wind to carry them. As a result, most kerakinsis obsess over any force that allows them to control the weather, often serving creatures capable of manipulating wind currents. Many display a natural affinity for druidic or shamanic magic, earning high status among their kind when they learn how to bend the winds to their will. Some scholars believe this aptitude indicates that kerakinsis descend from a people who turned to cruel druidic rituals to survive in the stormwracked wilds."

Creatures trapped inside can generally escape only via teleportation magic that crosses planes or if the ketesthius is defeated or nauseated from outside. As a result of its unusual anatomy and huge appetite, a ketesthius often has other monsters living inside its stomach, which in turn feed on things the ketesthius swallows. A ketesthius usually has from one to four monsters of CR 8-9 in its gullet.

Entire ecologies can form within a single ketesthius's extradimensional digestive tract. Though the stomach's ecosystem is capable of supporting life, it's far from a welcome environment: no sunlight comes in, the air is thin and dank, and most creatures trapped within become feral in short order. Larger creatures that end up inside a ketesthius have a difficult time surviving long term, and must resort to quickly snapping up prey that their host later swallows.",

Keulias today are prestige pets that Kalistocrats groom with all the care one would pay a bonsai tree, delicately coaxing the lizards to absorb gems and precious metals into their hides. They naturally shed their camouflage, and so intermittently shed a few jewels every month. Drumans have developed several superstitions and sayings about these events, considering it good luck for such a gem to fall at one's feet.",

A khaei in fear for her life can grab an attacker and forcefully age him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe's body. This exertion does damage to the khaei as well, and thus is rarely used, but a would-be tyrant who considers the khaei easy pickings may find himself surrounded by a weeping mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude-then forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the khaei's existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a great event.",
			"",
			"Khaei live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their situation. The only known enclave of khaei in the Inner Sea region is in the Dark Forest, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve as both subjects and prey for the mysterious dullahan called the Dark Rider. One of the most cherished stories of these khaei concerns a time and place-somewhere in either the past or the future- when there were many more of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones."

			"The true name of these creatures is one of Golarion's many forgotten mysteries. The name \"khardajeen\" is rough and ancient Dwarven for something akin to \"scourge of the deep.\" These aberrant creatures silently float throughout the tunnels of the Darklands. They are attracted to sites of great antiquity, particularly the treasure troves of dwarven Darklands kingdoms and the deeper Orvian depths. A khardajeen is a shifting mass of gray flesh and thick, multicolored blood that stretches roughly 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Khardajeens appear as little more than rock and metal orbiting an exposed liquid core. Some mental force ensures their liquid interiors do not spill out, while tentacles of blood allow them basic manipulation. They're renowned for their innate ability to form crystalline gems atop their tentacles. These gems are believed to imitate the properties of the magical ioun stones, leading some to believe that these creatures are related to the ancient Azlanti or even aboleths.",
			"",
			"The ability to obfuscate darkvision is one of the khardajeens' unique adaptations. This natural effect causes visual distortions when viewing khardajeens with darkvision, granting the aberrations an incredible advantage when facing other Darklands foes. As a result, surface-dwelling species with magical or natural light sources have an easier time hunting khardajeens than the natural inhabitants of the Darklands. Whether khardajeens evolved this adaptation over their millennia of wandering in the dark or as an augmentation selected by their mysterious creators is entirely unknown.",
			"",
			"Most scholars who've studied khardajeens believe that their survival is connected to their pearly white manifested gems. These gems reinvigorate the creatures, replenishing any life-sustaining fluids lost in the rigors of combat and healing other damage taken. Khardajeens don't breathe or sleep, allowing them to be constantly active. Those not under any immediate compulsion might enter a state of torpor; such khardajeens harden their blood into a fleshlike compound, making them resemble a roughly human-sized ball of mottled, purple skin.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The history of khardajeens is an enigma, and none make any claim on their creation. There is one imperative that seems to drive khardajeens: seeking out ancient artifacts. Khardajeens are innately attracted to the presence and use of magical devices associated with primordial Darklands empires, particularly the aboleths, the dwarves, and the Vault Builders.",
			"",
			"Khardajeens rarely work in tandem, though they occasionally cross paths and awkwardly travel together, attracted by similar, inscrutable goals-but without any true allegiance or ability to communicate. A conglomeration of khardajeens is known as a disassembly, for they gather in such numbers only to tear down great works or destroy historically significant objects. A disassembly of khardajeens currently stalks the lowest levels of the Sky Citadel of Kravenkus, their goals a mystery to the dwarves guarding the upper levels of the fortress-city.",
			"",
			"Khardajeens have an odd relationship with the Darklands species known as delvers. Khardajeens can't create their own tunnels' save for very slowly, using their manifested rays-so they rely on delvers to facilitate their travels. How such a union occurs is inexplicable, but many khardajeens silently float behind the ravenous, cavern-digging delvers, waiting until they reach some forgotten Darklands chamber. After the delver completes a tunnel, the khardajeen abandons it and continues its own journey without incident.",
			"",
			"Munavris wage an ongoing conflict against khardajeens. The aberrations glide up from beneath the Sightless Sea to assail the munavris' island cities. The munavri-held region of Beryl Island sees the greatest frequency of these attacks, and dozens of gallant munavris have sacrificed themselves to stymie the khardajeens' advance. The khardajeens concentrate their erratic efforts on pushing into the most secure area of the munavris' holdings: the central city of Valcergos. Attackers have yet to enter the mythical city, but it's only a matter of time before one of the aberrations closes in on whatever draws their attention."

An attended object can make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex, half). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle, torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any means for 24 hours.",

These tricky creatures nearly always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them for trouble-making urchins.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their \"play\" frustrates, harms, or otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more elaborate pranks.",
			"",
			"A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds. Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and climbing tall banyan trees.",
			"",
			"Consummate fishermen, kijimunas while away the hours fishing on the shores of oceans or large lakes. Although they delight in the taste of fish-especially the eyes' they easily grow bored and become distracted, sometimes leaving their fishing spears and a pile of fish to rot onshore. The creatures alleviate their boredom by playing tricks on fishermen and villagers living near their cavern or treetop homes. A kijimuna makes every effort to hide its involvement in the tricks it pulls, more out of a sense of pride about a well-executed joke than fear of reprisal.",
			"",
			"A young kijimuna grows to adulthood in a matter of 5 months, but retains its childish appearance for the entirety of its life. In the unlikely event that its activities don't cause its premature demise, the creature lives for about 15 years. An elderly kijimuna, having reached the ripe old age of 12, settles down and does little else beyond fish in solitude, except perhaps to bargain with children from nearby villages for its catch. It extracts a promise from a child in return for the fish, as well instructions for a devious prank or practical joke to pull on an elder.",
			"",
			"Although their societies and world view differ wildly from those of the goblins of the Inner Sea Region and elsewhere in Golarion, physiologically kijimuna are little different. As true goblinoids, any sort of device, concoction, or magical effect that only affects goblins affects these erratic tricksters as well.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Tribes of kijimunas maintain small lairs in seaside caves, amid groves of banyan trees, or in other secluded, enclosed areas near the shore. Their homes typically stink of rotten fish from catches brought home and promptly forgotten, while the walls often bear halfcompleted diagrams of pranks members intend to pull on neighboring creatures. Kijimunas rarely pull pranks on each other, mostly because they hold their peoples' cleverness in high regard, and believe that it's impossible to trick their own kind. Occasionally, however, some event leaves a kijimuna the victim of some accidental hilarity- well-placed meal scraps left on its face, tripping into a tide pool, falling down-such occurrences are the height of kijimuna comedy.",
			"",
			"Much like their Inner Sea cousins, kijimunas have a strong, bizarre hatred for a particular creature-in this case, the octopus. When faced with octopuses, kijimunas either flee in terror or desperately attack, their whoops and howls vastly exaggerating the threat the cephalopods pose. Kijimunas often share frightening stories about octopuses at night, scaring one another with fearful tales of squirming tentacles and clutching suckers. Occasionally these stories incite groups to action, leading them to go on raids of local tide pools and rocky beaches where the sea creatures regularly lurk. The resulting battles prove loud but brief, with skewered octopuses and the occasional \"hostage\" taken as supplies for the goblinoids' most startling jokes.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas have few strong feelings about other animals, especially as predators more dangerous than large lizards and the occasional hunting cat rarely occupy the same lands that they do. They delight in sharing their homes with large tropical birds, however, a sentiment that is hardly reciprocated, as they frequently employ the creatures (and the creatures' eggs) in their pranks and take endless delight in mimicking the birds' squawking. Spiders, with their numerous legs, are generally avoided by kijimuna, many of which suspect the insects might be just miniature octopuses in disguise.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas share goblins' affinity for fire, but this attraction manifests in a less overtly destructive way. These creatures have developed secret techniques allowing them to befriend small fires, calling such flames to them to light their paths, lead travelers into their pranks, or steal a lantern's ability to hold a light. No kijimunas remember how their people managed to make friends with small fires, just that they did a long time ago. Large fires remain dangerous to kijimunas, however, and not only do they have no power over such blazes, but they generally have nothing pleasant to say about any flame larger than a campfire.",
			"",
			"Kijimunas often form relationships with other humanoids who fish along the same shore. Some befriend such creatures, eagerly sharing all manner of trivial secrets-where the best fishing spots are, what trees grow the stinkiest fruit, and which rocks octopuses hardly ever visit. As a show of friendship, kijimunas make their companions favored targets for particularly embarrassing practical jokes.",
			"",
			"Those of a superstitious bent view kijimunas as evil spirits, pointing to the ghostly flames that often follow the creatures and their mischievous behavior as proof. Once in a while, someone discovers kijimunas' hatred for octopuses and carries one around as a ward. This typically backfires spectacularly, as the kijimunas then focus their ire on the person-who is obviously some sort of octopus spy or ally. Kijimunas reserve their most elaborate tricks for cephalopod sympathizers.",
			"",
			"The only counter to most humanoids' distrust and wariness regarding kijimunas manifests in times of famine or poor fishing seasons. In numerous such cases, a town on the brink of starvation has found its food stores replenished on a daily basis by an energized tribe of kijimunas, as these creatures apply their considerable fishing talents to feed their neighbors. After all, kijimunas realize that corpses are considerably less entertaining than living creatures, especially when serving as the butts of jokes. Thus, most communities accept that if their benefactors happen to play a trick or two on them, matters could be far worse."

			"**Hidey-Hole (Su)** When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she can create an extradimensional space by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or other permanent object (such as a stove). This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the nearest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole.",

			"",
			"Kikimoras are enemies of brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras often invite pain and frustration on their chosen housemates instead of helping chores along. Some brownies actively seek out kikimorainfested homes with the intention of driving out the disruptive fey creatures. When homeowners refuse to appease a resident kikimora (or can't rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora visits upon them a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Because of the subtle tricks these fey employ, inhabitants in homes plagued by kikimoras often believe they have been beset by ghosts.",
			"",
			"Kikimoras love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They proceed to trick the people in the house into leaving gifts in return for making repairs at night, much to the indignation of brownies, who view such gifts as payments for services rendered and resent the kikimoras' transformation of such agreements into coercion."

The kirrix can store up to two types of diseases at a time in an organ near its throat. (A typical kirrix has filth fever and bubonic plague stored.) A kirrix can harmlessly digest an unwanted disease as a full-round action. If the creature consumes a mold or another substance that causes disease, it clears the surface of disease. If it ingests a diseased creature's blood (either by licking an open wound or biting the creature), it can produce an antiplague secretion, which it can use on itself or apply to others.

			"Many ratfolk settlements raise these gregarious creatures, with whom the ratfolk share their warrens in a symbiotic relationship. The kirrixes prowl the ratfolk tunnels and act as scavengers-searching for unfamiliar scents, consuming detritus, and removing harmful diseases from the ratfolk settlement. If the warren comes under attack, the kirrixes act as guards, and squeeze through or block tunnels as necessary to buy time for their ratfolk allies to escape.",

			"**Blizzard Breath (Su)** A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Forlorn Gaze (Su)** As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Ice Walker (Ex)** A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of the kokogiak's dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons.",
			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids, and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique- they lie in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe, snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast. Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire nests in a single flick of the tongue.",
			"",
			"While they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks, kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water's edge serve them well in the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches. Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then, calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid dens.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer climes' abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a kokogiak's mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community, chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the kokogiak's hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community.",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power. More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the kokogiak's waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or more grisly trophies torn from its victims' remains, artfully displayed for the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind them of the price of defiance.",
			"",
			"Kokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals. Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival, struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving parent as its own mate."

While young korir-kokembe may swim near populated waterways to claim their prey, their elder kin prefer more remote backwaters, sloughs, and heavily wooded swamps where they can hunt undisturbed. These degenerate dragons live in a violent symbiosis with the tiny vermin that infest the jungle, hosting colonies of such creatures within their own bodies. Such tiny vermin constantly swarm in and out of the korir-kokembe's gullet, bringing contagion to creatures bitten and allowing the wyrm to expel swarms of pests, or to summon yet more vermin to its aid. While korir-kokembe are capable of flight, they generally prefer to crawl or climb on their eight legs, hunching their bodies like inchworms or twining their coils around their prey while savaging creatures with a barrage of slashing claws."

			"Qwoshokk is an ancient elder kraken who dwells northwest of Cheliax, 2 miles beneath the surface of the water in the Arcadian Ocean's Gartanica Trench. He has laired there for over 3,000 years, excavating the remains of an aboleth palace buried beneath a thin layer of sediment. In addition to uncovering the relics of his enemies, Qwoshokk devotes much of his time to restoring an aboleth machine called the Cholcorite Mechanism, using a rare kind of agate found off the Chelish coast to repair the engine. Once he has completed his work on the device, he believes it will grant him immortality and the power to dominate all the denizens of the sea, at which point he will take his ambitions to the surface world.",
			"",
			"While Qwoshokk's work on the Cholcorite Mechanism is almost finished, he fears he needs one more item to complete the device-an artifact of great power that will jump-start the Mechanism's arcane energies. Qwoshokk knows that to the north of the Gartanica Trench once stood the empire of Thassilon, and he has constructed a plan to excavate great chunks of the Fenwall Mountains of southern Varisia, seeking whatever unknowable treasures may lurk beneath the stone. Already, he has procured the aid of several influential land-dwellers who have promised to help him find the artifact, frightened into submission when the immense kraken appeared at the shore of their seaside towns promising destruction to all those who did not obey him.",
			"",
			"Having worked on the Cholcorite Mechanism for millennia, Qwoshokk was able to extract several unnecessary parts out of the device for his personal use. Among them are his crown and armlets, items which he's bonded to his flesh to give him power over lightning as well as to enhance his ability to summon and control creatures with weak minds."

			"**Capture (Su)** If Krampus begins its turn grappling a Medium or smaller creature, it can stuff the target into its bag as a swift action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature stuffed into this bag is subjected to Krampus's regression ability (see below). A creature in the bag can try to cut its way free with any light slashing weapon. The bag has AC 25, hardness 20, and 30 hit points. If a creature cuts its way out of the bag, Krampus can repair the bag as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Until then, any creature stuffed into the bag is still subjected to the regression ability but can escape with a move action that provokes an attack of opportunity from Krampus. The bag has other special qualities while in Krampus's possession. The weight of creatures in the bag doesn't count against Krampus's carrying capacity. Up to four Small creatures or two Medium creatures can fit in the bag at a time. If used by any creature other than Krampus, the container functions as a mundane sack. If Krampus's bag is lost or destroyed, it can create a new bag with 1 hour of work.",
			"",
			"**Limited Immortality (Su)** Though Krampus still needs to eat, drink, and sleep, it doesn't age and can't die of old age. If Krampus is killed, a new Krampus forms elsewhere in the world after a year's time-this new Krampus retains the memories of the previous Krampus and likely holds a grudge against the person who killed it the year before. If a method to disrupt this cycle exists, it has yet to be discovered by mortals.",
			"",
			"**Mystical Chains (Su)** Krampus's chains function as a +3 spiked chain and also count as an evil weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. These chains become non-magical if Krampus does not carry or wield them, and if a chain is disarmed or destroyed, Krampus can create a new set of chains as a standard action. The chains react almost as a living extension of Krampus's will and have the grab ability.",
			"",
			"**Punish the Naughty (Su)** As a swift action, Krampus can designate a single target it can see as being \"naughty.\" The target must be a child, a creature with the young template, or a victim of Krampus's regression ability. Against that target, Krampus gains a +5 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks. These bonuses remain in effect until the target is dead or Krampus designates another target as naughty.",
			"",
			"**Regression (Su)** Each round a creature begins its turn stuffed into Krampus's bag, it must succeed at a DC 32 Fortitude saving throw or be regressed back to its childhood. The creature is affected in size as if via reduce person, but none of the target's gear changes size. This effect persists for 24 hours, after which the target regains its original size. A creature currently under the effects of regression cannot be further affected by this ability. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

However, thanks to Krampus's twisted morality, it sees selfishness and incivility everywhere it goes.",
			"",
			"Krampus is a tall, goatlike humanoid with large horns and a long tongue that constantly lolls out of one side of its mouth or the other. Though its natural attacks are powerful enough to break bones, Krampus also carries a set of iron chains that it uses to thrash and grapple its foes. The oversized bag it carries is often stained with the blood of its captured victims. Krampus stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"The origins of Krampus are shrouded in mystery, with stories of the creature seeming to stretch back hundreds or even thousands of years, if not more. To the beleaguered regions under Krampus's tyranny, the creature has simply always been around.",
			"",
			"The most popular legend regarding Krampus's beginnings starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After several harsh winters that the townsfolk almost didn't survive, they came to doubt the rituals that the druids believed appeased the local nature spirits. As the villagers grew more and more resentful, the druids took drastic action. They attempted to create a central figure for the important winter rituals that would make people want to celebrate them. Under the light of a blue moon, one of the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and brought forth the essence of a spirit of revenge, and a new creature was born-Krampus.",
			"",
			"For a while, Krampus was everything the druids wanted. It brought together the villagers in revelry during the day and left small gifts of fruit for them in the night. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' hateful emotions and bitter resentment, which began to stain the creature's soul. Krampus began punishing those who behaved selfishly during these lean times, first simply striking them with bundles of birch, but then escalating to using magic to transform them into the petulant children it saw them as. Eventually, it came to see everyone as wicked and terrorized the villages for weeks.",
			"",
			"The remainder of the druidic circle managed to locate the creature as it slept and shackled it in cold iron chains, believing it still retained a part of its fey nature. They were wrong. When Krampus awoke, the creature tore free from its restraints and used those same chains to beat the druids to death. It then retreated into the snow-blanketed forest for the remainder of the season.",
			"",
			"Krampus returned year after year, growing stronger and more hideous with each winter solstice and gaining a taste for humanoid flesh. Even its periodic \"death\" at the hands of heroes did nothing to stop this cycle. Fortunately, while it could ravage the countryside all year long, for some reason it chooses to limit its predations to the winter months. Where it goes the rest of the year, no one has been able to discover."

			"**Skullface (Su)** As a standard action, a krenshar can pull the skin back from its face, revealing the musculature and bony structures of its skull. This counts as using Intimidate to demoralize an opponent, and is an extraordinary ability. The krenshar can emit a loud screech while peeling back its skin, causing potent fear in a single creature within 100 feet that can see the krenshar. The targeted creature must make a DC 12 Will save or become frightened (if the target has 6 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken (if the target has more than 6 Hit Dice) for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same krenshar's skullface ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"Krenshar's retractable skin allows it to dine on carrion with a lower risk of picking up disease-carrying vermin, much like a vulture's bare head and neck. When the creature finishes eating, restoring the facial skin to its normal position scrapes off gore and clinging bugs. The ability to retract their skin is demonstrated in other contexts as well-male krenshars bare their skulls at rivals as a challenge over mates, females use this ability to ward off undesired suitors, and hunting adults use it to scare prey into ambushes.",
			"",
			"Though krenshars generally prefer to stalk herd animals like deer or cattle, they have no qualms about taking on humanoids when food is scarce. They average 4 to 5 feet in length and weigh approximately 175 pounds.",
			"",
			"Scholars have long debated the confusing nature of krenshar intelligence. While clearly more intelligent than mere animals, the creatures seem to lack all but the most rudimentary language of snarls and yowls, and aside from the scare tactics that make them notorious, tend to behave much like mundane cats or wolves, even going so far as to occasionally be befriended by rangers or druids. Those who deny krenshars' intelligence, however, need only look into their strange violet eyes or observe the ease with which they manipulate and outmaneuver their prey to realize their folly-an error few make twice."

			"**Bloodfruit (Su)** Fruit-bearing plants in a kudimmu's field produce sickly, misshapen, blood-red versions of normal fruits of the same variety. An undead creature can consume a kudimmu's bloodfruit in place of whatever bodily material it normally hungers for, whether blood, flesh, or something else. Doing so temporarily sates the undead creature's hunger, but does not provide any other benefits normally gained from consumption. Upon consuming bloodfruit, an undead creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or fall under the kudimmu's control, as per control undead. A living creature treats bloodfruit as [a drug](rule/drugs_and_addiction) with the following statistics: type ingested; addiction severe, Fortitude DC 25; effects 1 hour; +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against necromancy spells and effects, fester as per the spell (caster level 24th); damage 1d4 Con. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Bombardment (Su)** A kudimmu can produce bloodfruit from its body, which are charged with negative energy and can be thrown as splash weapons. These bloodfruit deal 8d6 points of negative energy damage on a direct hit, and 8 points of damage to creatures adjacent to the targeted square. A successful DC 25 Will saving throw halves this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** A creature killed by the kudimmu's blood drain ability or by Constitution damage accrued through consuming bloodfruit rises as a vampire spawn under the kudimmu's control 1d4 days later. A kudimmu can have a number of enslaved spawn totaling at most double its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead.",
			"",
			"**Fieldbound (Ex, Sp, Su)** A kudimmu can designate an area of natural vegetation up to 100 feet by 100 feet per side as its field, fusing the root systems of the area's plants into an interconnected mass. While in physical contact with the ground of its field, a kudimmu gains fast healing 15, tremorsense, and a 15-foot burrow speed. Additionally, the kudimmu can teleport to any location in its field as per dimension door. Spells and effects that attempt to alter the field's earth or vegetation must overcome the kudimmu's spell resistance to succeed. The kudimmu is physically dependent on its field, as the root system beneath it is in many ways an extension of the kudimmu's body. A kudimmu separated from its field for more than 24 hours instantly decays into a lump of inanimate matter. A kudimmu that is slain or destroyed reforms in the ground beneath its field in a process that takes 1d10 days to complete. To prevent a kudimmu from reviving, its field must be sown with salt or destroyed by magic (merely destroying the surface plants is not sufficient-the roots must also be entirely destroyed). A kudimmu must maintain its field with the blood of the living. The field must soak up the blood of a Medium or larger creature once per week. For each week the kudimmu fails to feed its field, it takes 2 points of Constitution damage. This damage cannot be healed until the kudimmu feeds its field. A kudimmu can designate a new field once per month in a process that takes 1 hour to complete. It can have only one active field at a time.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"When a city is destroyed, it is customary for the conquering army to sow salt or thorns to render the ground forever infertile and curse those who would dare to rebuild. In most cases, this is simply a symbolic gesture. However, this ritual has eminently practical roots. Death and devastation are potent seeds, and the blood of conquered peoples can mingle with the roots of burned fields to produce terrible creatures. These are called kudimmus, twisted weeds that corrupt the ground of vanquished cities and exact a terrible price upon invaders.",
			"",
			"A kudimmu's body is diffused throughout its field, and it can weigh tens of thousands of pounds. Its primary fruiting body is vaguely humanoid in shape, standing 10 feet tall and weighing 4,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"Most of the fruit a kudimmu produces is tainted by sinister magic. While this does not affect the taste or nutritional value of the fruit, it does leave them misshapen and renders any seeds inside dead. Kudimmus can, however, produce viable fruit should they choose to do so. These fruit are identical to their normal bloodfruit in every way, except that the seeds of these fruit sprout into new kudimmus if planted into unconsecrated ground. Kudimmus rarely use this ability, as more kudimmus in the world means more competition for food. However, if a kudimmu feels its life is threatened or it knows it will soon be attacked, it can send one of its undead minions to plant its seeds in a distant field to ensure the continuation of its line.",
			"",
			"These monstrous plants require fresh sources of blood for their fields and thus prey on humanoid settlements to survive. Some kudimmus can make do with the blood of animals for a short time, but they do not find this subsistence living agreeable and almost always seek out farms or other civilized places to make their homes. Some kudimmus consume communities without care and live nomadic lives, always searching for fresh hunting grounds. Other kudimmus are more cautious and cunning, cultivating humanoid populations much as farmers tend to their crops.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once a kudimmu establishes itself in a field, it uses its addictive bloodfruit to conquer nearby settlements. If the local populace seems unwilling to eat the misshapen fruit, the kudimmu may leave its field at night to poison other fields and bring about a famine. Once one or two individuals fall under the kudimmu's control, it sends its new vampiric minions to strong-arm or convert the town's leadership.",
			"",
			"Competition for feeding grounds keeps kudimmus from cooperating with each other. In fact, kudimmus often squabble over territory. As kudimmus are usually unwilling to leave their fields and fight powerful rivals on their own, these wars are fought through proxies, often the kudimmus' vampiric minions.",
			"",
			"As kudimmus prey on humans, so too do the undead prey on kudimmus. Usually this is to the plants' benefit, as any undead that feed on their fruit eventually fall under their spell and strengthen their influence over the countryside. However, particularly strong-willed undead can resist the effects of kudimmus' bloodfruit and exploit the plants as an alternative to hunting humanoids."

Kurobozus need to feed upon the breath of mortals to survive, and they usually acquire this sustenance by sneaking up on a sleeping victim, though they can just as easily draw breath from a foe stunned by their fists in combat. While this feeding doesn't immediately kill the victim, it leaves a horrific rotting scent on the victim's breath that can spread the kurobozu's contagious apoxia to others, eventually leading to faintness, exhaustion, and death.",
			"",
			"When they aren't maintaining their existence through feeding, kurobozus carry out their jealous fantasies by murdering living monks, especially members of their former monastery or monastic tradition. They still possess a shred of their former discipline, which they use to formulate long-term plans for their acts of revenge. Generally, kurobozus' interactions with other creatures are limited to feeding and killing, but they have an affinity for malcontent ex-monks and may actually go out of their way to secretly offer protection or succor to such a person, without ever revealing their true identities. Evil ex-monks seeking to destroy their former masters and fellow disciples may even see the actual face of their benefactors and be able to forge lasting alliances."

The exiled kyranas then split up and wander the surrounding tunnels, traveling hundreds of miles in search of any source of heat. That means they often come waddling into inhabited areas, snorting and ready to burn anyone standing between them and the hearth.

These kytons are invariably more powerful than the one presented here, often having spell-like abilities or hideous and unsettling special attacks along the themes of torture and pain. Rumor holds that the most powerful kytons are completely inhuman, and that these monsters are the true progenators of the kyton race-the kyton presented here but the result of unholy dalliances with their unfortunate victims.",

			"#### Description",

			"The term \"sadistic\" is synonymous with kytons, who are known for their innate cruelty and capacity to gain pleasure from the suffering of others. However, an apocrisiarius kyton considers inflicting pain and suffering nothing more than a tool to reach what truly intrigues it-the purest form of a single truth. An apocrisiarius typically appears as a human whose eyes are blank, white orbs. Tears of blood weep from its eyes-physical evidence of the sorrow it has tasted over the ages from dreadful truths torn from the flesh and mind of its countless victims. The dozens of surgical lancets that pierce an apocrisiarius's body do the creature no harm, and the holes these instruments leave are as bloodless as they are deep. The kyton operates on those it captures with these lancets; these fiends prefer to use torture and vivisection to carve away both physically and metaphorically at their victims until all that remains is the one nugget of information they desire-a pure truth, unadulterated by extraneous life.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Kyton](family/kyton)",

			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"So obsessed with truths are these single-minded fiends that they exude a supernatural aura that causes others nearby to be unable to lie as well. For apocrisiariuses, speaking a truth is the greatest pleasure they can achieve, particularly if those to whom it is spoken suffer from the revelation. Laying bare the most damning of secrets, particularly those that have existed only in a cloak of lies, is to apocrisiariuses like the completion of a masterpiece. A truth, once spoken, is but wind and sound and ends once the breath used to fuel it expires, yet the effects upon those who hear such words can outlast even the finest work of art. To the apocrisiarius kyton, the wounds caused by such cutting truths are the finest vintage of suffering one can inflict. As outsiders, these fiends don't need to eat to survive, yet an apocrisiarius kyton denied the opportunity to extract a hidden truth for too long grows emotionally starved. Such kytons suffer no physical effects from this metaphorical starvation, but might well agree to things they otherwise would not (such as releasing a prisoner or revealing information they have been entrusted with) in return for someone admitting before them and allies a truth that shames and hurts those who hear it.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Because apocrisiariuses see themselves as seekers of truth, they tend to hold themselves apart from other kytons out of a haughty sense of superiority. This arrogance is sometimes answered with extravagant punishments meted out by more powerful kytons of other types, but apocrisiariuses take these brutal reprisals with equanimity, seeing such persecution as acts of jealousy, and further justification of their pursuit of truth.",
			"",
			"Though apocrisiariuses are native to the Plane of Shadow, they frequent the Material Plane with distressing regularity. On occasion they hire themselves out to those who require the services of a skilled torturers and interrogators, but they are used most often as messengers and diplomats, particularly in the political mazes of Nidal. Those aware of apocrisiariuses know that they are incapable of uttering falsehoods, and so messages delivered by them are beyond corruption or confusion. If a noble's conjured apocrisiarius reports to another an offer of alliance, the recipient can rest assured that the source has no duplicity in mind, at least for the moment. Others use these kytons as lie detectors, by either simply capitalizing on their truth auras when interrogating nearby subjects, or asking an allied apocrisiarius to repeat a phrase. If that phrase contains a lie, the kyton cannot repeat it. Of course, these kytons have no additional insights as to why such phrases are lies, and indeed, they have even been known to willfully ignore requests to repeat things they know to be true if doing so can further their own complex plans. To an apocrisiarius, strategically withholding a truth can be far more potent than a lie ever could be.",
			"",
			"Because of their inherent ability to recognize lies, apocrisiariuses are often used as emissaries between the governments of Nidal and Cheliax. If Nidalese diplomats wish to assure Cheliax that their darkened nation poses no threat, they send one of these fiends. The Chelish government accepts whatever the kyton says as truth, knowing that it can't utter falsehoods even if the Nidalese diplomat somehow tricked the kyton.",
			"",
			"An apocrisiarius' victims are particularly unfortunate souls, for these kytons have no interest in their prisoners' well-being after truths have been extracted. Indeed, apocrisiariuses have been known to deliberately avoid acquiring the desired information in a timely manner in order to maximize the amount of time they can spend tormenting their victims, under the theory that only when a being has nothing else to cling to does the truth it conceals become pure. This does mean that in cases where a creature might hold multiple secrets, an apocrisiarius may not be the best choice for the job. These kytons excel at extracting the truth, but often their subjects do not survive beyond uttering their first revelations."

Then, their frightening gaze matches the deadly intent of the chains piercing their flesh. These animated, wrought iron bands serve as protection and weapons in the hands or claws of all kytons, but may also bind and lash their victims to the ephialtes' ever-bleeding hide to carry them into the Great Beyond.

			"As long as a conjurer doesn't interrupt an ongoing hunt, most ephialtes kytons relish being summoned, looking forward to the sport of chasing down newly assigned prey or punishing those who fail to properly bind them. Any Charisma check made as part of the greater planar binding spell to convince an ephialtes kyton to undertake a mission other than the murder, abduction, or torture of specific victims suffers a -2 penalty.",
			"",
			"Once an ephialtes kyton accepts an assignment, it demands 1,000 gp paid in black onyx or opals for every Hit Die its target possesses. If the summoner cannot pay the price in the required gems, the kyton only partially carries out the requested service-maiming instead of murdering, abducting for only a limited time (typically 1d4+3 days), or only torturing a victim until it answers a single question as part of an interrogation. If a summoner tries to force an ephialtes kyton to perform a different type of service or accept a different form of payment, the kyton takes offense and all of the summoner's future Charisma-related interactions with the ephialtes suffer a -2 penalty.",
			"",
			"Once an ephialtes kyton has agreed to a task, only its assigned prey interests it. Ephialtes kytons always offer to dispose of such victims by taking them to the Shadow Plane so they can help lesser kytons obtain the necessary number of souls to become ephialtes.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated of kytons, having inflicted such massive damage to themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments are all that holds the creature's mutilated flesh together, yet they do so with a strength far greater than that granted by mortal flesh and bone.",
			"",
			"Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire only the most powerful beings to augment themselves with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane in search of the most promising additions to their bodily collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that possess a so-called \"perfect part,\" the powerful kyton seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite, these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they merely enhance the horror that the creature represents.",
			"",
			"While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection of their targets as well as introspection regarding their own powers and identity, their primary occupation is the understanding of pain and suffering, which they pursue by inflicting the most heinous cruelties upon their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own flesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to experience the pain alongside it.",
			"",
			"While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist in harvesting an even more interesting catch, an eremite can sometimes be convinced to let the helpful victim escape. It's worth remembering, though, that kytons as a whole have little patience for the petty pursuits of honor and pride, seeing such feelings as traits that ultimately spell the end for baser creatures. The only thing that matters to an eremite is the testing of its boundaries as well as the boundaries of existence itself. Just because an eremite might be convinced to let someone go in trade for an opportunity for a greater catch doesn't mean that once that other target is secured the eremite will cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original target. One who manages to distract and subsequently escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his life on the run.",
			"",
			"A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft particularly unusual pieces of flesh to their bodies from increasingly exotic victims.",
			"",
			"### Eremite Overlords",
			"",
			"Eremites who surpass the limits of individuality and achieve dominion over a certain realm of the Plane of Shadow are referred to as eremite overlords. An overlord has focused on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure. Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues.",
			"",
			"Each overlord is a unique Large (or larger) eremite with several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act of skinning itself and wrapping its flesh in thorny black vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns, and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.",

Libitinariis often wear robes of draping chains, though most prominent on their persons are the horrific icicles that pierce their flesh. Although they are as adept at wielding traditional weapons as any humanoid, they typically favor using these icicles as thrown weapons.",

			"",
			"According to infernal lore, libitinariis sprang fully formed from the frozen reaches of the Shadow Plane the moment that Doloras freed the rest of their kind from Hell. Not all kytons or scholars agree on the impetus of this creation story-some believe that a frozen tear fell from Doloras's crown upon her shattering of the kytons' prison, reverberating throughout the planes to create these new servants to enact an aspect of her will. Regardless, libitinariis have since spread throughout the Shadow Plane, Hell, the Material Plane, the Dark Tapestry, and other locales to enact their vision of perfection through painful, frozen preservation.",
			"",
			"Libitinariis are farsighted, dispassionate, and coldly rational. Many live in the realm of Frozen Tears, where they may spend centuries simply formulating a plan to please the White Death and advance their standing in his unholy court by a mere inch. Other libitinariis attempt to carve out small niches in the frozen wastes of Cocytus in Hell. Those libitinarii who call the Material Plane home typically do so as leaders of cults of Doloras or Inkariax. Some, however, hide in plain sight among society, masquerading as normal-if unsavory- scholars and artisans while secretly working to torment, freeze, and preserve their enemies as fantastic trophies to their own wicked ingenuity.",

			"Libitinariis are relatively solitary, but regardless of where they operate, they are ritual-minded creatures. Most enjoy tormenting victims to the brink of death with their razor-sharp icicles several times before finally using their supernatural abilities to freeze the creatures permanently. Some work profane religious aspects into these rituals of torment, and others seek specifically to secure frozen prizes for the glory of their patrons. If the libitinariis have a weak point, it might be considered their predictability in pursuing habits cultivated over decades or centuries.",
			"",
			"An infamous libitinarii ritual is the Rite of Piercing, which is common practice in the realm of Frozen Tears. In this ritual, libitinariis drive foot-long nails of ice through the flesh of victims they have determined to be morally pure. When the victims reach the point of death, the kytons then freeze them into icy statues and arrange them into unholy menageries."

As a move action, a phylacator can move a single set of manacles within 180 feet up to 30 feet in any direction, but if a creature is locked in the manacles, the phylacator must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against the creature to move it.

			"Phylacator kytons serve as jailers, torturers, and executioners in the most terrible prisons across the planes. Although a phylacator normally relies on its intimidating presence and booming voice to quell its charges, phylacators also enjoy violence and relish opportunities to quash riots. In combat, a phylacator knocks foes to the ground with its flail and pummels them into submission, relishing the painful feedback it receives when using its weapon. Against fleeing foes, a phylacator hurls manacles it magically animates, incapacitating its foes until it can recover them at it leisure. Since a phylacator is often responsible for keeping prisoners alive, it frequently uses nonlethal tactics-but that doesn't mean it is any less brutal or efficient in its methods.",

For ages, the phylacators' vigilance in maintaining security has been absolute. Wherever phylacators serve, they maintain a thorough knowledge of all chambers and passages, every lock and bar, and the habits of each other warden and guard.",
			"",
			"Phylacators are deeply familiar with the sufferings mortal minds experience while imprisoned and are experts at provoking maddening desperation in even the most resigned prisoners. As a form of entertainment, a phylacator sometimes allows the most intelligent of its prisoners to think he has found a way to escape, such as by creating predictable patterns of guard shifts, instructing officials to seem to be susceptible to bribes, or appearing to overlook access points near supply routes. After letting a prisoner plan for weeks, months, or even years, those avenues are closed at the last minute to catch the prisoner in the act of escape, after which he is publicly tortured to serve as an example to others.",
			"",
			"As powerful as they are, phylacators have a significant vulnerability. Every night, a phylacator must remove its armor and sit in a torture device known as an iron chair to shed its blood in tribute to Zon-Kuthon. This device is a dull metal throne covered with hundreds of spikes all over the back, seat, and leg-rests.

Failing to do so after a single instance of correction is sufficient to earn a phylacator's ire.",
			"",
			"A select few phylacators are bound to the Material Plane to serve as jailers for military prisons or other high-security detention facilities. A spellcaster can bound a phylacator only with powerful spells such as [planar ally, greater](spell/planar_ally_greater) or [greater planar binding](spell/greater_planar_binding). A conjurer that knows a phylacator's proper name can promise the phylacator sanction over not less than 100 good or chaotic creatures and ownership of the corpses of prisoners executed under the phylacator's jurisdiction. If these criteria are met, a phylacator serves willingly and obediently for 1 year. A phylacator might serve longer for a larger prison population, or increasingly sadistic authority over the prisoners.",
			"",
			"Most phylacators on Golarion serve evil dictators or wicked cults, although a few secretly serve less despicable benefactors who use the outsiders to keep dangerous criminals securely locked away. For instance, many Nidalese know of phylacators serving in Pangolais, but rumors that taxmasters of Abadar employ a phylacator in a secret correctional installation beneath Oppara are stridently denied by the church."

			"",
			"**Configuration of Chains (Ex)** As a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a suffragan can choose the configuration of the blades and chains sprouting from its amputated limbs. The suffragan's configuration of chains affects its number of attacks, its reach, its base speed, and its climb speed, in addition to affecting other statistics or granting additional abilities, depending on the configuration. The configurations available to the suffragan are described below, and the suffragan retains the selected configuration until it spends a swift action to change it. Most suffragans frequently use the old form configuration, which is reflected in the statistics above.",
			"",
			"- Midnight's Blessing Configuration: The suffragan rolls onto its back and extends all of its chains and whips to their full lengths. The kyton can make up to eight bladed limb attacks each round and has a reach of 10 feet. Its base speed and climb speed are 5 feet.",
			"- Old Form Configuration: The suffragan uses the chains and whips sprouting from the stumps of its amputated legs to walk. The kyton can make up to four bladed limb attacks each round and gains the trip special ability with its bladed limb attacks. Its base speed and climb speed are both 30 feet, and it gains a +4 bonus to its CMD against trip combat maneuvers.",
			"- Prowler Configuration: The suffragan uses most of its chains and whips for locomotion while hunched low to the ground like a beetle. The kyton can make up to two bladed limb attacks each round. Its base speed and climb speed are both 50 feet, and it gains the pounce ability as well as a +8 bonus to its CMD against bull rush, reposition, or trip combat maneuvers.",
			"",
			"**Slow Fall (Ex)** A suffragan in any configuration can use its bladed whips and chains to slow its fall. When within reach of a wall, a suffragan can slow its descent and fall any distance without harm.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Born from the twisted souls of the Joyful Things - Zon-Kuthon's most devoted zealots - suffragans appear as humanoid torsos with chains or barbed whips sprouting from the stumps of their amputated arms and legs. Suffragans display an uncanny ability to reconfigure their barbed limbs to suit any task at hand. When desperate or when fighting a cornered foe, most suffragans roll onto their backs to strike with a tempest of chains and whips. Albeit uncommon, other suffragan configurations include wings or fins made of interlocked limbs.",
			"",
			"A suffragan's face is as much a horrific fusion of metal and flesh as its body. Barbed blades droop from its mouth, its tongue replaced with jagged metal that undulates eerily.",
			"",
			"Like all kytons, suffragans delight in inflicting terror and suffering, particularly upon the pure and weak. They enjoy giving captives small, overlapping, painful lashes with their barbs and blades. Suffragans often refer to their torturous work as blessings they are bestowing on their cruel god's behalf, though their words are garbled around their mouth blades.",
			"",
			"A suffragan kyton stands about 5 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds.",
			"",
			"Suffragan kytons are born from the souls of [Joyful Things](monster/joyful_thing) who were so warped and depraved in their post-ritual transformations that they became true servants of Zon-Kuthon: kytons. Newly created suffragans lack appendages, but they quickly and eagerly embrace the kyton desire to improve their flesh. For suffragans, this means affixing chains and whips to their stumps. As the creatures had long ago shed their attachment to typical human forms, suffragans learn how to reconfigure their limbs as needed to suit the task at hand.",
			"",
			"Suffragans take pride in the bladed metal drooping from their mouths, replacing those components frequently with longer, sharper, or more brightly colored pieces of metal. They understand that their distinctive facial features evoke revulsion or even fascination in others, but they typically misinterpret this attention as adoration rather than horror.",
			"",
			"Suffragans serve loyally as functionaries and majordomos to eremites in the massive sanctuaries to Zon-Kuthon on the Plane of Shadow. The suffragans skitter about these echoing structures, carrying about their various tasks with fervent devotion.",
			"",
			"Suffragans have no need to eat or drink, and they are often so long out of the habit-having been fed through feeding tubes or magic while they were mortal-that they seem to have entirely forgotten how to. Suffragans understand that other creatures must eat, and they take delight in preparing what they believe to be elaborate meals for their mortal victims. Unfortunately, a suffragan's ideas of food range from the unusual (such as a bowl of moth wings) to the gruesome (such as lumps of flesh cut from the suffragan's torso).",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Kyton](family/kyton)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Even among the inscrutable kytons, suffragans have a particularly alien mind-set. Suffragans don't feel at all bound by the humanoid shape; they switch between climbing, crawling, and walking without much thought. When suffragans deign to take on humanoid forms, they seem to have forgotten how to move in that form, walking with painfully twisted torsos or in a disturbing crouch. Other kytons often find suffragans' zealous dedication to Zon-Kuthon off-putting and prefer to assign them to minor tasks or other busywork to keep them occupied and out of the way. Suffragans tend to take great pride in these tasks, no matter how menial, believing they are loyally serving more powerful or devout kytons.",
			"",
			"Suffragans often serve as torturers or jailors and take a particular, sadistic glee in the pain they inflict upon mortal victims. Generally, kytons utilize torture now as an end to itself, but rather as a gateway to a perverse form of enlightenment or as a debasing method of dominance. Suffragans blur this line, however. They are among the cruelest pain inflictors and the most zealous Kuthite servants among their kind. They believe that their own bodily transformations-as well as the excruciating pain they have endured and continue to suffer-are the purest and most powerful method of worshiping the Midnight Lord. Thus, they seek to perpetuate this evil obeisance through inflicting what they refer to as the blessings of Zon-Kuthon upon any who fall into their grasp.",
			"",
			"As suffragans switch easily and naturally between their configurations, they are often quite comfortable with other creatures that have malleable forms. Suffragans particularly like oozes, keeping them as pampered pets when possible and feeding them cast-off bits of flesh or the remains of their victims. Suffragans find doppelgangers and faceless stalkers intriguing, and such captives might earn an opportunity to escape by promising an entertaining display of shape-shifting."

They lurk within dark places in the Abyss and in similarly lightless places on the Material Plane near rifts to their home plane. Their bulbous, unblinking eyes are vaguely froglike, and are often the last things unprepared adventurers see, as the pesky creatures are fond of wrapping their wings around their victims' heads to blind their prey. Their tiny mouths house thick tongues that flick about in the presence of prey.",
			"",

Though lamhigyns are typically encountered flying, on the ground they stand on four insectile legs that they keep tucked beneath them while nesting. Although they are small, their 2-foot-high, 8-pound bodies are impressive sights when hurtling through the air at their victims.",
			"",
			"When it comes to their own kind, lamhigyns can be quite volatile. In general, they tend to get along with other lamhigyns, though almost anything can set them off. When this happens, lamhigyns unleash the full force of their chaotic fury on each other, stinging and grappling until only one-or sometimes none-of the bizarre creatures remain.",
			"",
			"When they're not fighting among themselves, lamhigyns live together in noisy, flapping hives, waiting for hapless creatures to stumble into their dens. When it comes to victims, lamhigyns prefer those that can think and walk, for they provide the most deliciously terrified reactions. There is nothing lamhigyns love more than injecting their mind-numbing toxin into terrified victims while they ineffectually scream and flail. Lamhigyns ignore most normal animals unless they have waited too long for fresh prey and have grown bored. Sometimes, however, a particularly large hive of lamhigyns will attempt to bring down large, imposing creatures simply for the challenge of it."

			"These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors. Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts, but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect.",
			"",
			"Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate prey both small and large. In the extreme mountainous areas they inhabit, such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountain aurochs, and even the occasional mountaineer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals dead and rotting.",
			"",
			"Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of desolate mountain ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or \"gluttonies.\" They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to many mountainous regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters strive to remain well out of sight of landbound races, which they mistrust and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again."

Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals.

			"Twisted in mind and form, lamp blighters have been corrupted by their own hatred for civilization and its encroachment upon lands that were once wild. Named for their practice of darkening lamps to draw victims close and also their love of ripping out eyes with their vicious claws, they take out this hatred upon inhabitants of border villages and towns, amplifying fear of the dark in the places they bedevil.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters stand 2 feet tall fully when upright, though they are usually hunched over and flying at eye level of their victims, and they weigh about 20 pounds.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters were once pixies who chose to remain in their ancestral lands in the face of civilization's relentless expansion. Embittered and resentful of what they saw as an attack upon their way of life, these fey developed malice and anger that transformed their bodies: their bright colors faded, their teeth and claws elongated and sharpened, and their minds turned to vengeance. To those who study these creatures, such as scholars of the Sincomakti School of Sciences in Rozenport, lamp blighters are evidence of the pliant nature of the fey and how they can be shaped by both their environment and their personalities. Some such researchers go so far as to theorize that lamp blighters have internalized the corruption and change of certain declining civilized societies, a transformation that mirrors the physical and mental shift from pixie to lamp blighter.",
			"",
			"Tales of lamp blighters are rare near well-established communities with a strong military presence, though should a once-prosperous settlement start to allow its defenses to weaken and nature to reclaim disused districts, lamp blighters have been known to become bolder and bolder as they work to remove the longstanding source of their anger. In particular, lamp blighters frequently haunt the southern edges of the Verduran Forest, where entire towns have been abandoned thanks to their efforts.",
			"",
			"In a lamp blighter's mind, nothing symbolizes the crushing pressure of civilization like fixed points of light. The stars glittering in the heavens, the glowing pulse of a firefly, and even forest fires brought about by lightning strikes-these are all in motion in accordance with some natural order. Torches fitted to walls, posts with continual flame cast upon them, and hanging lanterns, however, represent to lamp blighters the contrived attempts of civilization to control nature and to bring the assumed safety of light to all places at all times. By their own twisted logic, lamp blighters believe that by terrifying their enemies by extinguishing their lights and plucking out their eyes, they give their victims just what they think they desire: a world of perfect, orderly nothingness.",
			"",
			"While they prefer to spend much of their time invisible, a favorite tactic of a lamp blighter is to become visible, use [disguise self](spell/disguise_self) to take the form of a pixie, and then shyly introduce itself to a town's residents. After it manages to build trust with these residents over the course of days or even weeks, the lamp blighter viciously turns on them, attacking when they least expect it, like a friendly dog suddenly turned feral. Brutal attacks like these are often preceded by what appears at first to be simple accidents. Those near one of these subtle infestations notice streetlights snuffed and entire streets thrown into darkness at inopportune times, often leading to accidents such as cart crashes and falls down steps.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters prefer to live in wild areas just outside of frontier villages and towns, but they spend much of their time within those same villages and towns, working to spread fear. They build nests in hollow trees, decorating them with the eyes of the creatures they have attacked.",
			"",
			"Lamp blighters are usually solitary, driven as they are by immediate desires to harm and terrify rather than establishing any long-term communities of their own. Occasionally a lamp blighter with a particularly strong will takes command of a group of gremlins, but those arrangements usually result in general mayhem rather than focused effort. Bogeymen sometimes partner for short periods with lamp blighters, though the more brazen and direct approach of the lamp blighter means a bogeyman often uses the corrupted creature as cover and distraction for its own activities.",
			"",
			"For their part, pixies look upon lamp blighters with a mixture of nervousness and pity: they worry that what has happened to their former kin could happen to them, but they also have deep compassion for their lost cousins. Although individually less powerful and dangerous than lamp blighters, pixies are rumored to sometimes organize raiding parties and set out to capture lamp blighters, restraining them as they attempt to turn them away from evil. Whether any lamp blighter has ever been redeemed in this way-or any other-is unknown."

			"**Genius Loci (Su)** As a free action, a lar can possess any inanimate object with which it comes into contact, thereby animating it under its control. The object and lar merge, taking on the statistics of an animated object of the same size. A lar may possess any object of Tiny to Large size. If the animated object is destroyed or targeted by dispel good, the lar is expelled and takes 1d6 points of damage per size category of the possessed object-1d6 for a Tiny object, 2d6 for a Small object, and so on. The lar is then free to possess another object, if one is available. If a lar is reduced to 0 hit points or fewer, it is banished to its statua for 24 hours, after which it is fully healed. If the lar does not have a statua, or the statua is destroyed while it is at 0 or fewer hit points, the lar is killed.",
			"",
			"**Natural Invisibility (Su)** This ability is constant, allowing a lar to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject to the invisibility purge spell.",
			"",
			"**Statua (Su)** All lares rely on a small stone figure, known as a statua, for survival. This figurine serves as a lar's home, resting place, and tie to the Material Plane. Lares typically rest within their statua, finding it a comfortable place from which to oversee their surroundings. For every round a lar spends doing nothing besides resting within its statua, it regenerates 1 point of damage. However, being separated from the statua for extended periods of time weakens the lar. For every 5 hours a lar remains outside of its statua, it takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Only returning to the statua can heal this damage. If a lar falls to 0 hit points, even from nonlethal damage, it is banished back to the Upper Planes. While a lar's statua exists, the connected lar is treated as a native outsider. Any attempt to banish the lar-through dismissal or a similar spell-merely transports the creature back to its statua. If the statua is destroyed, a lar can be dismissed from the Material Plane as normal.",
			"",
			"**Suggestion (Sp)** A lar can influence creatures as per the spell suggestion, with some variations, at will. First, to influence a creature in this manner, a lar must occupy the same square as its target. The lar is considered to be able to speak any language and communicate with any creature-even animals and vermin (which are usually immune to mind-affecting effects)-for the purposes of this effect. The target may attempt to resist a lar's suggestion by making a DC 17 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Sometimes referred to as \"watchsouls,\" lares are subtle, benevolent spirits that prefer to spend their existence on the Material Plane minding the homes and fortunes of deserving mortals. Kind but aloof, lares watch over their mortal wards and help only when they are most needed. Yet where their homes are intruded upon or their charges imperiled, they prove frighteningly effective guardians, turning everything in their tiny dominions into living weapons.",
			"",
			"Lares are innately invisible, making the nature of their existence something of a mystery. Originating from the Upper Planes, these spirits have no true bodies and appear only as vague spectral eddies to those capable of seeing invisible beings. Yet while their forms prove vague, their blessings are undeniable.",
			"",
			"### Summoning a Lar",
			"",
			"A tradtion said to have been created and passed down since the days of lost Azlant, many families, homes, and even shops and public buildings along the Inner Sea invite lares to take up residence, seeking the blessings of the divine. Few, however, know when their invitations have been accepted, though, as a lar might prove aloof for months or years as it gauges its new wards. In order to welcome such spirits, families construct tiny effigies called statuae in the shapes of honored ancestors, regional heroes, or fanciful creatures, in which the spirits might come and reside. These statuae are non-magical effigies, typically composed of stone or fine wood and anointed with fine lacquers and oils, requiring 2 days, a successful DC 20 Craft check, and 40 gp to create. Once created, these Diminuative figures typically have a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points. If destroyed, a statua may be recreated in this same method.",
			"",
			"Summoning a lar is a more elaborate affair, requiring nightly prayers and small offerings of fruit, incense, flowers, and similar gifts to the statuae. For each night one prays to the figure for their home or family's protection there is a cumulative 1% chance a lar hears and turns its attention to the petitioner. This attention doesn't mean that a lar will aid a home, but merely that it has heard the prayer, and it might yet decide that its philosophies and virtues are incompatible with the supplicant. If such is the case, the lar quietly ignores the prayer, and the petitioner's chance to gain a lar's attention resets to 0%, all entirely unknown to the mortal.",
			"",
			"When a lar does accept an invitation, it may immediately plane shift to the associated statua, claiming it as its own. A lar typically makes some subtle acknowledgement that it has come, perhaps slightly altering its statua's appearance or lighting candles upon its arrival. It still often takes months, even years, for a lar to become intimate with a family and make its presence actively known, and some never do."

A larabay's idea of fun can quickly become quite serious, however, when its love of trickery begins to outweigh its sympathy for humanity, and a larabay's well-executed joke may result in a potentially fatal situation for those involved. In their never-ending pursuit of a good laugh, larabays have been known to employ their supernatural illusions to draw ships and their crews into precarious situations such as hazardous waters or hidden shoals, and the depredations of a larabay are often only realized after it's too late. On land, larabays entice their unknowing dupes off cliffs' edges, through monster lairs, or into hidden ravines or pools of quicksand.",
			"",
			"Larabays use their shapechanging abilities to craft intricate webs of social intrigue, though such schemes are always concocted in an effort simply to conduct a masterful hoax, usually resulting in the devastation or heartbreak of one or more of the parties involved rather than any concrete gains on the fey's part. While larabays have been known to inadvertently perform acts of good in the process of gulling cruel-hearted individuals, their unpredictable and precarious natures make them difficult allies, and one can never be sure just how long a larabay will remain faithful to a particular cause before getting bored or whether its companions are simply its latest victims."

A creature can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw to resist the effect, becoming immune to the larva's song for 24 hours. Creatures that fail their saving throws can act normally if removed from the maddening song's area of effect, but they must attempt a new saving throw upon re-entering the song's radius.

			"At the heart of the Dark Tapestry lies Azathoth, a shapeless entity the size of a star, imbued with immense chaotic and destructive power. The members of Azathoth's court orbit it like planets, exalting in the babbling nonsense the blind idiot god issues into the void and singing songs of exquisite madness to their lord. The least of this celestial choir are the larvae of the Outer Gods, shed from Azathoth as a body sheds skin cells. They conjure instruments from the ether, such as pipes and flutes, with which to serenade their progenitor as they mature into gods of the void.",

			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods are born as minuscule specks of matter sloughed off by the ever-changing bulk of Azathoth. These motes of flesh drift through space, caught in the gravitational gyrations of the idiot god, soaking up cosmic radiation and the songs of their kin. Eventually, the motes grow and coalesce into beings of chaos: larvae of the Outer Gods. Once they are large enough to move of their own volition, the larvae begin to whirl and dance in their orbits around the Primal Chaos, compelled by incomprehensible forces to join the cosmic song and dance.",
			"",
			"It is not known where the larvae of the Outer Gods create or steal their instruments. Though strange in appearance, these pipes and flutes are utterly mundane in both function and composition. However, in the hands of the larvae, they become terrible tools of chaos.",
			"",
			"When a larva plays an instrument, it does not merely create sounds. Instead, it warps the fabric of space, creating waves in reality. This allows the larvae to serenade their god even in the midst of an absolute vacuum. This dominion over space enables the larvae to conjure creatures from the planes, block dimensional travel, and transport themselves unfathomable distances in an instant.",
			"",
			"Though some do eat, most larvae of the Outer Gods subsist on cosmic radiation, allowing them to travel for weeks or months across interstellar voids without dying of hunger or thirst. Over time, exposure to the cosmic winds causes them to swell and mutate, growing even more powerful. The oldest of these larvae eventually mature into colossal beings as powerful as demigods. These beings return to orbit Azathoth and refine their songs. Rumor has it that some eventually reach the next stage of their life cycle, absorbing countless other larvae to become planet-sized gods unto themselves.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Once a larva of the Outer Gods has reached maturity, it is not compelled to stay in the court of Azathoth. Indeed, all have the ability and many have the inclination to explore the Dark Tapestry and the worlds beyond. Larvae of the Outer Gods drift among the stars on unseen currents, or fly through space following songs only they can hear. This often brings them into contact-and conflict-with mortal beings.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods bear no ill will toward such creatures, but their presence is often ruinous to mortal forms. Larvae do not understand the concept of mortality, nor can they imagine that a being would not want to be freed from the confinement of a static, unchanging body. Worlds visited by larvae of the Outer Gods thus come to see them as monsters-horrifying emissaries of destruction that spread chaos and fear wherever they roam.",
			"",
			"Larvae of the Outer Gods are particularly fascinated by any talented mortal bards and musicians that they encounter, particularly those who are touched by chaos or the Dark Tapestry. They pursue such players across time and space, much to the musicians' chagrin. These infatuations almost always end with either the larva's destruction, or with the musician succumbing to the larva's song. Some believe that larvae can even transform mortal musicians into fellow larvae of the Outer Gods, and that larvae scour distant worlds seeking to recruit new voices for Azathoth's court.",
			"",
			"Foolish mortals sometimes call upon the larvae of the Outer Gods for aid, summoning them to the realms of men in order to strike down some mortal enemy or share the forbidden secrets of Azathoth. While larvae are not opposed to serving such mortals, they also care little for what effect their songs have on mortal flesh. Those who conjure a larva of the Outer Gods are just as likely to fall victim to its maddening song as those they hoped to smite, and those who seek the secrets of the cosmos often learn them at the cost of their corporeal forms. Even when summoners take steps to protect themselves from unwelcome transformations, they find that the larvae of the Outer Gods approach tasks with an unfocused dreaminess that makes them terrible servants."

Lava children chieftains are visually indistinguishable from ordinary lava children, but often bear several innate magical abilities passed down from parent to offspring in what the chieftains (sometimes referred to as priests, though not necessarily affiliated with a deity) claim are a physical manifestation of their right to lead. Divine right or otherwise, lava children chieftains are most likely to lead from the rear, using their lava channel ability to heal lava children and other elemental creatures commanded into their service, while simultaneously unleashing their spell-like abilities to defend their cysts or make war upon those who fail to show proper deference. For reasons not entirely understood, lava children chieftains are much longer-lived than ordinary lava children, with a lifespan similar to that of dwarves. Lava children chieftains have the advanced creature template and the following abilities:",
			"",
			"Spell-Like Abilities (CL 5th; concentration +7): At will-faerie fire 3/day-pyrotechnics (DC 15), stone shape 1/day-contact other plane (earth or fire elemental plane only), summon nature's ally III (creatures with earth or fire subtype only)",
			"",
			"Lava Channel (Su): Three times per day, a lava child chieftain can channel volcanic energy to produce an explosion of molten rock, which functions like the channel positive energy ability of a cleric, except that it heals 3d6 points of damage for creatures with the earth or fire subtypes and does 3d6 points of fire damage to all others.",
			"",
			"Lava Form (Su): A lava child chieftain can shift between its solid body and one made of molten rock as a standard action. In lava form, the chieftain gains the elemental subtype, and its claw attacks add +1d6 fire damage. Any creature grappling or striking the lava form with natural weapons or natural attacks takes 1d6 points of fire damage. It can remain in this form for up to 5 minutes per day; this duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"Behemoth (+1 CR): This rare caste of warrior lava children was designed by its creators for espionage missions into especially dangerous regions. Though most behemoths succumbed to the high mortality rate that came with following their creators' orders, a few managed to survive and breed. Lava children behemoths have the giant creature template and [Improved Bull Rush](feat/improved_bull_rush) as a bonus feat. They gain the following special attack.",
			"",
			"Tremor (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a lava child behemoth can slam its fists to the ground to create an earth tremor. The behemoth makes a trip attempt against all adjacent creatures. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity and the behemoth is not at risk of being knocked prone. Multiple behemoths can cooperate to affect a larger area; as long as each behemoth uses this ability at the same time and is adjacent to at least one other behemoth using this ability, the affected area increases by 5 feet in all directions.",
			"",
			"Youths and Ancients (-1 CR): While mature lava children are Medium-sized, they are smaller at both the beginning and the end oflife. Newborn lava children are already the size of halflings, and grow quickly to full size within 6 years. At the opposite end oflife, the venerable lava children past 70 years of age lose their strength and mass as their bodies slowly wither. Both youths and ancients use the young creature simple template; the latter also apply venerable age modifiers."

But occasionally, during volcanic eruptions or other explosive geological events, lava lurkers are forced from their comfortable homes, becoming unwilling riders on blazing rapids. While these disasters rarely threaten lava lurkers' elemental forms, they do often force the creatures into-or worse, strand them in-areas they find uncomfortably cool.",
			"",
			"Dull-witted lava lurkers eagerly sow fires and throw magma as they wander semi-aimlessly, doing what they can to create more comfortable surroundings or seeking other nearby warm places-like furnaces or bonfires-as they try to find their way back to active volcanic flows. They care little for non-elemental creatures, being baffled and annoyed by the shrill noises such creatures make when they're exposed to even the slightest fleck of molten rock.",

If slain, the final surge of a lava lurker's animating fires consumes the nearby air, creating a momentary vacuum that extinguishes surrounding flames.

If consumed as a standard action, this air cyst grants water breathing (as the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed leshys can have a maximum of four usable air cysts at any one time, and air cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours.",

It must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target-if it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). In addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded by the water for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",

			"Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwater plant life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy.",
			"",
			"Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair of large clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any other creature.",
			"",
			"Patient and thoughtful by inclination (save for matters associated with those silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the river. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring.",
			"",
			"### Growing a Seaweed Leshy",

			"Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawater. The leshy's maker plants a strand of kelp or other seaweed in the water and treats it daily with bone ash to encourage algal growth. When first created, a seaweed leshy has no armor, but can construct it from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required).",

They often find their way into settled areas, where they caper and gab at those around them. When their neighbors are slow to laugh, snapdragon leshys sometimes resort to juvenile pranks to elicit a reaction. These escalating exploits often prompt townsfolk to chase off the plant people, which the leshys are quick to forgive so long as nobody comes to harm.",
