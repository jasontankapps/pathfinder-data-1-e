			"The rakshasa is an evil spirit that cloaks itself in the guise of a humanoid creature that it might walk unseen among its prey.

Were they human, these acts of cannibalism, blasphemy, and worse would mark them as criminals condemned to the cruelest of hells.",
			"",
			"When not disguised as a humanoid, the otherwise humanoid rakshasa has the head of an animal. Often, they possess the heads of great cats (such as a tiger or panther) or a snake (like a cobra or viper), yet other heads are not unknown-apes, jackals, vultures, elephants, mantises, lizards, rhinos, boars, and more are possible. In most cases, the type of head a rakshasa possesses speaks in some way to its personality-a tiger-headed rakshasa is stealthy and ravenous, while a boar-headed one might be gluttonous and crude. These changes rarely impact the rakshasa's base statistics, although there are more powerful variants of the standard rakshasa that possess multiple heads, more potent spellcasting powers, and additional deadly and unusual special abilities.",
			"",
			"Rakshasas scoff at religion-they understand the power of the divine, but see themselves as the only thing worthy of worship from the mortal races. Rakshasa clerics are thus quite rare. Although rakshasas are outsiders, they are also very much creatures of the Material Plane, and many believe the first rakshasas chose this exile over some other role offered them by a long-forgotten god. Although they usually work alone, it isn't unheard of to find extended families of rakshasas working together to ruin a mortal civilization from the inside out over the course of many generations. A rakshasa is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs.",

			"Among the most gregarious of rakshasas, amanusyas walk among mortals, learning their dreams and turning their desires against them. Amanusyas are seducers who often adopt the guise of entertainers or holy people from distant, exotic sects. The basest among them might tempt any mortal into lives of depravity, but the eldest, most experienced amanusyas seek to lure the most pure-hearted souls into debauchery and apostasy. They consider themselves keen observers and connoisseurs of mortal vice. Amanusyas might watch worthy victims for months before engaging them. When they do, though, their approaches are subtle and their promises calculated. They use guarantees of fame, wealth, pleasure, and a better life as tools to poison mortal minds with grand ambitions, endlessly assuring them that one more contrivance, one more broken vow, one more heist, or one more blasphemy will secure true greatness that, of course, never comes.",
			"",
			"Like many rakshasas, amanusyas dwell in urban environments. They prefer places where they can easily blend in and observe potential victims, such as markets, theaters, fairs, and even temple grounds. When amanusyas find that the time is right, they affect \"chance\" meetings with their prey. Amanusyas' lairs are usually the former homes of victims, decorated with defiled religious items and the preserved bodies of any kills too pretty to consume.",
			"",
			"Amanusyas often form troupes for mutual protection and to be able to take down dangerous and crafty opponents. They loathe serving more powerful rakshasas, but are sometimes blackmailed or bribed to work as infiltrators and assassins. They see most mortals as food and playthings, though according to an old Vudran folktale, once in a millennia, an amanusya actually falls in love with a mortal. These unions never end well, however.",
			"",
			"Amanusya rakshasas can produce offspring only with humanoids of Medium size. Their children become full-blooded amanusyas who, in their true forms, strongly resemble their humanoid parents. This physical reminder of corruption often pushes the mortal parents over the edge-they succumb to whatever heinous temptations are offered by both their lovers and their offspring. The most powerful amanusyas are born from unions with devout followers of good deities. Most amanusyas are female, but one in a dozen is male.",

Most mortals who witness these fiends in motion find them fundamentally unnerving, as their gangly limbs and awkward anatomy seem to work against each other-yet still manage to propel the creature forward with the speed of a hunting cat. A flap of taut, leathery flesh covers the face of every avatarana. While not a part of the rakshasa's body, the covering can't be removed-some grotesque magic fuses it to the creature's body. Indistinct shapes are visible behind this featureless mask. Many who glimpse an avatarana get the unsettling impression that their own features lie beneath this veil, making the rakshasa's appearance all the more unnerving. Those few grimly zealous investigators who have cut away an avatarana's facial covering find nothing below but hollow, uneven cavities. The shapes beneath never seem to correspond with what the covering suggests.",
			"",
			"Avataranas are rarely seen by their prey before they attack. Rather, they physically merge with unsuspecting mortals, invading their bodies and controlling them to perform terrible acts. Avataranas lust for power and they patiently work their way up social ladders, finding more impressive and influential individuals to possess. They strive to mimic the day-to-day actions of those they possess to keep up their disguises, but their viciousness increasingly shows. Only when others turn against their victims do avataranas release their control, leaving their prey to deal with the ramifications of the rakshasa's acts.",
			"",
			"Occasionally, avataranas employ lesser rakshasas to aid them, using these minions to perform tasks that are too demanding for mortal followers.",

Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as best they can, though their employers would still do well to keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such as idle wishes that a certain person were dead.",

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear.",
			"",
			"A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and influence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century.",
			"",
			"So great is a maharaja's power and influence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders-lounging in opulence.",
			"",
			"The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants.",
			"",
			"A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly.",
			"",
			"### Rakshasa Rajadhirajas",
			"",
			"Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment, and illusion. Other maharajas master various other techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings.",
			"",
			"Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower than CR 21-most have additional racial Hit Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each additional racial Hit Die granted increases the rakshasa's CR by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja.",
			"",
			"The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers.",
			"",
			"Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be any form within one size category of the dead creature's original size-the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.",

Activating an urumi form is a swift action, and the zalyakavat cannot cast spells during a round in which it activates one. Whenever the zalyakavat activates an urumi form, in addition to the other effects below, the zalyakavat gains the benefit of [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) until the start of its next turn. The zalyakavat can select from the following urumi forms, each of which last until the start of the zalyakavat's next turn.",
			"",
			"- Contingent Strikes: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to imbue an urumi it wields with a single magic weapon special ability. The special ability is added to any the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. The zalyakavat can select from the following special abilities. 1st-level slot-[corrosive](magic-enhancement/corrosive), [flaming](magic-enhancement/flaming), [frost](magic-enhancement/frost), [ghost touch](magic-enhancement/ghost_touch_weapon), [shock](magic-enhancement/shock); 2nd-level slot-[axiomatic](magic-enhancement/axiomatic), [corrosive burst](magic-enhancement/corrosive_burst), [flaming burst](magic-enhancement/flaming_burst), [icy burst](magic-enhancement/icy_burst), [shocking burst](magic-enhancement/shocking_burst), [unholy](magic-enhancement/unholy), [wounding](magic-enhancement/wounding); 3rd-level slot-[speed](magic-enhancement/speed); 4th-level slot-[brilliant energy](magic-enhancement/brilliant_energy); 5th-level slot-[vorpal](magic-enhancement/vorpal). Imbued magic weapon special abilities do not function for any creature other than the zalyakavat.",
			"- Deft Strikes: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to gain [Improved Disarm](feat/improved_disarm) and [Improved Trip](feat/improved_trip) as bonus feats, as well as a competence bonus on disarm and trip attempts equal to the level of the spell slot expended.",
			"- Dispelling Strikes: By expending a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a zalyakavat can disrupt magic with an urumi it wields, causing any creature struck by the zalyakavat's urumi to be the subject of a targeted [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) with a caster level equal to the zalyakavat's caster level plus the level of the spell slot expended. A creature can be the subject of only one such targeted dispel per use of this ability, but if the urumi strikes more than one creature, each creature struck is subject to the dispelling effect.",
			"- Garrote Whip: A zalyakavat can expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher to make an urumi it wields longer and more flexible. The zalyakavat's reach with the weapon increases by 5 feet, and the zalyakavat can attempt to strike and strangle a single target as a standard action. The zalyakavat makes a melee attack at its highest bonus. On a successful hit, the attack deals damage as normal, and the zalyakavat can attempt a combat maneuver check against the target's CMD as a free action. This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the maneuver succeeds, the target takes an additional 1d8 points of damage plus the zalyakavat's Strength modifier and must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1d4 rounds. This ability works only on creatures that breathe and have a discernible neck. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"- Whip of Many Blades: A zalyakavat can expend a 5th-level spell slot to cause extra blades to sprout from the hilt of an urumi it wields. When the zalyakavat makes a full attack with the weapon, it can make two extra attacks at its highest base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as [haste](spell/haste).",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Shrew-faced rakshasas with a lust for physical combat, zalyakavats are spiritually and magically bound to their weapon of choice, the urumi. Fueling their whip-like swords with arcane power, they perform astonishing feats of martial prowess. To sate their lust for swordplay, zalyakavats continually seek opponents to challenge.",
			"",
			"A zalyakavat stands 6 and a half feet tall and weighs around 170 pounds.",
			"",
			"When the most ruthless and dishonorable of warriors dies in ignominy, their vile spirits are reborn as zalyakavats, usually to a rakshasa mother. Even in infancy, zalyakavats dream of slashing their enemies and drawing blood. In these dreams, they always wield an urumi, and zalyakavats become obsessed with the flexible blades as they mature.",
			"",
			"As rakshasas, zalyakavats are selfish and power-hungry, but unlike many of their kind, they desire the thrill and frenzy of violent combat more than material wealth. They are not reckless, however, and use guile and magic to stack the odds in their favor.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Rakshasa](family/rakshasa)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Zalyakavats typically reside in urban areas, often maintaining homes or hideouts in several different cities. Their lairs are less opulent than those of many rakshasas, though still lavish by most humanoid standards. Individual zalyakavats have different and sometimes eccentric proclivities when it comes to selecting opponents, and they plan their guises accordingly. For example, a zalyakavat who prefers to victimize haughty nobles might operate as a silk merchant or purveyor of fine jewelry, while one who favors dueling with seasoned veterans might pose as a traveling noble to employ such men-at-arms as unsuspecting caravan guards. After slaying an opponent, a zalyakavat often plucks a valuable or gruesome trinket from the corpse to serve as a reminder of the encounter and as a decoration for one of its lairs.",
			"",
			"Zalyakavats rarely interact with other types of rakshasas. When convenient or unavoidable, they might serve maharajas or rakshasa immortals as warriors or bodyguards, but a zalyakavat remains forever preoccupied with its desire for melee combat and is thus an unreliable soldier. On rare occasions, zalyakavats gather to participate in prearranged contests of arms. Zalyakavats almost never fight each other in these events, instead coercing or tricking unfortunate mortals into their hidden arenas to serve as opponents. From plush divans surrounding the arena, zalyakavats watch each other take turns fighting the unlucky souls as entertainment."

Those within 30 feet who fail their saves become panicked. A creature who successfully saves can't be further affected by the same red reaver's roar for 24 hours.

Once a red reaver bonds to a territory, it gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception checks and Survival checks in that area.

Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both fear and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled leather armor and wear oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run."

They might spend months or even years shaping a victim into just the flavor of fear they enjoy. Despite their cowardice, redkind are extremely protective of these seasoned victims-some going so far as to label these unfortunates as their \"only real friends.\" They are especially common in the long shadows and broken dreams of Taldor, where misery is seen as just another facet of life's cruelty."

Indeed, there are stories of remaceras who feel a special bond with their killers, and return in their reincarnated forms to serve as familiars or animal companions.",

These components cost 25,000 gp and replace the usual costs associated with casting either spell (including greater planar binding's Charisma check requirement)."

Ringhorns are sexually dimorphic, with females growing up to 150 pounds and 4 feet tall at the shoulder, while males are slightly shorter but bulkier. They mate in the spring and bear a single calf in late summer, when their vast herds dominate entire valleys for months before they break apart into smaller groups and retreat into the mountains and canyons to wait out the winter."

They can operate independently for years, cataloging unique species while enduring extreme environments that would overwhelm their biological makers. These machines may tag a captive creature with a tracker chip that can be monitored and tracked with their integrated chipfinders. They do so to observe and document the behavioral patterns of such creatures from afar, studying viable specimens for days until they eventually isolate and retrieve the studied prey again for further examination in the controlled laboratories of the robots' masters.",
			"",
			"Among their more impressive features, collector robots possess a hardened artificial intelligence, maintaining a singular focus on their mission directives even when wandering out of communication range with their owners. They tend to react swiftly to movement and perceived threats to their physical security, either emitting loud tones or alarms as a preemptive warning, or flying upward to gain altitude before assessing a given situation and potentially opening fire in defense of itself. Some collector robots grow more lax in their analysis protocols over time, giving way to a state similar to paranoia if left in the field for too long. This corrupted logic inevitably leads them to interpret even the most innocuous actions as proof of hostile intent. Other collectors become fixated on their directive to retrieve specimens without undue damage, interpreting it as a need to protect their targets from all possible sources of harm.",
			"",

			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"Collector robots have no defined ecology, as they are built by others and gifted with a unique purpose and skill set. Most often, they emerge from automated factories, engineering shops, and scrap heaps under the direction of a controlling authority that activates them and assigns their missions. Thereafter, the power cores of collector robots last indefinitely. Most collector robots have fusion generators, but some have the ability to derive power from the sun, making them capable of recharging several weeks' worth of operating power with solar energy in a single daytime \"sleep\" cycle. During prolonged missions, collector robots often support one another in the absence of their masters, dragging damaged units back to repair facilities and cooperating to achieve any mutual goals. Collector robots have a similar protectiveness toward other robots of various types, treating them almost like siblings.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Collector robots have little in the way of organized society, but do array themselves in a rigid hierarchy as designated by their controlling authority. Individual collectors may carry a higher rank than other robots, and thus are capable of commanding lesser machines they encounter or even overriding their programming with new directives as they commandeer aid in carrying out their assigned missions. This often leads to symbiotic relationships with servant robots capable of repairing and assisting with their upkeep.",
			"",
			"Collector robots first appeared in Numeria, but some have since wandered further afield, slaves to their dedicated programming as they go about cataloging, tagging, and occasionally tracking various life forms' sentient or otherwise. Some rogue collector robots kidnap people and creatures, and secret them away in remote caves. Others cascaded from the starship Divinity during its original descent, falling to Golarion as newly deployed probes far outside the range of Unity's control, thus free to pursue individual interests. A few enterprising Technic League wizards and alchemists have managed to control some of these automatons, taming and reprogramming them to suit their purposes. New directives for these automatons typically involve the abduction or assassination of targets that their overseers program into them.",
			"",
			"### Variants",
			"",
			"The chassis developed for collector robots has proven exceptionally versatile over the years, giving rise to multiple configurations and alternate capabilities. These are less likely to be encountered than a typical collector robot. Some of the models include:",
			"",
			"Aquatic Collector Robots (CR +0): Adapted for use in marine environments, aquatic collector robots abandon flight for a swim speed of 30 ft. Their integrated stun guns still function underwater, though they are based on frequencies designed to work more efficiently in aquatic environments.",
			"",
			"Extermination Robots (CR +1): Newly encountered life forms can sometimes threaten the safety of landing parties or the ecological balance of controlled environments. Extermination robots serve a more specialized role than collectors, programming themselves to track and annihilate a single type of creature. This ability grants a favored enemy bonus (as the ranger class ability) against a single creature type chosen from the ranger favored enemies table. The robot also comes equipped with a longer-range arc rifle.",
			"",
			"Trapper Robots (CR +1): Some robots cover a wider range of territory by deploying traps rather than hunting creatures individually. Designed to capture specimens for retrieval and sedation, they have gravity-based snares which function similar to the snare spell. They can deploy up to five of these devices and remain linked to them via tracker chips and an integrated chipfinder. When a snare is sprung, it sends an alert to the trapper robot, which then hurries to retrieve its quarry."

Clad in gleaming metal and viewing the world through a rotating array of lenses, a director is a robotic overseer designed to maximize efficiency and command the loyalty of lesser automatons. Its torso rests upon a utilitarian egg-shaped pod loaded with manipulators, tools, and dozens of thin mechanical tendrils. Four long, mechanical legs support its bulk and carry it across any terrain, even allowing the robot to cling magnetically to vertical surfaces. While the upper frame sports human-like arms to manipulate traditional tools and weapons, two powerful tentacles extend from below its frame to facilitate combat and handle heavy lifting.

			"",

Designed to be adaptable, they function with equal ease on the battlefield, within winding corridors, deep underwater, and upon starship hulls in the vacuum of space. The magnetic claws that carry the director's bulk up sheer surfaces with surprising speed and grace are also perfectly suited to dragging damaged robots from the field.",
			"",
			"To better analyze and respond to threats, directors are programmed with a remarkably advanced artificial intelligence, capable of limited self-awareness and interaction with others.

While not fully self-aware in ways organic beings appreciate, their cold, clean minds take something like comfort in hard work, and experience distress if kept from their duties or left devoid of purpose-those without a clear goal often become obsessive, directing lesser robots to create order for its own sake. Surprisingly social, they fare poorly in isolation without other machines to interact with and direct.",
			"",
			"Like all robots, directors are built, not born. With neural networks almost as advanced as androids', newly activated units undergo a learning period during which they reconcile their reams of programmed knowledge with the unpredictable tendencies of reality. This digital \"infancy\" is a confusing time, and these robots exhibit extreme frustration while learning to adapt. Other directors are especially wary of these child units, and keep a cautious eye sensor on them, always prepared to jump in and override the new robot if it proves incapable of translating theory into practice.",
			"",
			"Directors rarely stray from their heavily technological environments. On Golarion, they usually cling to Silver Mount, but sometimes accompany a legion of the Technic League gearsmen unbidden, ignoring orders from human masters and watching over their mechanical charges with an almost religious devotion. Some directors operate within Starfall where they direct other robots used by the Technic League.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Androffans, the race responsible for the presence of robots on Golarion, were a spacefaring people who visited dozens of worlds. Masters of engineering, they created robots that could perform a wide array of tasks, even trusting their creations to perform complex surgeries on the Androffans' own organic forms. In the course of their interplanetary explorations, the Androffans quickly learned that not every world was ready to comprehend the awesome experience of leaving one's home planet to visit others. Not wanting to risk valuable crew members, the Androffans created evaluator robots as an alternative to sending a shuttle mission to alien planets and interacting in person. When sensors aboard Androffan ships orbiting foreign worlds discovered other humanoid species, evaluator robots would be dispatched to assess the planets' alien cultures.",
			"",
			"Taking forms designed to be recognizable to a planet's general populace, evaluator robots would drop from orbiting surveillance ships onto alien worlds to collect data so that their masters could determine the readiness of the planets' inhabitants to accept the existence of creatures from other worlds. Androffans also used evaluator robots to determine how violent or superstitious the indigenous populations were so that they could carefully plan direct contact. Evaluator robots were fashioned into pleasing and majestic forms to command respect and admiration from the humanoids they interacted with, and were usually made slightly taller than the planet's primary race so as to seem properly impressive. These robots' advanced construction utilizes sophisticated lightweight materials, making their durable frames weigh in under 400 pounds. The model presented here is the most common design-a radiant humanoid angel with gleaming feathers of brushed metal.",
			"",
			"### Design",
			"",
			"The engineers who designed evaluator robots created each one to serve specific purposes tailored to the world it was intended to observe. These thematic designs were tested through trial and error by the evaluators themselves, who paid close attention to the religions encountered on each planet. They discovered that reverence for angelic beings was common on many worlds populated by sentient humanoids, so the engineers built the majority of evaluator robots in this form.",
			"",
			"Although some evaluators were designed for use on worlds that used advanced technology, evaluators were rarely used to observe cultures that had already reached space on their own or that were otherwise accustomed to dealing with beings from other worlds. In some cases, Androffan engineers designed evaluator robots to mimic the form of beings iconic to the populace, gathering information about these individuals from intercepted communication signals. This was often judged too risky, however, as it was found that cultures rarely responded well to the eventual revelation that their resurrected heroes and messiahs were actually alien robots.",
			"",
			"Even though redesigning an evaluator robot's outward form was simple, their complex programming required a vast amount of collected data. If the robot couldn't reply in a convincing manner, or if its memory-modifying nanites took no hold on the alien humanoids it encountered, then the evaluator's mission was quickly compromised. The robot's creators then had to hope that the interaction would be interpreted as a fluke supernatural experience, or that the witness would be disbelieved and derided by its community.",
			"",
			"Evaluator robots are universally curious, their programming filling them with an endless need to learn about living creatures. These robots take every opportunity to ask questions of intelligent organic life forms, especially humanoids. An evaluator robot compares these answers to profiles of existing cultures, either installed when it was created or assembled from previous interactions. Complex algorithms capable of parsing the nuances of myriad humanoid societies allow the robot to quickly evaluate and categorize the nature of a particular society using these hundreds or thousands of profiles. Once an evaluator has thoroughly assessed a planet's cultures, its Androffan masters use this information to plan a landing expedition to make direct contact.",
			"",
			"**Family:** [Robot](family/robot)",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"As robots, evaluators have no society outside of their programming, and their habitat is wherever they happen to be deployed. In the Inner Sea region, nearly all evaluator robots encountered to date have been found in Silver Mount.",
			"",
			"Since they were designed to interact with sentient organic beings, evaluator robots don't regularly associate with other robots unless tasked with a project requiring such interaction, and instead keep the company of humanoids (though their cold robotic presence isn't always comforting).",
			"",
			"Crafts that split from Divinity during its crash and fell to other parts of Numeria contained two other known evaluator robots. A tribe of Ghost Wolves destroyed one of these evaluators-designed to resemble a horned, red-skinned fiend-when it appeared before the Kellid barbarians in the Sellen Hills. The robot fought with wicked claws, and after it was destroyed, it exploded in a blast that killed dozens of the barbarians. The other evaluator, reportedly appearing as a six-armed, three-faced woman with bronze skin, was spotted briefly by griffon riders at Castle Urion before it headed south into the River Kingdoms, and hasn't been seen since."

Owned almost exclusively by high-ranking members of the Technic League, gladiator robots often operate as personal bodyguards when not participating in gladiatorial combat, although their tendency toward targeting errors makes them risky protectors.",
			"",
			"The inherent danger of spectating a gladiatorial contest starring a gladiator robot draws crowds from far and wide, although it necessitates either large, open arenas or protective structures like walls and raised seats to keep the crowd safe. Many cities that normally allow gladiatorial combat have banned competition involving these robots after incidents of audience members being targeted following a lucky hit against the robot.",
			"",
			"While most robots behave in a logical and emotionless way, gladiator robots are gregarious, outgoing, and attention-seeking. Their voices are loud, upbeat, and cheerful, and they endlessly narrate their own actions in battle while providing commentary on their opponents and their actions. This attitude and presence stands in sharp contrast to their menacing, heavily-armored chassis and powerful weapons; these disparate elements make for a combination their opponents find unnerving. Spectators, however, love the bluster and braggadocio of a gladiator robot, often waiting after a match in hopes of meeting it. In Oppara, this tradition is taken even further, with young children running up to a victorious gladiator robot with two rags: a clean one to wipe away blood and grime, and an oiled one to shine its armor to brilliance. They then sell these rags to wealthy nobles for a few gold pieces each.",
			"",
			"Since their programming has been pushed to the limits of their capacity, gladiator robots are prone to develop quirks and bugs in their behavior. Despite frequently being sent back to technicians for repair, gladiator robots often develop personality traits that begin to blur the line between machines and living creatures. While most of these quirks tend to emulate personalities that are brash and energetic, some gladiator robots become enamored of death. These robots are likely the source of rumors about out-of-control \"kill bots\" that view killing as pleasure.",
			"",
			"Stories of gladiator robots leaving the service of their masters and taking up free lives on their own may be nothing more than Andoren propaganda, but such tales are appealing enough that several have spread throughout the Inner Sea. One famous tale is told by Mendevian Knights who watched a \"man of metal\" walk directly into hordes of demons near the Worldwound, shouting challenges the entire way.

This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate.

Thick cords twist over the robot's forearms before feeding into cannon-like barrels that pulse with energy. Oversized fists crackle with lightning and explode with thunderous force upon impact. However terrible these weapons are, nothing in the juggernaut's arsenal is feared more than the ray of death that its central orb emits-a sickly hued beam that reduces all materials to a fine green dust.

Their designers felt that humans would find the mannequins more comfortable to work next to than conventional robots-but they were mistaken. While the mannequins superficially resembled their makers, their inhuman behavior, subtly wrong appearance, and unnatural movement, as well as the unyielding cold of their synthetic flesh proved disturbing, and the humans they were meant to work alongside reflexively distrusted them. Though many were produced for a variety of tasks, the mannequin line of robot was deemed a failure. The next generation of human-form constructs took the form of a true artificial life form: the android.",

Attacks from a laser torch resolve as touch attacks and deal 1d10 points of fire damage. This damage is not modified further by Strength. An observer robot's integrated laser torch is mounted on an extending arm that allows it greater reach.

A laser torch's cutting beam passes through force fields and force effects without damaging the field. Invisible objects and creatures can't be harmed by a laser torch.",

This weapon uses a sonic amplifier to produce powerful low-frequency blasts of energy that can pummel targets. This weapon has a range increment of 20 feet, and it deals 1d8 points of nonlethal damage. When it scores a critical hit, the robot can attempt a free trip combat maneuver (CMB +13) against the target, which does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Transmit Senses (Ex)** An observer robot is outfitted with a number of sensors, cameras, and microphones that allow it to record events and transmit them to another location. An observer robot can record up to 12 hours of audio and video. An observer robot's communications can be keyed to a commset or other similar device, and it can broadcast everything it can see or hear to this device as long as it is within 1 mile. The signal strength can be enhanced with a signal booster. An observer robot can also transmit its senses to another observer robot. A signal has difficulty penetrating solid barriers. A signal is blocked by 1 foot of metal, 5 feet of stone, or 20 feet of organic matter. Force fields do not block signals. Broadcasting functions like a scrying sensor, allowing the viewer to hear and see what the observer robot is experiencing. The viewer gains the benefits of any nonmagical special abilities the observer robot has tied to its senses (such as low-light vision), but the viewer uses her own Perception skill. This ability doesn't allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it, even if both the observer robot and the viewer possess them.",
			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Designed for reconnaissance, observer robots are deployed to serve as the eyes and ears of their controllers. Because they're intelligent and able to make their own decisions, observer robots are suited for exploring without supervision, recording their observations so that they can relay the images and sounds to their creators. The outer hull of an observer robot and its wings are covered in a network of tiny screens that can display images of the robots' surroundings, which grants the observer robot a form of camouflage that allows it to clandestinely observe its subjects.",
			"",
			"The statistics above represent the most common observer robots, but some models have enhanced senses that allow them to see in darkness or see invisible creatures. Some even have olfactory sensors that effectively smell their environment and test the surrounding air for impurities that would harm their creators. Observer robots deployed in hostile environments might be outfitted with more formidable weaponry than the standard stun gun and laser torch.",

These swarms emerge from buried wreckage in dangerous metallic clouds that scour, confound, and burn creatures they attack.",
			"",
			"While swarms are typically chaotic, roiling clouds of creatures, observer robot swarms are highly organized, with hundreds of the tiny robots moving in synchronized patterns as they fly through the air. When observer robot swarms attack, the screens on their outer hulls flicker with disorienting colors that leave their enemies nauseated. They can also organize themselves into a matrix to display composite images across the screens on their collective shells. Treating their individual screens like pixels, observer robot swarms can form moving images of things that they have recorded such as displaying the terrorstricken face of their last victim. These robot swarms even cleverly use this technique to disguise themselves as churning clouds, flickering fires, or even other swarms such as bats or wasps.",
			"",

Failure results in the destruction of the item.

			"Reclamation robots, or \"reclamators,\" are masters of salvage and construction. These robots were originally designed to build structures and repair all manner of technology with speed and precision. Construction of these robots was difficult and time consuming, but they often repaid those spent resources swiftly with their ability to rebuild and repair other robots or technological items. Their truly remarkable programing surprised even those who originally developed them, as these machines can salvage items thought to be far beyond hope of repair.",
			"",
			"Over time it's not uncommon for a reclamation robot to develop a unique personality akin to that of an artist, with something that almost approaches pride in its work. On some occasions, reclamation robots have even been known to make improvements to items and constructs that they repair.",
			"",
			"Though a reclamation robot is generally quite adept at repairing damage to itself as well, injury to certain processors and memory modules deep within the robot can cause significant problems. Some of the resulting malfunctions can be quite noticeable (see the table above), while others are subtler, such as a tendency to add baroque and unnecessary embellishments to constructions and repairs. Reclamation robots with this type of damage are largely unaware of their condition and actively resist efforts to repair them, requiring intervention with a robojack or the like. There are even recorded incidents of damaged reclamators going rogue and setting off on their own to build whatever outlandish structures their flawed processors dictate. Though they were originally designed to create things for humanoids, such rogue robots typically design structures and devices of no apparent use to organic beings... which isn't to say that these creations don't have a place in some unknowable automaton agenda.",

Despite such alternate uses, these intelligent constructs have a hardwired directive that Technic League agents have failed to deactivate: an obsessive drive to perfect their craft. Surgeon robots continually attempt to study humanoid physiology. They require new subject matter to study with some regularity, and if denied such opportunities, they take it upon themselves to collect specimens and perform experiments on them-sometimes claiming the same Technic League agents who tried to cow them.",

On rare occasions, these beings form pacts with other intelligent creatures, bartering their services as surgeons in return for both materials and test subjects. Lacking any sort of conscience or ethical code, surgeon robots make excellent torturers and executioners."

A thought harvester's force field has fast healing 10, but once its hit points are reduced to 0, the force field shuts down and does not reactivate for 24 hours.",

			"**Integrated Nanite Injectors (Ex)** A thought harvester is outfitted with two nanite injectors. These modified syringes are mounted on the end of animated, flexible tubes that feed into the robot's crystal spheres and allow it to use its harvest thoughts ability. These injectors are treated as a piercing weapons that deal 1d4 points of damage, but can't be salvaged to be used on their own.",
			"",
			"**Integrated Sonic Rifle (Ex)** A thought harvester has an builtin sonic rifle slung beneath its head. This weapon has a range of 150 feet and deals 3d6 points of sonic damage. The weapon can fire once per round and does so in a burst of shots that attacks all creatures in a line. This line starts from any corner of the robot's space and extends to the limit of the weapon's range or until it strikes a barrier it can't penetrate. The robot must make a separate attack roll against each creature in the line, and each creature in the line can be attacked with only one shot from each burst. Each attack roll takes a -2 penalty, and its damage can't be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as [Vital Strike](feat/vital_strike). Effects that grant concealment (such as fog or smoke) or the spells blur, invisibility, or mirror image don't affect this weapon's attack.

			"",
			"**Harvest Thoughts (Ex)** A thought harvester that hits a living creature with one of its integrated nanite injectors can selectively duplicate certain memories the target possesses. Each time the harvester uses this ability, it can copy one significant event (such as the events of a combat or a birthday party), or it can sift through the victim's memories as part of an interrogation that allows it to effectively ask and receive truthful answers to six questions. A successful DC 17 Will save negates the effects of this ability; mindless creatures or creatures with an Intelligence score of 1 are immune to it. Each time a creature's memories are copied through the use of this ability, it must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Intelligence drain. A creature's Intelligence score can't be drained below 1 in this way. ",

			"Thought harvesters are specialized robots designed to forcibly extract memories from a living creature or corpse. Built to survive battlefields and other hazardous environments, thought harvesters are outfitted with thick armor plating and a durable force field. Giving the thought harvester robot its name, two prehensile tendrils extend from the creature's sides, each tipped with a wickedly barbed syringe through which the creature injects sophisticated nanites into its target. These nanites immediately duplicate portions of the target's brain and return through the syringe into the thought harvester's central core. There, the target's memories are swiftly categorized and stored in one of an array of crystalline spheres located along the robot's spine. When performed on a living target, the process is painful and can cause severe damage to the subject's cognitive reasoning capabilities. A thought harvester's head has a single glowing eye in the center, and two weapons hang beneath it. These weapons allow the thought harvester to fire bursts of sonic energy at any targets that react in an aggressive manner. A thought harvester rarely speaks, but when it does it speaks in short, monosyllabic words, and is always direct and to the point. Thought harvesters are 6 feet long and 4 feet tall. They are densely built, and weigh 1,600 lbs. A thought harvester draws energy from an efficient internal power source and continually recycles and repairs its internal store of specialized nanites.",
			"",

			"",
			"### Ecology",
			"",
			"A thought harvester is a militarized application of specialized thought-recovery technology. Nanites able to affect a target's thoughts or memories are used in weapons such as the id rifle or mindrender, but the nanites used in those devices become inert after performing their function. When they're instead directly injected and immediately recovered, the nanites duplicate a creature's thoughts and store them for review. The thought harvester's nimble frame and armored shell ensure effective frontline deployment of this technology.",
			"",
			"Dozens of egg-sized crystalline spheres line the creature's spine, each solidly nestled within a socket in the creature's armored back. These spheres are normally clear, but when the robot recovers a creature's thoughts, a sphere fills with a cloudy, gray haze. A thought harvester might fill all of its crystal spheres after a dozen missions. Regular maintenance includes transferring harvested thoughts into specialized computers, but the technology to do so is lost on Golarion. Instead, the stolen thoughts within the spheres simply dissipate when a sphere is destroyed or incorrectly removed.",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Thought harvesters are deployed in a variety of military situations in which specific intelligence must be recovered or eliminated, but bodily recovery of the target is unnecessary or unwise. A thought harvester can grab and carry a human in its claw, but these robots are rarely used to capture living humanoids. A thought harvester might be assigned to invade an enemy stronghold to remove key orders from an opposing commander, or invade a prison to copy sensitive information from the mind of a spy captured by the enemy. Thought harvester robots are often used to recover critical intelligence from soldiers killed in the middle of a raging battle or that fell in irradiated environments. Thought harvesters are deployed only when overt force is acceptable, as they're neither stealthy nor subtle.",
			"",
			"These robots show little individual personality as they go about their work of harvesting memories. Unlike other robots, which are generally content to stand perfectly motionless when not in use, thought harvesters tend to fidget, scanning for danger and waving their syringetipped tendrils in the air. A thought harvester cannot itself access any of the thoughts stored within the crystalline spheres, though it does retain some general idea of the memories it has previously collected. To the thought harvester, these memories are simply cargo to be recovered and brought back to its superiors."

Unlike golems or similarly mindless constructs, wardens possess an intelligence that allows them to employ tactics, either on their own or as part of a unit. When acting in groups, the robots are smart enough to suppress and reactivate their nausea-inducing sound waves in concert, maximizing the length of time their opponents are incapacitated.",

A typical roc is 30 feet long from beak to tail, with an 80-foot wingspan and weight of up to 8,000 pounds. While their beaks are hooked like an eagle's and designed for slashing and tearing, most rocs prefer to seize prey in their massive, clawed talons and drop them from great heights before feasting on the shattered remains. For this reason, they are often followed by flocks of scavengers like rooks, buzzards, and eagles hoping to steal portions of the roc's messy meals. The roc generally ignores such opportunists, but if the scavengers don't take care, they nevertheless may find themselves accidentally consumed by the feeding roc.",
			"",
			"Rocs are equally comfortable over land and sea. While they are capable of sleeping in the air as they soar solo across great ranges in search of food, they generally return home to the mountains to roost and procreate. They prefer rocky crags that are completely inaccessible by terrestrial means, building vast nests of tree trunks and ruined masonry. Once a decade, a mated pair lays a clutch of 3-5 eggs and raises its young. Outside of mating, rocs are extremely antisocial, and may attack others of their kind in vicious aerial battles in order to establish their territorial boundaries. When a nest contains eggs or chicks, parents trade off in their long-ranging flights, with one restricting its wanderings to within a 10-mile radius of the nest.",
			"",
			"Rocs are most commonly white but can be a number of different colors, from dark brown or gold to black or blood red. Their massive feathers are highly prized, and their eggs even more so. Due to their scarcity and the high risk involved in harvesting them, a single man-sized roc egg can net 4,000 gp if transported to market undamaged. A roc can be trained as well as any other animal, but its great size makes this a daunting task for most would-be trainers of human size. The same isn't true for giants-particularly cloud and storm giants, who often use trained rocs as guardians for their lairs. Rocs are even large enough to serve as mounts for the most prestigious of giants.",
			"",
			"Rocs taken as animal companions by druids or rangers are typically newly hatched birds-a baby roc is the size of a person and ready for flight and hunting within minutes of hatching. Unfortunately for druids seeking animal companions of legendary size, an animal companion roc is limited to Large size-still large enough for a Medium druid or ranger to use the flying beast as a mount."

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"A magical compound of pitch and alchemist's fire, roiling oil is a volatile and dangerous ooze. It hunts in subterranean tunnels and even city sewer systems and waterways for animal and vegetable material to consume. Thick, viscous, and resembling a glistening spread of black wax, roiling oil moves slowly across flat surfaces and up walls to find prey it can batter with its greasy pseudopods. When a patch of roiling oil attacks, the process of stretching and shifting its form to strike exposes portions of its interior mass to oxygen. This interaction creates a pungent odor of oil and rancid fat. A roiling oil's strikes slather its targets in an equally malodorous film capable of overwhelming victims with nausea. A roiling oil prefers to fully coat its prey in this substance before it kills and devours them. Even more dangerous, however, is the fact that creatures attempting to burn away a roiling oil only make it more lethal. Even the smallest spark or flame can turn this voracious ooze into a moving inferno against which only cold or strong wind act as any protection. The ooze itself feels no pain from the flames and isn't impeded by them, but such attempts can result in burns to everyone and everything else in the area."

			"Originally native to the Verduran Forest, where they laze about in the canopy to snare birds and small game, roofgardens are largely sedentary predatory plants whose bodies generate volatile oils that both render them resistant to heat and allow them to start the raging infernos required to cast their seeds into the wind. Vigorous logging efforts in their primordial homeland have spread roofgardens to several Taldan cities. Roofgardens have since come to thrive on the broad, unobstructed, elevated surfaces of their namesake, providing the territorial plants with plenty of birds, sunlight, water, and even human victims.",
			"",

The plants are gluttons for both warmth and water, and they consequently find most environments north or south of Taldor inhospitable, though the potential exists for them to spread along the coasts of the Inner Sea, driving increased scrutiny of Taldan lumber for the tiny seeds it might conceal."

A rope dragon reserves its other main use of its shapeshifting talents-setting up pranks and traps-for those who attempt to seek out or capture it, usually after the dragon has had its way with their pantries. Those who offer food willingly to a rope dragon, or at least don't mind the dragon's pilfering ways, are rarely the victims of the dragon's whimsy, and may find that when their lives or livelihoods are truly threatened, their small draconic ally uses its tricks and traps to protect them.",
			"",
			"Rope dragons rarely interact with their own kind except to mate, but they sometimes grow curious about other places and sneak along with travelers, wanderers, or adventurers by pretending to be part of that most iconic piece of adventuring gear: the 50-foot rope. While this may cause the rope dragon's unwitting transporter to experience an inexplicably dwindling food supply, in the end, a rope dragon doesn't want to be left in some monster's lair. The carrier of a rope dragon is in for a real surprise when she gets into a fight that she can't win on her own and her rope comes to life to assist in fending off the monster. Rope dragons dislike it when other creatures become aware of their existence, however, so a rope dragon abandons such an adventurer at the first opportunity."

Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, a roper's appetite always wins out over its intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where pets are constantly outmaneuvering their keeper's wits and patience.",

Once formed, a rot grub swarm is self-sustaining; the vermin quickly devour creatures they slay and move on. When individual grubs mature in a swarm, they are quickly eaten by those grubs yet to achieve adulthood.",

Swarms of rot grubs have been known to cross vast expanses of land like flesh-eating floods, consuming all living creatures that they happen to encounter.

Rusalkas are fond of keeping a few charmed monsters or powerful humanoids nearby to aid in their defense or for other forms of cruel and humiliating entertainment, but quickly grow bored with such pets. When this occurs, rusalkas generally murder the creatures and seek more interesting replacement pets."

Rust monsters consume metal objects, preferring iron and ferrous alloys like steel but devouring even mithral, adamantine, and enchanted metals with equal ease. Any metal touched by the rust monster's delicate antennae or armored hide corrodes and falls to dust within seconds, making the beast a major threat to subterranean adventurers and those dwarven miners who must defend their forges and compete for ore.",

			"Though rust monsters have no innate tendency toward violence, their insatiable hunger leads them to charge anything they come across that bears even trace amounts of metal, and any resistance is met with unthinking savagery. It's not unheard of for rust monsters in metal-poor areas to track escaped victims for days using their scent metal ability, provided the victims retain intact metal objects. Fortunately, it's often possible to escape a rust monster's attentions by throwing it a dense metal object like a shield and running in the opposite direction. Those who frequent areas infested with rust monsters quickly learn to keep a few stone or wooden weapons close at hand."

It's not uncommon when breaching a rust-risen lair to find it filled with baubles, gizmos, and other technological oddities - even schematics which rust-risen cannot make sense of. Rust-risen collect such items, which appear to give them some semblance of comfort in their rotting horror of an existence. Rust-risen also seek sources of electrical power, finding them comforting in the same way a warm bath soothes living flesh. If denied access to an electrical power source, rust-risen become sluggish and despondent, but spring to activity as soon as they are exposed to electricity.",
			"",
			"Rust-risen are always bonded to their creator, serving them as loyally as an animal companion does its master. They rely on their creator to keep their malfunctioning technology from completely breaking down. Over time however, their bond grows into obsession; eventually it becomes an uncontrollable desire for their master to join them in undeath. Such obsessed rust-risen often overpower their necromancer overlords, who awaken to find themselves on an operating table, their machine-studded monstrosities hovering busily over their extracted viscera.",
			"",
			"If a rust-risen's creator is destroyed, the undead becomes despondent and lost. It wanders, avoiding civilization and hovering at the fringes of communities, preying on stragglers and wallowing in misanthropic misery.

In cases where belligerent settlements threaten the way of life for tribes of saguarois, however, the cactusfolk respond with terrifying violence.",
			"",
			"Saguarois live in small nomadic tribes, traveling under the life-giving sun by day and rooting themselves each night in places where they can draw minerals from the pebbly and sandy soil and absorb water. Saguarois produce flowers once a year that go to seed and grow into young saguarois if the adult creatures properly care for them. If planted, a seed must be attended by one or more saguarois over the course of a year before the infant saguaroi sprouts.",
			"",
			"After sprouting, it takes 4 years before the infant saguaroi can uproot itself and move about, and decades more to reach maturity. Some saguarois have lived for hundreds of years, and these old cactusfolk often sprout additional limbs or strange twisting growths stretching out from their cylindrical torsos. Usually these additional limbs and growths are non-functional, but significantly advanced saguarois have been known to learn how to use them as if they were their primary arms and legs."

They then delight in aggressive episodes, barking and snapping until called down by their masters. They return to a fawning obedience for a time-until the next inevitable outburst.",

Esipils like to fight and scrap with nearly anything, and prefer that their victims not simply flee in terror, as they wish to savor the fear. Esipils use their telepathic abilities to harass would-be opponents into attacking them first, flinging mental taunts that are vulgar and disconcerting. Once they engage, they are resilient and dogged fighters. An esipil stands 1 foot tall at the shoulder, and its thin, wormlike body stretches nearly 3 feet long. An esipil weighs around 13 pounds.",

Once per day as a free action, a kimenhul can telepathically communicate with a creature affected by this ability for 1 minute as long as both creatures are on the same plane. For as long as the creature remains affected by a kimenhul's eternal fear, each time the affected creature finds itself in a stressful situation (such as combat), it has a 50% chance of being shaken for 1 minute as it recalls the horror of its encounter with the kimenhul. This lingering fear persists even if the creature defeated or killed the kimenhul. This effect is instantaneous and can be removed only via a wish or miracle. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

While paralyzed, the victim appears to those viewing it to transform into a terrifying creature as ghostly appendages of bone and gore randomly sprout from its body. Any creatures adjacent to the victim must succeed at a DC 32 Will save or be shaken for 1 minute. The ghostly appendages are an illusion (glamer) effect.

			"Kimenhuls prey upon the fear of failure, and encourage self-loathing. While all sahkils delight in spreading fear, few can leave an indelible mark of terror on its victim like a kimenhul. Among the strongest of sahkils, kimenhuls rarely leave the Ethereal Plane. Aside from the sahkil tormentors, kimenhuls are the eldest of all sahkils, and some particularly powerful kimenhuls carve out territory in the Ethereal Plane and rule over legions of other sahkils in much the same manner. Kimenhuls that achieve long-term control are outliers among their kind, however, as the hierarchy among sahkils is more mutable and fluctuating than the rigid order of devils or kytons, or psychopomps' strict adherence to the planar order.",
			"",
			"A kimenhul appears as three enormous, fused humanoid skulls with mouths full of jagged fangs, sitting atop an ever-shifting mass of limbs and faces. These latter manifestations constantly try to pull free of the kimenhul's bulk, shrieking and wailing in fear. Sometimes a creature gazing into this fluctuating horror sees a face all too familiar-a scolding parent, an old bully, or a lost lover. This may or may not be real, as the terrifying forms stretching out from a kimenhul's body incorporate both images from the viewer's mind and those creatures that have fallen prey to the kimenhul's eternal fear ability. A typical kimenhul stands 25 feet tall and weighs roughly 10,000 pounds.",
			"",
			"When a kimenhul telepathically communicates with those marked by its eternal fear, it constantly reminds them that they will never be good enough, and that they are utter failures in everything they do. These sahkils derive a perverse amount of pleasure from these brief mental interjections, and those that have made their horrific impression on large numbers of beings spend hours of each day engaged in this long-distance abuse.",
			"",
			"This lingering torment often drives a kimenhul's victims insane, or forces them into desperation as they attempt more and more drastic means to rid themselves of the sahkil's influence and predation. Many of these victims end up in the care of others, as their paranoia overtakes any ability to care for themselves and they constantly worry over whether they can actually achieve anything on their own. Doubt and distrust seep into every thought. The victim can't get the denigrating voice out of his head, and self-destruction seems the only thing that can keep it at bay.",
			"",
			"Kimenhuls don't bother with those they consider \"lesser\" minds, unless their intention is to cause havoc or rampant violence. They instead focus on instilling fear in the best and brightest they can find. Kimenhuls appreciate a challenge and even dedicate themselves to breaking down creatures that are immune to fear effects. Kimenhuls delight in tormenting the brave and confident. These cruel outsiders track down great heroes and famed generals-women and men known for courage and righteousness-and infect their otherwise strong minds with the static of constant fear. Kimenhuls share stories of their conquests with each other and any allied sahkils, bragging about the reduction of onceproud warriors to twitchy, frightened children who jump at the slightest noise.",
			"",
			"In combat, kimenhuls combine the use of their spell-like abilities and their physical might. Enemies out of reach fall victim to a host of different effects meant to frighten or weaken, while those nearby are at risk of being trampled or snatched up by one of the kimenhul's fanged mouths. Kimenhuls sometimes grab enemies with their bite attacks and then use their snatch between ability to bring their victims to the Ethereal Plane.",
			"",
			"Once back on the Ethereal Plane, kimenhuls bring their kidnapped victims to their lairs, where they and their sahkil allies subject them to a host of frightening stimuli in hopes of driving them mad. Some of these victims linger in this prison of terror for decades, while others die from fright-or take their own lives to escape the torture of constant dread. Otherwise, kimenhuls do their best to keep their victims alive.",
			"",
			"Kimenhuls generally linger near those places on the Ethereal Plane where a mortal peering into that realm might briefly glance upon their horrific visages. Most viewers only catch a terrifying, half-remembered glimpse of the sahkil and go on their ways, shaken but unscathed. Yet if the viewer looks too long into that hazy realm, a kimenhul doesn't hesitate to expose the creature to its look of fear or eternal fear abilities, or to attempt to drag the victim back to its lair for a proper dose of terror.",

They foster the vulgar and abusive voices in all sides of a conflict, subjecting the sensible and sensitive to ill treatment from the loud and malignant. These sinister outsiders instill feelings of dread and hopelessness, and make people feel as if they were alone and unacknowledged even in the presence of their friends and allies.",

In this way, ximtals hope to transform the righteous into fanatics.",
			"",
			"More subtly, ximtals sometimes focus their attention on friends and allies of the truly virtuous-their ultimate targets-to indirectly discredit these paragons. In these cases, ximtals encourage associates of a target to misrepresent the target's intended cause. They work their way into the minds and ideologies of people who focus their actions on advertising their ideals and motivations; they gradually corrupt such folk, leading them to treat other voices with barely concealed aggression and contempt and make hasty decisions that run counter to their final goals. Eventually, the ximtals hope, these agents of discord will subvert the paragon's message and mire her in despair and isolation.",
			"",
			"Ximtals tend to remain isolated from others of their kind. They don't often cooperate to target a certain individual or cause unless it holds some fascination specific to individual ximtals or sahkils. Instead, they spread themselves out through the multiverse to focus on divergent ideologies or selective societal crusades. Despite their tendency to be alone, some ximtals work in partnerships with pakalchis, as pakalchis focus on breaking down the bonds of friendship. Working in parallel, these two types of sahkil can destroy not only friendships, but entire families or organizations.",

			"Ravenous and cruel, the sahuagin are, unfortunately, among the most prosperous oceanic races. Great cities raised by these creatures darken the deep ocean trenches, and many are the near-coastal fortresses where they launch endless raids against their air-breathing enemies who dwell in close proximity to the shore. Warlike and proud, the sahuagin rarely ally with others, and view most other aquatic races such as the aboleths, the merfolk, and their ilk as competitors. The only creatures they seem to respect and adore apart from their own kind are sharks, for in these relentless predators the sahuagin see much of themselves. A sahuagin stands 7 feet tall and weighs about 250 pounds.",
			"",
			"Sahuagin are prone to beneficial mutations, and when a mutant is born it almost always rises to the society's nobility or rulership. The most common sahuagin mutation is an extra pair of arms (granting two additional claw attacks or the opportunity to wield more weapons). Rumors speak of the rare malenti-sahuagin who look not like sharkmen but aquatic elves, yet who share their kin's bloodlusts and cruel natures. Malenti often serve as spies and assassins for sahuagin rulers, but rumors of all-malenti tribes in isolated reaches of the sea persist.",
			"",

			"",
			"**Source** [Monster Codex pg. 188](source/monster_codex)",
			"",
			"Inherent instability in sahuagin genes makes them susceptible to mutations. Not all these mutations are beneficial, and defective sahuagin rarely survive long after hatching. Sahuagin mutants that do survive and grow to adulthood command the respect and admiration of their peers, quickly rising to positions of power. Four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common forms of mutated sahuagin.",
			"",
			"Four-Armed Sahuagin: These mutants have four arms, giving them two additional claw attacks. Four-armed sahuagin gain [Multiattack](feat/multiattack) and [Toughness](feat/toughness) as bonus feats, and gain the multiweapon mastery ability. They have a base CR of 3. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, and rangers.",
			"",
			"Malenti: A malenti resembles an aquatic elf, and receives a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, gains [Deceitful](feat/deceitful) and [Skill Focus](feat/skill_focus) (Bluff) as bonus feats, and can use command as a spell-like ability three times per day (this ability works only on creatures with the aquatic subtype, representing increased telepathic influence over aquatic creatures). Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards.",
			"",
			"Prehistoric Sahuagin: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to a more savage epoch; they're Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and aquatic megafauna in addition to sharks. Adacthys are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures.",
			"",
			"Shark-Blooded Sahuagin: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of shark-like teeth, as well as the fins and tail of an oversized shark. These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a base speed of 5 feet, a swim speed of 80 feet, a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and immunity to trip attempts. Shark-blooded sahuagin are typically found in sahuagin communities with an unusually high number of shark guardians or near shark breeding grounds.",
			"",
			"Sightless Sahuagin: These pallid, sickly looking sahuagin lack eyes, but their blindsense increases to 90 feet and they gain [Blind-Fight](feat/blind-fight) as a bonus feat. A glowing tendril protruding from a sightless sahuagin causes all sighted creatures to be dazzled while within 10 feet of the sahuagin, and allows it to use animal trance once per day as a spell-like ability. This animal trance effect is entirely visual, so it doesn't have the sonic descriptor or work on blind creatures. As sightless sahuagin are blind, they are immune to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks. Isolated sightless sahuagin mutants arise near sites of ancient evil, and make even other sahuagin uneasy. Whole tribes of such mutants dwell in deep underwater trenches and caves, lost cities at the bottom of oceans, and cursed aquatic temples.",
			"",
			"Spined Sahuagin: Covered in hundreds of needlelike spines, spined sahuagin can raise their piercing protrusions to impale creatures that touch them. Any creature that successfully grapples or is grappled by a spined sahuagin, or hits one with an unarmed strike or natural weapon, takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain [Defensive Combat Training](feat/defensive_combat_training) and [Improved Grapple](feat/improved_grapple) as bonus feats. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators.",

It's not unusual to encounter large groups of salamanders in the Abyss as a result.",

Salamander society is a cruel one based on power and the ability to subjugate those beneath oneself. Beings beneath a salamander that cause it discomfort are dealt a slow and painful death."

It is not uncommon for sandmen to voluntarily stay on the Material Plane, fiendishly playing with its inhabitants as they wreak silent havoc.",

Sandmen can manipulate their bodies in many ways, but prefer to keep their legs and feet in the form of dusty clouds of sand, so as to easily maneuver about in their preferred environments. Some of these creatures pride themselves on their ability to control their shapes. Just as a mortal artist might sculpt incredible works of art from stone with a chisel, so do these artist sandmen sculpt their own bodies into works of art. Some enjoy using this ability to reshape their appearance to mimic that of their conjurer or their enemies, allowing them an additional level of theatrics by either assuming a beautiful form or by allowing their form to melt away in a hideous manner. Given the combination of their quick imaginations and their natural penchant for cruelty, most sandmen tend to opt for the latter method of tormenting their foes."

			"**Amorphous Aegis (Ex)** As a full-round action, a sapphire ooze can transform into wearable armor. This armor can be sized for creatures of the ooze's size or one size category smaller, and the subject must be willing to wear the ooze as armor. While in its armor form, the ooze cannot take actions other than to use its hero's infusion ability or to return to its true form as a full-round action. While the shape of the armor created can vary, it always appears to be made of glittering sapphire crystals and provides protection as if it were a mithral breastplate. While a sapphire ooze is worn, it takes 1d6 points of damage each time its host takes more than 5 points of damage from a single attack; this damage bypasses the sapphire ooze's damage reduction and immunities. If this damage reduces the ooze to 0 hit points, it immediately reverts to its true form and falls to the ground.",

A sapphire ooze can use this ability as a swift action on a creature that is wearing it. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

			"Sapphire oozes are a form of intelligent ooze native to Elysium. Steadfastly courageous and protective, sapphire oozes are proof that even the least of Elysium's natives are heroic in their own right. These eager creatures have an intense and innocent curiosity about the world. This, combined with their unhesitating courage, renders sapphire oozes particularly vulnerable to the hazards of Elysium, as they have no qualms about wandering into any corner of the plane in search of adventure or vulnerable creatures in need of rescue. Of course, in most such cases, the sapphire oozes themselves must be rescued, whether by azatas or by visiting adventurers; wandering azatas are often alert for the bubbling sound of a sapphire ooze's distress calls.",
			"",
			"Sapphire oozes that find their way to the Material Plane usually do so by accident. In such cases, the ooze eagerly seeks out novice adventurers or aspiring heroes to share adventures with, using their abilities to protect their allies and inspire them to greatness. They are often quite surprised and confused when they encounter other oozes, which sapphire oozes never expect to be so mindless and such boring conversationalists."
