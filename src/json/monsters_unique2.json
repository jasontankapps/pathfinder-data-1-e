			"**Critical Poisoning (Su)** If Bokrug confirms a critical hit with his sting, he injects his foe with 3 doses of poison (this increases the save DC by 4). A foe that is normally immune to poison can be affected by Bokrug's poison in this way, but treats the poisoning as if it had been injected with only 1 dose.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Bokrug is killed, his body immediately begins to thrash and writhe spasmodically, continuing to do so for 1d4 rounds. During this time, he makes a single sting attack against one random target in reach. At the end of this time, his body grows still, then melts into water and evaporates away. Bokrug reforms in dormancy back in his realm in the Dimension of Dreams soon thereafter, remaining in a comatose state for hundreds of years unless he is awoken earlier via complex rituals. ",
			"",
			"Any effect that destroys Bokrug's body (such as disintegrate) merely reduces his remains to water that then evaporates away as described above, but such measures do prevent his body from thrashing and stinging prior to this supernatural evaporation.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Sting-injury; save Fort DC 41; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 2d4 Wisdom damage; cure 3 consecutive saves. A creature whose Wisdom damage equals its Wisdom score automatically becomes afflicted by a random insanity. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Spines (Ex)** Any creature that makes a melee attack against Bokrug must succeed at a DC 33 Reflex save or be struck by the numerous swiftly reacting spines that cover the Great Old One, taking 2d6+15 points of damage. Using a reach weapon does not endanger the attacker in this way. The save DC is Dexterity-based.",
			"",
			"**Toxic Breath (Su)** Bokrug's breath is toxic. Whenever the Great Old One is above water, he is surrounded by a 30-foot-radius cloud of invisible poison gas that causes temporary madness and hallucinations. Any creature that begins its turn in this area must succeed at a DC 41 Will save or be confused for 1 round. A creature that holds its breath or doesn't have to breathe gains a +4 bonus on this saving throw. This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 33 Will save against Bokrug's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become overwhelmed with hopelessness and doom - it takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls as long as it remains within the area of affect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Vengeful Dreams (Su)** Any creature that has ever damaged Bokrug or has slain one of his clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's vengeful dreams regardless of the distance between the creature and Bokrug, even across planar boundaries. In order to use vengeful dreams against a target, Bokrug must successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability; the target is always treated as familiar to Bokrug, and as if Bokrug possessed a body part of the victim, resulting in a -15 penalty on the saving throw against the nightmare. If the victim fails its save against the nightmare, the horrific dream unfolds as a vision of Bokrug consuming the victim alive. The victim then remains alive, conscious, and aware as the Great Old One digests it, and as Bokrug destroys all that remains of the victim's lifelong friends, home, belongings, and family. When the victim awakens from the nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 33 Will save or take 3d6 points of Wisdom drain from the vengeful dreams. If this drains the target's Wisdom to 0, it automatically gains a random insanity. Once Bokrug uses this ability against a creature, he can't do so again until that creature again damages him or slays one of his clerics. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bokrug, the Water Lizard, dwells in a distant and forsaken corner of the Dimension of Dreams, in a land that was once heavily populated but is now a desolate and barren realm surrounding a nameless lake - a realm once ruled by mighty human empires, but now ruled only by the hideous amphibian minions of the Water Lizard. Bokrug himself is a vast creature, a vaguely iguana-shaped monster with a beard of writhing tendrils and a long tail tipped with a stinger. The scales that cover his body hide long spines that Bokrug can extend or retract with near lightning speed.",
			"",
			"Bokrug spends the majority of his time slumbering far down in the depths of his submerged lair. No rivers feed the lake, nor does it drain into the sea. Yet the still, ominous waters are neither stale nor brackish, implying that they connect somewhere deep underground, and. By way of these dark, secret waterways, Bokgrug has access to the lakes and rivers of the Dimension of Dreams, and his ability to plane shift allows him access to other realms as he wills.",
			"",
			"### Bokrug's Cult",
			"",
			"Bokrug is worshiped more out of fear than adoration, and when traveling dreamers come across his cult in their nightmares, they can unknowingly spread this fearful faith into the waking world. Bokrug's temples are often found on the shores of remote lakes or hidden away in large swamplands. Though humans worship him, so do boggards, lizardfolk, marsh giants, and other swamp-dwelling races - particularly those who have suffered at the hands of aggressors, such as invading armies, rival tribes, or adventuring parties.",
			"",
			"Though Bokrug is chaotic neutral, almost all of his worshipers are chaotic neutral or chaotic evil. Only a rare few chaotic good worshipers of Bokrug exist; most of these being delusional heretics or apologists who seek to keep Bokrug calm, ensuring he continues to slumber. These heretics and outliers of the faith are remorselessly hunted down by his more zealous and traditional worshipers.",
			"",
			"Bokrug's cult is associated with revenge, storms, and water, and its sacred symbol is a green lizard with a long, coiling tail - an image of Bokrug himself. His greatest shrines feature unusually realistic statues of his form, statues the cult maintains Bokrug can see out of and even animate from his distant lair to take sacrifices. Bokrug's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Destruction, Water, and Weather, and to the subdomains of Catastrophe, Oceans, Rage, and Storms. The Water Lizard's favored weapon is the ranseur; his followers often forge their ranseurs' blades to resemble the Great Old One's stingered tail.",

In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or contract a random insanity. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that already has an insanity is immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Greater Starflight (Su)** Cthulhu can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through outer space at incredible speeds.

This cloud blocks vision as obscuring mist, but can't be dispersed by any amount of wind. Any creature in this area must succeed at a DC 45 Fortitude save or be nauseated for as long as it remains in the cloud and for an additional 1d10 rounds after it leaves the area. Cthulhu returns to life after 2d6 rounds, manifesting from the cloud and restored to life via true resurrection, but is staggered for 2d6 rounds (nothing can remove this staggered effect). If slain again while he is staggered from this effect, Cthulhu reverts to vapor form again and his essence fades away after 2d6 rounds, returning to his tomb in R-lyeh until he is released again. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

This grants Cthulhu a deflection bonus to AC and a racial bonus on Reflex saves equal to his Charisma modifier (+12). His apparent and actual position are never quite the same, granting him a 50% miss chance against all attacks.

			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Known to some as the Dreamer in the Deep, Great Cthulhu is the mightiest of the Great Old Ones. Cthulhu is represented often in artwork - particularly in sculpture, painting, and poetry, for his influence is particularly strong among such sensitive and creative minds. In these eldritch works of art, he is depicted or described as having a vaguely humanoid frame, but with immense draconic wings and an octopus-shaped head. His actual form is somewhat fluid - the Great Old One can shift and reshape his exact countenance as he wills, allowing him to occupy a smaller space than one might expect for a creature that stands over 100 feet tall.",
			"",
			"It is fortunate indeed that Cthulhu is currently imprisoned on a distant planet within the sunken city of R-lyeh. There, the Great Old One slumbers away the eons in a state neither quite dead nor living, held in stasis by ancient magic and the potency of the Elder Sign, yet at times the city rises from the sea and the doors to his tomb open, granting Cthulhu limited mobility before he must return to his tomb.",
			"",
			"### Cthulhu's Cult",
			"",
			"Although Cthulhu is imprisoned on a far-flung world, his dreams span the gulfs of existence and are capable of touching upon the sleeping minds of sensitive or artistic souls, inspiring them with insane visions and driving the creation of all manner of eldritch artistry. In such ways, his cult spreads like a night-borne virus of the dreaming mind across all worlds on which sapient life dwells. Cthulhu is worshiped by various aquatic races and folk who dwell along coasts, but also among certain decadent or fringe societies of artists, poets, and philosophers. When they form, his cults are secretive and careful to hide their allegiance to the Great Old One, meeting only in desolate and otherwise abandoned locales hidden from society's notice. Central among his cult's beliefs is the prophecy that one day, the stars will be right and Great Cthulhu shall rise from his corpse-city to usher in the end times, wiping clean all worlds to make them ready for his kind. The cultists believe they might be spared this fate through proper obeisance and fealty, when in truth Cthulhu is unlikely to notice the difference between those who worship him and anyone else.",
			"",
			"Cthulhu's cult is associated with cataclysms, dreams, and the stars, and his sacred symbol is a complex rune surrounding an open eye. Cthulhu's temples are monolithic structures of a stark and cyclopean architectural style, but most of his faithful lack the resources to build such temples and instead make do with what they can, hiding away personal shrines in underground chambers or in shacks or glades in the remote wilderness. Cthulhu's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Madness, and Void, and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry, Insanity, Nightmare, and Stars. His favored weapon is the dagger - often one with a curving blade.",

When Ghatanothoa uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim has a vivid dream of experiencing the end of the world in a fiery, destructive apocalypse-be it from asteroid impact, devastating floods, volcanic eruption, or anything else at the GM's whim. Upon waking, the conviction that such an apocalypse is only days, if not hours, away haunts the victim.

Ghatanothoa's body shrivels and compresses in on itself, growing hard and leathery as it mummifies and contracts in size to a Huge object with AC 24, hardness 30, and 200 hit points. These remains are immune to cold damage, take half damage from fire and electricity, and take 150% damage from acid. An earthquake manifests (as per the spell at CL 29th) each round thereafter, centered on the location where Ghatanothoa was slain (his remains never take damage from the effects of these earthquakes). If Ghatanothoa's remains are not destroyed within 1 minute of his death, the remains explode in a blast of negative energy with a 600-foot radius that deals 20d6 points of negative energy damage to all creatures within that area (Reflex DC 43 half). A creature killed by this damage is immediately transformed into a mummified creature. If the remains are destroyed before this occurs, they crumble to dust without exploding. In either case, as soon as the remains are destroyed or explode, the earthquake effect in the region ends. Once this occurs, Ghatanothoa is reborn from one of the hidden cysts deep within his island lair. If his remains were destroyed before they could explode, he stays dormant in his lair until outside influences awake him once again (this could be a complex ritual performed by cultists, an astronomical event, or any natural disaster that strikes the region). If his remains were allowed to explode, Ghatanothoa wakes immediately and his unspeakable presence ability once again functions as detailed below. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

If the creature averts its gaze from Ghatanothoa, this drain is reduced to 1 point per round. As soon as a creature's Dexterity score is drained to 0, it transforms into a perfectly preserved and completely immobile mummy, yet the victim does not die. A creature mummified in this way no longer needs to eat, drink, or breathe, and no longer ages. It is essentially immortal, and can observe the world around it (and may even take purely mental actions, including the use of psychic magic), but can take no other actions. No magical effect can end this condition (even if the victim's Dexterity drain is healed) save for an effect that removes the curse. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"**Fulvous Dreams (Su)** When Hastur uses his nightmare spell-like ability on a creature that has seen the Yellow Sign, he also afflicts that creature with horrifying dreams tinted with a nauseating yellow color and thick with overwhelming sensations of decadence, shame, and entropic disorder. In addition to the effect of nightmare, the target must also succeed at a DC 40 Will save or be compelled to seek out a Yellow Sign, throwing all of his resources and actions into the obsession. While obsessed, the target takes a -4 penalty on Will saving throws, saving throws against symbol spells, concentration checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks. This obsession effect ends immediately if the victim looks upon the Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Hastur is slain, the robes that drape his frame suddenly drop to the ground as if whatever shape supported them had suddenly ceased to exist. The robes themselves remain inanimate on the ground, but any humanoid creature that touches them must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to resist a sudden urge to put the robes on. Doing so is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once it has donned Hastur's robes, the creature immediately perishes and its body is destroyed. In its place, Hastur lives again, as if brought back via true resurrection. If the discarded robes are not donned within 24 hours, they fade away, leaving behind a faint yellow stain. In this case, Hastur can't manifest a physical body again until the conditions are right, or until an unwitting cultist or fool calls him forth once again. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Reveal Visage (Su)** As a swift action, Hastur may reveal to one adjacent creature the true shape beneath his robes. The creature must succeed at DC 40 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds and take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain at the end of its turn each round the paralysis lasts, though the revelation is too awful for memory to retain. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tattered Lash (Ex)** Hastur attacks with long strips of his tattered yellow robes. These strips have a reach of 40 feet and are primary natural slashing attacks. Bleed damage from the strips stacks with itself (up to 10d6 points of bleed damage). Hastur treats insane targets as if they were flat-footed when he attacks with these weapons.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 40 Will save against Hastur's unspeakable presence afflicts a creature with a random insanity. A creature that is already insane instead becomes confused for as long as it remains in the area. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Wish (Sp)** Although Hastur may use wish as a spell-like ability at will, he can do so only to grant the wishes of other creatures, and only once per creature. Invariably, the results of these wishes serve somehow to advance Hastur's agenda.",
			"",
			"**Yellow Sign (Su)** Once per day as a free action, Hastur can touch any solid surface and inscribe the Yellow Sign upon it. Once inscribed, the Yellow Sign remains for a year, but is active only on certain nights when the light from Hastur's distant world shines in the night sky as a star. Any creature that looks upon an active Yellow Sign must succeed at a DC 40 Will save to avoid becoming dominated by Hastur (as dominate monster); whether or not the save is successful, the creature doesn't have to save against that Yellow Sign again for 24 hours. While the creature is under this domination effect, if the creature's Charisma drain plus Charisma damage ever equal its Charisma score, it immediately dies and allows Hastur to manifest physically at the location of its corpse, as if the victim had donned Hastur's tattered robes (see Immortality). A Yellow Sign can be removed with dispel chaos, dispel evil, or erase, any of which requires the caster to succeed at a DC 35 caster level check. Mage's disjunction automatically removes a Yellow Sign. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Hastur is the most mysterious of the Great Old Ones. In fact, the entity known as Hastur might actually be an Outer God. The physical manifestation of this entity is known as the King in Yellow, and though most consider this creature - a vaguely human-shaped figure draped in a yellow cloak - to be synonymous with Hastur himself, many scholars believe that the King in Yellow is nothing more than an avatar used by the true Hastur to move among the denizens of the physical world. Hastur himself is said to dwell upon a distant world called Carcosa on the shores of the monstrous Lake of Hali, and his power on a planet is strongest when the baleful light of Carcosa's star is visible in that planet's night sky.",

			"### Hastur's Cult",
			"",
			"Hastur's cult is primarily composed of decadent nobles, playwrights, and aristocrats who have grown bored with life and have sought out increasingly deviant, bizarre, and self-destructive methods of achieving gratification in life. His temples are opulent and excessive-opera houses, manors, and the like that contain hidden chambers for pastimes best indulged in secret. His cultists are particularly eager to bring innocents into their fold, exposing them to the Yellow Sign so that their bodies and minds can serve as portals through which the King in Yellow may walk the world.",
			"",
			"Hastur's cult is associated with decadence, disorder, and nihilism, and its symbol is the Yellow Sign. The least varieties of these symbols are nonmagical - and somewhat inaccurate - representations of the sigil, though the more powerful cults possess methods by which they can craft fully functional Yellow Signs. Unlike those created by Hastur, a cult-created Yellow Sign can be resisted with a successful DC 23 Will save (as if it were a 9th-level spell). Hastur's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Rune, and Void, and to the subdomains of Dark Tapestry, Language, Stars, and Wards. Hastur's favored weapon is the rapier.",

A creature that lacks any immunity or resistance to cold also becomes chilled by the Great Old One's presence, taking a -4 penalty on ranged attacks, initiative checks, Reflex saving throws, and Dexterity-based skill checks, as well as a -4 penalty to Armor Class.

However, even oblivion could not quell Mhar's suffering, and its agony was enough to stir it from death. When Mhar awakened yet again, trapped within the crust of Golarion, it went mad, unable to escape its own torment. Mhar let out a psychic scream. As this scream rebounded and echoed between the crust and Mhar itself, intensifying the creature's madness, the mental force of it pushed against the surface of the earth and formed the Kodar Mountains.",

			"**Absorb Light (Su)** Mordiggian's presence causes all light levels within a 100-foot spread to be reduced by one category as long as he has at least 1 hit point. Anyone who attempts to cast a spell with the light descriptor in this area must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check, or the spell is lost as if it had been counterspelled.",
			"",
			"**Dreams of Darkness (Ex)** Mordiggian can affect a creature that has been restored to life by a worshiper of Mordiggian, that has suffered negative energy damage while within the walls of a temple devoted to Mordiggian, or that has been in the area of effect of Mordiggian's unspeakable presence (whether or not the creature was affected by it) with dreams of darkness. When Mordiggian uses his nightmare spell-like ability on such a target, the victim endures what seems to be the passage of hundreds of years imprisoned in a lightless sarcophagus or coffin. Upon waking, the creature takes an additional effect beyond the normal effects of nightmare - it must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude saving throw or contract an accelerated form of ghoul fever that inflicts its damage every hour instead of every day. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Eldritch Insight (Ex)** The whispers of all the world's dead echo in Mordiggian's mind, and as a result, he adds his Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus to his Armor Class and on all Initiative checks. If Mordiggian is on a planet or in a dimension where no creature has ever died, this ability does not function.",
			"",
			"**Engulf (Su)** When Mordiggian engulfs a creature, he inflicts 20d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d4 negative levels. A successful DC 44 Reflex saving throw halves the negative energy damage, and a DC 44 Fortitude save removes the negative levels. The save DCs are both Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Great Old One Traits (Ex)** Rules for Mordiggian's Great Old One traits such as immortality, insanity, and otherworldly, as well as the rules for his mythic abilities and unspeakable presence can be found [here](subtype/great_old_one).",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Mordiggian is killed, the shadows that comprise his body lose all form and become a 20-foot-diameter roiling blot of churning darkness with a 300-foot fly speed and perfect maneuverability. This blot of darkness is incorporeal and cannot be harmed, but it cannot enter an area of bright light. The blot can sense all undead creatures within a 100-mile radius, and if it finds an undead creature, it can attempt to infuse it. An intelligent undead can resist this attack with a successful DC 40 Will saving throw; unintelligent undead receive no save. Once this blot of darkness infuses an undead creature, it grants the undead creature the advanced creature simple template, but 24 hours later, the undead is destroyed, releasing a fully-healed Mordiggian back into the world. If Mordiggian cannot find a suitable undead host within 24 hours or is trapped by bright light for that duration, the blot of darkness fades away, only to manifest immediately on another world-perhaps in the distant past, in the distant future, or even in the present. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Tentacles (Su)** Mordiggian's tentacles are primary attacks that inflict bludgeoning damage. He adds his Charisma modifier to damage done by his tentacles, which also gain a +5 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls. These tentacles are treated as magic epic chaotic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If Mordiggian reduces a living creature to fewer than 0 hit points with a tentacle or with his constriction damage, he automatically casts death knell on the target as a free action.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 40 Will saving throw against Mordiggian's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become permanently blinded. A creature that is killed while blinded by this ability immediately animates as a chaotic evil juju zombie. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"Called the Charnel God by his worshipers, Mordiggian is one of the oldest and most powerful of the Great Old Ones. However, his tendency to move back and forth in time whenever he reincarnates makes the tracking of his age largely academic. None can say how long Mordiggian has existed, for as far as one can look back into the past or forward into the future, the presence of his cult can be found if one searches hard enough.",
			"",
			"Mordiggian has no body. He appears as a cloud of mobile, malevolent darkness and shadow that can change its outline and shape at will. He is fond of appearing as an immense graveworm or limbless giant made of darkness, and when he desires a meal, he can form tentacles of solid darkness to pluck up his feast.",
			"",
			"Ghouls, particularly those that dwell in Leng, often venerate Mordiggian with a ferocious zeal. They consider ghoulish worshipers of other deities, particularly of the demon lord Kabriri, to be heretics and work to eradicate such blasphemers whenever they are found. Although worship of Mordiggian has become quite rare on Golarion as other death gods have gained more prominence, his cult is patient and willing to simply wait for the Charnel God's inevitable return to power.",

			"Mordiggian's worshipers venerate him as a death god, and his worship is openly allowed in some cities. In these cases, his temple also serves to dispose of all of the city's dead, yet the faithful's exact method for dealing with corpses is subject to fearful whispers among the nonbelievers. His temples consist of either underground vaults hidden below graveyards or towering cathedrallike structures containing mazes of rooms. Mordiggian grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Death, and Evil, and to the subdomains of Entropy, Loss, Night, and Undead. His favored weapon is the scimitar.",

When he is in statue form as a result of his statue spell-like ability, Rhan-Tegoth can still use his spell-like abilities and the range of his tremorsense increases to 640 feet. Once per day, he can activate his unspeakable presence while in statue form.",
			"",
			"**Apocalyptic Dreams (Su)** When Rhan-Tegoth uses his nightmare spell-like ability, he can target any creature that has touched him (even if the touch occurred while Rhan-Tegoth was hibernating), has been affected by any of his other spell-like abilities, or has sacrificed a living creature to an image of him, regardless of the distance between himself and the target. In addition to the normal effects of nightmare, the target must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or become convinced that the horrific visions of the end of the world experienced in the nightmare are in fact visions of the very near future. Such a victim becomes overwhelmed with despair and loss, and is so distracted by the conviction that its doom is imminent that it cannot take swift or immediate actions, cannot concentrate to maintain spells with concentration durations, and takes a -10 penalty on concentration checks to cast spells and on Wisdom based skill checks. Whenever the victim attempts a saving throw against fear effects, it must roll twice and take the worse result. This fear effect lasts for 2d4 days, after which (assuming the world doesn't end after all) the effect ends. The effect also ends automatically if the victim voluntarily sacrifices a living, sentient creature to Rhan-Tegoth (this is a chaotic evil act) - although in most cases, a creature that performs such a sacrifice finds itself targeted with apocalyptic dreams soon thereafter, again and again. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"**Feed (Su)** Once per round when Rhan-Tegoth successfully bites a creature he is grappling, his proboscis feeds on the victim and siphons away bodily fluids at an alarming rate. This attack deals 2d4 points of Constitution drain to the victim unless the victim succeeds at a DC 42 Fortitude save, in which case the feeding instead deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. For every point of Constitution drain dealt in this way, Rhan-Tegoth regains 10 hit points, and for every point of Constitution damage dealt in this way, he regains 5 hit points. In addition, if Rhan-Tegoth drains more than 4 points of Constitution in this way in a single round, he gains the effects of a haste spell for the following round. A creature that is slain by this Constitution drain or damage is reduced to a shriveled corpse riddled with deep, dry holes, and can be restored to life only via miracle, true resurrection, or wish. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Rhan-Tegoth is slain, he merely petrifies into a statue. He remains in statue form, in hibernation, until a living, sentient creature is sacrificed adjacent to the hibernating Great Old One, at which point Rhan-Tegoth is immediately restored to life (as if via true resurrection). If no such sacrifice is performed, Rhan-Tegoth can remain in hibernation in this form forever - though certain rare cosmological events can rouse him from his slumber. In this statue form, he has hardness 30 and 300 hp. If the statue of the hibernating Great Old One is destroyed, it crumbles to dust but immediately affects all creatures within 300 feet with Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence, and Rhan-Tegoth's consciousness is transplanted into a different statue of the Great Old One (typically one on another world). If no such statues remain in existence at the time of destruction, his consciousness is instead transplanted into a statue in the past or future to await eventual awakening.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Su)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Rhan-Tegoth's unspeakable presence fills the victim with an irresistible urge to sacrifice a living, sentient creature to the Great Old One. Treat this as a geas/quest spell (CL 28th) that ends the moment the affected creature kills a living, sentient creature in Rhan-Tegoth's name (this is a chaotic evil act). This is a mind-affecting curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"",
			"While records of Rhan-Tegoth's waking periods and his activities during those times are rare and unreliable, rumors still persist of certain chants and rituals that are capable of temporarily waking the Great Old One from his slumber. What reasons might exist for stirring Rhan-Tegoth from his sleep can only be guessed at, for the Great Old One will usually simply consume any foolish enough to rouse him from slumber.",
			"",
			"Rhan-Tegoth appears as an aquatic arthropod in shape, yet closer inspection leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind of the Great Old One's truly alien nature. His body measures 10 feet from tip to tip, and his legs span 24 feet. The Great Old One weighs 2,000 pounds, but this weight increases to 10 times this amount when he is in statue form. The fact that countless statues of Rhan-Tegoth exist makes it difficult to determine which of them is in fact the actual slumbering god, so care should be taken in proximity of any depiction of the Herald of the End Times.",

As a sort of avatar of this deity, Tawil at-Umr pursues its own goals throughout the Material Plane and dimensions that intersect it in ways mortals can never fully understand. Tawil at-Umr is just as likely to react to attacks against it with its formidable combat prowess as it is to ignore its attackers or simply relocate to another point in the multiverse-its reasons for doing so are as inscrutable as its plans for reality. Some scholars theorize that Tawil at-Umr is little more than a side effect of Yog-Sothoth's presence upon reality when the Outer God brushes up against this universe. Even if this is the case, Tawil at-Umr's knowledge of reality is vast, and many have sought the avatar out to learn its secrets.",

Those who choose to exalt this less-powerful but highly-focused avatar tend to do so as individuals, and no organized cult to Tawil at-Umr is known to exist. Those who specifically seek to devote themselves to Tawil at-Umr typically do so out of a mistaken impression that worship matters to the avatar.",

			"**Adaptive Spellcasting (Su)** Tsathoggua has mastered all forms of magic, be they arcane, divine, or psychic. He casts spells spontaneously, as per a sorcerer, but he can cast spells from any spell list. He can know up to two spells per spell level from 1st to 9th at any one time (and up to six 0-level spells at any one time), taken from any spell list. When he uses his consume spellcaster ability, he can swap out up to two spells currently known for any two spells known (and currently prepared in the case of prepared spellcasters) by his consumed victim. The only spells Tsathoggua can never know are those with the good or lawful descriptors. The spells listed above are those he favors, but GMs are free to alter that list as they wish for encounters with Tsathoggua.",

These newly created formless spawn have free will and are fully grown, but they follow Tsathoggua's commands for 1d4 days after creation. Tsathoggua sometimes gifts newly created spawn to visitors he favors. Sometimes he just eats them. Those spawn that escape servitude or digestion slither off into the world on their own.",

When Tsathoggua uses nightmare on such a target, the victim must also succeed at a DC 38 Will saving throw or feel cast out of society and spurned by friends and loved ones.

Yet these moods are mercurial, and the Great Old One tires of company and attempts to eat those he had been aiding only a moment before. Those who worship him generally do not display this level of magnanimity; they are typically fanatic and violent in their methods of preserving the secrets of their sect.",

Tsathoggua grants access to the domains of Chaos, Evil, Knowledge, and Magic and to the subdomains of Arcane, Divine, Thought, and Whimsy. Tsathoggua's favored weapon is the short sword.",

In addition, any creature that ends its turn within Xhamen-Dor's reach must succeed at a DC 37 Reflex saving throw or become entangled as long as it remains in that area.

			"",
			"**Immortality (Ex)** If Yig is slain, his body decays as normal, but he does not stay dead for long. He is reborn 3 months after his death, hatching from the egg of a venomous serpent (although not necessarily on the same planet on which his previous incarnation was slain). He spends a year in the form of a venomous (but otherwise normal) snake, after which he sheds his skin and emerges once again as Yig. Typically, Yig does not hold grudges against those who slew him, but this is not always the case.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Ex)** Bite-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Constitution drain plus nauseated for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Serpentine Dreams (Su)** Any creature that has ever willfully harmed a snake, has suffered the effects of the curse of Yig (see above), or has slain one of Yig's clerics can be targeted by the Great Old One's serpentine dreams, regardless of the distance between the creature and Yig - even across planar boundaries. In order to use serpentine dreams against a target, Yig must first successfully affect the target with his nightmare spell-like ability. If the victim fails its save against nightmare, it must succeed at a DC 35 Will save or take 2d6 points of Intelligence drain in addition to the normal effects of nightmare. When this Intelligence drain would reduce the victim's Intelligence score below 2, the victim is instead transformed (as if via baleful polymorph) into a Tiny venomous snake. This is a mind-affecting polymorph effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Unspeakable Presence (Ex)** Failing a DC 35 Will save against Yig's unspeakable presence causes the victim to become more susceptible to curse effects. The victim takes a -6 penalty on all saving throws against curse effects, and the effective DC to remove a curse from such a victim increases by 6. A creature normally immune to curses that is affected by Yig's unspeakable presence can now be affected by curses (but takes no further penalty against curses as a result of the Great Old One's unspeakable presence). This effect lasts for 1 year or until removed by a miracle or wish. If a creature suffering from this effect dies and is brought back to life, there is a 50% chance the effect persists upon the creature's restoration to life.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Of all the Great Old Ones, Yig is without a doubt the most benign. Yet those so foolish as to expect kindness from the so-called Father of Serpents would do well to think again, for Yig does not suffer fools and is as likely to devour those who beseech him for help as he is to provide aid. Even his most devout worshipers realize he may simply wish to feed at times, and on these occasions no amount of devotion can protect a supplicant from death.",
			"",
			"Yig appears as a scaled, humanoid creature with a serpent's head and lashing tail, but he can appear as any serpentine creature if he so wills. In his true form, Yig stands 14 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds.",
			"",
			"### Yig's Cult",
			"",
			"Yig is primarily worshiped by nomadic societies and those who live with a close connection to the land; veneration of him is all but unknown in urban areas. Although Yig often makes his presence known through the actions of serpents, serpentfolk rarely worship him, preferring their own, more sinister deity. Yig's cult is associated with cycles (the cycle of seasons, the cycle of birth and death, and other manifestations of repetition in the natural world), procreation, and serpents, and his sacred symbol is a coiled rattlesnake with a crescent-shaped mark upon its head. His temples rarely take the form of constructed buildings and are often nothing more than a forest clearing, a ring of standing stones, or the mouth of a large cave. Unlike most of the Great Old Ones, Yig tends to take notice of those who worship him. This is, however, as much a bane as it is a boon for those who offer the Father of Serpents worship, for just as he may protect his flock when they are endangered, his retribution for slights is swift, and communities that fail to properly worship him often find their crops failing, their livestock sickened, and their children born with crippling deformities. You can model such unfortunate creatures by applying the mutant creature template. In addition to the normal changes wrought by this template, such mutants invariably bear a unique birthmark somewhere on their body - the crescent moon shape that all of those touched by Yig bear.",
			"",
			"Yig's clerics have access to the domains of Chaos, Community, Protection, and Scalykind, and to the subdomains of Defense, Dragon, Revelry, and Venom. His favored weapon is the punching dagger.",

The height of a short man, Grendler Red-Chains stalks the mountain's tunnels with aplomb, terrorizing adventurers and the complex's denizens alike with his wicked scythe and spiked boots. Perhaps because of his larger size, he heals faster than most redcaps; he enjoys self-mutilation almost as much as he enjoys dipping his cap in his victims' blood. Over the years, Grendler Red-Chains has culled bits of chains and shackles from the corpses of long-dead slaves and embedded them into his own flesh, both to terrify his enemies and to fortify his defenses."

			"Groetus's herald is End's Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected.",
			"",
			"The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus.",
			"",
			"End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like the ocean's tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations.",
			"",
			"Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a difficult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again.",
			"",
			"When called by mortals, the herald demands specific deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions.",
			"",
			"When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a specific task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts their presence (and their insanity) as if used to them. On one occasion, it absorbed a servitor into itself, inhaling the creature like smoke, then expelling it a year later with no explanation or apparent harm to the creature.",

			"**Bury Alive (Su)** As a standard action, Gravedragger can telekinetically pull a target within 100 feet into a grave (or a similar physical hole in the ground that is an appropriate size for burying the target) and bury it. Gravedragger must be adjacent to the grave he intends to drag his target into. Treat this as a special drag combat maneuver. The target takes 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 22 half) and is buried alive (see [Cave-Ins and Collapses](rule/cave-ins_and_collapses_cr_8)). The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Long Arm of the Reaper (Ex)** Gravedragger can throw his heavy pick up to 100 feet away as a ranged attack with no range increment. The weapon automatically returns just before the herald's next turn, as if it had the returning weapon quality.",
			"",
			"**Unearthly Luck (Su)** Gravedragger adds his Charisma bonus as a luck bonus on all his saving throws and to his Armor Class.",
			"",
			"**Unluck Aura (Su)** Gravedragger radiates an aura of unluck to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature in this area must roll two d20s whenever a situation calls for a d20 roll (such as an attack roll, a skill check, or a saving throw) and must use the lower of the two results. This is a mind-affecting effect that doesn't work on worshipers of Zyphus. Any creature that gains any sort of luck bonus (such as that granted by a luckstone or divine favor) is immune to Gravedragger's unluck aura.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Gravedragger is a cruel prankster who enjoys murdering innocents in unexpected, horrid, ironic, and tragic ways. In the same way that children fear the mysterious bogeymen, adults cower at the thought of Gravedragger bringing them to a painful end. Unlike Pharasma, who enforces fated and inevitable death, the herald of Zyphus is a break from destiny's plan - a sudden deviation that leads to danger and ruin. Gravedragger appears as a vaguely humanoid mass of grave dirt and bones, and wields a heavy pick made of a rib bone punched through a giant's skull. He also takes the form of an old, thin human man with shifty eyes and a sickening, toothy smile. In this form he is known as \"Grinning Jack,\" often shortened to \"Grinjack.\" Gravedragger speaks in a high, mad voice, and is prone to outbursts of cackling even when cloaked by invisibility.",
			"",
			"Divinations by the faithful show that Gravedragger was once a mortal farmer. When his wife and family fell ill with a sickness, he traveled to the nearest village to get aid from the healer. When he returned with a curative potion, he found that his home had been struck by lightning and burned to the ground; his family, too sick to crawl out, had perished in the fire. The man's mind snapped, broken by the idea that he could have prevented his loved ones' random and pointless deaths if he hadn't been away from home. He embraced the cult of Zyphus and began studying magic, using his abilities to stalk and kill clerics of rival faiths as well as to ambush adventurers to slay them in their sleep or after difficult battles. After a long, successful life at this morbid career, he died in his sleep, and in Zyphus's realm he was infused with divine power and became the god's herald. Remorseless and vindictive, Gravedigger now enjoys his role as the bringer of bad luck and the foil of fate, and every death he causes buries a little bit deeper the guilt he feels for his family's deaths.",
			"",
			"Although Gravedragger enjoys lurking in graveyards, where he can easily use his bury alive ability, he isn't a harbinger of deserved deaths and is bored by the idea of dispatching wounded soldiers-something he feels is the job of psychopomps. Instead, Gravedragger revels in unexpected methods of murder, such as causing a fallen armored knight to drown in a couple inches of mud after being pulled from his horse.",
			"",
			"The herald uses invisibility and greater invisibility to sneak up on his targets and afflict them with curses or blindness, blow them off cliffs (with gust of wind or telekinesis), call sudden bolts of lightning, or create symptomless deaths (using slay living). He might attack from invisibility for 1 or 2 rounds, then leave if he fails to kill anyone quickly-his interest is in spontaneity and sudden death, not extended battle. He usually employs these tactics even if tasked with slaying a specific person, as it's more entertaining to him to set up an elaborate ambush than to confront his opponent directly. Sometimes he's content to just follow his prey unobserved, creepily breaking the silence with his tittering laugh and unnerving the victim so much that it stumbles into a natural trap or flees in terror toward a wild creature's lair.",
			"",
			"Created from a mortal soul and raised to his station by a god, Gravedragger is sustained by divine power and like other outsiders has no need to eat or drink. However, he has often been seen hovering over a dead or dying victim, inhaling deeply as if sucking out remnants of the mortal's soul. He claims these breaths sustain him in place of food or air, but there's no evidence that he actually needs to do this; the habit is probably just some perverse torture intended to unnerve his victims in their last moments. When in his Grinjack form, he often pretends to be a Pharasmin priest, administering false last rites to doomed mortals just to enjoy the sound of their death rattles.",
			"",
			"While Gravedragger's physical body appears to be composed of nonliving materials, he's a living creature and this appearance is only his outer \"skin.\" When damaged, he bleeds red blood, pungent yellow bile, and - if the wound is large enough - dismembered humanoid body parts such as hands, limbs, and heads. As he doesn't eat, these parts are probably physical manifestations of the countless lives he has taken in the name of Zyphus. Immortal and able to recover from severe wounds, he would rather escape a fight than allow himself to die, for he has felt death as a mortal and has no desire to repeat the experience.",

			"",
			"### Habitat",

			"Gravedragger spends most of his time in Zyphus' realm in Abaddon, exchanging grisly stories with the souls of Zyphus's faithful and other divine servitors. Left unsupervised to perform whatever murderous mischief he pleases, Gravedragger visits Golarion to enact petty revenge, blasphemous murders, and countless \"accidental\" deaths.",
			"",
			"The herald sometimes associates with various daemons who help him effect these structured accidents, particularly hydrodaemons (death by drowning), leukodaemons (death by plague), meladaemons (death by starvation and thirst), and crucidaemons (death by traps). In the mortal world, Gravedragger has a fondness for pugwampis and trickster fey, especially bogeymen, and has been known to guide their efforts or even transport them over long distances to save them from extermination or help them to find new victims. He sometimes sneaks into a city in his Grinjack form carrying a sack of pugwampis and releases them upon an unsuspecting urban population, cackling glee as he watches the aftermath."

			"",
			"#### Description",

			"Great Elder Iuu is one of the first stone giants ever to set foot upon the mountains of Golarion, and one of the stone giants' first tribal elders. After he died at the age of 888, Minderhal brought him to Stonepeak for a century of paradise and crafting, then elevated him to serve as the god's herald. Minderhal sends Iuu to the mortal world in times of great trouble or change for the stone giant people, or to put an end to conflicts between tribes.",
			"",
			"Iuu looks like an exceptionally tall, handsome, and wise elder stone giant with crystals sprouting from his head like a crown and a cloak of heavy moss. His weapon is Anfaru (meaning \"Mountain from the Sky\"), an adamantine-laden stone meteorite he carved over the course of 100 years into a hammer shape. Iuu has a deep, booming voice that can shatter mortar when he's angry. His crystal crown and unusual weapon have sometimes led ignorant members of lesser races to mistake him for a stone giant king.",
			"",
			"Iuu uses his magical abilities to enhance, protect, and support himself and his mortal allies. Having been in countless battles against various creatures, he is a competent tactician; he quickly reacts to specific threats or enemy abilities and determines how to best use the available terrain and resources to overcome threats. When he gives orders, he expects other giants to obey immediately and without question. He believes in the inherent strength of his people, and although he is evil, he's unwilling to sacrifice their lives in risky gambits unless the survival of all the stone giants is at stake. He thinks little of smaller races and is indifferent to the \"degenerate\" giant races (which, according to some stone giant lore, includes all other races of giants).",
			"",
			"Iuu was born a mortal giant, and although he doesn't have to eat, he still has a strong attachment to the traditional foods and beverages of his people. When summoned to the Material Plane by those with means, he expects a great feast to be prepared for him, and he honors his hosts by participating. If those who call him are impoverished, he treats whatever meager food they offer as if it were a fine meal, and limits what he eats so others don't go hungry.",
			"",
			"Iuu does not need to sleep, and although he needs to breathe, that becomes an issue only if he is forced underwater or buried alive - in which case he can use magic such as dimension door or meld into stone to escape or compensate for the hazard.",
			"",
			"As with mortal stone giants, Iuu's flesh appears to be made of rock, but he is a creature of flesh and blood. His flesh is much harder than normal stone, but when injured, he bleeds red. Having already lived a full mortal life once, he doesn't fear death, especially if his dying better serves Minderhal or the stone giant race as a whole. At worst, he would experience regret that he would not share another song or teach another student about the traditional ways of giantkind.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Herald}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"Great Elder Iuu spends decades at a time in a catatonic slumber deep within Minderhal's realm, and nearly as much time crafting weapons for the god's other servitors and building architecture for the realm itself. After one of his deep sleeps, it's customary for new petitioners and servitors of the god to seek him out and gain his blessing. Many in Stonepeak determine their seniority by how many cycles of Iuu's waking and sleeping they have been present for.",
			"",
			"Iuu enjoys teaching others - whether mortals, petitioners, or outsiders - about crafting and the early history of the giant race, using ancient songs to convey these tales to eager ears. He is pleased when a student learns the songs he teaches, but becomes stern if his pupil accidentally or intentionally alters the words or cadence of the song. If he hears an altered version of a song or tale from another, he interrupts, insisting the raconteur tell it the right way and honor its proper, orthodox form.",
			"",
			"Iuu is respectful toward shrines and priests of Estig (the stone giants' name for Erastil), Fandarra, and spirits of ancestors and stone. He doesn't allow followers of Urazra to speak in his presence - the first offense merits a verbal rebuke; the second, a beating; and the third, a beating followed by tribal exile.",
			"",
			"Many mortal giants are related to Iuu through the countless generations extending back to the origin of their race. Stone giants of all tribes award him great respect as a powerful, wise, and noteworthy hero-ancestor - even those of tribes that don't worship Minderhal or that disagree with the herald's beliefs. When a stone giant exemplifies many of the god's ideal traits, members of the tribe often consider that giant a spiritual incarnation of Iuu, as if the herald granted the leader a portion of his own spirit at birth, destining that child for greatness.",
			"",
			"When he visits the mortal world, Iuu typically travels with other stone giants; it's very rare that he's encountered alone. Usually, his companions are members of the tribe he came to the Material Plane to help. However, in rare cases, the giants who accompany him are his \"proud children\"-worthy petitioners temporarily given mortal bodies in the form of fiendish stone giants. These companions give Iuu many hands to accomplish tasks that, even with his great strength and knowledge, would be difficult to handle alone."

Much as a true champion of freedom loathes charm spells for temporarily enslaving a person's free will, Latten Mechanism believes spells such as control construct are a violation of a sentient construct's free will, and only uses them as a last resort to peacefully end a threat. When confronted by a dangerous construct in an enemy's service, Latten Mechanism has been known to render the construct helpless and flee with it, returning to deal with the construct's master at a later time. The herald is a legend among intelligent constructs, and many come to Brigh's faith after witnessing or experiencing its generosity and leniency.",
			"",
			"The herald doesn't speak in battle, as it prefers to fool its opponents into mistaking it for a mindless clockwork foe. Outside of combat, it's curious about its allies' inventions and crafting projects, and it can provide many insights into how the ally might overcome various obstacles to achieve greater successes (although it sometimes needs a few minutes to update its mind with knowledge suitable for the conversation). It can speak equally well out of its termite or humanoid mouth, and sometimes uses both in the same conversation, adding deep emphasis to certain words with its inhuman vocal apparatus. Both voices have a metallic, echoing twang.",
			"",
			"The herald's proper name is Latten Mechanism, although it answers to either part of its name individually, or even if its name is used as a title (\"the Latten Mechanism\"). Its programming allows it to recognize flattery, insults, and threats, although it doesn't really understand the motivations for such things. The easiest way to anger it is to treat it like an unfeeling, unthinking machine or suggest that it could be parceled into useful parts (in the same way that a dragon would object to a casual discussion of how its hide could be made into armor).",
			"",
			"Latten Mechanism is a created being that has no need to eat or drink. Though it has a need for occasional maintenance to prevent its delicate mechanical parts from seizing up or breaking down, it's effectively immortal. It has no need to reproduce, but it treats all constructs it builds (even the temporary ones) as beloved pets, and is saddened if they are damaged, destroyed, or otherwise compromised. It feels kinship toward mortals who create constructs, so long as those creators are respectful toward their inventions.",
			"",
			"The herald has no particular attachment to any mortal race or country, although it has spent more time among humans and the people of Alkenstar than any other kind or place. It holds neither aversion nor affinity to undead creatures - it considers reusing dead body parts to create new entities essentially similar to reusing metal or wood from a destroyed construct to repair or build another.",
			"",
			"Because it became self-aware only when Brigh built it out of inanimate parts, it has no fear of death-for it, death is the same as the state of non-consciousness it existed in before its activation. If it was destroyed, but Brigh needed its abilities once more, the goddess would recreate and reawaken it; from the herald's perspective, this wouldn't even be an interruption of its consciousness.",
			"",
			"Latten Mechanism has a fondness for small clockwork objects and wind-up toys, such as rolling carts, hopping animals, and music boxes. It collects these treasures much the way noble's child might collect elaborate dolls. A priest who offers such a thing as part of a payment when the herald is called is likely to gain the herald's support, especially if the device features a clever mechanism, such as a dragon toy that utilizes a smokestick to create a miniature breath weapon, or a mechanical spider that utilizes a tanglefoot bag to catch bugs with tiny bursts of sticky webbing.",
			"",
			"**Family:** {family/Herald}",
			"",
			"### Habitat",
			"",
			"The herald spends most of its time on Axis mixing with Brigh's other servitors and pursuing its own research projects. It enjoys the company of axiomites and inevitables, respecting their non-biological anatomies and ever curious about their devotion to law. It sometimes directly intervenes in the mortal world by soothing a rampaging construct that might accidentally kill a genius inventor, but otherwise limits its interactions to those commanded by Brigh.",
			"",
			"Among the servitors of Brigh, Latten Mechanism is admired for its crafting skills and devotion to all artificial creatures. Some servitors who become melancholy and long to become true flesh beings seek counsel from the herald, hoping to gain a better appreciation of their mechanical bodies and the uniqueness of their souls."

			"",
			"**Create Spawn (Su)** Any creature slain by the Maw (including those that die from any of its special attacks or disease) rises 1 round later as a bloody skeleton loyal to the herald.",
			"",
			"**Deathless (Su)** The Maw is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points, but it returns to unlife 1 hour later at 1 hit point, allowing its fast healing to resume healing it thereafter. The Maw can be permanently destroyed if it is destroyed by positive energy, if it is reduced to 0 hit points in the area of a bless or hallow spell, or if its remains are sprinkled with 20 vials of holy water.",
			"",
			"**Desecrate (Sp)** The bonuses from the Maw's constant desecrate spell-like ability (always centered on it) are calculated into the stats above.",
			"",
			"**Devour Soul (Su)** By using its swallow whole ability, the herald can deal 12d6+18 points of damage to a swallowed creature as if using a slay living spell. A DC 21 Fortitude save reduces this damage to 3d6+18. A swallowed creature must make this save every round on the herald's turn. The soul of a creature slain by this attack becomes trapped within the herald's skull (the creature's body is regurgitated immediately as a mangled wreck of shattered bone and chewed meat). The creature cannot be brought back to life until the herald's destruction (or a spell deflection-see below) releases its soul. The Maw can hold only one soul at a time. The trapped essence provides the Maw with fast healing 20, lasting 1 round for every Hit Die of the devoured soul. The trapped soul gains one permanent negative level for every round it spends within the Maw - these negative levels remain if the creature is brought back to life (but they do not stack with any negative levels imparted by being brought back to life). A soul that is completely consumed may only be restored to life by a miracle or wish spell. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Spell Deflection (Su)** If any of the following spells is cast at the Maw and overcomes its spell resistance, it instead affects the devoured soul: banishment, chaos hammer, confusion, crushing despair, detect thoughts, dispel evil, dominate person, fear, geas/quest, holy word, hypnotism, imprisonment, magic jar, maze, suggestion, trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. While none of these effects harms the soul, the caster makes a DC 25 caster level check when a spell is deflected-success indicates that the trapped soul is released from its prison and the creature whose body it belonged to can now be restored to life as normal.",
			"",
			"**Swallow Whole (Ex)** If a creature cuts its way out of the Maw after being swallowed, the Maw can use swallow whole once its fast healing repairs the damage caused by its prey cutting itself free.",
			"",
			"**True Herald Despite (Ex)** its type and Hit Dice, Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. Despite its type and Hit Dice, it can be conjured using the spell greater planar binding.",
			"",
			"**Vomit Swarm (Su)** Once per round as a free action, the Maw can vomit forth a swarm of maggots (use the statistics for [army ants](monster/army_ant_swarm)) into a square adjacent to it, after which the swarm moves in a direction of the Maw's choosing. These swarms persist for 10 rounds.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"The Mother's Maw is the herald of Urgathoa. A disgusting undead creature that comes to the mortal realm at the command of the Pallid Princess, it is an unsubtle thing of ravenous hunger, with little purpose but to kill, eat, and animate corpses as undead. Though it is as brilliant as a lich, its only interests are in satisfy its cravings for sensation.",
			"",
			"The Maw has little interest in the desires of mortals (or of undead in the mortal world) except for how they intersect with Urgathoa's orders. If it is necessary to eat a hundred members of her cult, or to drive an entire city of ghouls into a lava pit, the Maw does it. It can speak but finds little worth talking about, so many assume it is as mindless as an animated skeleton. However, when not on a mission of death, disease, or gluttony, it is a font of knowledge about food, wine, exotic scents, and other strange experiences only an undead creature can understand, and is quite willing to speak on these matters to an interested party-assuming the sight of the enormous talking, winged skull isn't a distraction to listeners.",
			"",
			"Although the Maw normally appears as a bare skull, it sometimes covers itself with its swarms. Whether this is out of a morbid sense of humor or an attempt to remember an old sensation from its life is unknown. It has confirmed that it was once a devourer, and before that a living creature, but it does not give further details.",

			"",
			"**Curse of Ages (Su)** The first time in a round that Charon strikes a creature with a weapon or a successful touch attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 40 Fortitude save or instantly grow decrepit and feeble, as if the target suddenly became venerable. The target's Constitution, Dexterity, and Strength scores are reduced by 6, but its mental ability scores are not increased. If Charon touches or strikes a venerable target (either a naturally venerable creature or a creature suffering from this effect or a similar magical effect), that creature is subjected to memory loss (see below). Curse of the ages is an aging and a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Memory Loss (Su)** When Charon strikes a creature with a Stygian bolt or touches or strikes a venerable target, he can affect that creature with memory loss. A creature affected by memory loss must succeed at a DC 40 Will save or gain 2 permanent negative levels as swaths of memory are wiped away. These negative levels are a mind-affecting effect but not a negative energy effect. If these negative levels cause the target's total number of negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice, instead of dying the target enters a catatonic state that lasts as long as the negative levels from the Stygian bolts continue to cause its total number of negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice. The save DC is Charisma-based.",
			"",
			"**Reach of the Styx (Su)** Once per hour as a standard action, Charon can transport himself and any adjacent creatures - such as passengers on his skiff - to any point touched by the River Styx, even if he is not currently on a plane through which it flows, traveling as if via a plane shift spell.",
			"",
			"**Stygian Bolt (Su)** As a standard action, Charon can spit four blasts of Stygian water from his mouth. Each of these Stygian bolts can target a different creature. These attacks are treated as ranged attacks with a range increment of 100 feet. On a hit, a Stygian bolt deals 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and inflicts memory loss.",

			"**Transform Mount (Su)** As a swift action, Charon can cause his mount, the Pale Horse, to transform into a skiff that can carry up to four passengers plus himself. He can also transform this skiff back into the Pale Horse as a swift action, in which case he automatically mounts the Pale Horse and any passengers or cargo in the skiff are dumped into adjacent squares.",

			"",
			"Charon, the Horseman of Death and Boatman of the Styx, is ancient even by comparison to his kindred Horsemen. Of all the Four, he alone was an original Horseman, the first - and only - Lord of Death. Yet Charon's title obfuscates his true focus: not simply death as a whole, which is the purview of all daemons, but specifically death by old age. Even the most virile mortals must eventually succumb to that looming specter, and in this sense, it's unsurprising that the Boatman remains the most powerful of the Four. Like mortality's inevitable end, Charon's patience is legendary.",
			"",
			"Charon resembles his thanadaemons, and most presume that he modeled them after himself. Charon, however, is so ancient as to have preceded the creation of humanoid life and thus his current form is likely nothing more than a modern guise, with his original form long discarded.",
			"",
			"Daemons in Charon's service range far and wide across Abaddon, often riding the Styx to other reaches of the cosmos, hunting souls in his name. Unlike those of the other Horsemen, Charon's servitors often act in understated and subtle ways, yet they harvest just as many souls as others. When approached independently by a traveler, Charon sometimes simply carries the guest off to be consumed. Other times, however, he makes legitimate deals, though his bargains work toward ends hundreds or thousands of years in the making. Charon's dealings also serve him well in other ways, with even his fellows among the Four often quietly acquiescing to his authority. In the past, Charon has bargained with dying and desperate divinities, archfiends, empyreal lords, and even the populations of entire worlds, offering them aid in return for payments of souls, knowing all the while that the bargainers were beyond saving anyway.",
			"",
			"Charon's domain is the largest of the Four, particularly when one takes into account the fact that the River Styx stretches into or borders the others' realms, the unclaimed wastes, and the planes beyond. Every branch of the Styx ultimately flows back to Charon's citadel, the Drowning Court, which comprises hundreds of mobile islands, ships, and floating castles swirling around a massive central whirlpool.",
			"",
			"### Charon's Cult",
			"",
			"Charon is worshiped by ferrymen and -women, grave robbers, undertakers, the undead, and so very many doomed and damned would-be immortals. The Horseman of Death is served by thanadaemons, his deacon servitor race, along with fiendish krakens, grim reapers, hags, hydrodaemons, river monsters, and numerous varieties of undead. Charon's unholy symbol is a skull with coins over its eye sockets, and the quarterstaff is his favored weapon. He grants access to the domains of Death, Evil, Knowledge, and Water, and to the subdomains of Daemon, Ice, Memory, and Undead.",

			"**Corrupted Flames (Su)** Channeling the fury and sorrow of those devoured within the boundaries of her domain, Szuriel's touch corrupts the very essence of fire. Any spell-like ability or supernatural effect used by Szuriel that normally causes fire damage deals half of that damage as fire damage and half of it as profane damage that is not subject to energy resistance or fire immunity.",
			"",
			"**Eruptive Arrival (Su)** When Szuriel uses any teleportation effect, she can create a pyroclastic detonation upon arrival as a swift action. This creates a blast of fire that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 41 half). Szuriel can selectively omit creatures from this effect as she chooses, though she rarely does, enjoying the carnage and death of even her own allies. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Fury of the Forsaken (Su)** As a standard action once per day, Szuriel can instill all non-daemons within a 60-foot radius of herself with a mind-twisting rage and lust for blood. Affected creatures gain a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and a -2 penalty to AC, and they are compelled to attack the nearest creature regardless of any previous allegiances. A creature can resist this effect with a successful DC 36 Will save; otherwise, it persists as long as Szuriel remains within line of sight. When the effect ends, an affected creature becomes fatigued. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect and does not stack with barbarian rage, the rage spell, or similar effects. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"#### Description",
			"",
			"At first glance, Szuriel seems a triumphant, angelic figure. With her ivory skin, flowing golden hair, flawless and powerful body clothed in a coil of unsullied silk, and wings the blue-black of a raven, she appears as a personification of glory from on high - a veritable goddess of war. Up close, however, this impression quickly fades. Mirrored and black as onyx, Szuriel's eyes bleed constantly in crimson rivulets that run down her cheeks and fall to the ground. When she deigns to smile, she reveals a mouth of jagged, razor-sharp fangs more befitting a shark or dragon than anything humanoid. Szuriel's greatsword, Lamentation of the Faithless, has been wielded by every Horseman of War dating back to the first, and it is said to be the corrupted blade of an ancient and forgotten empyreal lord.",
			"",
			"The Horseman of War was once a fallen mortal paladin. After she was excommunicated for her sins, she became a conquering general and finally a ruling empress who slaughtered the followers of her former faith. Her own death came not on the battlefield but by an assassin's blade, yet this merely opened the greatest chapter in her conquests by propelling her into Abaddon and, in time, the role of the Horseman of War.",
			"",
			"Szuriel makes open mockery of all angels, playing upon their thematic elements in her warped, destructive interactions with mortals, awing both the misguided and those fully cognizant of her nature. Her cults often portray her not as a paragon of destruction, conquest, and genocide, but as promising righteous victory, with the souls of fallen soldiers elevated to paradise regardless of what horrific crimes they commit.",
			"",
			"Szuriel's armies represent the largest and most strictly organized force in Abaddon, but at any given moment, fully half of the Horseman's armies are scattered throughout the planes in mercenary service to various Abyssal lords, archdevils, and whatever other forces purchase their services. Most times, that price is steep, as Szuriel demands living mortals or souls, or the right to consume those who fall upon the field of battle. When her armies march upon the mortal plane, they honor their commitments just long enough to make their \"allies\" complacent before engaging in systematic genocide.",
			"",
			"### Szuriel's Cult",

			"Szuriel is worshiped by those associated with every facet of war, including everything leading up to it and arising in its bloody wake. Arms dealers, looters, mercenaries, soldiers, and warlords worship the Angel of Desolation.

The Seraph of Devastation is served by her deacon race of purrodaemons as well as carrion eaters, obcisidaemons, undead soldiers, war beasts, and warswornB4.

This previous Horseman was herself a parasitic entity, and once per hour as an immediate action, Trelmarixian can lower his resistance to his predecessor's rage to allow her to infuse him with fury from within. When Trelmarixian does so, he gains the effects of righteous might, and his regeneration increases to 30 for 4 rounds.

His stomach functions similarly to an extradimensional space and can hold any number of creatures. If Trelmarixian swallows an object that contains an extradimensional space (such as a bag of holding or a portable hole), that object cannot be opened while it is within the Horseman of Famine's belly, but it does not otherwise interact with his stomach in a destructive way.",

A creature that succeeds at a DC 36 Will save instead takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage and is staggered for 1 round. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.",

			"The youngest but perhaps most ambitious of the Four, Trelmarixian the Black obsesses over soul consumption, riding the line between brutal, amoral science and quasi-religious zealotry. A perpetually ravenous shapeshifting horror, Trelmarixian maintains a three headed humanoid shape - but only just, with his frame constantly shuddering and shifting and threatening to slump into a protoplasmic slurry of bile, blood, and mucus. Trelmarixian was once a meladaemon himself, and his meladaemon servitors, while always emaciated and bestial, have become more canine in appearance under his rule. When the so-called Lysogenic Prince rose to power, he overthrew and consumed his predecessor, but he maintains a fragment of her existence within him to fuel periodic bouts of parasitic rage.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian embodies not only starvation, but also the broader concept of wasting, both physical and metaphysical, particularly the lingering dooms of cancer, parasitism, and spiritual decay. Like the viral afflictions he represents, the Horseman of Famine behaves like his chosen concept in a concrete manner, having secretively inserted fragments of his physical form into many of his servitors. This bombards him with sensory information on a truly maddening scale, and thus Trelmarixian's fragmented mind brims with insanity and a multitude of voices, including that of his predecessor. He still adores her in his own fashion, and she in turn speaks to him, advising as she sees fit or mocking his shortcomings like an aggressive, self-aware conscience. By force of will, he can silence the voices, but the thing that haunts him more than any of these cannot be so easily dismissed. Most daemons retain only fractured, fragmented recollections of their mortal life. Trelmarixian, on the other hand, remembers everything save for the last few minutes of his life. As a mortal, daemon-blooded tiefling, Trelmarixian exterminated all life on his world with a work of profound sorcery, but in doing so he condemned himself to starvation. Near the moment of his agonizing death, he recalls someone talking to him, asking him questions and mocking his success as paltry compared to what awaited him after death. Despite his destruction of everyone he had ever known in life, someone was there, and he cannot remember that person's face or final words.",
			"",
			"Trelmarixian's memories haunt him still, as does the question of whose blood his soul carried, and thus who may still have some unknown claim on him, such as a long-dead Horseman of Famine. He's likewise haunted by the notion that he was born to be the vector for his progenitor's return - one virus within another, waiting and incubating, to someday express itself and snuff him out as he did his own predecessor.",

During the honeymoon, Ilzunae brings the friend to a distant city via teleportation, informs the friend of her plans before releasing him, then teleports back to the honeymooners, where she possesses one of them to enjoy their first night of wedded bliss. The non-possessed spouse never survives until the dawn, and if they are lucky, Ilzunae waits until the final hour of the night to shift from sharing bliss to giving pain. She then abandons the possessed widow or widower with a message that all this was made possible through the jealousy of the friend, who has fled to a distant city. In most cases, the surviving spouse either commits suicide or seeks out the \"friend\" to murder them, and when she can, Ilzunae enjoys intercepting those sinful lost souls when they come to the Abyss so she can harvest and keep them in gilt bird cages in her palace as trophies.",

			"The ambitious Gnargorak always hungered for power and status, but he didn't aspire to be Jarl of all Jarls until Winter's Heart came into his grasp. The sword whispered dreams of greatness to Gnargorak, of lordship over all frost giants. The first obstacle to establishing his regime was the ancient silver dragon Lanargix, long a thorn in the side of frost giants throughout the Tusk Mountains. Jarl Gnargorak filled her hide with a dozen arrows before meeting her in melee, sword to claw. With the dead dragon's horns adorning his staff, Gnargorak proclaimed himself the chosen of Thremyr and high jarl of all frost giants, in the Tusk Mountains and beyond. Now, a full score of Tusk Mountain jarls openly swear fealty to Gnargorak. Others placate him, lest they draw his wrath. Only the jarl's lack of focus and unceasing need to conquer keeps him from uniting the remaining giants of the Tusks under one banner.",
			"",
			"The skulls of those who dared dispute his sovereignty line the path to his mountain fortress of Bos-Phargrumm. He rarely sets foot in this ice castle, as raiding the hated [Mammoth Lords](rule/aff_beast_riders) brings him far more pleasure than consolidating his rule. The towering citadel that reaches into the clouds stays busy even without its ostensible owner sitting upon its massive, ornate throne. Jarl Gnargorak's cloud giant harem lives there, serving as his advisors, maintaining the treasuries, collecting taxes from lands Gnargorak has claimed, and negotiating with the tribes on the jarl's behalf. They grow tired of this work, as the jarl is far more interested in conquering new territory than in ruling over that which he holds.",
			"",
			"Winter's Heart also grows weary of Gnargorak's lack of dedication to building a true empire. Of late, the sword has denied the jarl its greater powers except in times of dire need. It constantly searches for another potential leader to bear it and use it to impose rule over the north. Of course, the jarl never lets Winter's Heart leave his presence, so the sword's options are limited. The artifact is unattended only while the jarl is in his personal chambers, where he feels he's safe. But one of his harem has communicated with the sword and sympathizes with its goals. She watches for the best candidates, and invites them to Bos-Phargrumm on false pretenses so she can weigh their acumen. She and Winter's Heart haven't found a suitable leader among the frost giants; there's no shortage of ambition among their kind, but no tribal leader has half the experience or cunning Gnargorak does.",
			"",
			"Though other frost giants admire and fear Jarl Gnargorak's prowess in battle, they view his harem of cloud giants with private derision and a touch of envy. Even given the jarl's imposing 16-foot stature, his brides all stand noticeably taller than he. Gnargorak prizes his exotic harem, and eagerly anticipates the birth of a son surely destined to be the mightiest frost giant in all the Tusks. Yet despite his many brides, the jarl's seed has yet to bear fruit. His displeasure over this continued lack of an heir drives him to ever more brutal raids against the Mammoth Lords so that he can at least leave a legacy of conquest and make a mark for all to see in the histories of the north - even if there would be no one of his own blood to take over his domain.",
			"",
			"Jarl Gnargorak leads a veritable army, but because he started out as a hunter, not a soldier, he uses his forces in unconventional ways that suit the tactics he learned in the wild. Rather than simply leading an overwhelming force directly into battle against the Mammoth Lords, he draws the warriors' attention away from the safety of their followings and into his snares and ambushes. Only when a group is weakened does he sweep in to destroy them.",

			"**Blinding Flash (Su)** By spreading her wings as a full-round action while she stands upon the ground, Agyra can create a blinding flash of light that targets all creatures within 100 feet. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded and staggered for 1d6 rounds by the blast of light. A successful saving throw reduces the blindness to 1 round and negates the staggered effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, each of Agyra's twin heads can breathe out a line of electricity to a range of 1,200 feet. Agyra can breathe each line in a different direction. Each creature caught in a line of electricity must succeed at a DC 41 Reflex save or take 20d6 points of electricity damage and be staggered for 1d4 rounds. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. A creature struck by both breath weapons simultaneously must attempt separate saving throws against each breath weapon, but takes a -4 penalty on both - the damage and staggered condition duration stack with each other. A creature wearing medium or heavy metal armor or a creature composed mostly of metal that fails its saving throw is also stunned for 1 round. A creature slain by Agyra's breath weapon remains electrified for 2d4 rounds after death-any creature that touches the body automatically takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Electrified Corpse (Su)** If Agyra is slain, her corpse crackles and flashes with pulses of electrical light if she has not used her rebirth ability that year. Any creature that touches her corpse takes 3d6 points of electricity damage. Even if Agyra's body is destroyed, the site of her death continues to carry this electrical charge for 1 minute, or until Agyra is reborn, whichever comes first.",
			"",
			"**Hurricane (Sp)** Once per day, Agyra can create a supernatural hurricane surrounding herself. This effect functions as control weather, save that it affects an area with a 4-mile radius, lasts for 24 hours, and can only be used to create hurricane-force winds. The hurricane created is static, and features a calm eye at the center with a 500-foot radius.",
			"",
			"**Rebirth (Su)** Agyra remains dead for only 1 minute before she come back to life, as if via a true resurrection spell. Agyra rises from the exact same position she occupied when she died, and typically takes advantage of this second chance to use her swift flight to escape as soon as possible. Agyra can only be reborn in this manner once per year; if she is slain a second time before a year has passed, her death is permanent and her corpse does not become electrified. This ability replaces Agyra's ability to immediately heal damage that would normally kill her, granted by her recovery ability, but does not replace the other defenses granted by recovery.",
			"",
			"**Storm Flier (Ex)** Agyra does not take penalties on Fly checks when flying in strong or more powerful winds.",
			"",
			"**Swift Flight (Su)** As a standard action once per hour, Agyra can fly in a straight line at an incredible speed. She may travel up to 1 mile in this manner-doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. When Agyra activates this ability, her thunderous blast ability is automatically triggered from the swift flight's point of origin.",
			"",
			"**Thunderous Blast (Su)** When Agyra uses her swift flight, she creates a thunderous sonic boom. This devastating explosion of sound occurs at her location when she activates swift flight, filling an area equal to her space and her reach combined-resulting in a 100-foot-diameter burst of sonic energy. All creatures in this area of effect take 20d10 points of sonic damage, are permanently deafened, are knocked prone, and are stunned for 1 round. A successful DC 41 Reflex save halves the damage, reduces the deafened condition to 1d4 rounds, and negates the knocked prone and stun effects entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",

			"Agyra, the Forever Storm, is believed by many cultures to be the cause of seasonal typhoons or other great storms - such tempests being a manifestation of Agyra's monstrous breaths as she exhales during her long slumber every season. While this kaiju is not in fact responsible for the world's storms, her powers over wind and lightning are significant, and when she is vexed to rampage, the effects of her hurricanes can be as devastating to a region as her more direct attacks.",
			"",
			"Agyra has the appearance of a primeval, two-headed flying reptile with a wingspan of over 150 feet. Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances.",
			"",
			"Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers' travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature - and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She's been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island's inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers' destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves - they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju's vengeful wrath in this situation.",
			"",
			"There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives' ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island.",
			"",
			"Agyra has a particular hatred of the kaiju Mogaru, and often leaves her volcanic lair to fly west to the remote jungle lake that serves as Mogaru's home to clash with her nemesis. Mogaru's penchant for attacking coastal cities often results in a devastating escalation when Agyra arrives to do battle with the land-bound kaiju. Sometimes, methods of conjuring Agyra are used to deliberately lure the kaiju to a city besieged by Mogaru, but just as often her arrival seems to be driven by self-interest. Agyra typically manages to weaken Mogaru enough to drive him off, but is often slain herself in these battles, resurrecting and returning to her home at the same time Mogaru returns to his. The nature of this rivalry is unclear, but kaiju scholars believe that the two monsters have been enemies for longer than humanity has existed.",

			"**Heat Beam (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Bezravnis can fire beams of searing heat and fire from one of its three stingers. Each stinger's heat beam is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju may fire one heat beam from a stinger as a move action, two heat beams as a standard action, or all three as a full-round action. Each heat beam is a 1,200-foot-long line that deals 20d6 points of fire damage to everything in its path (Reflex DC 40 half). If Bezravnis fires more than one heat beam, it can direct them in different directions. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Poison (Su)** Sting-injury; save Fort DC 40; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect staggered for 1 round plus loss of fire immunity and resistance; cure 3 consecutive saves. As long as a creature suffers the effects of Bezravnis's poison, it loses all racial resistances and immunities to fire. Any spell or spell-like effects active when the target fails its initial saving throw against this poison are suppressed as long as it continues to be staggered by the poison. New effects of this nature that become active after that initial failed saving throw function normally if the caster succeeds at a DC 35 caster level check; otherwise, the spell effects are suppressed until the victim is no longer staggered.",
			"",
			"**Web (Ex)** Bezravnis's webs are immune to fire damage. In addition, these webs are semi-living things that continue to crush and squeeze those entangled by them. If a creature is entangled in the webs, at the start of each turn during which it is entangled, it takes 2d6+6 points of bludgeoning damage as the webs crush and constrict it. This ability otherwise functions the same as the [universal monster ability](umr/web).",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Bezravnis, known also as the Inferno Below, dwells in the sands of a sparsely inhabited high-altitude desert found in the shadow of the world's largest mountain range. There, the 130-foot-long beast slumbers the centuries away until its cycle of wakefulness rouses it from its torpor and causes it to emerge from the sands in an eruption of fire and ash. The Inferno Below then begins its rampage, traveling in a straight line toward a heavily populated region bordering the great desert. Typically, the Inferno Below's rampage is limited to a single city, and never the same one twice in a row. After destroying no less than two-thirds of the city, it retreats back to the vast desert, burrows deep, and settles into a new sleep of ages.",
			"",
			"The reason for the Inferno Below's cyclic rampages is not well understood, but the cycle of these rampages functions like clockwork - they take place every 273 years with little deviation. As there seems to be no pattern to the kaiju's attacks themselves, with a different city being targeted each cycle, the cities of the bordering nations do their best to prepare for the monster's attack. The nations themselves have little love for each other, and attempts to generate lures to direct the kaiju's march toward an enemy city are common - yet these lures have yet to work, and in fact they seem to result in the kaiju attacking a city in the luring nation more often than not. Other cities spare no expense during a so-called \"Inferno Season,\" and send huge armies of scouts into the desert to watch for signs of the kaiju's emergence or traces of its burrowing passage through the sands, in hopes of determining the direction of the beast's travel and warning likely target cities (or, in the case of a trajectory that leads it to an enemy city, working to silence warnings).",
			"",
			"Kaiju scholars have correlated Bezravnis's appearance with the passage of a singular red comet in the skies above the world - an astronomical event known as the Inferno Star. As the comet nears the world, Bezravnis emerges, and as the comet vanishes from the sky, the kaiju turns its back and returns to the desert. Confirmation of this correlation has given rise to numerous theories. Some believe that Bezravnis first fell to the world from the Inferno Star, and its advent wakens within the beast a bewildered longing for home that drives it into a frenzy. Others hold that the kaiju exists as a guardian against an even more deadly occupant of the Inferno Star, and that by displaying its power by destroying a city, Bezravnis is in fact protecting the world by driving the Inferno Star back into the depths of space.",
			"",
			"But Bezravnis doesn't always have the luxury of waiting for the Inferno Star to draw near before waking. At several points in the past, lunatics, cults, and accidents have woken the kaiju before its appointed time. Some mad, apocalyptic-minded spellcasters use powerful magic to cause great explosions above the sands where the kaiju slumbers. Earthquakes, severe weather phenomena, and similar natural events have been known to waken the monster early as well. When Bezravnis wakens off-cycle like this, the monster is particularly foul-tempered. It's rampage does not follow a straight line-instead, its travels are erratic as it pursues the perceived cause of its wakening with single-minded ferocity and tenacity. In this way, cults have accomplished what the border nations have not-leading the kaiju to attack an enemy. Of course, such tactics are dangerous and often backfire, for Bezravnis is fast and destructive, and it has been known to follow such tormenters.",
			"",
			"Bezravnis doesn't seem to be particularly vexed by the presence of other kaiju, and ignores them unless it is attacked first. Once attacked, however, the Inferno Below becomes singularly focused and deviates from its path to fight the target creature as long as it remains visible or alive. Smaller foes can sometimes distract the kaiju from its path in this manner if they can deal enough damage upon the creature to bait it into directing its furious rage on them.",

			"**Absorb Energy (Ex)** Mogaru absorbs energy attacks that damage him, including negative energy attacks. Damage blocked by one of his resistances or immunities instead heals him an amount equal to the damage dealt. He may absorb only one kind of energy in this manner in a round. The first type of energy that affects him in a round (whether or not it penetrates his immunities or resistance to actually damage him) sets the type of energy he absorbs for that round. Hit points gained in excess of his normal maximum are lost. Mogaru cannot gain healing from energy effects generated by himself.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon (Su)** Once every 4 rounds, Mogaru can breathe out a beam of fiery red force. When Mogaru uses this attack, he can choose to focus the breath weapon into a single 1,200-foot-long line, or he can shorten the range and turn his head and body while breathing, effectively affecting a 600-foot-long cone. All creatures caught in this area of effect take 20d6 points of fire damage, 20d6 points of force damage, and are staggered for 1d6 rounds from the devastating energy (Reflex DC 42 halves the damage and prevents the staggered effect). A creature slain by this effect is disintegrated, whether the saving throw was successful or not. This breath weapon is particularly effective at blasting through cover-cover does not grant any bonuses on Reflex saves against Mogaru's breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Firebolts (Su)** As a standard action on any round immediately following the use of his breath weapon, Mogaru can fire bolts of red energy from the glowing spines along his back. These bolts are ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. When Mogaru uses this ability, he must choose between firing one firebolt, three firebolts, or six firebolts. If he fires one, it deals 20d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires three bolts, each deals 8d6 points of damage on a hit. If he fires six bolts, each deals 5d6 points of damage on a hit. Half of the damage caused by any one firebolt is fire damage, the other half is force damage. Firebolts deal full damage against objects, and ignore the first 10 points of hardness possessed by an object.",
			"",
			"**Reflexive Breath (Ex)** The first time in any round that Mogaru can make an attack of opportunity, he can choose to use a diminished version of his breath weapon instead of making a physical attack. This reflexive breath weapon attack only targets the creature that provoked the attack of opportunity, but otherwise causes the same damage and effects his breath weapon normally inflicts (Reflex DC 32 halves the damage and negates the staggered effect). Use of his breath weapon in this way does not affect the recharge rate of the regular breath weapon. The save DC is Constitution-based, and includes a -10 penalty to reflect the fact that the reflexive breath is a shorter (but no less intense) blast of energy than the kaiju's typical breath weapon attack.",
			"",
			"**Sense Kaiju (Su)** Mogaru can sense the location of the nearest active kaiju, as if using discern location, at will.",
			"",
			"**Susceptible to Song (Ex)** Mogaru's actions can be influenced by song, provided the kaiju notices the singing. If the kaiju is not currently engaged in battle, he automatically hears any song within 100 feet that is directed at him in an attempt to influence him, but when he is in combat, there's only a cumulative 20% chance per round of sustained singing that he notices the song. In order to influence Mogaru, the singer must make a DC 35 Perform (sing) check (this check cannot be bolstered by the aid another action, and the singer cannot take 10 or 20 on the check). The result of this check sets the DC of the Will save Mogaru must make in order to not be influenced by the song. The singer can choose to influence Mogaru as if she had successfully cast suggestion on the kaiju (CL = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing]). If Mogaru succeeds at a Will save (DC = the singer's ranks in Perform [sing] + the singer's Charisma modifier), the effects of the influence last for a maximum of 1d4 rounds; otherwise, the effects last as long as a suggestion spell would normally last. Mogaru cannot use his recovery ability to recover from song influence, and a single singer may influence Mogaru only once per day.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Mogaru, known as the Final King to kaiju scholars, or simply as King Mogaru, is one of the most destructive of his kind. Although not the most powerful kaiju (a sobering thought in and of itself), Mogaru is certainly the most active of the known kaiju. Additionally, Mogaru seems to be as eager to rampage through the works of humanity as he is to attack and kill other kaiju, making him something of a mixed blessing to kaiju-threatened cities. While the prospect of an attack by Mogaru is the stuff of nightmares, the possibility of his intervention during a different kaiju attack is the stuff of hope, though the damage dealt to a city during its defense may be significant. Mogaru appears as a towering dinosaur with twin tails, spines that glow red as he uses his breath weapon, and two powerful clawed forearms.",
			"",
			"King Mogaru dwells in the depths of a tropical jungle, sleeping silently at the bottom of an unusually deep lake until roused. Legends hold that Mogaru was born of the world itself, either formed from the spirits of countless plants and animals resulting from ages of hunting and predation by humanoids for food or sport, or formed from the souls of the countless slain in an ancient apocalypse or war that devastated one of the first of the world's empires. Regardless of the actual cause, the birth of Mogaru in these legends seems to be the same-soon after another kaiju, Lord Varklops, emerged from an erupting volcano, Mogaru rose to oppose the Thrice-Headed Fiend in a vast battle that nearly slew Varklops while devastating an entire nation in the process. Mogaru is also rumored to have slain no fewer than a dozen other kaiju, including Agmazar the Star Titan, now believed to be the only undead kaiju in existence.",
			"",
			"Of particular note is the curious fact that Mogaru exhibits a particularly unique interest in song. Legends of skilled singers being able to save their cities with a single mournful paean to the kaiju, or of vengeful bards using their craft to waken the monster from his lair to send him on a rampage are common along coastal regions with a history of kaiju attacks, and in such regions renowned singers are well respected for this ability to influence one of the world's most destructive creatures. Kaiju scholars suspect that song manages to penetrate Mogaru's memories of some primeval event, but the reasons for the kaiju's reaction to the song are its own.",

Each head's breath weapon is a separate attack with its own 4-round recharge period. The kaiju can exhale one line of fire as a move action, two lines as a standard action, or three lines as a full-round action. Each breath weapon deals 20d6 points of fire damage and 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to all creatures in the area of effect as they are barraged with semi-solid chunks of superheated rock and magma expelled in the torrent of fire; targets are also stunned for 1 round by the overwhelming force. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, a creature takes half damage and negates the stun effect. If Varklops exhales more than one breath weapon, he can use them in different directions. If a creature is subjected to more than one breath weapon in a round in this manner, it takes damage from and must attempt separate saves against each breath weapon. The save DCs are Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Deflect Cold (Ex)** Although Varklops is vulnerable to cold damage, he can shield himself from a cold attack by reflexively curling his wings around himself as an immediate action when he would otherwise take cold damage. He must choose to use this ability before any cold damage from the attack is applied and before he attempts any applicable saving throws to resist the cold damage, but he can wait until after the attack hits to choose to deflect cold. When he uses this ability, all cold damage from that particular attack is ignored. At Varklops's discretion, he can deflect the cold damage to any single adjacent creature, which is then instead treated as the target of the cold attack. If the cold attack was an area effect that also affected the adjacent creature, that creature does not take the cold damage twice, but does need to attempt two saving throws (if applicable) against the effect, taking the worse of the two results as the actual result.",

			"",
			"**Distracted When Outnumbered (Ex)** While Varklops is furiously focused on slaying kaiju, his rudimentary intellect supports a surprisingly powerful and inflated sense of self-worth that crumbles when he faces overwhelming odds. In any combat round that involves two allied kaiju focusing their efforts against him, Varklops loses his kaijuslayer ability and becomes so distracted by which target to focus on that he must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or become staggered for that round. Non-kaiju cannot distract Varklops in this manner, even if the non-kaiju is similar in size to a kaiju.",
			"",
			"**Eruption (Su)** Up to three times per day (but no more than once every 4 rounds) as Varklops emerges onto the surface of terrain after burrowing, he does so with an explosion of ash and magma. All creatures within 150 feet of Varklops when he bursts out of the ground in this manner take 20d6 points of fire damage. Huge or smaller creatures in this area are knocked prone. With a successful DC 43 Reflex save, creatures take half the damage and negate being knocked prone, but a creature that takes any damage from this eruption is subjected to Varklops's burn ability. In addition, the eruption creates a cloud of ash in the area of effect; this cloud of ash lingers in the area for 1 minute, obscuring vision as per obscuring mist. The save DC is Constitution-based.",

Although the fact that Lord Varklops so eagerly hunts and slays kaiju might seem to make him an ally of all civilizations threatened by such creatures, in truth Varklops is also one of the few kaiju to be actively evil in his predations upon the world. When no other kaiju present themselves as victims and the urge to destroy seizes Varklops, the so-called Thrice-Headed Fiend thinks nothing of razing entire cities for his pleasure.",

Creatures that are pushed take 1d6 additional points of bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they are pushed, but can attempt a DC 43 Reflex save to halve this additional damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Infuse Terrain (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, Vorgozen can dematerialize and seep into the terrain, infusing it with her polluted nature. The kaiju appears to simply melt into the surrounding terrain when she uses this ability, vanishing from view. The terrain in a 1-mile radius becomes infused with the kaiju's essence - if the terrain is swamp or other wetland, the radius increases to 10 miles. While infusing terrain, Vorgozen cannot be harmed, and all magical effects generated in the region can trigger polluted effects (see Polluted Magic below). Vorgozen remains aware of what takes place in the region of infused terrain, and she can remain infused in the terrain indefinitely, during which time she does not need to breathe, eat, or sleep. She can emerge from the terrain at any point within the infused region as a swift action, gaining the benefit of a heal spell (CL 20th) when she does so. Alternatively, she can suppress all effects of her presence on the terrain for up to 24 hours to move at a speed of 50 miles per hour, as per shadow walk. When she ceases moving (typically upon arriving at a region with powerful magic that has drawn her attention), her presence remains suppressed and she cannot move for the remainder of the 24 hours, at which point the suppression ends and her presence again infuses the surrounding terrain.",
			"",
			"**Polluted Magic (Su)** Vorgozen's presence pollutes magic, causing magical abilities to become unreliable when used within 300 feet of the kaiju. When a creature within this area generates a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural effect, roll on the table below to see how Vorgozen's polluting presence hampers or transforms the effect. Effects created by creatures outside of this 300-foot aura are unaffected by Vorgozen's polluted magic, even if the effect of the spell or supernatural ability enters the area of polluted magic or targets Vorgozen. Likewise, ongoing spell effects or supernatural effects are not polluted when Vorgozen's aura envelops them. Vorgozen's own supernatural abilities never trigger polluted magic effects.",

			"Most kaiju are ancient creatures that have dwelled in hidden lairs since the dawn of civilization, prehistoric monsters woken from eons-long slumbers, or alien entities who visit the world only rarely. But Vorgozen (referred to as the Shapeless Feeder by some, and as Queen Vorgozen by those who wish to see all magic abolished from the world) is a relatively recent addition to the world's kaiju. This accidental but overwhelmingly powerful creation was forged from the unfortunate combination of hubris and arrogance. The absolute destruction of the remote academy in an immense fen that gave rise to the Shapeless Feeder left few clues as to the nature of the potent magic the wizards there were toying with. What hints remain suggest it involved reverse-engineering an artifact in an attempt to distill the potent powers held within the core of a once flying city.",
			"",
			"Born as she was out of the abuse of magical power, Vorgozen is very much a personification of the arrogant wizard who values the study and mastery of magic and the pursuit of arcane power over all else. The Shapeless Feeder was not content to remain at the epicenter of her accidental creation, and has instead seeped through the world, drawn by powerful magical auras or supernatural foci. Fortunately for civilization, after emerging to destroy, the Shapeless Feeder invariably retreats to vast swamplands such as the site of her genesis to hibernate for decades before rousing once again from her slumber.",
			"",
			"The powerful magic of other kaiju's supernatural abilities is particularly coveted by Vorgozen, and she enjoys polluting these effects more than any other. She is often drawn to places where other kaiju rampage as a result.",

			"**Clinging Frost (Su)** Whenever a creature takes cold damage from Yarthoon (including from her freezing mist), the creature becomes encrusted with a layer of clinging frost for 1 round. The duration of this clinging frost stacks with multiple instances of cold damage from Yarthoon. As long as a creature has at least 1 round of clinging frost remaining, it takes a -2 penalty on all Reflex saving throws and Dexterity-based skill checks. As long as a creature has at least 2 rounds of clinging frost remaining, it is staggered. Freedom of movement negates the effects of clinging frost, and if a creature activates a fire-based supernatural ability on its turn, it reduces the number of rounds remaining by 1d4. Creatures with the fire subtype, the heat ability, or any similar ability to shed significant warmth are immune to clinging frost.",
			"",
			"**Eye Beams (Su)** Once every 4 rounds as a standard action, Yarthoon can emit several beams of freezing energy from her eyes. When Yarthoon uses this attack, she can choose to fire all of the beams in one direction to create a single line 1,200 feet long, or she can instead fire eight separate beams as ranged touch attacks with a range of 1,200 feet. If she chooses to fire them in a line, all creatures within the area of effect take 20d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 38 half). If she fires the beams as ranged touch attacks, she has a +30 attack bonus but can target a single creature with no more than two eye beams at a time (though she can fire the beams in any direction to attack multiple targets in range). A single eye beam deals 8d6 points of cold damage on a hit (no save). The save DC for the line-based attack is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Freezing Mist (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, Yarthoon can exhale a cloud of freezing mist, filling a 200-foot-radius sphere surrounding her. This mist obscures vision as per obscuring mist and persists for 10 rounds, and is not dispersed by moderate wind. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the mist in 2d4 rounds, while fireball, flame strike, or similar spells burn away the mist in the spell's area. Any creature within the area of the mist when Yarthoon creates it takes 8d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 38 half). A creature that begins its turn within the mist takes 4d6 points of cold damage (no save) at the start of its turn. The save DC is Constitution-based.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Cold (Su)** When Yarthoon deals cold damage, the damage ignores the first 30 points of cold resistance the target has.",
			"",
			"**Staggering Strike (Ex)** If Yarthoon hits a Gargantuan or smaller foe that's standing on the ground with her slam attack, the target struck must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save or be knocked prone and become staggered for 1d6 rounds. If she hits a Gargantuan or smaller flying foe, the creature is staggered for 1d6 rounds and must succeed at a DC 42 Fly check or lose 30 feet of altitude (a winged flying creature loses 60 feet of altitude instead; this replaces the normal rule for being attacked while flying for winged creatures). A Colossal creature struck by Yarthoon's slam must succeed at a DC 42 Reflex save to resist being staggered for 1 round, but is not knocked prone or forced to lose altitude. The save DC is Strength-based.",
			"",
			"**Starflight (Su)** Yarthoon can survive in the void of outer space. She flies through space at incredible speeds, but generally only does so to travel between the moon and the world below when her attention is caught or her curiosity piqued. It takes Yarthoon only 2d4 hours to travel from the moon to the world below. If she were to travel to a more distant point in the same solar system, she requires only 3d6 days to make the journey, while trips beyond this range generally take her 3d6 weeks.",
			"",
			"**Swift Bite (Ex)** Yarthoon strikes with astonishing speed when she attacks with her bite. Whenever Yarthoon makes a bite attack on her turn, she can attack two times, either as a standard action to bite twice, or as part of a full attack to bite two times in addition to making one slam attack. She can make any number of attacks of opportunity with her bite attack, but does not get to bite more than once when she does so.",
			"",
			"#### Description",
			"",
			"Yarthoon is among the least powerful of the kaiju, yet even she is of staggering size and capable of unleashing devastation on an apocalyptic scale. Known as the Moon Grub to kaiju scholars, Yarthoon does indeed dwell upon the moon itself, where she spends much of her time in a frozen reach of ice and snow, created, in part, by her presence and the effects of her freezing breath over the course of centuries. (Note that although Yarthoon's exhalations fill the region with freezing mist, the Moon Grub herself has no need to breathe and can exist comfortably in the vacuum of space.)",
			"",
			"Were Yarthoon content to remain upon the moon, there would be little known about the frozen kaiju; unfortunately, the larger world her home orbits is a constant fascination for her. Indeed, certain events have been known to specifically attract Yarthoon's attention, whether they're intentional calls such as powerful rituals led by apocalyptic cultists, or accidental lures that occur when powerful effects of magical cold occur. The exact nature of these attractions varies, and even the most learned scholars argue over what exactly it is that draws Yarthoon to visit the world. None, however, dispute the devastation Yarthoon unleashes, if unintentionally, when she visits the world. Unlike many kaiju, Yarthoon seems not to purposefully seek out civilizations to destroy, but her immense size and her freezing breath wreak havoc nonetheless. Fortunately, Yarthoon's visits to the world typically last for only a few days before she slithers off into the sky like an eel swimming through water to return to her den on the moon.",
			"",
			"Yarthoon has a complex relationship with Mogaru, the Final King. Often, Mogaru's devastation on a region is enough to lure Yarthoon down from the moon, in which case she often clashes with the more powerful kaiju. Likewise, Mogaru's ability to sense kaiju often results in him coming to investigate a region that Yarthoon has decided to visit. Yet the two kaiju never seem willing to finish a fight against the other, and rather than deliver a death blow when the chance rises, each seems content to let the other flee. The one thing that seems to unite the two kaiju is their shared hatred of Lord Varklops, and the two kaiju have teamed up several times to drive off the three-headed fiend more than once.",
			"",
			"Although Yarthoon is the least powerful of the known kaiju, the Moon Grub has been remarkably resilient. Time and time again, Yarthoon has returned after suffering what seemed to be a complete defeat, at either the hands of powerful heroes or the claws and fangs of fellow kaiju. Scholars of these immense monsters have theorized that Yarthoon may not be a unique creature, and that in its hidden lair on the moon, multiple Moon Grubs writhe and dream. Others posit that Yarthoon is but the larval stage of a kaiju, and that while only one may live at any time, numerous other eggs lie in a hidden creche on the moon, waiting to hatch and release replacement Moon Grubs as needed.",

			"Kaltestrua has been the thrall of the Whispering Tyrant for well over a thousand years, a servitude that has had a singular effect upon her appearance. While she is not herself undead (yet), she appears as if she were a bloodstarved vampire, with sallow flesh clinging tightly to her frame and a skeletal pattern of stripes along her otherwise night-black serpentine lower torso. Kaltestrua was key in the Whispering Tyrant's conquest of the college of Casnoriva, and while the lich has now been imprisoned deep under Gallowspire for nearly 9 centuries, rule of Casnoriva has remained in the marilith's control. In an ironic twist, her greatest enemies in maintaining this control are themselves undead - the spectral and ghostly spirits of the academy's previous professors and arcanists continue to fight against the demon and her servants for control of the site. Led by the ghostly wizard Mistress Qais, these undead have never managed to control a majority of Casnoriva, but neither has Kaltestrua ever been able to wholly defeat them. Today, the site remains a battleground, with the marilith eagerly awaiting the return of her master so that, with his support, she might finally seize full control of the academy.",
			"",
			"It requires a gate spell to conjure Kaltestrua, and even then the marilith is particularly ill-tempered at having been pulled away from her post in the academy. Every second she's gone is another second the ghosts have a chance to regain ground or, in a worst-case scenario, to take control of the building. As a result, if a conjurer has a relatively short-term task (taking less than a day) for the marilith, she is more likely to agree to perform the service than most of her kind, if only so she can get started (and thus finish) the task quickly and return home. A spellcaster who thinks to keep her from returning home had best be prepared for her increasing fury, for even bound, Kaltestrua has other minions who will come to aid her if she is gone for too long. Kaltestrua prefers offerings of magical flails-ghost touch weapons are her favorite, but as long as the flails possess enhancement bonuses of at least +2, they'll do. It's a DC 31 check to research Kaltestrua."

			"Khalirai, the Ivory Queen, is one of the most powerful nymphs in the Mwangi Expanse. Protecting her exotic ward, known in local myths as the Ivory Boneyard, Khalirai is mysterious even by nymphs' standards. In mimicry of her surroundings, she has bone-white skin - a rarity among nymphs of the region - and she possesses long, lustrous black hair and deep green almond-shaped eyes. She has taken to wearing ivory jewelry that she crafts from the tusks of the fallen elephants that travel here at the ends of their lives to rejoin their ancestors in her ward. The Ivory Boneyard has had a great impact on her, and she is a dark, brooding soul, but with a soft spot for the sick and ill, and often heals those who are brave enough to come into her ward. While she protects the elephant graveyard from external threats, she holds it as her solemn duty to keep undead at bay, especially those arising from the ward itself.",
			"",
			"Many years ago, Khalirai fell in lust with a young Mwangi man, and has served as his muse ever since. It has been many years since then, and her love is old and frail; soon she will need to find a new bard to inspire."

			"",
			"Though Khain has sent ambassadors to Thuvia, Osirion, and their neighbors to conduct trade negotiations, thoughts of war, insurrection, and murder are never far from his mind. Much of his wrath has been turned against the nearby inhabitants of the Darklands-his purges have largely depopulated Sekamina in the vicinity of his city. A fortunate few are merely dead and devoured-all of the rest have been absorbed into Khain's ever-growing ghoul army.",
			"",
			"Not even the genies of Garund have escaped the Priest-King's capture squads. Many have been defeated and converted by the powers of death into great ghuls, often serving in positions of prominence as atamans, beys, and pashas under Khain's dominion. The most powerful of these are four great ghul oracles called the Quadrate Pillars, each formed from the undead remnant of a genie twisted into serving in death the element that was its opposite in life. A few renegade shaitans have been converted to the worship of Kabriri, and serve Kortash Khain as architects, engineers, and builders in his city. This so-called Blackstone Brotherhood is held in high esteem in Nemret Noktoria not only for its architectural creations but also for its members' prowess as hunters. They infiltrate their genie brethren and lure them into ambushes.",
			"",
			"Kortash Khain and any other clerics or oracles worshiping Kabriri gain several unique options when summoning or creating undead to serve them. They add the following creatures to their summon monster lists: I-fiendish human zombie (standard or fast zombie); II-fiendish ghoul, fiendish plague zombie; III-fiendish ghast; IV-giant fiendish ghast; V-ghul; VI-fiendish ghul, great ghul; VII-fiendish great ghul, fiendish shaitan. When using create undead, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can create a ghul or great ghul from the corpse of a genie rather than creating a mummy (minimum caster level 15th). When creating a ghoul, ghast, ghul, or great ghul with this spell, a cleric or oracle of Kabriri can also apply the fiendish template to that creature. This requires the caster to double the normal material component cost or sacrifice a living humanoid as an additional material component of casting the spell.",

The demagogue spent untold ages wandering the cosmos looking for the perfect place to keep his collection of wickedly preserved innocents, leaving carnage and abandoned menageries of victims along the way. When he finally happened upon the wastes that would become the Frozen Tears, Inkariax felt a surging empathic link with {faith/Doloras}, the Queen of the Night of dispassion, whom he believed freed the entire kyton species from Hell. He then began constructing an elaborate and terrible citadel and surrounding realm from the sheer evil of the landscape before him. The screams of the first victims of Inkariax and his kytons are said to be woven into the realm's fabric in such a way as to drive any creature fool enough to stumble upon them to heinous thought and deeds.",

She spoke not a word to Inkariax, whose lost voice is said to be so horrific that its throaty growl could end civilizations. Instead, she merely gave him a wan glance and gifted him tears harvested from her diadem-her symbol of power. These gifts Inkariax turned into the [pendants of the first tears](magic-artifact/pendant_of_the_first_tears). Doloras wordlessly left that day, but ever since, Inkariax has seen her as the perfect, like-minded ally, and he has spent millennia attempting to again catch her attention with monuments and havens for her worshippers in his realm. It is unclear whether Doloras is testing the demagogue, playing a long game to destroy him, or merely taking her time to ally with him, but the unholy churches of Inkariax and her worshippers are tightly connected.",

			"Inkariax himself is a cosmic mystery, even beyond his would-be alliance with the Queen of the Night. He never speaks, cares nothing of mortals, and is rarely seen outside his palace, called White Death's Diadem. However, the demagogue can take the form of his favored servants, [libitinarii kytons](monster/libitinarii) at any time, and he roams the planes in this guise to further his plans. All libitinarii kytons receive particular respect from canny outsiders, as none know whether one of the grim fiends is actually Inkariax in disguise. The demagogue's isolation and the regimented nature of his realm are also attractive to devils and other expatriates from Hell who crave order but appreciate Inkariax's aloofness. Some say that Inkariax is secretly building an army of such devils to present to Doloras as a gift should she ever return to his realm. It's more likely, though, that the demagogue is simply focused on building his horrific menageries of mutilated goodly creatures, turning his realm into the ultimate macabre museum of torturous preservation - which might also one day win him the Queen of Night's true attention.",

			"Inkariax is an enormous humanoid, towering 70 feet high and crusted with ice. Bloody icicles pierce his skin in many places, particularly through his lips, stitching his mouth shut. Inkariax never speaks, but his expressive gaze is sufficient to communicate his curiosity or displeasure. Troubled by the impermanence of perfection, Inkariax seeks to preserve works of horrific art - whether ideal screams, exquisite tortures, or perfect examples of sadistic brutality - by sealing them in ice forever. Inkariax's control over ice and snow is absolute, and he can freeze a victim into a solid block of ice with only a thought.",

			"Frozen Tears, the demagogue's realm, lies in the Shadow Plane atop a frozen sea and blanketed by an icy blizzard of razor-sharp crystals. The heart of his realm, White Death's Diadem, holds his greatest treasures and most powerful minions. Its upper reaches, however, are reserved only for the demagogue himself and for his greatest horrors, which he has preserved for all time.",

			"Inkariax has a long-standing connection to the infernal demigoddess Doloras, even beyond the debt all velstracs owe to her for setting them free from Hell. Doloras visited Inkariax before he built his realm, and the demagogue named it for Doloras's gift of frozen tears from her crown. Indeed, Inkariax built much of his realm in honor of the demigoddess, and he strives to earn her further favor.",
