Shout your oath of loyalty to Gorum at the top of your lungs, punctuating each pause for breath by smashing your weapon against a shield or against your armor-clad body. After your oath is done, kneel on one knee with your weapon resting against your shoulder. Recite your victories in battle in a sonorous voice until the time for your obedience is done. If you should be attacked while conducting your obedience, slay the creature who dared test your might. (You may be assisted by allies, but you must strike the killing blow.) Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment - if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

Your illusions are especially convincing and persistent. Spells you cast from the figment or glamer subschools last twice as long, as if extended with the {feat/Extend Spell} feat. You cannot further extend these spells by applying {feat/Extend Spell} metamagic a second time.

You have learned to use the spider's patient guile in combat, trapping your foes within the spider's web. You gain {feat/Net Adept} as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. If you already have {feat/Net Adept}, you instead gain a +1 sacred or profane bonus on attack rolls with a net. When fighting with a net as a one-handed weapon and wielding nothing in your off hand, you also gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.",
			">3. **Binding Strike (Su)** You allow no chances for your foes to escape once you have the advantage. Those enemies you fell are bound and ripe for your stewpot, should you feel less than charitable in victory. When you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can forgo any additional damage to immediately bind your foe in sticky webs, paralyzing it and pinning it in place. This functions as a {spell/hold monster} spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",

If it fails, the target is driven mad by thoughts and concepts far beyond what the brain can handle, as if the workings of Thassilonian magic were revealed to a common ant; it is affected as if by the insanity spell.

Onlookers who succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) are not fooled, though they might still be fooled by concealing clothing or mundane disguises you may be wearing.

You can attack normally with this attack of opportunity or target the triggering creature with one of the spells granted by the malice boon above (though doing so provokes an attack of opportunity if an opponent is in melee with you). You can use this ability only once per round.",

The target of this ability can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect.

One week after interment, a creature entombed by this ability breaks free from its sarcophagus as a chaotic evil ghast with all class levels it had in life; these ghasts are not under your control, but are often friendly toward you.",

You ignore cover or concealment from plants, though trees large enough to completely block your vision still provide total cover to the target. You also take no penalties on your ranged attacks due to the effects of wind, and you ignore any miss chance caused by mundane or magical winds. This ability functions no matter what terrain you are in.",

Instead of a gemstone, you must be carrying a piece of jewelry (such as a bracelet, ring, or torc) of adequate value to contain the target's soul. (Value derived from magical properties counts for this purpose.) A single piece of jewelry can hold only one soul, but if you are restored to life, you can release a trapped individual as a standard action by holding the jewelry out before you, which causes the target to reappear prone in that square.

This does not affect the size of manufactured weapons you can wield, but you gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with manufactured melee weapons.",

You can cast extended giant form II once per day as a spell-like ability. While under this effect, your gear resizes to fit your giant form.

If the damage would bring you to negative hit points, you are brought to 0 hit points instead, and the remaining damage is negated.

As a standard action, you can cause runes to appear on an adjacent, unattended corpse, which you can read to attempt to gain insight into the deceased or its soul. If the creature has been dead for a year or less, you can attempt a Knowledge (planes) check with a DC equal to the DC for a monster lore check about the creature when it was alive. If successful, you learn information as if you had used the appropriate Knowledge skill to learn about the creature when it was living. If the creature has been dead for more than a year, you have a 75% chance of learning what plane its soul was sent to by Pharasma and a 25% chance of learning nothing. If the soul has not yet been judged, has somehow escaped judgment, or has been reincarnated, you receive nothing (which is indistinguishable from the 25% of the time this ability fails).

The target must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your character level + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier [whichever is highest]). If it fails its save, you show it a mental image of its destined plane in the afterlife, depending on the creature's alignment and its adherence to its ethos, if it succeeds at finishing its mortal business. If the target is good-aligned, it is fascinated for 1d4 rounds on a failed save. If the target is neutral-aligned, it is confused for 1d4 rounds on a failed save.

This works like the witch's forced reincarnation hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with reincarnate, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a wish or miracle spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect.

The wall of roses heals from damage dealt to it at a rate of 5 hit points per round; it is immune to fire damage; and all piercing damage it deals bypasses damage reduction as if it were a good, magic, and silver weapon.

Fortunately, the goddess teaches that the truly devout who are martyred saving other people from death or tyranny will rise again in some way - perhaps even immediately, though being reborn in the faith is much more likely.",
			">- Some priests claim to be the incarnations of past followers of the goddess, able to access memories of past lives with the proper magic and meditation. A follower born after Milani ascended to godhood (about a century ago) can attempt to search for his past lives' memories by casting legend lore, which Milani grants only for this purpose to clerics, inquisitors, and warpriests as a 4th-level divine spell. The first time a caster attempts this use of the spell, he rolls 1d4-1 to determine the number of specific followers of Milani whose memories he accesses; each time he uses the spell, it reveals only information known to those individuals. If the result of the roll is 0, the caster can access no memories, either because he is not a reincarnated follower of Milani or because the goddess has not made his past lives' memories available."

For 1 minute after you end the effect, your body becomes uncomfortably warm, and once as a standard action you can use a melee touch attack to deal an amount of fire damage equal to the damage your immunity prevented (maximum 10 points of fire damage for every Hit Die you have) and cause the attack's target to catch fire.

For a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, Malebolge's flames aid you and up to four allies within 30 feet of you. The flames encase affected creature's bodies, providing a +4 profane bonus to AC and immunity to fire. Anyone who strikes you or an affected ally with a melee attack takes 2d6 points of fire damage on each hit. Additionally, affected allies' melee, ranged, and natural weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage while this ability is in effect.

Twice per day as a standard action, you can invoke the names of the Lord of the Sixth. All enemies that can hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, the affected creatures are merely shaken, but they also take a -4 penalty to their AC for the duration.

The robe functions as a lesser globe of invulnerability except that it only excludes hostile spell effects of 3rd level or lower.

If you hit the target, you deal quarterstaff damage as well as discharge the spell effect. You can hold the charge as normal when delivering a touch spell through a quarterstaff.",

You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). These rounds don't need to be consecutive, and you can activate and deactivate your aura as a free action. You and any allies within 20 feet of you increase your caster levels by 1d4. Roll this die when you activate this ability and use the same value for all who gain this benefit.

If this roll is made as part of a Sleight of Hand check or game of chance, the luck bonus is instead equal to your total Hit Dice.

This tail is prehensile and capable of manipulating and holding small objects, but cannot perform fine manual work as if it were a hand, with the exception of wielding a dagger. When you make a full attack, you can make an additional attack with this tail-wielded dagger. When you do so, you resolve this attack as a primary attack, add your Dexterity modifier to any damage dealt (in addition to any modifiers you might have from Strength), and have a reach that is 5 feet greater than your base reach. Wielding a dagger with your tail in this way does not count as two-weapon fighting for the purposes of determining penalties to attacks made with weapons wielded in your hands. In any round during which you don't make a full attack but you wield a dagger with this tail, it makes a single attack against an adjacent enemy of your choice - if it hits, it deals no damage but distracts the foe enough so that you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against that target. You cannot attack with this tail-wielded dagger in any other way, including as a thrown weapon.",

			">2. **Acceptable Losses (Su)** The most important responsibility of your minions is ensuring your survival on the battlefield. Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by an attack or affected by a spell or effect, you can transfer its effects to a creature within 30 feet. This creature must be one that is under your control or command or that otherwise considers itself subordinate to you. You suffer no effects from a transferred effect. If the effect is one that affects multiple creatures (such as horrid wilting or a breath weapon), the recipient of the transfer can suffer its effects twice. You can decide to transfer the effect or attack after the results of the attack rolls or saving throws have been revealed.",
			">3. **Avatar of Strife (Sp)** You can call upon the Shining Scourge to fill you with his burning light, which spreads mindless warfare everywhere you go. Once per day as a standard action, you can begin radiating an aura of blazing light equivalent to that created by daylight, lasting 1 round per Hit Die. Any creature within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) at the start of its turn or be compelled to attack the nearest conscious creature that round (similar to the \"attack nearest creature\" result of the confusion spell). Worshipers of Nurgal are immune to this effect. As a swift action, you can command a creature affected by your aura to direct its attacks against a creature of your choice within the effect's 60-foot area; this designation lasts until the effect ends.",
