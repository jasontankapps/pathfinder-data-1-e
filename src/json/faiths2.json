Shout your oath of loyalty to Gorum at the top of your lungs, punctuating each pause for breath by smashing your weapon against a shield or against your armor-clad body. After your oath is done, kneel on one knee with your weapon resting against your shoulder. Recite your victories in battle in a sonorous voice until the time for your obedience is done. If you should be attacked while conducting your obedience, slay the creature who dared test your might. (You may be assisted by allies, but you must strike the killing blow.) Gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Strength checks and Strength-based skill checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

This bonus attack is made at your highest base attack bonus, and provokes an attack of opportunity if you lack the [Improved Unarmed Strike](feat/improved_unarmed_strike) feat or a similar ability. If you're Medium, you deal 1d6 points of damage with this unarmed strike; if you're Small, you deal 1d4 points of damage. Add half your Strength bonus to the damage dealt. The attack roll for the unarmed strike is subject to the normal penalties for two-weapon fighting unless you have the feats to reduce these penalties.",
			">3. **Devout Rage (Ex)** You enter a holy or unholy frenzy whenever you rage, depending on your alignment. You gain a +2 bonus on your attack and damage rolls while raging. If you don't have the rage class feature, you can fly into a rage once per day as the rage spell, though you don't need to concentrate.

			">Spend an hour weaving something clever and useful that you will use to better your community, incorporating the stories or symbolism of Grandmother Spider. Kindhearted souls often interpret this to mean weaving blankets, clothing, or tapestries for those in need, while duplicitous worshipers take it to mean weaving a tall tale or confidence game that exploits someone who's taking advantage of the community or teaches someone a valuable lesson. Gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus on Bluff and Perform (oratory) checks and on saving throws against illusions. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

You gain the *fascinate* bardic performance and a number of rounds of bardic performance each day equal to your Charisma modifier + your Hit Dice, with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.

You too have learned to embrace the starlit beauty of the evening, knowing that the darkness will give you shelter whether you are predator or prey. You gain darkvision with a range of 30 feet, or extend your existing darkvision by 30 feet. You need only half the normal amount of sleep or rest each day to avoid becoming fatigued.",

Your illusions are especially convincing and persistent. Spells you cast from the figment or glamer subschools last twice as long, as if extended with the [Extend Spell](feat/extend_spell) feat. You cannot further extend these spells by applying [Extend Spell](feat/extend_spell) metamagic a second time.

Those enemies you fell are bound and ripe for your stewpot, should you feel less than charitable in victory. When you confirm a critical hit against an opponent, you can forgo any additional damage to immediately bind your foe in sticky webs, paralyzing it and pinning it in place. This functions as a [hold monster](spell/hold_monster) spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.

If it fails, the target is driven mad by thoughts and concepts far beyond what the brain can handle, as if the workings of Thassilonian magic were revealed to a common ant; it is affected as if by the insanity spell.

Each day, when you perform your obedience, you create a small amount of mystic quicksilver; if mixed with a potion of cure serious wounds, it creates a dose of oil of life. Just like that created by a philosopher's stone, if this oil is sprinkled over a dead body (a standard action), it revives the dead creature as per true resurrection. Alternatively, the quicksilver can be used to convert up to 1 pound of lead into gold (worth a maximum of 50 gp).

			">With the assistance of another priest of Hanspur or by yourself, simulate the act of drowning. You can do this by fully submerging yourself in a body of water, exhaling all of your breath, and painfully inhaling water instead of air. Alternatively, you can lie on your back with your head at a lower elevation than your legs while water is slowly poured on your face and up your nose. If you choose the latter method, you must cover your face with a cloth while the water is poured. When you conclude this simulated drowning, contemplate your life and how your goals coincide with the teachings of Hanspur and the Six River Freedoms. You gain a +4 sacred or profane bonus on Survival checks attempted while on or near rivers. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either a sacred bonus or a profane bonus the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

These hours need not be used consecutively, but must be used in 1-hour increments.",

This effect lasts for 1 round per Hit Die you possess or until you dismiss it as a free action, whichever comes first. Your allies must remain within 30 feet of you or lose this benefit.

			">3. **River's Depths (Su)** The river is your companion, and it fights on your behalf, teaching your enemies about the holy act of drowning. Once per day as a standard action, you can cause one creature within 30 feet to begin drowning, filling its lungs with water. The target of this ability can attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) to negate the effect. If the target succeeds, it is staggered for 1 round while it gasps for breath. On a failed save, the target immediately begins to suffocate. On the target's next turn, it falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the target drops to -1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the target dies. Each round, the target can attempt a Fortitude save to end the effect. This ability affects only living creatures that must breathe and cannot breathe underwater. This is a curse effect.",

Three times per day as a standard action, you can sculpt water into the form of a melee weapon with which you are proficient (typically a trident, but it could also take the form of a dagger or another light weapon). You must have enough water to form the weapon, an amount equal to the weapon's normal weight. Once formed, the weapon behaves as a weapon of its type with an enhancement bonus of +1. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 additional Hit Dice you have beyond 5 (up to a maximum of +4 at 20 Hit Dice). This weapon deals double the normal amount of damage to creatures with the fire subtype. The weapon dissolves into ordinary water after a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or as soon as it leaves your hand, whichever happens first.",

The target's gear does not transform with it; any such items fall under or within the ooze's body, which may cause them to take damage or to be destroyed.

Your body still retains enough rigidity that you can speak, wield objects and weapons, and wear items like armor.

Once per day, when you are the target of an attack or spell that would either kill you or render you helpless, you can target your attacker with a trap the soul spell as an immediate action after you resolve the effects of the attack on yourself (even if you are dead when this effect occurs). Instead of a gemstone, you must be carrying a piece of jewelry (such as a bracelet, ring, or torc) of adequate value to contain the target's soul. (Value derived from magical properties counts for this purpose.) A single piece of jewelry can hold only one soul, but if you are restored to life, you can release a trapped individual as a standard action by holding the jewelry out before you, which causes the target to reappear prone in that square. A creature released this way is stunned for 1d4 rounds.",

			">Using a chisel and hammer, carve the rune for \"repose\" on a stone entryway or cave entrance. If no appropriate entryway is available, carve multiple runes on a stone surface, creating an arch of runes related to Magrim. These runes can be marked on a stone surface representative of some entryway or passage, such as the stone cover of a book of knowledge (representing the entrance to greater learning), or the first stone of a road leading to a new land. Once you have finished carving your runes, spend at least 10 minutes maintaining the tools you used for this obedience. Gain a +2 sacred or profane bonus on saving throws against necromancy spells and death effects. The type of bonus depends on your alignment&mdash;if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can't be changed.",

In emulation of this horrific method of reproduction, you have been granted the ability to curse a foe to rebirth itself-when you do so, its new and horrible form bursts from the husk of its old flesh. This works like the witch's forced reincarnation hex, but instead of becoming a random race, the creature's new body is that of a spider of its original size category with the head of its original form. As with reincarnate, a rebirthed creature can be returned to its original form only through a wish or miracle spell. This ability can be used once per day, and a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect. If you have the hex or hex arcana class feature, you can use the DC for your hexes instead.",

			">Spend time meditating among roses you have planted yourself, so you can inhale their sacred scent while offering prayers to Milani. If no such roses are available, you can instead brew tea from herbs and rose petals and share the tea with close friends or neighbors. Preferred topics for conversation during this teatime include hopes for the future and preparations for times of need, but the act of sharing is itself enough. During times of war or conflict, though, you must instead spend time sparring, preferably with friends or neighbors whom you plan to fight alongside during the conflicts to come. If you are imprisoned and unable to spar, you can instead sing any song of hope or resistance in unison with one or more fellow prisoners. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects, and a +2 sacred bonus on all rolls made to dispel or remove such effects from others.",

You are automatically aware of any creature within 10 feet of you that is currently under the effects of a charm, compulsion, or possession effect. Three times per day as a swift action, you can inspire such a creature to throw off the influence, granting that creature a new saving throw to immediately end the effect. If the effect does not normally allow a saving throw, calculate the save DC as normal if it is a spell; if it's not a spell, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the source's Hit Dice + the source's Charisma modifier. The creature gains a sacred bonus on this saving throw equal to your Charisma bonus (minimum +1).

The wall of roses heals from damage dealt to it at a rate of 5 hit points per round; it is immune to fire damage; and all piercing damage it deals bypasses damage reduction as if it were a good, magic, and silver weapon.

Fortunately, the goddess teaches that the truly devout who are martyred saving other people from death or tyranny will rise again in some way-perhaps even immediately, though being reborn in the faith is much more likely.",
			">- Some priests claim to be the incarnations of past followers of the goddess, able to access memories of past lives with the proper magic and meditation. A follower born after Milani ascended to godhood (about a century ago) can attempt to search for his past lives' memories by casting legend lore, which Milani grants only for this purpose to clerics, inquisitors, and warpriests as a 4th-level divine spell. The first time a caster attempts this use of the spell, he rolls 1d4-1 to determine the number of specific followers of Milani whose memories he accesses; each time he uses the spell, it reveals only information known to those individuals. If the result of the roll is 0, the caster can access no memories, either because he is not a reincarnated follower of Milani or because the goddess has not made his past lives' memories available."

Twice per day as a standard action, you can invoke the names of the Lord of the Sixth.

If you hit the target, you deal quarterstaff damage as well as discharge the spell effect. You can hold the charge as normal when delivering a touch spell through a quarterstaff.",

You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 6 rounds). These rounds don't need to be consecutive, and you can activate and deactivate your aura as a free action. You and any allies within 20 feet of you increase your caster levels by 1d4. Roll this die when you activate this ability and use the same value for all who gain this benefit.

Wielding a dagger with your tail in this way does not count as two-weapon fighting for the purposes of determining penalties to attacks made with weapons wielded in your hands. In any round during which you don't make a full attack but you wield a dagger with this tail, it makes a single attack against an adjacent enemy of your choice-if it hits, it deals no damage but distracts the foe enough so that you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class against that target.

If you can't locate a suitable crowd, dig a hole at least 6 inches deep in the ground, whisper your prayers into the hole, and bury the sound.

Creatures hit by the bomb's splash damage are unaffected by the poison.

You gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls made with thrown weapons, ranged weapons, and short swords while invisible as well. These bonuses apply only when you're using this spell-like ability, not when you're affected by any other spell or effect that grants greater invisibility.

This effect applies only to poisons you administer directly, including applying the poison to a weapon you use. Giving the weapon to another person reduces the poison's efficacy back to normal, as the weapon's new owner does not have your skill at storing and using the poisoned item.",

You never risk exposing yourself to the effects of the poison when applying it to the weapon, nor do you run the risk of poisoning yourself if you roll a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon.",
			">3. **Death Strike (Ex)** Once per day, you can make a death strike with a melee weapon. You must declare your use of this ability before you roll your attack. You gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice you possess (maximum 5d6). If your death strike reduces the target to negative hit points but doesn't kill it outright, the target immediately drops to a negative hit point total equal to its Constitution score - 1 (one point away from death).",

If the result of your check exceeds the target's CMD, treat the target as if it were completely unaware of your presence for the purpose of the initial benefit of this divine fighting technique. If you beat the target's CMD by 5 or more, you also treat it as being completely unaware of your presence for the purposes of all class features and feats you have.",

Three times per day as a move action, you can use this power to improve the next melee or ranged attack you make during your turn; if you are in an area of bright light, you can instead use this ability as a swift action. For the purpose of this enhanced attack, you are treated as if you had true seeing against the target. If the target of the attack is within 30 feet, your enhanced attack targets the creature's touch AC. If this attack is made using a firearm, the result is never a misfire, regardless of the attack roll. If the attack threatens a critical hit, the critical threat is automatically confirmed. Any attack that hits threatens a critical hit that must be confirmed as normal. If you hit the target and deal damage, the creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Strength modifier) or be staggered for 1d3 rounds.",

As a swift action up to three times per day, you can transform your weapon into raw energy for 3 rounds, giving it the qualities of a brilliant energy weapon. Any creature struck by your weapon must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be permanently blinded. Unlike normal brilliant energy weapons, this weapon is made of pure sunlight and can harm undead creatures normally. Against undead foes that are particularly vulnerable to sun, the weapon also functions as a disrupting weapon.",

Once per day as an immediate action, when you are hit by an attack or affected by a spell or effect, you can transfer its effects to a creature within 30 feet. This creature must be one that is under your control or command or that otherwise considers itself subordinate to you. You suffer no effects from a transferred effect. If the effect is one that affects multiple creatures (such as horrid wilting or a breath weapon), the recipient of the transfer can suffer its effects twice. You can decide to transfer the effect or attack after the results of the attack rolls or saving throws have been revealed.",
			">3. **Avatar of Strife (Sp)** You can call upon the Shining Scourge to fill you with his burning light, which spreads mindless warfare everywhere you go. Once per day as a standard action, you can begin radiating an aura of blazing light equivalent to that created by daylight, lasting 1 round per Hit Die. Any creature within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) at the start of its turn or be compelled to attack the nearest conscious creature that round (similar to the \"attack nearest creature\" result of the confusion spell). Worshipers of Nurgal are immune to this effect. As a swift action, you can command a creature affected by your aura to direct its attacks against a creature of your choice within the effect's 60-foot area; this designation lasts until the effect ends.",
