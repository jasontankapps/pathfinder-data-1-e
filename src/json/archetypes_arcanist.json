At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, the power of this ability increases by one spell level, allowing her to summon more powerful creatures (to a maximum of [summon monster IX](spell:summon_monster_IX) at 17th level), at the cost of an additional point from her arcane spell reserve per spell level. An occultist cannot have more than one [summon monster](spell:summon_monster) spell active in this way at one time. If this ability is used again, any existing [summon monster](spell:summon_monster) immediately ends. This ability replaces the arcanist exploit gained at 1st level.",

Whenever an attack removes the last temporary hit point from the twilight sage's arcane barrier, the barrier's negative energy lashes back at the attacker, dealing an amount of negative energy damage equal to the barrier's maximum temporary hit point capacity.

To cast a spell, she must expend a number of points from her arcane reservoir equal to 1 + the spell's level. The spirit disappears if she has no points remaining in her arcane reservoir or she spends a round without casting a spell. The spirit can't move, deliver touch or ranged touch spells, or do anything that isn't part of casting a spell. Her spirit completes the verbal and somatic components of her spells, any material components are consumed from the supply on the corpse, and any focus components must be on the corpse.
