The exact configuration of these equations is unique to each witch. From that point on, when she uses dimensional travel to travel to that location, she does so without any chance of mishap. Teleport always sends the witch to this spot, and even plane shift, if used to travel to that site, is precisely accurate. Once a dimensional waypoint is set, it remains active for that witch despite the condition of the inscription or even that of the surface upon which it was inscribed-it is the act of inscribing the waypoint, not the waypoint itself, that matters. At 12th level, and then again every two witch levels thereafter, the dimensional occultist can maintain an additional waypoint. She can replace a waypoint she's already set by simply using that waypoint's unique equation at a new site. This ability replaces the witch's hex gained at 12th level."

While they lack any ability to truly eliminate bad luck, they are uniquely gifted at making others believe otherwise.

Rogue talents and advanced rogue talents marked with an asterisk (*) can be found in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide. The white-haired witch is an archetype of the witch class.",
			"",
			"**White Hair (Su):** At 1st level, a white-haired witch gains the ability to use her hair as a weapon. This functions as a primary natural attack with a reach of 5 feet. The hair deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small witch) plus the witch's Intelligence modifier. In addition, whenever the hair strikes a foe, the witch can attempt to grapple that foe with her hair as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity, using her Intelligence modifier in place of her Strength modifier when making the combat maneuver check. When a white-haired witch grapples a foe in this way, she does not gain the grappled condition.",
			"",
			"At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, a whitehaired witch's hair adds 5 feet to its reach, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.",
			"",
			"The hair cannot be sundered or attacked as a separate creature. In addition, a white-haired witch further improves her ability to control her hair as she progresses in level, gaining the following abilities.",

			"**Pull (Ex):** At 6th level, a white-haired witch who successfully strikes a foe with her hair can attempt a combat maneuver check to pull the creature 5 feet closer to her as a free action.",

			"",

			"",
			"**Rogue Talents:** At 10th level, a white-haired witch learns a rogue talent, using her white-haired witch level in place of her rogue level. At 12th level and for every two levels thereafter, she gains an additional rogue talent. A whitehaired witch cannot select an individual rogue talent more than once, and can select from among the following: assault leader, combat trick, finesse rogue, major magic, minor magic, positioning attack, resiliency, surprise attack, and weapon training. At 18th level and 20th level, a white-haired witch can choose from among the following advanced rogue talents: another day, defensive roll, improved evasion, opportunist, redirect attack, slippery mind, and thoughtful reexamining. This ability replaces major hex and grand hex."

			"The descendents of Baba Yaga rule the frozen realm of Irrisen, and possess a unique power stemming from their otherworldly origin and their ties to cold magic. This power is partly magical, partly political, and partly cultural. Known as winter witches, these scions of Baba Yaga have not bothered to hide their secrets from outsiders, for they understand that those who see winter witches not native to Irrisen working their frozen magic will simply assume the witches are agents of Irrisen. By opening up their traditions to those who have no direct blood connection to Baba Yaga or the ruling families of Irrisen, they spread the notoriety and infamy of their wintry magic far beyond what they could accomplish on their own. While winter witches are most commonly encountered in Irrisen, they could be encountered in any part of the Inner Sea region, where they work to increase Irrisen's notoriety with each frozen spell and manipulative hex they cast. A winter witch has the following class features.",
			"",
			"**Familiar:** Winter witches must choose a familiar that is native to the frozen north, even if they themselves operate in other regions. Traditionally, this limits winter witch familiar choices to bat, cat, fox, hawk, owl, rat, raven, or weasel. A winter witch who gains the Improved Familiar feat can select any familiar she desires, save for familiars with the fire subtype.",

An asterisk (*) indicates that the patron theme is detailed in Ultimate Magic.",

			"**Cold Flesh (Ex):** At 1st level, a winter witch gains endure elements as a constant spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. At 9th-level, this increases to cold resistance 10, and at 14th level, it becomes immunity to cold. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex.",

			"",
			"**Frostfoot (Su):** This ability works like the spider climb spell, but the surfaces the witch climbs must be icy. The witch can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. She can move across regular snow without penalty, and heavy snow costs her only 2 squares of movement instead of 4.",
			"",
			"**Frozen Caress (Su):** Whenever the winter witch casts a touch spell, she can infuse the magic with cold as a swift action. This grants the spell the cold descriptor, and adds 1d4 points of cold damage to the spell's effect. If the touch spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates this additional cold damage."

As a standard action when her covenant ally is within 30 feet, a witch-watcher can grant it one of the abilities listed below. Unless otherwise noted, each ability lasts for a number of minutes equal to the witch-watcher's Intelligence modifier. She can grant a number of abilities per day equal to 1/2 her witch level (minimum 1).",

The temporary hit points from this ability do not stack with themselves, but additional uses cause the total number of temporary hit points and the duration to reset.",
			"",
			"**Safeguard:** The covenant ally gains a deflection bonus to AC or a resistance bonus on saving throws equal to 1/2 the witch-watcher's witch level (minimum 1). When given, this bonus can be divided between the AC and saving throws as the witch-watcher wishes, up to a maximum of for either.",
			"",
			"**Solace:** The witch-watcher temporarily disrupts a spell affecting her covenant ally by succeeding at a dispel check against the spell, as per dispel magic. The ability suppresses a spell effect for a number of rounds equal to the witchwatcher's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). If the spell affects multiple creatures, this ability suppresses the spell effect only for the covenant ally. At the end of this duration, the spell resumes and the suppressed rounds do not count against its total duration. This ability has no effect on spells that are instantaneous or have a duration of permanent.",

At 10th level, the spell resistance increases to 11 the witch-watcher's witch level. The spell resistance cannot be suppressed, but it doesn't affect spells cast by the witch-watcher."

A wyrmwitch's hoard must have a value of 50 gp plus 100 gp for every character level he has beyond 1st. Only nonmagical objects that are not alchemical items, weapons, armor, or useful tools can be part of a wyrmwitch's hoard.

A wyrmwitch can add spells to his hoard in a similar fashion to the way conventional witches store spells in their familiars. A witch's familiar and a wyrmwitch's hoard can exchange spells in the same way two normal witch familiars do. Also, a witch can add a spell to his hoard from a wizard's spellbook, if the spellbook is kept in the hoard and the spell is on the witch's class spell list. The wyrmwitch must sleep on the spellbook in his hoard for a number of days equal to the spell's level, after which he must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC = 15 + spell level) to learn the spell. No matter the result, the spell is erased from the spellbook.",

If he does not spend at least 8 hours resting atop his hoard prior to preparing spells, he must attempt a concentration check anytime he attempts to cast a spell (DC = 20 + the spell's level). If the wyrmwitch does prepare spells after properly sleeping on his hoard, he gains the ability to call on his hoard to cast any one spell it is holding and that he is capable of casting, even if the spell is not prepared. This spell is treated like any other spell cast by the wyrmwitch, including when determining casting time, duration, and other effects dependent on the wyrmwitch's level. This spell cannot be modified by metamagic feats or other abilities.",
