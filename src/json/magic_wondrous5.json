			"**Marble Elephant:** This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant.

			"- *The Goat of Travail:* This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.",
			"- *The Goat of Terror:* When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.",

On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.

Once activated in this manner, the codex of conversations begins recording any verbal communication that occurs within 20 feet of it, inscribing the words upon its pages in whatever language they are uttered. If the language being spoken has no written form, the inscription occurs phonetically in whichever language the book's activator specifies.

The codex can't record anything other than the spoken word, so it can't inscribe musical notes if a song is sung. It can record verbal components to spells, but the resultant verbiage is not magical and can't be used to cast the spell or be read as a scroll.

The device creates an abstraction of north, east, south, and west, as well as up, down, in, out, back, forward, past, future, and a variety of other directions that can prove helpful in navigating the planes. Despite diverse cosmetic differences, astralabes share a uniform internal design and, by and large, give consistent, shared directions. As such, many-if not most- planar cartographers utilize astralabes when creating maps, allowing travelers to navigate lands without magnetic poles or with malleable terrains as though there were one consistent north. The device keeps a constant orientation, but it does not adjust or circumvent hazards or show particular paths. Any creature not on the Material Plane who employs an astralabe while attempting a Knowledge, Survival, or similar skill check to navigate gains a +4 bonus on that check.",
			"",
			"Additionally, an astralabe can aid a traveler in preparing to travel to another plane. The device can read emanations from portals, gates, and other connections between the planes and display them upon its surface. These displays can be interpreted with a successful Knowledge (planes) check. A user must typically succeed at a DC 25 Knowledge (planes) check to correctly read an astralabe, though demiplanes and stranger realms might require a higher DC or yield inconclusive results. Those who succeed learn the name of the plane beyond the portal, though not the portal's exact location upon that plane-it doesn't reveal tiers, layers, or subrealms, in the case of planes divided into multiple parts. Those who fail the check are unable to tell what plane lies beyond. Those who fail the check by 10 or more incorrectly identify what plane lies beyond, with the details of this misinformation determined by the GM.",

However, should one be brought within 20 feet of a portal or similar passage to another plane, it becomes active for as long as it remains nearby.

			"A planar keystone is a small cube etched with runes. Each planar keystone is attuned to a specific site on a particular plane-this site must be determined when the planar keystone is created and cannot be changed at a later date. Anyone examining the etched patterns can determine the plane and location with a successful DC 20 Knowledge (planes) check. Once per day, up to eight intelligent creatures within 20 feet of the planar keystone can concentrate upon its etched patterns for 1 minute. This concentration is tenuous; if any of the creatures are attacked or pause to take other actions during this time, the concentration of all participants is broken and the planar keystone's use for that day is lost. At the end of this time, all creatures concentrating on the planar keystone are transported to the planar keystone's site as if via plane shift, but arriving precisely on target. The planar keystone travels with the creatures-it is not left behind in the process.",

Ale poured out the tankard quickly loses its flavor and virtue, becoming common swill within minutes. The tankard prevents most of the ill effects of excessive drinking, such as hangovers and blackouts, as long as it remains in its owner's possession. It also provides a +4 bonus on saving throws against poison.",

These effects last for 10 minutes. If the tankard is empty, it must be filled prior to drinking. If the imbiber expends one use of mythic power while drinking from the cup, the morale bonus increase to +4, the penalties to -4, and the duration of the tankard's effects to 1 hour.",
