The shield prevents a total of 2 points of damage per occultist level you possess. It lasts until the start of your next turn or until exhausted. For example, if you are 5th level, the mind barrier protects you from 10 points of damage; if you are hit by an attack that would deal 12 points of damage, the mind barrier is exhausted and you take 2 points of damage. You can activate this ability as an immediate action, but doing so costs 2 points of mental focus instead of 1.",

			"*Globe of Negation (Sp):* As a standard action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to create a stationary globe of negation. This globe is 10 feet in diameter and cancels any spell effect that is cast into or through its area. This functions as globe of invulnerability, but it affects spells of any level. The globe can negate a total number of spell levels equal to your occultist level, after which the globe collapses. Spells that exceed the number of remaining levels remove all remaining levels, but are weakened; any creatures targeted by such spells receive a +4 circumstance bonus on any saving throws against the spells' effects.

When you set the sentry, you can set any number of specific creatures to be immune to the sentry and thus avoid triggering it.",
			"",
			"*Planar Ward (Sp):* As a standard action, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to surround yourself with a planar ward. Creatures not native to the plane that you are currently on take a -4 penalty on attacks against you, and you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of such creatures. This ward lasts for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"*Unraveling (Sp):* As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to unravel a magical effect. This functions as a targeted dispel magic spell, but you must be adjacent to the effect to unravel it.

The warded area moves with you and can be used only defensively. Any attempt to force the ward against an undead creature immediately ends the effect."

If he does so, he adds 1 to his caster level for every 2 points of mental focus stored in the implement (to a maximum bonus equal to your occultist level).

If you have more than one implement for the same school, decide which set of spells the conjured implement will grant when you first conjure it.

			"*Side Step (Sp):* You can create a temporary fissure in space by expending 1 point of mental focus. You can use this ability as part of a move action taken to move. The fissure begins in any square you designate and allows you to teleport to any other square you can see within 10 feet per occultist level.

You immediately cease concentrating if you move from your originating location. Difficult terrain created this way remains for 24 hours before returning to its original state."

At 5th level, whenever the necromantic servant would be destroyed, if you are within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) of the servant, you can expend 1 point of mental focus as an immediate action to cause the servant to return to full hit points. At 9th level, you can choose to give the servant the bloody or burning simple template (if it's a skeleton) or the fast simple template (if it's a zombie). At 13th level, when you take an immediate action to restore your servant, it splits into two servants. You can have a maximum number of servants in existence equal to 1/2 your occultist level.

All living creatures in this area are wracked with pain, gaining the sickened condition for 1 round per occultist level you possess.

If you choose mental block, you can proscribe one specific action, such as attacking with a type of weapon, casting a specific spell, or something else suitably specific (subject to the GM's discretion). The target can't take that action without first succeeding at a Will save. If it fails, it can take other actions instead. If it attempts the prohibited action again on subsequent rounds, it gains a cumulative +2 bonus on the save until it succeeds. If you select pain confusion, the creature is confused for 1d4 rounds whenever it is damaged by a critical hit. The target can attempt a Will save to negate this effect.

You can instead use a humanoid bone, doll, or skull, to give the puppet the base statistics of a homunculus, but without a fly speed or the poison bite or telepathic link abilities.

			"*Rebuke Anathema (Sp):* As a standard action, you can present the holy symbol used as the panoply's associated implement and expend 2 points of mental focus to keep a single creature at bay. Your alignment must be within one step of that of the holy symbol's deity, and the creature's alignment must be more than one step away from both your alignment and the deity's alignment. If neither is the case, this power is ineffective and the spent mental focus is wasted. If the target creature fails a Will save, it can't move toward you for a number of rounds equal to your occultist level."

			"This panoply is associated with brave and stalwart warriors, martial skill, and the defense of one's allies.",
			"",
			"**Implements:** Shield (abjuration) and weapon (transmutation).",
			"",
			"**Resonant Power:** Each time the occultist invests mental focus into all of the associated implements, the panoply grants the following resonant power. The panoply's bearer gains the benefits of this power until the occultist refreshes his focus.",
			"",
			"*Martial Skill (Ex):* When wielding the weapon used as the panoply's associated implement, you treat your base attack bonus as though it were 1 point higher for every 4 points of total mental focus invested in all of the associated implements, to a maximum base attack bonus equal to your occultist level. This increase can grant you additional attacks when using the full attack action (for example, a 12th-level occultist with 12 points of mental focus invested among the associated implements would be treated as having a base attack bonus of +11, with iterative attacks at a base attack bonus of +6 and +1).",
			"",
			"**Base Focus Power:** All occultists who learn to use this panoply gain the following focus power.",
			"",
			"*Combat Trick (Ex):* As a move action, you can expend 3 points of mental focus to gain a single combat feat for which you qualify. This benefit lasts for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Focus Powers:** In addition to the base focus power, occultists who learn to use this panoply can select the following focus powers when choosing powers gained from their focus powers class feature.",
			"",
			"*Counterstrike (Ex):* As an immediate action when you are damaged by a melee attack, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to immediately make a single attack at your highest base attack bonus against the creature that hit you, provided that you threaten that creature. If the attack hits, you gain a bonus on the damage roll equal to 1/3 your occultist level (rounded down, minimum +1). This attack counts as an attack of opportunity.",
			"",
			"*Shield Ally (Ex):* As an immediate action when an adjacent ally is the target of a spell or attack, you can expend 2 points of mental focus to redirect that spell or attack to yourself instead. You must declare that you are using this ability before the result of any attack roll is known or before any saving throws are attempted.",
			"",
			"*Warrior's Resilience (Su):* As an immediate action when you would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, you can expend 1 or more points of mental focus to remain at 0 hit points instead. Using this focus power costs 1 point of mental focus for every 5 points of damage below 0 that you would otherwise be reduced to (rounded up, minimum 1 point of mental focus). This has no effect on anything that would kill you without reducing your hit points below 0, such as a failed saving throw against a death effect."
