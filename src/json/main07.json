				"An altar is a stationary magic item used to focus the power of a particular deity into the world at a fixed point such as a temple, a monastery, a shrine, or the site of a miracle. An altar is normally about 10 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet at its widest points and is very heavy, usually weighing at least 150 pounds. It is often the central focus of an entire chamber, small sanctum, underground grotto, or forest grove. An altar is always fixed in place; it cannot be moved without losing its magical abilities. Most altars are secured to the floor, and a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to uproot or move them (or a higher DC, depending on their size and weight).",
				"",
				"An altar has an alignment aura identical to that of its associated deity, and is the center of a magic circle effect or effects appropriate to that alignment (magic circle against evil for a good altar, both magic circle against evil and magic circle against law for a chaotic good altar, and so on). As a permanent religious fixture, it is a suitable target for effects such as consecrate or desecrate.",
				"",
				"A worshiper of an altar's deity may stand, sit, kneel, or lie prostrate within 10 feet of the altar and speak a prayer to gain a temporary blessing from the altar (treat this as speaking a command word to activate a magic item). The effect of this blessing is described in the individual altar entries. Unless otherwise specified, this blessing ends after 24 hours (or earlier, if dispelled or ended by the actions of the worshiper). The altar can provide its blessing only once per creature per day. Usually, this blessing is something suitable for making life easier for members of the altar's associated faith (such as a skill bonus) and isn't always something an adventurer would consider useful, though martially oriented faiths and temples in dangerous lands may have altars that provide protective blessings for their worshipers. Because an altar can affect many dozens of worshipers in a day, it is possible or even likely that all worshipers in a community may have that blessing each day; likewise, all members of a secret cult or evil monster lair may have a useful blessing.",
				"",
				"Depending on the motivations of the deity and the altar's creators, some altars may grant their blessings to non-worshipers who pray to the altar's deity so long as the creature's alignment is compatible with the deity's alignment. Conversely, an altar of an evil deity might allow anyone to gain its blessing, as drawing power from evil can corrupt good and neutral folk. Accepting the blessing of an evil altar is an evil act, and likewise for blessings from altars with other alignment auras.",
				"",
				"An altar is otherwise like any other permanent magic item and can be crafted with additional abilities, be intelligent, and so on."

				"A less invasive, but perhaps more painful, method of becoming a demon is the piecemeal transplanting of demonic elements into a mortal's body. By extracting a portion of a demon's body and then preparing it by utilizing various occult techniques or strange methods of preservation, one can reap a portion of the demon's power and transfer it into a sentient being. Demonic implants can either be temporary (and often addictive) drug-like magical elixirs, or they can be actual body parts that must be grafted onto or into a living mortal before they work. All are treated as wondrous items for the purposes of construction and use. The three examples listed below merely scratch the surface of this reckless category of magic item.",
				"",
				"All demonic implants require a willing host to attach them to-attempts to attach a demonic implant to an unwilling host automatically fail. Successfully attached demonic implants impart a negative level to a lawful or good user-the number of negative levels imparted stacks with each new implant. These negative levels remain as long as the implant remains attached or (in the case of demon blood) until the effects wear off. They never result in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way while the implant is in effect.",

But in truth, knowledge of such methods is withheld only to whet mortal desires, a feint to hasten a diabolist's willing damnation. Ultimately, any spellcaster can create a devil talisman through the use of the [Craft Wondrous Item](feat/craft_wondrous_item) feat and planar binding. As an additional prerequisite to the creation of any type of devil talisman, the creator must summon a devil and bargain with it to be bound within the talisman. Most devils prove resistant to the idea of being trapped within a magic item, but might acquiesce to a particularly convincing summoner. A devil summoned via planar binding and coerced into being bound within a devil talisman gains a +10 bonus on its opposed Charisma check. Once convinced, the devil infuses the already prepared devil talisman, completing the profane item.",

These augmentations grant the recipient powerful abilities, but they often come with side effects as the recipient's body becomes elementally unbalanced.

Removal deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage and could have other effects as well, such as blindness or lameness, as determined by the GM. A body part that has been elementally augmented cannot receive another elemental augmentation, even of the same type.",

The presenter must intentionally give the favor to the recipient, and the recipient must intentionally accept it and don it within 1 minute for the favor to activate. Giving a favor to a recipient is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity; receiving and donning a favor requires as much time as it takes to don an item of the favor's type (usually a standard action). Once donned, the favor provides the indicated effect for the listed duration. In addition, while the favor is active, the presenter can take a standard action to sense whether the recipient is alive (with 4 or more hit points), badly wounded (at 3 or fewer hit points), dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead (as a construct). This effect functions regardless of distance, as long as the presenter and recipient are on the same plane of existence.",

				"Fleshcrafting involves the same processes and applications as true fleshwarping, but is used to modify only a single portion of a living creature. Fleshcrafts are living pieces of tissue that can be attached to any corporeal, living creature via a graft or grown by a consumed elixir. Once attached, a fleshcraft immediately begins functioning and grants its listed abilities to the grafted creature. While a fleshcraft is partially magical in genesis, it doesn't radiate magic or have a caster level, regardless of whether it has been grafted to the subject or supplied via an elixir.",
				"",
				"**Fleshcraft Grafts:** Creating a fleshcraft graft requires the [Fleshwarper](feat/fleshwarper) feat and an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the graft to be created. Creating a fleshcraft graft is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value.",
				"",
				"Applying a fleshcraft graft to a target requires a 1-hour surgical procedure, during which time the subject must be either willing or helpless. At the end of the hour, the surgeon must attempt a Heal check against the graft's listed DC. Failure indicates the patient's body rejects the graft and the graft dies. Regardless of the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if employing the [sanity system](rule/sanity)). Although fleshcraft grafts are not magical, some occupy a magic item slot on the body, preventing that slot from being used for any magic item or other graft.",
				"",
				"A fleshcraft graft can be removed with another hour-long surgery and a successful Heal check against the original DC. On a failure, either the graft remains or the surgeon removes the graft, destroying it and killing the subject (surgeon's choice). Alternatively, the surgeon can remove the graft more delicately and use healing magic to save the subject, attempting a DC 15 Heal check and applying a heal or regenerate spell immediately afterward. Failing this Heal check always results in the destruction of both graft and subject. A successful surgery removes and destroys the graft. Regardless of the method used and the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if using the sanity system).",
				"",
				"**Fleshcraft Elixirs:** A creature with the [Fleshwarper](feat/fleshwarper) feat can also create fleshcraft elixirs. Doing so requires an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the elixir, just like creating a graft, but the components are distilled into the elixir. Creating a fleshcraft elixir is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value. These potionlike concoctions can bestow the effect of an individual fleshcraft graft (a creature can't benefit from more than one at a time), but for a limited period of time. Imbibing a fleshcraft elixir works similarly to imbibing other potions or elixirs, except that it's slow acting, taking effect the round after it is imbibed (as if the imbiber were casting a 1-round casting time spell). Fleshcraft elixirs are foul and potentially dangerous. A fleshcraft elixir is keyed to a specific type of fleshcraft, and each elixir provides a Fortitude save that the imbiber must succeed at in order to gain that graft's effect for the limited duration. On a failed saving throw, the imbiber gains only the graft's penalty for its duration, and if the imbiber fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the imbiber also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. While not strictly magical (and not applicable for reuse with alchemical allocation), they count as both transmutation and poison effects that affect only living creatures for the purposes of saving throws and resistances.",

This does not apply to a permanent fleshcraft such as a graft. If the graft has a limited number of uses per day, a creature affected by its corresponding elixir can use the ability the same number of times during the elixir's duration.",
				"",
				"**Saving Throw:** This is the DC of the Fortitude saving throw the imbiber must succeed at to gain the benefits rather than just the penalties of the fleshcraft when imbibing a fleshcraft elixir. A creature imbibing a corresponding elixir that fails this saving throw by 5 or more also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.",

During this time, the nascent fungus must be fertilized with expensive material components (the cost varies according to the graft), watered as needed, and kept safe from harm. After the required time has passed, the cultivator must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check in order for the fungus graft to be properly formed. The DC of this check varies according to the graft. On a failure, the graft withers and the cultivator must begin anew. On a success, the fungus is ready to be grafted onto a target.",

				"By combining the skill of potioncraft with a poisoner's art, cunning assassins and herbalists can craft vile supernatural threats. An infused poison combines the effects of an ingested poison and a potion. A creature drinking an infused poison is affected by the poison (and its initial effects or damage) first, after which the infused spell effect triggers and the imbiber must attempt a second saving throw (often of a different type or DC) against its magical effects. Spell resistance applies normally to an infused poison's magical effects, but offers no protection against the poison, and poison resistance offers no protection against the magical effects of an infused poison. Poison immunity renders a creature immune to an infused poison's magical effects.",

As with a potion, you cannot create an infused poison without meeting its spell prerequisite. The base price of the infusion is equal to the level of the spell &times; the creator's caster level &times; 25 gp. The cost of the poison to be infused is paid separately. If the spell has a material component cost, it is added to the poison's base price and cost of creation.",
				"",
				"Infused poisons function like spells cast on the imbiber. A poison's creator makes all decisions regarding the spell's effects when it is created-the creature consuming the infused poison has no control over its effects. Unlike with a potion, the imbiber is not considered the caster of the effect. If the spell has an effect related to the caster (as does charm person), the subject treats the first sentient creature it encounters after consuming the poison as the poison's creator.",

Many fetishes take the form of ensorcelled pouches about half the size of a human hand, made of skin or leather and containing bones, vegetable matter, stones, spices, broken pottery, hair, blood, grave dirt, and other such ingredients. The exterior may be dyed, or strange scratches may be worked into the surface. On occasion, some other item may be sewn onto the surface, such as the severed foot of a chicken tied with colored ribbon, or a frog's leg bone etched with strange patterns. However, a cursory examination of a pouch or its contents cannot reveal the fetish's purpose or nature, as each fetish is unique.",

They differ in duration and durability, however, as all juju fetishes last for 1 week plus a number of days equal to the creator's caster level.

This limited duration is reflected in the price and creation cost of each of the following fetishes.",

Most magic plants bear fruit, seeds, or sprouts that, once mature, replicate the effects of a spell when eaten, thrown, or used in some other way.

Growing seasons are continuous 13-week-long periods confined to one of the four seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). If a season is longer than 13 weeks, the growing season needs not be continuous. Magic plants cannot be in a growing season for longer than 52 weeks, and a plant that has four consecutive growing seasons produces fruit, seeds, or effects year round.

These item sets are collections of thematically aligned equipment whose magical properties can resonate with each other to make the set greater than the sum of its parts. Set bonuses are cumulative; for example, a character who wears four pieces of a set gains the listed benefits for having two, three, and four of the items. If a set modifies a class feature or ability, the wearer must have this class feature or ability to gain this benefit; for example, a character wearing at least three pieces of the Archmage's Vestments must be able to cast 3rd-level spells to gain the additional 3rd-level spell slot.",

				"While some GMs may introduce these set bonuses as a unique reward for players in their campaigns, any character can take the [Collector's Boon](feat/collector's_boon) and [Improved Collector's Boon](feat/improved_collector's_boon) feats to access the benefits of these equipment sets. GMs can also increase the rarity of these items by waiving the requirement of having the Collector's Boon and Improved Collector's Boon feats and instead requiring the set to consist of specific pieces of equipment rather than any item of that type; for example, instead of any greater caster's shield forming a piece of the Archmage's Vestments, perhaps only Old Mage Jatembe's shield, a greater caster's shield crafted and used by the legendary Old Mage Jatembe himself, can be used to complete the set.",

A throne is normally 5 feet wide, 5 feet long, and 10 feet high, although specific dimensions vary considerably. Thrones are heavy and always fixed in place; a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to uproot or move them (though this could be a higher DC, depending upon a throne's size and weight). Moving a throne purges its magical abilities, although the throne's magic can be restored with a lengthy and expensive rededication ritual (generally taking several weeks and costing half the market price of the throne).",

Most magic thrones grant a heroism effect to the current ruler of the kingdom for as long as the ruler is seated upon the throne. Regardless of the throne's size, only one creature can receive this effect at a time. While a ruler is seated on a magic throne, another creature within 20 feet of the throne can kneel, bow, or otherwise make an obeisance to gain a temporary blessing from the throne (treat this as speaking a command word to activate a magic item). The creature need not feel genuine allegiance to the ruler to gain this blessing; the physical act of loyalty is sufficient to receive the throne's blessing. The effect of this blessing is described in the individual throne entries. Unless otherwise specified, this blessing ends after 24 hours. The throne can provide its blessing only once per creature per day. Because a throne can affect many dozens of courtiers in a single day, it is possible that all courtiers in a court with a magic throne have that blessing each day.",
