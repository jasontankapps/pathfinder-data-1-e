				"An altar is a stationary magic item used to focus the power of a particular deity into the world at a fixed point such as a temple, a monastery, a shrine, or the site of a miracle. An altar is normally about 10 feet by 5 feet by 5 feet at its widest points and is very heavy, usually weighing at least 150 pounds. It is often the central focus of an entire chamber, small sanctum, underground grotto, or forest grove. An altar is always fixed in place; it cannot be moved without losing its magical abilities. Most altars are secured to the floor, and a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to uproot or move them (or a higher DC, depending on their size and weight).",
				"",
				"An altar has an alignment aura identical to that of its associated deity, and is the center of a magic circle effect or effects appropriate to that alignment (magic circle against evil for a good altar, both magic circle against evil and magic circle against law for a chaotic good altar, and so on). As a permanent religious fixture, it is a suitable target for effects such as consecrate or desecrate.",
				"",
				"A worshiper of an altar's deity may stand, sit, kneel, or lie prostrate within 10 feet of the altar and speak a prayer to gain a temporary blessing from the altar (treat this as speaking a command word to activate a magic item). The effect of this blessing is described in the individual altar entries. Unless otherwise specified, this blessing ends after 24 hours (or earlier, if dispelled or ended by the actions of the worshiper). The altar can provide its blessing only once per creature per day. Usually, this blessing is something suitable for making life easier for members of the altar's associated faith (such as a skill bonus) and isn't always something an adventurer would consider useful, though martially oriented faiths and temples in dangerous lands may have altars that provide protective blessings for their worshipers. Because an altar can affect many dozens of worshipers in a day, it is possible or even likely that all worshipers in a community may have that blessing each day; likewise, all members of a secret cult or evil monster lair may have a useful blessing.",
				"",
				"Depending on the motivations of the deity and the altar's creators, some altars may grant their blessings to non-worshipers who pray to the altar's deity so long as the creature's alignment is compatible with the deity's alignment. Conversely, an altar of an evil deity might allow anyone to gain its blessing, as drawing power from evil can corrupt good and neutral folk. Accepting the blessing of an evil altar is an evil act, and likewise for blessings from altars with other alignment auras.",

By extracting a portion of a demon's body and then preparing it by utilizing various occult techniques or strange methods of preservation, one can reap a portion of the demon's power and transfer it into a sentient being. Demonic implants can either be temporary (and often addictive) drug-like magical elixirs, or they can be actual body parts that must be grafted onto or into a living mortal before they work. All are treated as wondrous items for the purposes of construction and use. The three examples listed below merely scratch the surface of this reckless category of magic item.",

Successfully attached demonic implants impart a negative level to a lawful or good user-the number of negative levels imparted stacks with each new implant.

They never result in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way while the implant is in effect.",

But in truth, knowledge of such methods is withheld only to whet mortal desires, a feint to hasten a diabolist's willing damnation. Ultimately, any spellcaster can create a devil talisman through the use of the {feat/Craft Wondrous Item} feat and planar binding. As an additional prerequisite to the creation of any type of devil talisman, the creator must summon a devil and bargain with it to be bound within the talisman. Most devils prove resistant to the idea of being trapped within a magic item, but might acquiesce to a particularly convincing summoner. A devil summoned via planar binding and coerced into being bound within a devil talisman gains a +10 bonus on its opposed Charisma check. Once convinced, the devil infuses the already prepared devil talisman, completing the profane item.",

Removal deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage and could have other effects as well, such as blindness or lameness, as determined by the GM. A body part that has been elementally augmented cannot receive another elemental augmentation, even of the same type.",

The presenter must intentionally give the favor to the recipient, and the recipient must intentionally accept it and don it within 1 minute for the favor to activate. Giving a favor to a recipient is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity; receiving and donning a favor requires as much time as it takes to don an item of the favor's type (usually a standard action). Once donned, the favor provides the indicated effect for the listed duration. In addition, while the favor is active, the presenter can take a standard action to sense whether the recipient is alive (with 4 or more hit points), badly wounded (at 3 or fewer hit points), dead, undead, or neither alive nor dead (as a construct). This effect functions regardless of distance, as long as the presenter and recipient are on the same plane of existence.",

Fleshcrafts are living pieces of tissue that can be attached to any corporeal, living creature via a graft or grown by a consumed elixir. Once attached, a fleshcraft immediately begins functioning and grants its listed abilities to the grafted creature. While a fleshcraft is partially magical in genesis, it doesn't radiate magic or have a caster level, regardless of whether it has been grafted to the subject or supplied via an elixir.",
				"",
				"**Fleshcraft Grafts:** Creating a fleshcraft graft requires the {feat/Fleshwarper} feat and an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the graft to be created. Creating a fleshcraft graft is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value.",
				"",
				"Applying a fleshcraft graft to a target requires a 1-hour surgical procedure, during which time the subject must be either willing or helpless. At the end of the hour, the surgeon must attempt a Heal check against the graft's listed DC. Failure indicates the patient's body rejects the graft and the graft dies. Regardless of the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if employing the [sanity system](rule/sanity)). Although fleshcraft grafts are not magical, some occupy a magic item slot on the body, preventing that slot from being used for any magic item or other graft.",
				"",
				"A fleshcraft graft can be removed with another hour-long surgery and a successful Heal check against the original DC. On a failure, either the graft remains or the surgeon removes the graft, destroying it and killing the subject (surgeon's choice). Alternatively, the surgeon can remove the graft more delicately and use healing magic to save the subject, attempting a DC 15 Heal check and applying a heal or regenerate spell immediately afterward. Failing this Heal check always results in the destruction of both graft and subject. A successful surgery removes and destroys the graft. Regardless of the method used and the surgery's success, the subject takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d8 points of sanity damage, if using the sanity system).",

				"**Fleshcraft Elixirs:** A creature with the {feat/Fleshwarper} feat can also create fleshcraft elixirs. Doing so requires an alchemy lab worth at least 1,000 gp as well as 1 pound of living tissue per 1,000 gp value of the elixir, just like creating a graft, but the components are distilled into the elixir. Creating a fleshcraft elixir is like creating a magic item and requires 1 day of crafting time per 1,000 gp of the graft's value. These potionlike concoctions can bestow the effect of an individual fleshcraft graft (a creature can't benefit from more than one at a time), but for a limited period of time. Imbibing a fleshcraft elixir works similarly to imbibing other potions or elixirs, except that it's slow acting, taking effect the round after it is imbibed (as if the imbiber were casting a 1-round casting time spell). Fleshcraft elixirs are foul and potentially dangerous. A fleshcraft elixir is keyed to a specific type of fleshcraft, and each elixir provides a Fortitude save that the imbiber must succeed at in order to gain that graft's effect for the limited duration. On a failed saving throw, the imbiber gains only the graft's penalty for its duration, and if the imbiber fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the imbiber also takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage.

During this time, the nascent fungus must be fertilized with expensive material components (the cost varies according to the graft), watered as needed, and kept safe from harm. After the required time has passed, the cultivator must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check in order for the fungus graft to be properly formed. The DC of this check varies according to the graft.

An infused poison combines the effects of an ingested poison and a potion. A creature drinking an infused poison is affected by the poison (and its initial effects or damage) first, after which the infused spell effect triggers and the imbiber must attempt a second saving throw (often of a different type or DC) against its magical effects. Spell resistance applies normally to an infused poison's magical effects, but offers no protection against the poison, and poison resistance offers no protection against the magical effects of an infused poison. Poison immunity renders a creature immune to an infused poison's magical effects.",

A poison's creator makes all decisions regarding the spell's effects when it is created-the creature consuming the infused poison has no control over its effects.

The exterior may be dyed, or strange scratches may be worked into the surface. On occasion, some other item may be sewn onto the surface, such as the severed foot of a chicken tied with colored ribbon, or a frog's leg bone etched with strange patterns.

A throne is normally 5 feet wide, 5 feet long, and 10 feet high, although specific dimensions vary considerably. Thrones are heavy and always fixed in place; a successful DC 25 Strength check is required to uproot or move them (though this could be a higher DC, depending upon a throne's size and weight).

Most magic thrones grant a heroism effect to the current ruler of the kingdom for as long as the ruler is seated upon the throne. Regardless of the throne's size, only one creature can receive this effect at a time. While a ruler is seated on a magic throne, another creature within 20 feet of the throne can kneel, bow, or otherwise make an obeisance to gain a temporary blessing from the throne (treat this as speaking a command word to activate a magic item). The creature need not feel genuine allegiance to the ruler to gain this blessing; the physical act of loyalty is sufficient to receive the throne's blessing. The effect of this blessing is described in the individual throne entries. Unless otherwise specified, this blessing ends after 24 hours. The throne can provide its blessing only once per creature per day. Because a throne can affect many dozens of courtiers in a single day, it is possible that all courtiers in a court with a magic throne have that blessing each day.",
