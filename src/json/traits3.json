The application process went well, and you're now a full member. Your first assignment is to accompany Garavel's group to Kelmarane-the Pathfinder Society has heard rumors of several ancient structures in the area, including a ruined monastery once dedicated to Sarenrae, and would like to learn more about them. Even more pressing is the mystery of what brought about Kelmarane's ruin in the first place-reports of which are vague at best. If you can determine the cause of the village's abandonment so many years ago, you're sure the Society would be impressed. You begin the game with your own wayfinder, a loan from your venture-captain. you've promised to pay your venturecaptain 500 gp for the wayfinder some day, but for now it's yours to use. A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action."
