			"If the undead mount ability is selected, the sealbreaker gains the ability to reanimate any Large corpse (or a Medium corpse for Small seal-breakers) as his corpse mount. If no such corpse is present, the seal-breaker cannot summon his mount. The corpse animates as a quadruped of the same size that the seal-breaker can ride, regardless of the corpse's living form. This corpse mount functions as a [druid's animal companion](class/druid) using the seal-breaker's level as his effective druid level. The mount has the same base statistics as a heavy horse, pony, boar, camel, or dog (based on its size) with the following changes: its type changes to undead, it has a good Will save and bad Fortitude and Reflex saves, it uses the base creature's Constitution score as its Charisma score (and likewise applies all level-based advancements to Charisma instead of Constitution), and it has an Intelligence score of at least 6. This ability otherwise functions as and replaces fiendish boon.",

			"**Aura of Death (Su):** At 8th level, a seal-breaker radiates an aura that causes undead creatures within 10 feet to gain a profane bonus on all saving throws. This ability replaces aura of despair.",
			"",
			"**Aura of Rebirth (Su):** At 11th level, if a living creature is slain within 10 feet of the seal-breaker, the seal-breaker can spend two uses of his smite good ability at the start of his next turn as a standard action to summon the spirit of a dead murderer to reanimate the corpse as a mohrg. The mohrg immediately rises and attacks the seal breaker's foes, acting under the antipaladin's command. After 1 minute, the murderer's soul leaves the body, which collapses, again lifeless. At 15th level, the seal-breaker can activate this ability as a move action. At 19th level, he can activate this ability as a swift action. This ability replaces aura of vengeance.",
			"",
			"**Code of Conduct:** The seal-breaker is dedicated to releasing the Whispering Tyrant from his prison. If a sealbreaker willingly and altruistically commits a good act, he loses all class features except proficiencies. This doesn't mean that a seal-breaker can't take actions someone else might qualify as good, only that such actions must always lead toward the eventual release of the Whispering Tyrant. A seal-breaker's code requires that he place the ultimate release of Tar-Baphon above all else, as well as impose tyranny, take advantage whenever possible, and punish the good and just (provided such actions don't interfere with his ultimate goal)."

Tyrants are manipulative and lawful antipaladins, chess masters who arrange things behind the scenes to ensure that whatever happens, evil always wins, and the tyrant along with it.

A tyrant's code requires that he place his own sinister goals above all else, respect rightful authority even as he twists its loopholes to his own ends, impose tyranny, and punish all those who dare dissent.
