			"At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (&ast;) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"### Bomb Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Acid Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.",
			"",
			"**Anarchic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source:ChampionsofBalance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal chaotic divine damage. Lawful creatures that take a direct hit from an anarchic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, anarchic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Anarchic bombs have no effect on chaotic-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Anguish Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source:DistantRealms)*): You can throw bombs infused with psychic trauma. This discovery allows other alchemists to duplicate the anguish bombs used by [mnemostillers](unknown:mnemostillers).",
			"",
			"**Axiomatic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source:ChampionsofBalance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal lawful divine damage. Chaotic creatures that take a direct hit from an axiomatic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, axiomatic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Axiomatic bombs have no effect on lawful creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Blackstar Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source:MonsterCodex)*): This bomb crushes the target like a void bomb, then repels nearby creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts. Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed directly away from the target's square. An alchemist must have the void bomb discovery to create blackstar bombs.",
			"",
			"**Blinding Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Boneshard Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:UndeadSlayer'sHandbook)*): This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike; aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead. The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the [skeleton template](unknown:skeleton_template). Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell:animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concussive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Confusion Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist's bombs twist the target's perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a [confusion](spell:confusion) spell for 1 round per caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cursed Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:ChampionsofCorruption)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver a debilitating curse. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by [bestow curse](spell:bestow_curse). An alchemist must be at least 12th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cytillesh Bomb** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can infuse it with cytillesh extract. Cytillesh bombs deal 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a cytillesh bomb are sickened for 1 round per alchemist level unless they succeed at Fortitude saves. If a creature is rendered unconscious from this bomb or any other attack before it is able to remove the sickened condition, the victim loses all memory from the last hour and cannot form new memories for 8 hours. The lost and prevented memories might return later as dreams, and can be restored with a [restoration](spell:restoration) spell. This discovery doesn't stack with other discoveries that alter an alchemist's bomb.",
			"",
			"**Darkness Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes nonmagical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as [deeper darkness](spell:deeper_darkness).",
			"",
			"**Defoliant Bomb** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): These poisonous bombs clear away foliage, dealing extra damage to plant creatures. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal extra damage against plant creatures but less damage against other creatures. Against creatures with the plant type, a defoliant bomb deals 1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered level the alchemist possesses, instead of 1d6. Against all other creatures, the defoliant bomb only deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. This is a poison effect. A defoliant bomb kills all normal vegetation in the target's square and its splash area; any plant-based difficult terrain in the affected area becomes normal terrain.",
			"",
			"**Delayed Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. [Dispel magic](spell:Dispel_magic) can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Demolition Charge&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal damage to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver. If the item is worn or held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target, and the wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is unattended, a demolition charge deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a direct hit. This bonus doesn't affect the bomb's splash damage. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Directed Bomb** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:MagicalMarketplace)*): The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone. If the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of the blast from where the bomb lands. This discovery can't be combined with the explosive bomb discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted [dispel magic](spell:dispel_magic) spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dread Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source:DistantRealms)*): Your anguish bombs are tainted with fear and dread. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs become frightened for 1d6 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Will saving throw is instead shaken for a single round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:UndeadSlayer'sHandbook)*): The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility or other forms of obscurity (such as [ethereal jaunt](spell:ethereal_jaunt)), effectively creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for 1 minute, and is otherwise identical to [faerie fire](spell:faerie_fire).",
			"",
			"**Explosive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.",
			"",
			"**Fast Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Flesh-Eating Bomb&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:MonsterHunter'sHandbook)*): The alchemist can create bombs that devour living matter. The alchemist's bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1 armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the bomb's splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb's save DC to take only half damage.",
			"",
			"**Force Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Frost Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.",
			"",
			"**Glassfoot Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it cover the ground in volatile jagged crystals in addition to its normal effects. These crystals act like [caltrops](equipment/misc:caltrops), evaporating into a smelly but harmless gas in 2d6 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Grease Bomb&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb's splash radius in grease (as the [grease](spell:grease) spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can't affect items or armor. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Plague Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [greater contagion](spell:greater_contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the plague bomb and smoke bomb discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grounding Goo&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): The alchemist's bomb applies a sticky residue after any damage from the bomb is resolved. If a creature damaged by the bomb has a nonmagical fly speed, its flight is severely impaired, and it takes a penalty equal to the alchemist's level on Fly checks for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Healing Bomb&ast;** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:MagicalMarketplace)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to expend an infused extract or potion containing a cure spell. A creature that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had imbibed the infusion or potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing them.",
			"",
			"**Hellfire Bomb&ast;** (*[Agents of Evil](source:AgentsofEvil)*): This discovery is available to tiefling alchemists. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can have it act as an explosive bomb, but deal half of its damage as fire damage and half as unholy damage that is not subject to fire resistance or immunity. An alchemist must be at least 9th level and have the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Holy Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Purity](source:ChampionsofPurity)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Immolation Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater. An alchemist must be at least 3rd level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Incendiary Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source:VillainCodex)*): An incendiary charge is a bomb specifically designed to overcome the effects of any nonmagical object's hardness. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place an incendiary charge that burns and eats away at an object, dealing normal bomb damage to it. (The damage is not halved against an object with hardness, unlike most energy damage.) Furthermore, the incendiary charge ignores the first 5 points of hardness of the material being damaged. The alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inferno Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of [incendiary cloud](spell:incendiary_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Bomb (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:AdvancedClassGuide)*): An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend two uses of inspiration to increase the bomb's damage by 1d6. The type of damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other a discoveries that affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb with another bomb discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than once.",
			"",
			"**Jury-Rigged Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero'sHandbook)*): Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift action (this counts against the alchemist's daily use of bombs), and they deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the alchemist's Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly unstable; if the alchemist's attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a direct hit. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Madness Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Melancholy Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source:DistantRealms)*): Your anguish bombs are filled with memories of sadness and regret. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs are also affected as per [crushing despair](spell:crushing_despair) for 1 round per alchemist level, or a single round if the target succeeds at a Will saving throw. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Neutralizing Bomb** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn't allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn't stack with any other that modifies bombs.",
			"",
			"**Ooze Blight&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:MonsterHunter'sHandbook)*): A target hit by the alchemist's bomb loses the split special quality for 1d4 rounds. In addition, against creatures with the ooze type, this bomb deals untyped damage that bypasses all resistances.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source:VillainCodex)*): A penetrating charge is a bomb specifically designed to disable locks and similar mechanisms, though not other means of sealing a door, a container, or other sorts of devices. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place a penetrating charge on a lock. Instead of dealing damage, the penetrating charge seeps into the mechanism and eats away at it, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on any subsequent Disable Device checks against the mechanism. A creature can spend 10 minutes and attempt an appropriate Craft check (DC 15) to fix the lock and remove this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Plague Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [contagion](spell:contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash area for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Plague Vector** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:ChampionsofCorruption)*): The effects of the alchemist's plague bomb operate as normal except for the following changes. The chosen disease's save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier. Any creatures affected by the chosen disease become vectors for it, spreading the disease to any creatures they come in physical contact with for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The save DC to avoid contracting the disease from the vector is the same as the DC used for this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the plague bomb discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poison Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [cloudkill](spell:cloudkill) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poisoned Explosive&ast;** (*[Dirty Tactics Toolbox](source:DirtyTacticsToolbox)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can apply a dose of contact or injury poison to it, as if applying poison to a weapon. If the poisoned bomb hits its target, the bomb deals damage as normal, but the target must also succeed at a saving throw against the poison or be affected by that poison. No other creatures are affected by the poison. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and have the poison use class feature before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Profane Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:ChampionsofCorruption)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal evil divine damage. Good creatures that take a direct hit from a profane bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against a neutral creature, a profane bomb deals half damage, and the target is not affected by the bomb's staggering effect. A profane bomb has no effect against evil-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychoactive Bomb&ast;** (*[Blood of the Moon](source:BloodoftheMoon)*): Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten certain sensations. A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, and pain effects, and the DC for Intimidate checks against the victim decreases by 2. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack, and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than normal. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remote Bomb** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:HeroesoftheHighCourt)*): The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Rocket Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): ([Goblin](unknown:Goblin) only) Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a 20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemist's normal splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sand Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can pack the casing full of sand that explodes in an abrasive cloud on impact. A creature that takes a direct hit from a sand bomb is blinded for 1 round, as are any creatures in the splash radius that fail a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier).",
			"",
			"**Scrap Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): ([Goblin](unknown:Goblin) only) When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.",
			"",
			"**Shock Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Siege Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege engine with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Smoke Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.",
			"",
			"**Solid Ground&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): The alchemist launches an explosive paste bomb that bonds with any earthen surface. Each application of this paste deals no damage and affects a 5-foot-cube of dirt, loose soil, or stone, transmuting the earth for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level. Creatures cannot use burrow, earthmeld, or similar abilities (such as the meld into stone spell) while the ground remains transmuted in this way.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Stink Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of [stinking cloud](spell:stinking_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Strafe Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at the alchemist and extends away from him in the direction he chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.",
			"",
			"**Substantiating Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source:DistantRealms)*): Your bombs are infused with ectoplasm and a longing for life, lending ethereal creatures a measure of substance. You can throw a bomb that inflicts no damage but instead creates a 10-foot-radius cloud of fog that functions as [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud) and lasts for 1 round per alchemist level. Incorporeal creatures that pass through this cloud become partially solid, taking half damage from nonmagic attacks and full damage from magic weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for the duration of the smoke cloud, even if the incorporeal creature moves outside the cloud's area. A creature affected by the cloud can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the substantiating effects of this bomb. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead, fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the blinding bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Syringe Stirge (Su)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:CohortsandCompanions)*): As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its payload. A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a [stirge](unknown:stirge) but lacks the blood drain ability. If it ends its turn attached to an opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent's bloodstream, dealing damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (as the [Throw Anything](unknown:Throw_Anything) feat-this injection is a direct attack and doesn't deal splash damage. A syringe stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not attached to an enemy before the end of its life span it and its bomb payload fall inert. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tanglefoot Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a [tanglefoot bag](equipment/misc:tanglefoot_bag). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.",
			"",
			"**Thorny Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal piercing damage. Thorny bombs count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Underwater Demolition (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including throwing from the air into the water. If the bomb travels through water, the range increment is reduced to 5 feet.",
			"",
			"**Void Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source:MonsterCodex)*): (Drow only)  By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some drow alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of crushing those inside. Void bombs deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st, instead of 1d6. A creature hit by the bomb must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC. If it fails, it is knocked prone and can't get up for 1 round. If it succeeds, all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. Other creatures within 5 feet of the bomb's target take no damage, but must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC or have all their movement speeds reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Extract Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Aromatic Extract** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:HeroesoftheHighCourt)*): The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist's daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Bottled Ooze (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist has learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he actually throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature. The ooze is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The ooze remains for 1 round per caster level, and decays into powder when the duration expires. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze's CR (so a CR 4 [gray ooze](unknown:gray_ooze) requires a 4th-level extract). An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Combine Extracts** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infusion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.",
			"",
			"**Intuitive Understanding (Sp)** (*[Champions of Balance](source:ChampionsofBalance)*): If the alchemist drinks an extract of the divination school while under the effects of a cognatogen, his effective caster level temporarily increases by 2. In addition, while under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist may use augury once as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to his alchemist level). At 10th level, he can use divination instead. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nostrum** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:HeroesoftheHighCourt)*): When the alchemist creates an infusion, he can mask a delayed poison within the mixture. A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect a number of hours after being imbibed equal to the alchemist's Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities. Until the nostrum is consumed or destroyed, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pickled Quasit** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:ChampionsofCorruption)*): The alchemist has learned how to seal a quasit in a bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the quasit. The quasit is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The quasit remains for 1 round per caster level, then collapses into its associated elements. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a pickled quasit requires a 4th-level extract. An alchemist must be at least 10th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tainted Infusion** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:ChampionsofCorruption)*): The alchemist can mask murder behind beneficence. When preparing an extract with the infusion discovery, he can lace the extract with one of his bombs as long as the extract has a duration greater than instantaneous. If he chooses, the alchemist can reduce the duration of the extract to 1 round. As soon as the extract's duration expires, it detonates, dealing 150% of the alchemist's bomb damage to the drinker. This effect does not produce a splash radius. Producing a tainted extract consumes both an infusion slot and a daily bomb use. An alchemist must know both the delayed bomb and infusion discoveries to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Volumizer (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): The alchemist can use an extract slot of any level to create a reactive tablet that purifies water and doubles its volume. This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has ?? the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that's not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.",
			"",
			"### Gloom Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bounding Gloom** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): The alchemist gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a [dimension door](spell:dimension_door) spell. The limitation is that the alchemist's beginning and ending locations must be areas of dim light or darker, or within the radius of an umbral gloom that is lowering the light level. The alchemist can travel up to a total of 100 feet each day in this way. This distance must be used in 10-foot increments; for example, the alchemist can make a single jump of 100 feet or 10 jumps of 10 feet each. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the distance the alchemist can jump each day doubles (200 feet at 12th level, 400 feet at 14th level, and so on). An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Debilitating Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or take a penalty to its Strength equal to 1d4 + 1 per 2 alchemist levels (maximum of 1d4+5) for 1 round per alchemist level. A target's Strength score cannot drop below 1. This penalty does not stack with itself. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): A creature struck by a direct hit with the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the debilitating gloom discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glutinous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): The gloom creates an area in its splash radius that functions as [web](spell:web). The webbing lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grasping Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): The gloom creates an area equal to double its splash radius that functions as [black tentacles](spell:black_tentacles). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the debilitating gloom and draining gloom discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Mucilaginous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): The gloom leaves a chilly gray residue that turns each square in its splash radius into difficult terrain. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's level.",
			"",
			"**Rime-Bound Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:BloodofShadows)*): The gloom creates an area of freezing shadow in its splash radius that deals 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area each turn. This effect lasts 1 round for every 2 alchemist levels. An alchemist must be at least 6th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Mutagen Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bone-Spike Mutagen (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he mutates his skeletal structure, causing the bones on his elbows, knuckles, spine, and shoulder blades to grow massive and pierce his skin, exposing themselves as large spikes. While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist's natural armor bonus granted by the mutagen increases by 2. The spikes count as masterwork armor spikes with which the alchemist is proficient. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his Intelligence, it applies a penalty to his Strength. If it enhances his Wisdom, it applies a penalty to his Dexterity. If it enhances his Charisma, it applies a penalty to his Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Mutagen** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:MagicalMarketplace)*): The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill check. This resistance increases by 5 and the competence bonus by 2 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand mutagen, greater mutagen, and true mutagen. The elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity, Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold, Swim). An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time. An alchemist can gain the benefits of only one elemental mutagen at a time, selected when he imbibes the mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Feral Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.",
			"",
			"**Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:LegacyoftheFirstWorld)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a fey mutagen, a mixture that lends him some of the grace and power of the First World. When imbibed, a fey mutagen grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the alchemist's Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, and DR 2/cold iron. This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and interacts with other effects as though it were a mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Grand Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist's cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the cognatogen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to each physical ability score when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:LegacyoftheFirstWorld)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 10/cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](unknown:druid's_woodland_stride_class_feature). In addition, he can choose not to allow spells and effects to affect him if they would not be capable of affecting both his original creature type and the fey creature type. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:AdvancedClassGuide)*): The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the [item lore, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration investigator talents](unknown:item_lore,_tenacious_inspiration,_and_underworld_inspiration_investigator_talents). An alchemist must be at least 16th level and have the greater inspiring cognatogen discovery to select this discovery.",

The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to both associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:LegacyoftheFirstWorld)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 5/ cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](unknown:druid's_woodland_stride_class_feature). An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",

The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Rasugen** (*[Distant Realms](source:DistantRealms)*): The alchemist's rasugen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus on all saving throws, 3 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The alchemist takes a -4 penalty to Intelligence as long as the greater rasugen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and able to brew a rasugen before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infuse Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:AdvancedClassGuide)*): An alchemist with this discovery leans how to make an inspiring cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that grants him inspiration (as the investigator's class feature) at the expense of Strength and Constitution. Upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, the alchemist gains a pool of inspiration equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modif ier (minimum 1). He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -2 penalty to both Strength and Constitution. As a free action, the alchemist can add 1d6 to the result of an ability or skill check (including any he takes 10 or 20 on) by expending one use of inspiration. This ability works exactly like the [investigator's inspiration ability](unknown:investigator's_inspiration_ability), except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If the alchemist already has access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his inspiration pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. He cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw. All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes non-alchemists sick, and so on. When the effect of an inspiring cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to Strength and Dexterity. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to an inspiring cognatogen.",
			"",
			"**Mutagen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): This discovery gives the alchemist the mutagen class ability. (This discovery exists so alchemist archetypes who have variant mutagens, such as the [mindchemist](unknown:mindchemist), can learn how to make standard mutagens.)",
			"",
			"**Purging Mutagen** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer'sHandbook)*): The alchemist's mutagen combines ipecac and other purgative components. A non-alchemist who consumes the mutagen is nauseated for only 1 round, during which time her body rapidly metabolizes or expels all extant toxins, granting her an immediate second saving throw against each ongoing disease and poison currently affecting her. Each successful save counts as two consecutive successful saving throws for the purpose of curing the affliction. Any failed saving throws do not result in additional damage or other effects. A non-alchemist who consumes a second purging mutagen in a 24-hour period is instead nauseated for 1 hour. When an alchemist drinks the mutagen, he can choose whether or not to also be affected by this discovery in addition to the mutagen's other effects.",
			"",
			"**Rag Doll Mutagen (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): ([Goblin](unknown:Goblin) only) When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, his body and bones become rubbery and easy to contort. The alchemist gains a bonus equal to his class level on Escape Artist checks, can squeeze through places as if he were one size category smaller, and can make a Reflex save (DC equal to 15 + 1 for every 10 feet fallen) to take half damage from falling. At 10th level, all falling damage is considered nonlethal damage, and the alchemist can squeeze through places as if he were two size categories smaller than his size while under the effects of this mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Splitting Mutagen** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:MonsterHunter'sHandbook)*): Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well. The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist's next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a [fireball](spell:fireball)), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via [resurrection](spell:resurrection) or similarly powerful magic. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Poison Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Celestial Poisons (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:ChampionsofPurity)*): The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concentrate Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Excretions (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): When using his toxic skin ability, the alchemist can choose to excrete a Constitution poison instead of a Dexterity poison. This poison works the same as the normal grippli toxic skin poison except that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the [toxic skin racial trait](unknown:toxic_skin_racial_trait) before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Designer Poison (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:PotionsandPoisons)*): The alchemist can create special poisons that are more effective against certain creatures. When crafting a poison, the alchemist can choose a single creature type (and subtype, if appropriate) from the [ranger's favored enemy list](unknown:ranger's_favored_enemy_list). Against creatures of the chosen type, the poison's saving throw DC is increased by 4. Against all other creatures, it is reduced by 2. The alchemist must choose the creature type and subtype (if appropriate) while crafting the poison and afterward cannot change this choice.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Destabilizers (Su)** (*[Elemental Master's Handbook](source:ElementalMaster'sHandbook)*): The alchemist is able to concoct reactive chemical compounds that affect elementals like poisons. The alchemist can craft poisons that affect only outsiders with the elemental subtype, bypassing their inherent immunity. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its saving throw, the poison acts as normal, but it may have no effect on the creature depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing fire damage to a fire elemental). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enduring Toxin (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:PotionsandPoisons)*): The alchemist can alter the properties of a poison, causing it to persist longer in the victim's body. Altering a dose of poison in the way takes 1 hour, requires the expenditure of raw materials worth half the poison's market price, and exposes the alchemist to the poison, thereby affecting him if he is not immune. This doubles the poison's maximum duration. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Malignant Poison** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer'sHandbook)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can increase the save DC of any poison by 4 and increase its duration by 2 frequency increments (for example, [large scorpion venom](unknown:large_scorpion_venom) lasts 8 rounds instead of 6 and [drow poison](unknown:drow_poison) lasts 4 minutes instead of 2). Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison's extended duration ends or for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nauseating Flesh** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.",
			"",
			"**Poison Conversion** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Poison (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): The alchemist is adept at delivering poison to the most vulnerable areas of his targets. When the alchemist confirms a critical hit with a poisoned weapon, he increases the save DC of the poison by an amount equal to the weapon's critical multiplier.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.

			"### Potion/Elixir Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Dilution** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Elixir of Life** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell [true resurrection](spell:true_resurrection). Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a [resurrection](spell:resurrection) spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enhance Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:AdvancedPlayer'sGuide)*): If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the extend potion discovery before selecting this discovery.",

			"",
			"**Air Lung** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source:Pathfinder#123:TheFloodedCathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery has conditioned his body to adapt to life above water. He gains the amphibious special quality. Only an alchemist with the aquatic subtype can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a [lesser simulacrum](spell:lesser_simulacrum). This works like the [lesser simulacrum](spell:lesser_simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Zombie (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to animate a relatively complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie. This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the [zombie template](unknown:zombie_template). Zombies that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell:animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Bitter Pill (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): The alchemist becomes bitter in flavor. Any creature that hits the bitter alchemist with a bite attack gains the sickened condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Constitution modifier). Any creature that swallows the alchemist whole gains the nauseated condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (same DC as above). If the alchemist is trapped in the creature's gullet and it becomes nauseated, the creature vomits him back out immediately as a free action at the start of the creature's turn; the alchemist lands prone adjacent to the creature.",
			"",
			"**Chameleon (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks. At 10th level, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +8.",
			"",
			"**Change Alignment (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:ChampionsofPurity)*): Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Collective Memory (Su)** (*[Champions of Balance](source:ChampionsofBalance)*): While under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist adds half his class level on all Knowledge skill checks and may attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained. This bonus does not stack with the second Intelligence bonus granted by the mindchemist archetype's perfect recall class feature. An alchemist must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist's dyes congeal and solidify, allowing him to make physical objects from them. The alchemist can expend two uses of his daily bombs to create a nonmagical object, as [minor creation](spell:minor_creation), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist can develop special pigments and combine them with his alchemical reagents to create unique dyes that cling to the empty space around him, allowing him to paint images in the air to fool his enemies. By expending two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space adjacent to him, as [silent image](spell:silent_image), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Doppelganger Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist learns how to create a [simulacrum](spell:simulacrum), a soulless duplicate, into which he can project his consciousness. As a full-round action, he may shift his consciousness from his current body to any one of his available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, he transfers to his own body automatically; if killed in his own body, he is dead. Unused simulacra (including his abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay. Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Calligraphy** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist can create especially volatile pigments that detonate when agitated. This requires expending one daily use of his bombs, but otherwise functions as [explosive runes](spell:explosive_runes) except that it deals damage as one of the alchemist's bombs. The alchemist can expend an additional daily use of his bombs to apply one discovery that applies to his bombs, such as acid bomb or dispelling bomb, to the runes created with this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Missile** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:UltimateCombat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Fire Brand (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): ([Goblin](unknown:Goblin) only) An alchemist with this discovery can expend one daily bomb use to apply the bomb reagents to his weapon as a swift action. A weapon treated this way deals fire damage as if it had the [flaming](unknown:flaming) weapon special ability. At 10th level, the weapon is treated as if it had the [flaming burst](unknown:flaming_burst) weapon special ability. The bomb reagents continue burning for 1 minute or until extinguished by dousing the weapon in water. An alchemist can use this ability with natural weapons, but he takes 1d6 points of fire damage per round for each natural weapon treated.",
			"",
			"**Gills** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source:Pathfinder#123:TheFloodedCathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery grows a set of gills that allow him to breathe water in addition to breathing air. When on land, the alchemist risks his gills drying out and must bathe his gills with 1/2 gallon of water every 24 hours he is out of the water or take 1 point of Constitution damage every hour thereafter. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glimmering Infusion (Sp)** (*[Spymaster's Handbook](source:Spymaster'sHandbook)*): The alchemist can expend any prepared extract to produce a cube of glowing motes that act as per [glitterdust](spell:glitterdust). The area must be adjacent to the alchemist and covers one 5-foot square per level of extract sacrificed, and the effect's save DC is calculated using the level of the sacrificed extract. The alchemist must have the infusion discovery to choose this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a simulacrum. This works like the [simulacrum](spell:simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Greater Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist expands the set of objects he can create with his constructive dyes. The alchemist can expend one additional use of his daily bombs when using his constructive dyes discovery to create objects, as [major creation](spell:major_creation). The alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the constructive dyes and divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create lifelike images. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces sound, smell, and heat, as [major image](spell:major_image). The alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the divine inks and improved divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Healing Touch (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 round's effect of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. The alchemist's daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 ?? his alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the alchemist. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the spontaneous healing discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Improved Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create images accompanied by sound. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces minor sounds, as [minor image](spell:minor_image). The alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lasting Tinctures (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:PotionsandPoisons)*): The alchemist knows how to make [tinctures](unknown:tinctures) that last much longer than normal. The durations of the effects of any tinctures the alchemist brews using the Craft skill are doubled. When the alchemist uses this discovery to brew a longer-lasting tincture, the tincture imposes its normal penalties on the alchemist even if the alchemist has an ability that reduces tinctures' penalties (such as the [substance tolerance ability of the fermenter alchemist archetype](unknown:substance_tolerance_ability_of_the_fermenter_alchemist_archetype) presented in this section). An alchemist with this discovery can brew tinctures with normal durations.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Plague** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:AdvancedRaceGuide)*): Any creature that must make a save against a disease caused by the alchemist's extract or other class ability must make a second save 1 round later to avoid doubling the duration of the disease effect. If the disease doesn't have a duration, this discovery reduces its onset time and frequencies by half. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Spirit (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist is familiar enough with the ties between his body and spirit that he lingers at death's door far longer than a normal person. He treats his Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills him (so an alchemist with a Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at -20 hit points instead of -10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes him unconscious and comatose, but he is only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, the alchemist must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks). An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Living Pigment** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:HeroesofGolarion)*): The alchemist infuses his inks and dyes with a spark of animating force. As a standard action, he can expend one daily use of his bombs and a 1st-level extract he has prepared to create a creature, as [summon monster I](spell:summon_monster_1), using his level as the spell's caster level. The extract is expended as if the alchemist had consumed it. The alchemist can expend a higher-level extract when using this ability to create a creature using a [summon monster](spell:summon_monster) spell of a level equal to the level of extract expended. For example, if the alchemist expends a 4th-level extract, he can create a creature as if using [summon monster IV](spell:summon_monster_4). Additionally, the alchemist can expend an additional use of his daily bombs when creating a creature in this way to grant the creature the [celestial](unknown:celestial) or [fiendish](unknown:fiendish) template. The alchemist must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Material Mastery (Ex)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:CohortsandCompanions)*): Your superior knowledge of the nature of matter enables you to ignore spell requirements more easily when crafting magic items. By expending an extract of the same school and level as a spell prerequisite when crafting a magic item, you take only a -2 penalty for ignoring that requirement, instead of -5.",
			"",
			"**Method to the Madness (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): The alchemist has learned to channel his madness into one of his alchemist class abilities. When the alchemist takes this discovery, he chooses one of either bombs or extracts. If he selects bombs, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus when determining the bonus to damage and the saving throw DCs of his bombs. If the alchemist selects extracts, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus to calculate bonus extracts per day. The alchemist must have the [madness extraordinary ability](unknown:madness_extraordinary_ability) to take this discovery. This discovery can be taken twice, allowing the alchemist to select both bombs and extracts.",
			"",
			"**Monstrous Graft (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): The alchemist can replace up to four of his own amputated limbs with those of a monstrous beast of the same size category. If the grafted limb is an arm, the alchemist gains either a climb speed of 15 feet or a claw or slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 for a Small alchemist). If the grafted limb is a leg, the alchemist gains one of the following benefits: a +5 bonus to land speed, a swim speed of 15 feet, or a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. For each limb the alchemist replaces in this manner, he takes a -2 penalty to Wisdom as he loses his sense of self. [Derros](unknown:Derros) are immune to this penalty.",
			"",
			"**Mummification (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist has mastered preserving flesh and applied this knowledge to his own body, turning himself into an undeadlike creature. After learning this discovery, the alchemist must perform a 30-day regimen of a special diet, rigorous exercise, and drinking a mildly poisonous alchemical tea. At the end of this regimen, he falls unconscious for 24 hours, then awakens as a \"living mummy.\" The alchemist's type does not change, but he becomes immune to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the preserve organs discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Parasitic Twin (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist's vestigial limbs are part of a parasitic twin on his torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the vestigial limb discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within the alchemist's body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though the alchemist can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if the alchemist succumbs to a mental effect that would make him unconscious, helpless, or not in control of his own actions (such as [charm person](spell:charm_person), [feeblemind](spell:feeblemind), or [hold person](spell:hold_person)), he can reroll his saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can ignore it. Using this ability sickens the alchemist for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and he cannot use the twin's limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally. The alchemist must have selected the vestigial arm discovery twice before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Phantom Limb** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:UndeadSlayer'sHandbook)*): The alchemist can manifest a ghostly, incorporeal arm that juts out from his torso. This phantom limb does not grant the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, and it cannot hold or grab anything (including incorporeal objects). The alchemist may use his phantom limb to make a touch attack against a foe as a standard action, scraping away at the very fibers of the victim's soul. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage per alchemist level (Fortitude half ). Creatures that are immune to incorporeal attacks are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction except DR/ epic. The alchemist may suppress or activate this ability as a free action, and can use his phantom limb for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier (these rounds need not be consecutive). An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pheromones (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:UltimateWilderness)*): The alchemist exudes an imperceptible musk that grants him a permanent +3 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.",
			"",
			"**Preserve Organs (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist learns how to preserve and protect his vital organs, reducing the chance of a mortal wound. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the alchemist, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks (such as [fortification](unknown:fortification) armor). An alchemist can take this discovery up to three times; the effects stack, increasing this chance to 50% and then 75%.",
			"",
			"**Promethean Disciple** (*[Occult Adventures](source:OccultAdventures)*): An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains [Craft Construct](unknown:Craft_Construct) as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct. [The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to](unknown:The_DC_to_create_the_construct_still_increases_for_any_necessary_spells_that_the_alchemist_does_not_have_access_to). However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychokinetic Tincture** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:UndeadSlayer'sHandbook)*): Once per day, the alchemist can concoct a foul-tasting tincture that harnesses the power of the spirit. By drinking this tincture as a standard action, the alchemist can invite the latent spirits in the area to surround him. The alchemist can channel one spirit for every 4 alchemist levels he possesses. Each spirit channeled this way grants the alchemist a +1 def lection bonus to AC as the spirits whirl around his body. As a standard action, the alchemist can launch one of these spirits toward a target as a ranged touch attack. Launching a spirit this way reduces this discovery's deflection bonus to AC by 1. As a launched spirit passes through its target's body, it emits a terrible wail heard only in the target's mind, causing the target to become frightened for 1 round per alchemist level (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by this discovery again for 24 hours. The spirits whirl around the alchemist's body for 10 minutes per alchemist level, or until the alchemist has launched all of the spirits. An alchemist must be at least 4th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Baptism (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:ChampionsofPurity)*): When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by [consecrate](spell:consecrate), for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the [consecrate](spell:consecrate) effect even if they leave the affected area. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remady Extract** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer'sHandbook)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one nonmagical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sandstone Solution (Su)** (*[People of the Sands](source:PeopleoftheSands)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can convert any potion or extract into a solution that, when thrown or applied, solidifies sand or dirt to the hardness of stone for 1 hour, affecting an area with a radius of 10 feet ?? the level of the potion or extract. If this solution is thrown at or applied to stone, it instead causes a 5-foot cube of stone to become crumbly and soft for 1 minute, reducing its hardness by double the level of the potion or extract.",
			"",
			"**Sleeper Agent (Su)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): The alchemist learns how to create a sleeper agent, whom he releases back into its original society none the wiser. The alchemist can create a sleeper agent in a ritual that takes 1 minute; the target must be unconscious for the ritual's duration. At any time during the next year, as long as he is within 1 mile of the sleeper agent, the alchemist can activate the agent's programming. When the sleeper agent is activated, treat her as if she were the target of a [dominate person](spell:dominate_person) spell with a caster level equal to the alchemist's level at the time the sleeper agent was created. If the sleeper agent is killed or the dominate person effect's duration expires, the sleeper agent is permanently released from the alchemist's control. The alchemist can also release any sleeper agent as a free action. The alchemist can have one active sleeper agent for every 6 alchemist levels he possesses. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Spell Knowledge** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:CohortsandCompanions)*): Your studies into how all things are interconnected have taught you to cast a very limited number of spells. Select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least 2 levels lower than your highest-level extract known. You can prepare and cast this spell as an arcane spell. Preparing the spell uses up an extract slot 1 level higher than the spell's level. Your caster level is equal to your alchemist level, and your save DCs and concentration checks are Intelligence-based. You're considered to have this spell on your spell list for purposes of prerequisites, spell completion items, and spell trigger items. You may select this discovery more than once. Each time, it grants you access to another spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Healing (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:UltimateMagic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. As a free action once per round, he can heal 5 hit points as if he had the fast healing ability. He can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner for every 2 alchemist levels he possesses. If the alchemist falls unconscious because of hit point damage and he still has healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until he is conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.",
			"",
			"**Subsumed Spirit (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): As the alchemist grows in power, his parasitic twin laps up a portion of his soul, like a dog feeding on its master's scraps. The alchemist's parasitic twin can now manifest or hide within the alchemist's torso as a move action. As a standard action, the alchemist can cause his manifested twin to babble, driving listeners insane. All creatures without the insanity special ability that are within 60 feet of the alchemist must succeed at a Will save or be affected by confusion for 1 round per alchemist level. The alchemist can urge his parasitic twin to babble a number of times per day equal to 3 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Creatures that successfully save can't be affected by this effect for 24 hours. The alchemist is immune to its sibling's babbling. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The alchemist must have the parasitic twin discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Acclimation (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:InnerSeaMonsterCodex)*): Time spent in the bright light of day has partially inured the alchemist to its effects. When the alchemist would normally take Constitution damage as a result of vulnerability to sunlight, he can attempt a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to negate the effects. The DC of this saving throw increases by 1 for each hour after the first spent in sunlight within the last 24 hours.",

					"**Command the Meek (Ex)**: At 8th level, the cavalier treats all of her allies with the shaken condition as though they had the same teamwork feats as the cavalier for the purpose of determining whether the cavalier receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually have the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the cavalier to receive the listed bonus.

The ally must have the shaken condition or have no more than half the Hit Dice of the cavalier, and the ally gains a Reflex save to negate this ability's effect entirely (DC = 10 + half the cavalier's level + the higher of her Strength modifier or Charisma modifier). If the attack hits, the damage is split evenly between the cavalier and the ally. If the ally's save was a natural 1, the ally takes all of the damage, including any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). An ally can purposefully fail this saving throw, but cannot purposefully roll a natural 1."

His options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions as [beast shape II](spell:beast_shape_2), except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per cavalier level, or until the cavalier chooses to change his mount back.

			"## Variant Channeling",
			"",
			"(Source: [Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic))",
			"",
			"An iconic ability of clerics is their power to channel positive or negative energy, whether for healing, for damage, or to turn or command the undead. However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. The following categories are examples of alternative channeling abilities based on the nature of a deity's power; for example, a fire deity's negative energy channeling may deal fire damage as part of or instead of the damage from channeling.",
			"",
			"When you create a cleric character, decide whether she uses the standard form of channel energy or a variant presented here based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio. Once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. Variant channeling has the same area of effect, save DCs, uses per day, and other rules relating to channeling energy. Feats and abilities that modify or present alternative uses for channeled energy (such as Command Undead and Turn Undead) work normally with these variant channeling abilities.",
			"",
			"A variant channeling either modifies positive channeled energy when used to heal or modifies negative energy when used to harm. When using positive energy to heal, affected creatures gain only half the normal amount of healing but also receive a specific beneficial effect. When channeling negative energy to harm, affected creatures take only half the normal damage but take an additional penalty or harmful effect; a successful saving throw negates the additional penalty or effect but does not reduce the damage any further. Creatures that would normally ignore the effect of a particular channel (such as undead with respect to a positive energy channel used to heal) ignore the variant effect of that channel.",
			"",
			"Some variant channeling abilities are enhanced when used on particular creature types. Such channeling increases the normal healing or damage from channeled energy by 50% for that creature type, rather than the default half healing or damage for the alternative channeling. For example, a 7th-level cleric normally heals 4d6 points of damage with channeled positive energy; with the Nature alternative channeling, that cleric instead heals only half that amount (2d6) when channeling, but heals animals and fey an additional +50% over the unhalved value (4d6 + 50%).",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise stated, bonuses granted by a variant channeling are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. If an alternative channeled energy provides a \"channel bonus\" on rolls or statistics, the bonus is +1, increasing to +2 at cleric level 5 and for every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5). Likewise, a \"channel penalty\" is initially -1, increasing to -2 at cleric level 5 and every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of -5).",
			"",
			"A character who has the channel energy ability from a class other than cleric may use these variant channeling rules if the class's abilities are tied to serving a deity. For example, paladins can select alternative channeling abilities if they serve a deity, as can oracles with the Life mystery (as they serve many deities), but necromancer wizards cannot.",
			"",
			"The following is a list of example portfolios and the variant channeling abilities available to each.",

Unlike many of her deific counterparts, Urgathoa champions the shepherding and protection of haunts and possessing spirits, even to the danger and detriment of her own followers. The faithful of the Pallid Princess believe that by prolonging the torment and tortured existence of a spirit, they create something akin to a beautiful piece of artwork. In a similar manner, servants of Urgathoa view the possession of a mortal body by a deceased spirit as a blessing.",

They grant the character a benefit and a new ability to regain or increase the ability to regain either grit or panache.",
			"",
			"A dare can be taken in place of one of the bonus feats a gunslinger or a swashbuckler gains at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. A gunslinger or a swashbuckler can choose to have multiple dares, but can only pick one to be active each time she reaches 0 grit or panache points. Once chosen, the active dare cannot be changed until the gunslinger or swashbuckler reaches 0 grit or panache points again.",

			"**Desperate Evasion (Ex):** While this dare is active, you gain the evasion class feature. If you already have this class feature, while this dare is active you roll twice when making a Reflex saving throw and take the higher result. You regain 1 grit or panache point when you succeed at two Reflex saving throws while using this dare.",
			"",
			"**Frantically Nimble (Ex):** While this dare is active, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. You regain 1 grit or panache point when any enemy making a ranged or melee attack against you misses you three consecutive times. The attacks need not come from the same enemy.",
			"",
			"**Out for Blood (Ex):** While this dare is active, your critical threat range with firearms (for gunslingers) or light or onehanded piercing melee weapons (for swashbucklers) increases by 1 (20/x4 becomes 19-20/x4, 19-20/x2 becomes 18-20/x2, and so on). This effect does not stack with similar effects that modify a weapon's critical threat range.",

			"Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.",

Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger's Dodge (Ex)**: At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.",
			"",
			"**Quick Clear (Ex)**: At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger Initiative (Ex)**: At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.",
			"",
			"**Pistol-Whip (Ex)**: At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/??2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.",
			"",
			"**Utility Shot (Ex)**: At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.",
			"- Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.",
			"- Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.",
			"- Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Dead Shot (Ex)**: At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.",
			"",
			"**Startling Shot (Ex)**: At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.",
			"",
			"**Targeting (Ex)**: At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.",
			"- Arms: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.",
			"- Head: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Legs: On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.",
			"- Torso: Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20.",
			"- Wings: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.",
			"",
			"### 11th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Wound (Ex)**: At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",
			"",
			"**Expert Loading (Ex)**: At 11th level, whenever the gunslinger rolls a misfire with a gun that has the broken condition, she can spend 1 grit point to keep the gun from exploding, though it retains the broken condition.",
			"",
			"**Lightning Reload (Ex)**: At 11th level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can reload a single barrel of a one-handed or two-handed firearm as a swift action once per round. If she has the Rapid Reload feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a free action each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"### 15th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Evasive (Ex)**: At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the evasion, uncanny dodge, and improved uncanny dodge rogue class features. She uses her gunslinger level as her rogue level for improved uncanny dodge.",
			"",
			"**Menacing Shot (Ex)**: At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point, shoot a firearm into the air, and affect all living creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst as if they were subject to the fear spell. The DC of this effect is equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"**Slinger's Luck (Ex)**: At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend grit to reroll a saving throw or a skill check. It costs 2 grit points to reroll a saving throw, and 1 grit point to reroll a skill check. The gunslinger must take the result of the second roll, even if it is lower. The deed's cost cannot be reduced by the true grit class ability, the Signature Deed feat, or any other effect that reduces the amount of grit a deed costs.",
			"",
			"### 19th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Cheat Death (Ex)**: At 19th level, whenever the gunslinger is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, she can spend all of her remaining grit points (minimum 1) to instead be reduced to 1 hit point.",
			"",
			"**Death's Shot (Ex)**: At 19th level, when the gunslinger scores a critical hit, she can spend 1 grit point to deal normal damage, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. On a failed saving throw, the target dies. This is a death attack. Performing this deed does not allow the gunslinger to regain grit from confirming a critical hit or making a killing blow.",
			"",
			"**Stunning Shot (Ex)**: At 19th level, when a gunslinger hits a creature, she can spend 2 grit points to stun the creature for 1 round. The creature must make a Fortitude saving throw (the DC = 10 + 1/2 the gunslinger's level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier). If the creature fails, it is stunned for 1 round. Creatures that are immune to critical hits are also immune to this effect."

			"Swashbucklers and gunslingers perform impressive deeds through their grit and panache, but some are capable of truly spectacular acts known as renowned deeds. A swashbuckler or gunslinger (though not members of other classes) can select a renowned deed for her class upon reaching the class level listed in the deed's description. This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.",
			"",

			"**Thundering Shot (Ex)**: The gunslinger's shots explode with deafening reports. At 1st level, as a standard action the gunslinger can spend 1 point of grit and make a single ranged attack with a firearm. All creatures in a 15-foot cone, starting at the corner of the gunslinger's square closest to the target and extending directly toward the target, must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the gunslinger's class level + the gunslinger's Wisdom modifier) or be deafened for 1 minute. This deed replaces the *gunslinger's dodge* deed and one other 1st-level deed.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Gruesome Parry (Ex)**: Some gunslingers wield guns and blades in concert, readying a shot to unbalance attackers and then eviscerating their assailants. At 7th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point when she readies an action to make a ranged attack with a firearm against a creature that declares a melee attack against her. If she does, the readied ranged attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this readied attack hits, she gains a +4 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering attack, and she can make a single melee attack with a slashing or piercing weapon against the creature that attacked her; if this melee attack hits, it is considered to be a critical threat. This deed replaces the *dead shot* deed and one other 7th-level deed.",
			"",
			"### 15-Level Renowned Deed",
			"",
			"**Lethal Patience (Ex)**: While wild flurries of bullets are certainly effective at felling foes, veteran gunslingers appreciate the value of lining up the perfect shot. At 15th level, the gunslinger can spend 1 grit point to line up a shot against a target as a full-round action. On her next turn, she can make an attack against the target as a standard action, and if the attack hits, the attack is treated as a critical threat. This deed replaces the *slinger's luck* deed and one other 15th-level deed."

You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the -4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size."

Once you have activated spying touchsight, you can concentrate on it to spy on your target with any of your five senses (though your own body no longer benefits from the senses you project); the strand lasts as long you concentrate, though you can switch which senses you are projecting each round. A creature using see invisibility or a similar effect can notice the trailing strand of aether and follow it back to you. A creature can break your spying touchsight by dispelling it, but otherwise, the only way to break the strand is if one of you uses a teleportation effect, moves more than 1 mile from the other, or is completely blocked from the other in all directions (such as if one of you were inside a telekinetic sphere)."

In the latter case, the creature receives a Will save as per scrying (including bonuses and penalties based on connection and knowledge); a target that saves is immune to your greater watersense for 24 hours. In either case, an extremely thin funnel of water, lasting for 1 minute per kineticist level, carries light and sound to your location, where your target area or location appears in the water next to you and you can view it as if through a scrying sensor, allowing you to both see and hear the area immediately surrounding the other end of the funnel. In the case of a distance greater than 480 feet, the sound comes 1 round later than its corresponding visual information for every mile away you are (for instance, if you were 5 miles away, you would see your target start talking 5 rounds before you heard what it said). When you are tracking a creature, the funnel moves as best it can through the water to follow that creature, up to 150 feet per round, but the target can escape by simply moving away from the water. If you also possess the voice of the wind wild talent, you can use its message effect to send your voice through the funnel with a delay of 1 round per mile. This wild talent is a divination and scrying effect."

The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick."

By adhering to his vow's tenets, the monk's ki pool increases by the amount listed in the vow's description. Every vow comes with a penalty or limitation to offset this increase in ki. A monk can take a vow at any level, but it does not add to his ki pool until he gains a ki pool as a class feature. A monk who takes a vow never gains the still mind class feature, even if he abandons all his vows.",
			"",
			"If a monk knowingly and willingly breaks his vow, his ki pool is reduced to 0 (as if he had spent all of his ki points) and he cannot replenish his pool or use abilities that require ki or a ki pool until he has redeemed himself. Redemption requires a recommitment to his vow accompanied by an atonement spell. After the redemption, the monk's normal ki pool (without the bonus from the vow) returns. If he upholds the previously broken vow for a full month, his ki pool regains the additional points from taking the vow, and he can decide whether to continue with his vow or forgo his vow without penalty. Once a monk forgoes a vow in this fashion, she can never gain a ki point bonus from that vow.",

If a monk violates a vow, he suffers the loss of ki described above; redemption means the monk regains the extra ki from his unbroken vows, but the extra ki from the broken vow does not return until he finishes the month-long commitment (in effect, violating one vow does not have an effect on the other vows once the monk redeems himself)."

					"*Talons of the Dragon (Su):* You fight with the fearsome talons of dragonkind. You can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to perform two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. Each of these attacks deals an amount of slashing damage equal to 1d4 (1d3 if you are Small) + your Strength modifier. At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming DR. At 7th level, the damage die increases by 1 step, to deal an amount of slashing damage equal to 1d6 (1d4 if you are Small) + your Strength modifier.

					"",
					"*Wings of the Dragon (Su):* Like the great dragons, you can take to the skies and terrorize opponents from above. As a swift action, you can manifest leathery dragon wings that grant you a fly speed of 60 feet (clumsy maneuverability). At 10th level, your maneuverability increases to poor. You can use these wings for 1 minute per day for each oracle level you have. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your oracle level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",

At 11th level, while using this ability, you can walk on liquid as if using water walk, and you are immune to damage caused by proximity to (but not immersion in) lava, magma, and similarly heated stone. You can use this ability for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. Oracles with the lame oracle curse cannot select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Reforged Arms (Su):* The forge's fire turns earthen ore into useful metal, and you can hone weapons in the same way. As a standard action, you can touch a metal or stone weapon and transform it into a masterwork equivalent if it is not already a masterwork or magical weapon. At 3rd level, you can also have the weapon act as if it were made of alchemical silver or cold iron (your choice when you activate this ability) for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus, though this bonus does not stack with any enhancement bonus the weapon already has. At 11th level, you can have the weapon act as if it were made of adamantine rather than of alchemical silver or cold iron. This effect lasts for 1 minute per oracle level, and you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Roiling Soil (Su):* Combining your mastery of earth and water, you shape the battlefield in your favor, bending the terrain to benefit you and your allies and hinder any who might oppose you. The ground within 5 feet per 2 oracle levels you have shifts and rolls unpredictably; if you use this ability underwater, the surrounding waters churn. This area moves with you, and you and your allies are unaffected by the roiling terrain. Other creatures can move within the area at half speed with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means they stop moving for the round, while failure by 5 or more causes them to fall prone; if underwater, creatures gain the effects of being off-balance instead of falling prone. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your oracle level, and you can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Sweeping Impact (Ex):* You can shake the earth and buffet foes with the roaring force of wind you draw from the Elemental Plane of Air. When performing a bull rush as part of a charge, if you push the target at least 5 feet, you can attempt a trip combat maneuver against that creature as a free action. You are not tripped if you fail this check by 10 or more. At 7th level, you can bull rush or trip creatures two size categories larger than you; for every 4 levels you gain beyond 7th, you can bull rush or trip creatures an additional size category larger.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, your body undergoes an internal elemental shift, and you become a living conduit of the Elemental Planes. Your external appearance remains the same, although you may take on certain cosmetic elemental traits (such as smoldering hair or pebble-like skin). You become immune to critical hits and precision damage such as from sneak attacks. You no longer need to breathe, eat, or sleep."

					"*Assumed Form (Sp):* You can change your appearance at will, as disguise self with a caster level equal to your oracle level. At 7th level, you can choose to actually transform, which works the same way but counts as a polymorph effect instead of an illusion and doesn't allow a Will save to disbelieve. At 11th level, the ability lasts until you dismiss it or use it again, allowing you to even keep it active while you sleep. At 15th level, when you use this ability as a polymorph effect, you can gain the size bonus to your ability scores and additional racial abilities as if using alter self.",
					"",
					"*Desire Sight (Sp):* As a standard action, you can learn the desires of any creature you can see within 100 feet, as if you had concentrated until the third round of detect desires. As usual for detect desires, the target can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. You can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th.",
					"",
					"*Forgotten Presence (Sp):* Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a creature to forget that you were present for the last minute per oracle level, including forgetting all actions you took during that time, unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier). Effects such as modify memory can restore the lost memories. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Gossip Guru (Sp):* You sit in a web of intrigue like a spider, subtly tracing the course of rumors and gossip in order to understand the ties that bind those around you. You can use the rumormonger spell once per day as a spell-like ability, using your oracle level as your caster level. Each time you do so, it ends the duration of any previous activation. At 11th level, you can use this ability three times per day, and at 15th level, you can use it at will, but regardless, each use still ends the duration of any previous activation. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Hidden Magic (Su):* You gain the Conceal Spell feat as a bonus feat without needing to meet the prerequisites. At 7th level, you can also hide your use of spell trigger items using the Conceal Spell feat, though onlookers receive a +2 bonus on their skill checks to pierce your subterfuge. At 11th level, you can even hide the use of spell completion items using the Conceal Spell feat, though in this case, onlookers receive a +5 bonus on their skill checks to pierce your subterfuge.",
					"",
					"*Mirrored Retreat (Su):* Once per day as a full-round action, your form ripples and releases seven illusory duplicates, as mirror image, and then you can move up to your speed in any direction, while the duplicates move in seven other directions. The duplicates continue to retreat in their chosen direction, avoiding walls and other barriers but unable to open doors or interact with objects. The duplicates last for 1 minute per oracle level or until they take damage (they have the same AC as your touch AC and the same Reflex save as you, and they are immune to effects that allow a Fortitude or Will save). You can use this ability an additional time per day at 11th level and every 4 levels thereafter. This is a figment effect. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Poetic Vengeance (Su):* You constantly plot and scheme to take your revenge against those who wrong you. Once per day as an immediate action, after an enemy successfully affects you with an attack (whether with a spell, a physical attack, or any other sort of attack), you can force the enemy to take half the effects of its own attack unless it succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier). Any damage from the attack is halved, and non-damaging effects have a 50% chance to apply. If the non-damaging effect has a DC, the enemy receives a saving throw against it, at either the DC of the original effect or the DC of this ability, whichever is lower. At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day, and at 20th level you can use it three times per day.",
					"",
					"*Tracer Touch (Sp):* Once per day, you can touch a creature or object and plant a scrying sensor on it, as if you had cast vicarious view. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Veiled Venom (Sp):* The powers of intrigue veil your poisons and magic items from magical scrutiny. As a standard action, you can touch an object, granting it the benefits of the spells magic aura and obscure poison. You can use this ability at will, but each time you do, the effects of any previous use end.",
					"",
					"*Whispered Glimpses (Su):* The whispers of intrigue sing to you with glimpses of insight into others' presence and motives, granting you greater awareness than your own senses could manage. You can add your Charisma modifier instead of your Wisdom bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of intrigue. You can apply Silent Spell or Still Spell to any spell you cast without increasing the level or casting time. You do not need to possess these feats to use this ability."

Creatures affected by either spell become listless and pale, appearing dead to observers (DC 20 Heal or Perception check to determine the creature is not undead). Affected creatures are slow to take any action unless you specifically direct them to do so. They are not mindless or helpless, however, and defend themselves if attacked.",
					"",

You also gain a +2 bonus on Perception and Sense Motive checks made against spirit creatures, such as outsiders, fey, and incorporeal undead. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +4.",
					"",

Instead of the spell's normal damage, you make a full attack, using your Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier, against the victim's touch AC. You deal 1d10 damage for each successful hit. You must be at least 11th level before selecting this revelation.",

					"",
					"*Spiritual Defense (Sp):* Your chanting grants protection against your enemies.

					"",
					"*Summon Nature's Spirits (Sp):* Once per day, as a standard action, you may cast a summon monster spell of a level up to the highest level you can cast.

					"",
					"*Combat Healer (Su):* As the battle mystery revelation (Nethys: Provided here for your convenience.) Whenever you cast a cure spell (a spell with \"cure\" in its name), you can cast it as a swift action, as if using the Quicken Spell feat, by expending two spell slots.

Any undead creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level.

You may remain in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.",
					"",
					"*Enhanced Cures (Su):* Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of life with this revelation may cast cure light wounds to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.",
					"",

Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).",

					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce you below 1 in any ability score.

Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your Dexterity.",
					"",
					"*Spontaneous Symbology:* Your knowledge of the secret history of the world has unveiled the mysterious symbols that govern reality.

					"",
					"*Armor Mastery (Ex):* You become more maneuverable while wearing armor. You can move at your normal speed in medium armor that is made of metal. This does not grant proficiency in armor. At 5th level, whenever you are wearing metal armor, you reduce the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 1. At 10th level, and again at 15th level, these bonuses increase by 1.",
					"",
					"*Dance of the Blades (Ex):* Your base speed increases by 10 feet. At 7th level, you gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a metal weapon in any round in which you move at least 10 feet. This bonus increases by +1 at 11th level, and every four levels thereafter. At 11th level, as a move action, you can maneuver your weapon to create a shield of whirling steel around yourself until the start of your next turn; non-incorporeal melee and ranged attacks against you have a 20% miss chance while the shield is active. You must be wielding a metal weapon to use this ability.",

					"*Iron Constitution (Su):* You gain a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves. At 7th level, and again at 14th level, this bonus increases by +1.",
					"",
					"*Iron Skin (Sp):* Once per day, your skin hardens and takes on the appearance of iron, granting you DR 10/adamantine.

You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Iron Weapon (Su):* You can create a melee simple or martial weapon that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your size and entirely made of metal (even if it would normally include non-metal parts, such as a spear's shaft) but functions as if it were a normal weapon of its type. You are considered proficient with this weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp. At 3rd level, the blade is made of cold iron. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the blade gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 11th level, the blade is made of adamantine. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Riddle of Steel (Su):* Your sacred bond with metal gives you insight into its form and function. Once per day, you may spend 10 minutes meditating on the structure of a piece of unworked metal or ore to gain a +5 insight bonus on your next Craft check to make something using that metal.",
					"",
					"*Rusting Grasp (Sp):* Once per day as a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that rusts iron, as the rusting grasp spell. At 11th level, and every four levels thereafter, you can use this ability an additional time per day. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Skill at Arms (Ex):* You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and heavy armor.",
					"",
					"*Steel Scarf (Su):* As a swift action, you can harden a scarf, sleeve, cloak, or other piece of your clothing into something as hard as steel that stretches out to be up to 30 feet long. You can then strike outward with it as if it were a weapon making a melee attack. For the purpose of this ability, you are proficient with this weapon. You can use the weapon to perform combat maneuvers. Make a melee attack roll against a creature within 30 feet; you may use Weapon Finesse with this attack. If you hit, the weapon deals 1d8 points of slashing damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. After this attack, the clothing returns to its normal length and hardness. You do not threaten an area with this weapon and cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Vision in Iron (Sp):* You can use any piece of polished metal at least the size of a dagger as a scrying device, as if using the spell scrying. At 15th level, this functions like greater scrying. You can scry for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level; these rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of iron and steel. You gain the benefits of Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Focus, and Improved Critical with any one metal weapon that you are proficient with. Your armor is like a second skin to you-while wearing metal armor you are proficient with, the armor's maximum Dexterity bonus increases by +5 and you take no armor check penalty. In addition, any metal you create with your magic (such as wall of iron) has its hardness increased by +10."

The target takes 1d6 points of damage per two levels you possess (maximum 10d6). You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage you deal. You can't gain more than the target's current hit points + the target's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the subject). The temporary hit points last a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier. The target receives a Fortitude save to halve the damage (and the temporary hit points you gain).

					"",
					"*Natural Divination (Ex):* You can read the entrails of a freshly killed animal or humanoid to gain an insight bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw. Alternatively, by observing and interpreting the flights of birds, you may apply a +10 competence bonus on any one skill check. Finally, by charting marks in dirt or stone, or observing the behavior of sand when thrown into the wind, you gain a +4 insight bonus on one initiative check. These bonuses must be used during the next 24 hours and you must declare you are using the bonus before the check or save is made. Making a natural divination takes 10 minutes. You may use natural divination (in any combination) once per day plus one additional time per day for every four oracle levels you have attained.",
					"",
					"*Nature's Whispers (Ex):* You have become so attuned to the whispers of the natural world, from the croaking of frogs to the groaning of great boulders, that your surroundings constantly keep you preternaturally aware of danger. You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.",
					"",
					"*Speak with Animals (Ex):* Choose a specific kind of animal (eagle, fox, dog, and so on). You gain the ability to converse with that type of animal as if you were under the effects of speak with animal. You gain the ability to communicate with an additional kind of animal for every 3 oracle levels you have attained.",
					"",
					"*Spirit of Nature (Su):* When in a natural setting, whenever you are reduced to negative hit points, you automatically stabilize.

At 15th level, you gain fast healing 3 for 1d4 rounds when reduced to negative hit points.",
					"",
					"*Transcendental Bond (Su):* You become so attuned to the common spirit shared by all living things that you can use it to communicate with allies. You may communicate with your allies for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level as if using telepathic bond. You may designate a number of creatures as your ally equal to your Charisma modifier. Designating a creature is a standard action that requires a touch. At 10th level, you may use this bond to cast a touch spell on a designated ally once per day.",
					"",
					"*Undo Artifice (Sp):* At 11th-level, you gain the ability to reduce a nonliving item to its component parts, essentially erasing the hand of artifice and rendering the item into a pile of raw natural materials. This effect acts as the spell polymorph any object, working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, it cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect. Magic items receive a circumstance bonus on this save equal to +1 for every 5,000 gp in the item's value. You may use undo artifice a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* At 20th level, you have discovered the intrinsic secrets of life itself, granting you incredible control over your own body. Once per day, you can surround yourself with an organic cocoon as a full-round action. While enclosed in the cocoon, you are considered helpless. Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to plant, animal, or humanoid, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Each time the transformation is made, you are cleansed of all poisons or diseases, are restored to full hit points, and heal all ability damage. You must select a new type every time the transformation is made."

The target receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful mental prying. Those who fail this save are wracked with pain, and take 1d4 points of damage per oracle level you possess. After successfully attacking with this ability, you can use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories and then attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim's skill bonus. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in your mind for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. Treat the knowledge gained as if you had used detect thoughts.

					"*Planar Infusion (Su):* As a standard action once per day, you can cause a 20-foot-spread to gain either the mildly chaotic-aligned or mildly evil-aligned planar trait for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Lawful creatures in a chaotic-aligned area take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, as do good creatures in an evil-aligned area.

These have a spell level equal to their sorcerer/wizard spell level. You can add only illusion spells from the shadow subschool or spells with the darkness descriptor to your list of spells known in this manner. Each time you gain an oracle level after taking this revelation, you can choose to replace one of these spells for a new appropriate spell on the sorcerer/wizard spell list.",
					"",
					"*Living Shadow (Sp):* Your body dissolves, and you become a living shadow. This ability functions as gaseous form. At 14th level, this ability functions as shadow body instead, except you also gain DR 10/magic and become immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits as if also using gaseous form.

					"*Shadow Armament (Su):* You can create a quasi-real simple or martial masterwork weapon appropriate for your current size. You are considered proficient with this weapon. The first time you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature can attempt a Will save to disbelieve; failure means the weapon deals damage normally, while success means the creature takes only 1 point of damage from the weapon's attacks.

					"",
					"*Shadow Projection (Su):* You infuse your life force and psyche into your shadow, causing it to separate from your body and act as an independent creature. This ability functions as shadow projection except as follows. Your shadow has the outsider type and the phantom subtype instead of the undead type. As a result, this ability does not have the evil descriptor and your shadow cannot be turned or affected as undead (though it can be affected as an outsider). You can use this ability for a number of hours per day equal to half your oracle level. These hours don't need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-hour increments. Your shadow's hit points are not replenished between uses, although your shadow can be healed in the same manner as any other outsider. When this ability isn't in use, any healing done to you also heals your shadow for an equal amount. You must be at least 7th level to choose this revelation.",
					"",

At 7th level, a creature that fails its save against this revelation becomes sickened for 1d4 hours in addition to taking fire damage.

At 13th level, creatures that end their turn adjacent to your luminous form are blinded for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude reduces to 1 round).

At 10th level, you become immune to magical diseases, gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against poisons, and only need to sleep half as long to rest or recover from fatigue or exhaustion. At 15th level, you become immune to poison and fatigue. You lose these benefits if you fail to spend at least 4 hours in sunlight in a 24-hour period.",
					"",
					"*Solar Wind (Su):* You can unleash a blast of searing wind at a single target within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Your solar wind deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 for every 2 oracle levels you possess. At 7th level, you can also knock an opponent back, treating the blast as a bull rush combat maneuver that uses your caster level + your Charisma modifier in place of your CMB. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",

					"",
					"*Sun Stride:* You can travel between areas of natural sunlight as if by means of a dimension door spell. This ability does not function in areas of less than bright light, though it does work within the area of a daylight spell. At 5th level, you can sun stride up to 40 feet per day; this can be a single stride of 40 feet or four strides of 10 feet each. At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the distance you can sun stride doubles (80 feet at 9th level, 160 feet at 13th level, and 32 feet at 17th level).

					"*Sungazer (Sp):* You can study the sun and gaze upon any place its light touches. You can use clairaudience/clairvoyance as a spell-like ability, but only for visual observation and you can only place your sensor in places currently being touched by sunlight. At 10th level, you can instead use scrying to observe any area touched by sunlight. At 15th level, you can use greater scrying instead. You must be at least 5th level to select this revelation.

At 14th level, you can affect Large or smaller nonmagical light sources (such as bonfires) and magical light sources up to the size of an everburning torch.

					"",
					"*Eldritch Scar (Su):* Once per day when you damage a creature with a spell you cast, you may, as a swift action, cause your magic to leave an eldritch scar upon that creature. An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event (see page 13) of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse's level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event-an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Magic Penetration (Ex):* You gain a +2 bonus on any caster level check made to dispel or remove a magic effect (such as when using the dispel magic or remove curse spell). If you are 9th level or higher, the bonus increases to +4.",

You may use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every 5 levels. At 15th level, you can change a spell to deal sonic damage, though the damage is halved. At 20th level, you can change a spell to deal force damage, though the damage is halved. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Primal Mastery (Su):* Whenever a spell you cast triggers a primal magic event (see page 13), or whenever you use a rod of wonder, roll d% twice when generating the result. You may pick which of the two results actually occurs. You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist primal magic events or magical effects caused by a rod of wonder.",
					"",
					"*Trigger Primal Magic Event (Su):* Once per day as an immediate action, you can cause a spellcaster (including yourself ) within 30 feet to trigger a primal magic event as the spell is being cast. At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see page 13). At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option. You must be at least 9th level before selecting this revelation.",

If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free action.

The range increment for a rock is 20 feet, and you can hurl it up to 5 range increments. Damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a Medium creature or 2d3 for a Small creature, plus 1-1/2 your Strength bonus.",
					"",
					"*Shard Explosion (Su):* As a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
					"",
					"*Steelbreaker Skin (Su):* As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed. Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the weapon takes an amount of damage equal to your oracle level. This ability does not prevent the weapon from harming you unless the damage destroys the weapon attacking you. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 minute/level.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, any weapon that you wield deals +1d6 points of acid damage, similar to how a flaming weapon operates.",

Whenever the target would roll to deal damage with an attack or spell, it deals the minimum amount of damage. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 11th level and 15th level. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Enhanced Cures (Su):* As per the life oracle mystery revelation of the same name.",
					"",
					"*Enhanced Inflictions (Su):* You recognize that harming your enemies is sometimes the only way to help your allies, and so your wrath is particularly fierce. Whenever you cast an inflict spell (a spell with the word \"inflict\" in the name), the maximum amount of damage dealt by the spell is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of succor with this revelation can cast inflict light wounds to deal 1d8+11 points of damage instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.",
					"",
					"*Perfect Aid (Ex):* You can effortlessly give aid to your allies, whether that means providing them with help attacking or defending them in the heat of combat. You gain Bodyguard as a bonus feat, and whenever you use the aid another action to provide a bonus on attack rolls or to AC to one of your allies, the bonus you provide increases by 1. This bonus increases by 1 at 4th level and every 5 oracle levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5 at 19th level). It doesn't stack with other feats or class features that improve the bonus you provide when using the aid another action. This revelation also counts as the Combat Expertise feat, but only for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of the Swift Aid feat and any feat that lists Swift Aid as a prerequisite.",
					"",
					"*Pitiful Foe (Su):* You can temporarily curse one target within 30 feet as a standard action, making it pitiful and ineffective in battle. While this ability is in effect, the target is never considered to be threatening you or your allies, even if it is armed and you or your allies are standing in a square into which it can make a melee attack. If the target rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll or saving throw, the attack or saving throw is not an automatic success (as would be normal) and whether it is successful is instead determined normally. Additionally, the target automatically fails all rolls to confirm critical hits. This curse lasts for 1 round per 2 oracle levels you have (minimum 1). A successful Will saving throw negates this effect. This is a mind-affecting curse effect. You can use this revelation once per day, plus one additional time at 7th and 15th levels.",
					"",
					"*Shell of Succor (Su):* You can surround an ally with bolstering energies that supplement its health and grant it extra vigor. With a touch from you (a standard action), one creature gains a ward of restorative energy, granting it a number of temporary hit points equal to your Charisma bonus + 1d6 per 2 oracle levels you have (maximum 10d6). These temporary hit points last 1 minute per oracle level you have.",
					"The target always loses these temporary hit points first, even before other temporary hit points (including those from, for example, the purify body spell on page 9 or a kineticist's force ward defense wild talent). If an attack deals fewer points of damage than the target has as temporary hit points from shell of succor, it still reduces those temporary hit points but otherwise counts as a miss for the purpose of abilities that trigger on a hit or a miss.",

					"",
					"*Spirit Boost (Su):* As per the life oracle mystery revelation of the same name.",
					"",
					"*Teamwork Mastery (Ex, Sp):* You are an immaculate team player and can distribute your team-based insights to your allies with a touch. This revelation grants you a bonus teamwork feat. You must meet the teamwork feat's prerequisites, if any. Additionally, you can touch an ally as a standard action to confer upon it the benefits of any one teamwork feat that you have. This effect persists for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1). You can confer the benefits of a teamwork feat you have a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* You become a beacon of aid and assistance to your allies and those you deem worthy of receiving your succoring magical benefits. You can apply any one of the following metamagic feats to any spell you cast that targets one or more of your allies without increasing the level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell. You do not need to have these feats to use this ability, and you can use this ability any number of times per day on any spell that can be affected by the listed metamagic feats."

At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take any one of the results.",
					"",
					"*Time Flicker (Su):* As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the blur spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.
