			"Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain *advanced armor training*, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor's armor check penalty and improve its maximum Dexterity bonus. Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor's check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum Dexterity bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option. If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.",

The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total base attack bonus (including his base attack bonus gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill's usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.",

While wearing the selected type of armor, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor's armor bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light armor, +4 for medium armor, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the armor bonus doesn't increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor's base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options.

If the fighter is 19th level and has the armor mastery class feature, these DR values increase by 5.

			"The fighter can also remove his armor in the same amount of time that it takes him to don his armor hastily. He can even remove sections of armor to escape grapples and similar grasping hindrances. Whenever the fighter attempts a combat maneuver check, an Escape Artist check, or a Strength check to escape from an effect that reduces or restricts his ability to move or act, he can reduce the armor bonus of any armor that he is wearing by up to half his armor's base armor bonus. If he does so, he gains a bonus on his check equal to the amount by which he reduced his armor's armor bonus. Multiple uses of this ability cannot reduce the armor's armor bonus below half its base armor bonus, and the reduction to the armor's armor bonus lasts until the fighter recovers and dons the removed pieces of armor.",

Whether using his armor as leverage against a grappling foe or using its weight to help him stop a bull rush, a fighter can use his armor to protect him from the chosen combat maneuver. While wearing armor or wielding a shield, the fighter gains a bonus to his CMD against the chosen combat maneuver. The bonus is +1 if he's wearing light armor, +2 if he's wearing medium armor, and +3 if he's wearing heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum at 19th level of +5 for light armor, +6 for medium armor, and +7 for heavy armor.

She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack.

She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days.

This marking is not magical, and if it is defaced or erased, it can no longer be used by the rogue (the marking can be hidden from view without removing its usability, including painting over the marking in question). Once placed, the rogue can use word of recall once per day to return to the shrine.

Though the Runes of Wealth is focused primarily on spells, Haphrama included a remarkable appendix of ingenious theories about transmuting the properties of magical armor and weapons, from which the magical process of anointings has been developed over the centuries. Alchemists can choose any of the following anointings in place of a normal discovery. An alchemist can use any of the anointings he knows a total number of times per day equal to 3 + his alchemist level. Unless an anointing specifies otherwise, all anointings require a standard action to apply (this provokes attacks of opportunity) and last for 1 minute per alchemist level.",

Clerics with the artifice domain can select an anointing in place of their 8th-level domain ability. Transmuter wizards can gain anointings in place of wizard bonus feats. Witches with transformation patrons can gain a single anointing in place of a major hex.

			"Wizards spend much of their lives seeking deeper truths, hunting knowledge as if it were life itself. The wizard's power is not necessarily the spells he wields; spells are merely the outward, most visible manifestation of that power. A wizard's true power is in his fierce intelligence, his dedication to his craft, and his ability to peel back the surface truths of reality to understand the fundamental underpinnings of existence. A wizard spends much of his time researching spells, and would rather find an undiscovered library than a room full of gold. A wizard need not be a reclusive bookworm, but he must have a burning curiosity for the unknown. Arcane discoveries are the results of this obsession with magic. A wizard can learn an arcane discovery in place of a regular feat or wizard bonus feat.",

Whenever you cast a summon monster spell, you can summon two creatures from a single list 1 or more levels lower than the level of the spell.

			"**Infectious Charms** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 18](source/magical_marketplace)): Your charms are so smooth that they're contagious. Anytime you target and successfully affect a single creature with a charm or compulsion spell and that creature is within 30 feet of another opponent, your spell has a chance of affecting the second creature as well. As a swift action immediately after affecting a creature with a charm or compulsion spell, you can cause the spell to carry over to the nearest creature within 30 feet. The spell behaves in all ways as though its new target were the original target of the spell. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ioun Bond** ([People of the River pg. 9](source/people_of_the_river)): You can form an arcane bond with an ioun stone. If you choose this arcane discovery at 1st level, you gain a dull gray ioun stone as a bonded object at no cost. A bonded ioun stone must be orbiting your head to have effect. At 12th level, you can turn a bonded dull gray ioun stone into another kind of ioun stone as if you possessed the Craft Wondrous Item feat; if you die or replace a bonded ioun stone that has been transformed in this way, the stone reverts to a dull gray ioun stone. You must have chosen a bonded object as your arcane bond to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Knowledge Is Power (Ex)** ([People of the River pg. 9](source/people_of_the_river)): Your understanding of physical forces gives you power over them. You add your Intelligence modifier on combat maneuver checks and to your CMD. You also add your Intelligence modifier on Strength checks to break or lift objects.",
			"",
			"**Multimorph (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 86](source/ultimate_magic)): Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells. When you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool on yourself, you may expend 1 minute of the spell's duration as a standard action to assume another form allowed by the spell. You can do this as often as you like, subject to the duration of the spell. You must be at least a 5th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Observant Illusion (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 23](source/spymaster's_handbook)): You can project your senses into any ongoing figment or shadow illusion you create with a spell of at least 3rd level. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift or move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to choose this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Opposition Research** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 86](source/ultimate_magic)): By completing strenuous studies, you have broken through the mental barriers that made it hard for you to prepare spells from one of your opposition schools. Select one wizard opposition school; preparing spells of this school now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer have the -4 Spellcraft penalty for crafting items from that school. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Preperation** ([Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 3](source/magic_tactics_toolbox)): You have learned a limited way to access psychic magic. When you first prepare your spells for the day, you can prepare one spell as a psychic spell. This spell must be at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wizard spell you can cast, and takes a slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level. When you cast this spell, it operates as a psychic spell, including using emotional and thought components in place of somatic and verbal components, and only having expensive material components.",
			"",
			"**Resilient Illusions** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 18](source/magical_marketplace)): You are able to conjure illusions so lifelike that they defy disbelief. Anytime a creature tries to disbelieve one of your illusion effects, make a caster level check. Treat the illusion's save DC as its normal DC or the result of the caster level check, whichever is higher. You must be at least an 8th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Split Slot** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 86](source/ultimate_magic)): Once per day when you prepare spells, you may treat any one of your open spell slots as if it were two spell slots that were two spell levels lower. For example, a 9th-level wizard can split a 5th-level slot into two 3rd-level slots, preparing fireball and lightning bolt in those 3rd-level slots. For all purposes, the two lower-level slots are treated as that lower level (so the split 5th-level slot used for a fireball has a DC as if it were in a normal 3rd-level slot). Splitting a 2nd-level slot lets you prepare two additional cantrips (which you can cast over and over, just like normally prepared cantrips). This discovery has no effect on cantrips or 1st-level spells. You may select this discovery multiple times; each time you select it, you may split another spell slot when you prepare spells. You cannot split a slot that you created by splitting a higher-level slot. You must be at least 5th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Staff-Like Wand** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 87](source/ultimate_magic)): Your research has unlocked a new power in conjunction with using a wand. Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if it's higher than the caster level of the wand. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard and must have the Craft Staff feat to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Steward of the Great Beyond** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): Whenever a creature attempts to use a teleportation effect or summon a creature within 30 feet of you, you may attempt to block the effect. Make an opposed caster level check (1d20 + caster level) as an immediate action. If the check succeeds, the spell or effect fails and is wasted; otherwise, it is unaffected. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time for every 5 wizard levels you possess beyond 10th. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Time Stutter (Sp)** ([People of the River pg. 9](source/people_of_the_river)): You can briefly step out of time, pausing the world around you. This ability acts as the time stop spell, except that you gain only 1 round of apparent time. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time for every 5 wizard levels you possess beyond 10th. You must be at least a 10th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**True Name (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 87](source/ultimate_magic)): Your researches into ancient tomes and your inquisitions of bound spirits have led you to one of the best-hidden secrets of the multiverse: the true name of an outsider-the name that defines the very essence of the creature and that gives the speaker control over the being. This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear.",
			"",
			"If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability.",
			"",
			"It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.",
			"",
			"You may select this discovery multiple times. Each time you select this discovery, it applies to a different, specific outsider. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard to select this discovery. If you select this discovery at 15th level or higher, the creature may have up to 18 Hit Dice and the call acts as greater planar binding instead of planar binding.",
			"",
			"**Werewolf Shape** ([Blood of the Moon pg. 25](source/blood_of_the_moon)): When you cast beast shape IV or shapechange, you can choose to take the shape of a werewolf in addition to the other shapes available. While in werewolf shape, you gain all the effects of the werewolf template instead of the spell's normal benefits. You act in all respects as a natural lycanthrope for the duration of the spell, including the ability to inflict the curse of lycanthropy using the spell's save DC. You must be at least a 15th-level wizard to select this arcane discovery.",
			"",
			"**Yuelral's Blessing** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): You cast any spells that appear on both the wizard and druid spell lists at +1 caster level and with +1 to the save DC. In addition, you may replace the material component of any arcane spell with gems of the same value. You must be at least a 5th-level wizard to select this discovery."

This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school's spell list (see Chapter 5). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.",

Rather than directly opposing each other, these five elements counter and generate each other in a wheel-like formation: wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood. Similar to the four types of elemental wizard schools, some wizards specialize in the schools of magic based on metal or wood. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school's spell list (see below). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school-in the case of the five-element system, he must choose the element that overcomes his element as his opposition element (so a metal elementalist must select fire as his opposition school because fire overcomes metal).

Focused blessings are to blessings what subdomains are to domains; each focused blessing corresponds to a specific subdomain, and a warpriest can select a focused blessing only if his deity could grant the corresponding subdomain (and associated domain) to a cleric. For instance, a warpriest can select the Resurrection focused blessing only if his deity's list of subdomains includes the Resurrection subdomain.",

If a warpriest selects a focused blessing, he cannot select its associated blessing as his other blessing choice (in effect, the focused blessing replaces its associated blessing). A focused blessing is treated as equivalent to its associated blessing for any effect or prerequisite based on blessings. A focused blessing can be selected by a character of any class that grants the warpriest's blessing class feature, provided his deity allows the focused blessing (subject to the GM's discretion).",

			"If a warpriest with a focused blessing or blessings also has levels in a class that grants cleric domains, the associated blessing or blessings must match the domain selected by that class. Subject to the GM's discretion, the warpriest can change his previously selected associated blessings or domains to make all of them conform.",

			"| Bloodline | Description |",
			"| --- | --- |",
			"| [Aberrant](bloodragerbloodline/aberrant) | There is a taint in your blood that is both alien and bizarre. When you bloodrage, this manifests in peculiar and terrifying ways. |",
			"| [Abyssal](bloodragerbloodline/abyssal) | Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into the essence of your bloodline. While it doesn't manifest in all of your kin, in those moments when you're bloodraging, you embody its terrifying presence. |",
			"| [Aquatic](bloodragerbloodline/aquatic) | The anger in your blood rises from the ocean depths, seeded by descent from undersea empires, creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages, or something deeper still. |",
			"| [Arcane](bloodragerbloodline/arcane) | While others of your kin may be powerful wizards and sorcerers, the eldritch nature of the blood coursing through your veins transforms you into a spell-breaking terror. |",
			"| [Black Blood](bloodragerbloodline/black_blood) | Contact with the black blood of Orv-by you or one of your ancestors-transformed your bloodline. This necromantic taint in your blood mutates you into something peculiar. |",
			"| [Celestial](bloodragerbloodline/celestial) | By way of a celestial ancestor or divine intervention, the blood of angels fills your body with a holy potency, granting you a majestic visage and angelic powers when you enter your bloodrage. |",
			"| [Destined](bloodragerbloodline/destined) | Your bloodline is destined for great things. When you bloodrage, you exude a greatness that makes all but the most legendary creatures seem lesser. |",
			"| [Draconic](bloodragerbloodline/draconic) | At some point in your family's history, a dragon interbred with your bloodline. Now, the sublime monster's ancient power fuels your bloodrage. |",
			"| [Elemental](bloodragerbloodline/elemental) | The power of the elements resides in you, and at times you can hardly control its fury. This influence comes either from an elemental outsider in your family history or from a moment when you or your ancestors were exposed to a powerful elemental force or cataclysm. |",
			"| [Fey](bloodragerbloodline/fey) | One of your ancestors was fey, or the fey realm somehow intermixed with your bloodline. It affects your bloodrage in tricky and surprising ways. |",
			"| [Hag](bloodragerbloodline/hag) | Hags interbreed with other races frequently, and those children who escape their grasp may pass their heritage on to later generations before it reemerges. The potent humors that accompany hag blood are better suited to a bloodrager's ferocity than to traditional spellcasting. |",
			"| [Infernal](bloodragerbloodline/infernal) | The Pit lives in your blood. Maybe one of your ancestors was seduced by the powers of Hell or made a deal with a devil. Either way, its corruption seethes within your lineage. |",
			"| [Kyton](bloodragerbloodline/kyton) | In the shadowy land of Nidal, the influence of Zon-Kuthon and the Midnight Lord's favored servants-the kytons' taints the land and its inhabitants. Just as an eclipse drives animals wild, so too does the darkness unleash a madness from deep within you. |",
			"| [Martyred](bloodragerbloodline/martyred) | One of your ancestors paid the ultimate price for her beliefs. This distant relative martyred herself out of a devout dedication to some specific cause, and that sacrifice has infused you with power that you can use for good-or for ill. When you bloodrage, an inspiring fury conjures echoes of your forebear's incredible determination and selfless dedication, both offering you protection and amplifying your ability to punish any who dare incur your wrath. |",
			"| [Medusa](bloodragerbloodline/medusa) | No magical creature is more iconic in Iblydan lore than the [medusa](monster/medusa). Perhaps your lineage traces back to a medusa, or an ancestor survived a medusa's petrifying gaze and was forever changed by the experience. However the medusa's influence entered your bloodline, when you bloodrage, you gain fearsome and ancient powers. |",
			"| [Naga](bloodragerbloodline/naga) | The blood of the powerful, serpentine aberrations known as nagas runs through your veins, fueling your bloodrage. |",
			"| [Phoenix](bloodragerbloodline/phoenix) | The flames of the phoenix burn brightly within your soul, filling you with an inextinguishable vitality that can withstand the most harrowing of assaults. |",
			"| [Salamander](bloodragerbloodline/salamander) | Salamanders are fierce warriors and master smiths, and you wield their might and mastery of metal by birthright. |",
			"| [Shadow](bloodragerbloodline/shadow) | Because of your heritage, you can move and see through shadows as if you are part of them. Your fury absorbs light, warmth, and strength. |",
			"| [Shapechanger](bloodragerbloodline/shapechanger) | The blood of doppelgangers, faceless stalkers, lycanthropes, or other shapechangers courses through your veins. |",
			"| [Sphinx](bloodragerbloodline/sphinx) | Those who successfully traded riddles with sphinxes sometimes find themselves or their descendants exhibiting both arcane power and violent fury. These bloodragers find being outwitted or outmaneuvered especially infuriating; though they are usually scholarly and erudite, their fits of frenzied rage are all the more terrifying in comparison. |",
			"| [Undead](bloodragerbloodline/undead) | The foul corruption of undeath is a part of you. Somewhere in the past, death became infused with your lineage. Your connection to the attributes of the undead bestows frightening power when your bloodrage. |",
			"| [Verdant](bloodragerbloodline/verdant) | Your body is suffused with raw plant life. When you bloodrage, your plantlike characteristics bolster your durability and grant you some control over vegetation. |",

			"",
			"At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (&ast;) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"### Bomb Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Acid Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.",
			"",
			"**Anarchic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal chaotic divine damage. Lawful creatures that take a direct hit from an anarchic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, anarchic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Anarchic bombs have no effect on chaotic-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Anguish Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source/distant_realms)*): You can throw bombs infused with psychic trauma. This discovery allows other alchemists to duplicate the anguish bombs used by [mnemostillers](unknown/mnemostillers).",
			"",
			"**Axiomatic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal lawful divine damage. Chaotic creatures that take a direct hit from an axiomatic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, axiomatic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Axiomatic bombs have no effect on lawful creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Blackstar Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source/monster_codex)*): This bomb crushes the target like a void bomb, then repels nearby creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts. Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed directly away from the target's square. An alchemist must have the void bomb discovery to create blackstar bombs.",
			"",
			"**Blinding Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Boneshard Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source/undead_slayer's_handbook)*): This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike; aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead. The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the [skeleton template](monster/template/skeleton). Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell/animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concussive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Confusion Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist's bombs twist the target's perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a [confusion](spell/confusion) spell for 1 round per caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cursed Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source/champions_of_corruption)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver a debilitating curse. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by [bestow curse](spell/bestow_curse). An alchemist must be at least 12th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cytillesh Bomb** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can infuse it with cytillesh extract. Cytillesh bombs deal 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a cytillesh bomb are sickened for 1 round per alchemist level unless they succeed at Fortitude saves. If a creature is rendered unconscious from this bomb or any other attack before it is able to remove the sickened condition, the victim loses all memory from the last hour and cannot form new memories for 8 hours. The lost and prevented memories might return later as dreams, and can be restored with a [restoration](spell/restoration) spell. This discovery doesn't stack with other discoveries that alter an alchemist's bomb.",
			"",
			"**Darkness Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes nonmagical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as [deeper darkness](spell/deeper_darkness).",
			"",
			"**Defoliant Bomb** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): These poisonous bombs clear away foliage, dealing extra damage to plant creatures. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal extra damage against plant creatures but less damage against other creatures. Against creatures with the plant type, a defoliant bomb deals 1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered level the alchemist possesses, instead of 1d6. Against all other creatures, the defoliant bomb only deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. This is a poison effect. A defoliant bomb kills all normal vegetation in the target's square and its splash area; any plant-based difficult terrain in the affected area becomes normal terrain.",
			"",
			"**Delayed Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. [Dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Demolition Charge&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source/dungeoneer's_handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal damage to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver. If the item is worn or held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target, and the wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is unattended, a demolition charge deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a direct hit. This bonus doesn't affect the bomb's splash damage. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Directed Bomb** (*[Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)*): The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone. If the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of the blast from where the bomb lands. This discovery can't be combined with the explosive bomb discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dread Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source/distant_realms)*): Your anguish bombs are tainted with fear and dread. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs become frightened for 1d6 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Will saving throw is instead shaken for a single round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source/undead_slayer's_handbook)*): The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility or other forms of obscurity (such as [ethereal jaunt](spell/ethereal_jaunt)), effectively creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for 1 minute, and is otherwise identical to [faerie fire](spell/faerie_fire).",
			"",
			"**Explosive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.",
			"",
			"**Fast Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Flesh-Eating Bomb&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source/monster_hunter's_handbook)*): The alchemist can create bombs that devour living matter. The alchemist's bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1 armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the bomb's splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb's save DC to take only half damage.",
			"",
			"**Force Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Frost Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.",
			"",
			"**Glassfoot Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it cover the ground in volatile jagged crystals in addition to its normal effects. These crystals act like [caltrops](equipment/misc/caltrops), evaporating into a smelly but harmless gas in 2d6 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Grease Bomb&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source/dungeoneer's_handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb's splash radius in grease (as the [grease](spell/grease) spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can't affect items or armor. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Plague Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [greater contagion](spell/greater_contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the plague bomb and smoke bomb discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grounding Goo&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): The alchemist's bomb applies a sticky residue after any damage from the bomb is resolved. If a creature damaged by the bomb has a nonmagical fly speed, its flight is severely impaired, and it takes a penalty equal to the alchemist's level on Fly checks for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Healing Bomb&ast;** (*[Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to expend an infused extract or potion containing a cure spell. A creature that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had imbibed the infusion or potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing them.",
			"",
			"**Hellfire Bomb&ast;** (*[Agents of Evil](source/agents_of_evil)*): This discovery is available to tiefling alchemists. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can have it act as an explosive bomb, but deal half of its damage as fire damage and half as unholy damage that is not subject to fire resistance or immunity. An alchemist must be at least 9th level and have the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Holy Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Immolation Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater. An alchemist must be at least 3rd level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Incendiary Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source/villain_codex)*): An incendiary charge is a bomb specifically designed to overcome the effects of any nonmagical object's hardness. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place an incendiary charge that burns and eats away at an object, dealing normal bomb damage to it. (The damage is not halved against an object with hardness, unlike most energy damage.) Furthermore, the incendiary charge ignores the first 5 points of hardness of the material being damaged. The alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inferno Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of [incendiary cloud](spell/incendiary_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Bomb (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source/advanced_class_guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend two uses of inspiration to increase the bomb's damage by 1d6. The type of damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other a discoveries that affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb with another bomb discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than once.",
			"",
			"**Jury-Rigged Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source/antihero's_handbook)*): Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift action (this counts against the alchemist's daily use of bombs), and they deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the alchemist's Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly unstable; if the alchemist's attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a direct hit. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Madness Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Melancholy Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source/distant_realms)*): Your anguish bombs are filled with memories of sadness and regret. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs are also affected as per [crushing despair](spell/crushing_despair) for 1 round per alchemist level, or a single round if the target succeeds at a Will saving throw. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Neutralizing Bomb** (*[Healer's Handbook](source/healer's_handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn't allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn't stack with any other that modifies bombs.",
			"",
			"**Ooze Blight&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source/monster_hunter's_handbook)*): A target hit by the alchemist's bomb loses the split special quality for 1d4 rounds. In addition, against creatures with the ooze type, this bomb deals untyped damage that bypasses all resistances.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source/villain_codex)*): A penetrating charge is a bomb specifically designed to disable locks and similar mechanisms, though not other means of sealing a door, a container, or other sorts of devices. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place a penetrating charge on a lock. Instead of dealing damage, the penetrating charge seeps into the mechanism and eats away at it, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on any subsequent Disable Device checks against the mechanism. A creature can spend 10 minutes and attempt an appropriate Craft check (DC 15) to fix the lock and remove this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Plague Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [contagion](spell/contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash area for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Plague Vector** (*[Champions of Corruption](source/champions_of_corruption)*): The effects of the alchemist's plague bomb operate as normal except for the following changes. The chosen disease's save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier. Any creatures affected by the chosen disease become vectors for it, spreading the disease to any creatures they come in physical contact with for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The save DC to avoid contracting the disease from the vector is the same as the DC used for this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the plague bomb discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poison Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [cloudkill](spell/cloudkill) instead of [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poisoned Explosive&ast;** (*[Dirty Tactics Toolbox](source/dirty_tactics_toolbox)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can apply a dose of contact or injury poison to it, as if applying poison to a weapon. If the poisoned bomb hits its target, the bomb deals damage as normal, but the target must also succeed at a saving throw against the poison or be affected by that poison. No other creatures are affected by the poison. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and have the poison use class feature before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Profane Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source/champions_of_corruption)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal evil divine damage. Good creatures that take a direct hit from a profane bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against a neutral creature, a profane bomb deals half damage, and the target is not affected by the bomb's staggering effect. A profane bomb has no effect against evil-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychoactive Bomb&ast;** (*[Blood of the Moon](source/blood_of_the_moon)*): Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten certain sensations. A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, and pain effects, and the DC for Intimidate checks against the victim decreases by 2. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack, and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than normal. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remote Bomb** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source/heroes_of_the_high_court)*): The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Rocket Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): ([Goblin](race/goblin) only) Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a 20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemist's normal splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sand Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source/antihero's_handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can pack the casing full of sand that explodes in an abrasive cloud on impact. A creature that takes a direct hit from a sand bomb is blinded for 1 round, as are any creatures in the splash radius that fail a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier).",
			"",
			"**Scrap Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): ([Goblin](race/goblin) only) When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.",
			"",
			"**Shock Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Siege Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege engine with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Smoke Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.",
			"",
			"**Solid Ground&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): The alchemist launches an explosive paste bomb that bonds with any earthen surface. Each application of this paste deals no damage and affects a 5-foot-cube of dirt, loose soil, or stone, transmuting the earth for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level. Creatures cannot use burrow, earthmeld, or similar abilities (such as the meld into stone spell) while the ground remains transmuted in this way.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Stink Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of [stinking cloud](spell/stinking_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Strafe Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at the alchemist and extends away from him in the direction he chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.",
			"",
			"**Substantiating Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source/distant_realms)*): Your bombs are infused with ectoplasm and a longing for life, lending ethereal creatures a measure of substance. You can throw a bomb that inflicts no damage but instead creates a 10-foot-radius cloud of fog that functions as [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud) and lasts for 1 round per alchemist level. Incorporeal creatures that pass through this cloud become partially solid, taking half damage from nonmagic attacks and full damage from magic weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for the duration of the smoke cloud, even if the incorporeal creature moves outside the cloud's area. A creature affected by the cloud can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the substantiating effects of this bomb. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead, fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the blinding bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Syringe Stirge (Su)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source/cohorts_and_companions)*): As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its payload. A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a [stirge](monster/stirge) but lacks the blood drain ability. If it ends its turn attached to an opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent's bloodstream, dealing damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (as the [Throw Anything](feat/throw_anything) feat-this injection is a direct attack and doesn't deal splash damage. A syringe stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not attached to an enemy before the end of its life span it and its bomb payload fall inert. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tanglefoot Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a [tanglefoot bag](equipment/misc/tanglefoot_bag). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.",
			"",
			"**Thorny Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal piercing damage. Thorny bombs count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Underwater Demolition (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including throwing from the air into the water. If the bomb travels through water, the range increment is reduced to 5 feet.",
			"",
			"**Void Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source/monster_codex)*): (Drow only) By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some drow alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of crushing those inside. Void bombs deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st, instead of 1d6. A creature hit by the bomb must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC. If it fails, it is knocked prone and can't get up for 1 round. If it succeeds, all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. Other creatures within 5 feet of the bomb's target take no damage, but must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC or have all their movement speeds reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Extract Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Aromatic Extract** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source/heroes_of_the_high_court)*): The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist's daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Bottled Ooze (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist has learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he actually throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature. The ooze is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The ooze remains for 1 round per caster level, and decays into powder when the duration expires. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze's CR (so a CR 4 [gray ooze](monster/gray_ooze) requires a 4th-level extract). An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Combine Extracts** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infusion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.",
			"",
			"**Intuitive Understanding (Sp)** (*[Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)*): If the alchemist drinks an extract of the divination school while under the effects of a cognatogen, his effective caster level temporarily increases by 2. In addition, while under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist may use augury once as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to his alchemist level). At 10th level, he can use divination instead. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nostrum** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source/heroes_of_the_high_court)*): When the alchemist creates an infusion, he can mask a delayed poison within the mixture. A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect a number of hours after being imbibed equal to the alchemist's Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities. Until the nostrum is consumed or destroyed, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pickled Quasit** (*[Champions of Corruption](source/champions_of_corruption)*): The alchemist has learned how to seal a quasit in a bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the quasit. The quasit is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The quasit remains for 1 round per caster level, then collapses into its associated elements. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a pickled quasit requires a 4th-level extract. An alchemist must be at least 10th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tainted Infusion** (*[Champions of Corruption](source/champions_of_corruption)*): The alchemist can mask murder behind beneficence. When preparing an extract with the infusion discovery, he can lace the extract with one of his bombs as long as the extract has a duration greater than instantaneous. If he chooses, the alchemist can reduce the duration of the extract to 1 round. As soon as the extract's duration expires, it detonates, dealing 150% of the alchemist's bomb damage to the drinker. This effect does not produce a splash radius. Producing a tainted extract consumes both an infusion slot and a daily bomb use. An alchemist must know both the delayed bomb and infusion discoveries to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Volumizer (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): The alchemist can use an extract slot of any level to create a reactive tablet that purifies water and doubles its volume. This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has &times; the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that's not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.",
			"",
			"### Gloom Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bounding Gloom** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): The alchemist gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a [dimension door](spell/dimension_door) spell. The limitation is that the alchemist's beginning and ending locations must be areas of dim light or darker, or within the radius of an umbral gloom that is lowering the light level. The alchemist can travel up to a total of 100 feet each day in this way. This distance must be used in 10-foot increments; for example, the alchemist can make a single jump of 100 feet or 10 jumps of 10 feet each. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the distance the alchemist can jump each day doubles (200 feet at 12th level, 400 feet at 14th level, and so on). An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Debilitating Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or take a penalty to its Strength equal to 1d4 + 1 per 2 alchemist levels (maximum of 1d4+5) for 1 round per alchemist level. A target's Strength score cannot drop below 1. This penalty does not stack with itself. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): A creature struck by a direct hit with the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the debilitating gloom discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glutinous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): The gloom creates an area in its splash radius that functions as [web](spell/web). The webbing lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grasping Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): The gloom creates an area equal to double its splash radius that functions as [black tentacles](spell/black_tentacles). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the debilitating gloom and draining gloom discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Mucilaginous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): The gloom leaves a chilly gray residue that turns each square in its splash radius into difficult terrain. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's level.",
			"",
			"**Rime-Bound Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source/blood_of_shadows)*): The gloom creates an area of freezing shadow in its splash radius that deals 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area each turn. This effect lasts 1 round for every 2 alchemist levels. An alchemist must be at least 6th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Mutagen Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bone-Spike Mutagen (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source/antihero's_handbook)*): When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he mutates his skeletal structure, causing the bones on his elbows, knuckles, spine, and shoulder blades to grow massive and pierce his skin, exposing themselves as large spikes. While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist's natural armor bonus granted by the mutagen increases by 2. The spikes count as masterwork armor spikes with which the alchemist is proficient. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his Intelligence, it applies a penalty to his Strength. If it enhances his Wisdom, it applies a penalty to his Dexterity. If it enhances his Charisma, it applies a penalty to his Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Mutagen** (*[Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)*): The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill check. This resistance increases by 5 and the competence bonus by 2 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand mutagen, greater mutagen, and true mutagen. The elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity, Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold, Swim). An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time. An alchemist can gain the benefits of only one elemental mutagen at a time, selected when he imbibes the mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Feral Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.",
			"",
			"**Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source/legacy_of_the_first_world)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a fey mutagen, a mixture that lends him some of the grace and power of the First World. When imbibed, a fey mutagen grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the alchemist's Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, and DR 2/cold iron. This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and interacts with other effects as though it were a mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Grand Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist's cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the cognatogen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to each physical ability score when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source/legacy_of_the_first_world)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 10/cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](class/druid). In addition, he can choose not to allow spells and effects to affect him if they would not be capable of affecting both his original creature type and the fey creature type. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source/advanced_class_guide)*): The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the item lore, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration [investigator talents](class/ability/investigator_talents).

The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to both associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source/legacy_of_the_first_world)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 5/ cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](class/druid). An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",

			"",
			"**Greater Rasugen** (*[Distant Realms](source/distant_realms)*): The alchemist's rasugen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus on all saving throws, 3 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The alchemist takes a -4 penalty to Intelligence as long as the greater rasugen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and able to brew a rasugen before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infuse Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source/advanced_class_guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery leans how to make an inspiring cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that grants him inspiration (as the investigator's class feature) at the expense of Strength and Constitution. Upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, the alchemist gains a pool of inspiration equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -2 penalty to both Strength and Constitution. As a free action, the alchemist can add 1d6 to the result of an ability or skill check (including any he takes 10 or 20 on) by expending one use of inspiration. This ability works exactly like the [investigator's inspiration ability](class/investigator), except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If the alchemist already has access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his inspiration pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. He cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw. All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes non-alchemists sick, and so on. When the effect of an inspiring cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to Strength and Dexterity. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to an inspiring cognatogen.",
			"",
			"**Mutagen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): This discovery gives the alchemist the mutagen class ability. (This discovery exists so alchemist archetypes who have variant mutagens, such as the [mindchemist](class/archetype/alchemist/mindchemist), can learn how to make standard mutagens.)",
			"",
			"**Purging Mutagen** (*[Healer's Handbook](source/healer's_handbook)*): The alchemist's mutagen combines ipecac and other purgative components. A non-alchemist who consumes the mutagen is nauseated for only 1 round, during which time her body rapidly metabolizes or expels all extant toxins, granting her an immediate second saving throw against each ongoing disease and poison currently affecting her. Each successful save counts as two consecutive successful saving throws for the purpose of curing the affliction. Any failed saving throws do not result in additional damage or other effects. A non-alchemist who consumes a second purging mutagen in a 24-hour period is instead nauseated for 1 hour. When an alchemist drinks the mutagen, he can choose whether or not to also be affected by this discovery in addition to the mutagen's other effects.",
			"",
			"**Rag Doll Mutagen (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): ([Goblin](race/goblin) only) When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, his body and bones become rubbery and easy to contort. The alchemist gains a bonus equal to his class level on Escape Artist checks, can squeeze through places as if he were one size category smaller, and can make a Reflex save (DC equal to 15 + 1 for every 10 feet fallen) to take half damage from falling. At 10th level, all falling damage is considered nonlethal damage, and the alchemist can squeeze through places as if he were two size categories smaller than his size while under the effects of this mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Splitting Mutagen** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source/monster_hunter's_handbook)*): Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well. The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist's next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a [fireball](spell/fireball)), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via [resurrection](spell/resurrection) or similarly powerful magic. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Poison Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Celestial Poisons (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concentrate Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Excretions (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): When using his toxic skin ability, the alchemist can choose to excrete a Constitution poison instead of a Dexterity poison. This poison works the same as the normal grippli toxic skin poison except that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the [toxic skin racial trait](unknown/toxic_skin_racial_trait) before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Designer Poison (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source/potions_and_poisons)*): The alchemist can create special poisons that are more effective against certain creatures. When crafting a poison, the alchemist can choose a single creature type (and subtype, if appropriate) from the [ranger's favored enemy list](class/ranger). Against creatures of the chosen type, the poison's saving throw DC is increased by 4. Against all other creatures, it is reduced by 2. The alchemist must choose the creature type and subtype (if appropriate) while crafting the poison and afterward cannot change this choice.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Destabilizers (Su)** (*[Elemental Master's Handbook](source/elemental_master's_handbook)*): The alchemist is able to concoct reactive chemical compounds that affect elementals like poisons. The alchemist can craft poisons that affect only outsiders with the elemental subtype, bypassing their inherent immunity. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its saving throw, the poison acts as normal, but it may have no effect on the creature depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing fire damage to a fire elemental). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enduring Toxin (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source/potions_and_poisons)*): The alchemist can alter the properties of a poison, causing it to persist longer in the victim's body. Altering a dose of poison in the way takes 1 hour, requires the expenditure of raw materials worth half the poison's market price, and exposes the alchemist to the poison, thereby affecting him if he is not immune. This doubles the poison's maximum duration. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Malignant Poison** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source/dungeoneer's_handbook)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can increase the save DC of any poison by 4 and increase its duration by 2 frequency increments (for example, [large scorpion venom](equipment/poison/large_scorpion_venom) lasts 8 rounds instead of 6 and [drow poison](equipment/poison/drow_poison) lasts 4 minutes instead of 2). Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison's extended duration ends or for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nauseating Flesh** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.",
			"",
			"**Poison Conversion** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Poison (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): The alchemist is adept at delivering poison to the most vulnerable areas of his targets. When the alchemist confirms a critical hit with a poisoned weapon, he increases the save DC of the poison by an amount equal to the weapon's critical multiplier.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Potion/Elixir Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Dilution** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Elixir of Life** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell [true resurrection](spell/true_resurrection). Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a [resurrection](spell/resurrection) spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enhance Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the extend potion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Extend Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.",
			"",
			"### Other Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Air Lung** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source/pathfinder_#123_the_flooded_cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery has conditioned his body to adapt to life above water. He gains the amphibious special quality. Only an alchemist with the aquatic subtype can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a [lesser simulacrum](spell/lesser_simulacrum). This works like the [lesser simulacrum](spell/lesser_simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Zombie (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to animate a relatively complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie. This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the [zombie template](monster/template/zombie). Zombies that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell/animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Bitter Pill (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): The alchemist becomes bitter in flavor. Any creature that hits the bitter alchemist with a bite attack gains the sickened condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Constitution modifier). Any creature that swallows the alchemist whole gains the nauseated condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (same DC as above). If the alchemist is trapped in the creature's gullet and it becomes nauseated, the creature vomits him back out immediately as a free action at the start of the creature's turn; the alchemist lands prone adjacent to the creature.",
			"",
			"**Chameleon (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks. At 10th level, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +8.",
			"",
			"**Change Alignment (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Collective Memory (Su)** (*[Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)*): While under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist adds half his class level on all Knowledge skill checks and may attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained. This bonus does not stack with the second Intelligence bonus granted by the mindchemist archetype's perfect recall class feature. An alchemist must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist's dyes congeal and solidify, allowing him to make physical objects from them. The alchemist can expend two uses of his daily bombs to create a nonmagical object, as [minor creation](spell/minor_creation), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist can develop special pigments and combine them with his alchemical reagents to create unique dyes that cling to the empty space around him, allowing him to paint images in the air to fool his enemies. By expending two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space adjacent to him, as [silent image](spell/silent_image), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Doppelganger Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist learns how to create a [simulacrum](spell/simulacrum), a soulless duplicate, into which he can project his consciousness. As a full-round action, he may shift his consciousness from his current body to any one of his available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, he transfers to his own body automatically; if killed in his own body, he is dead. Unused simulacra (including his abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay. Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Calligraphy** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist can create especially volatile pigments that detonate when agitated. This requires expending one daily use of his bombs, but otherwise functions as [explosive runes](spell/explosive_runes) except that it deals damage as one of the alchemist's bombs. The alchemist can expend an additional daily use of his bombs to apply one discovery that applies to his bombs, such as acid bomb or dispelling bomb, to the runes created with this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Missile** (*[Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Fire Brand (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): ([Goblin](race/goblin) only) An alchemist with this discovery can expend one daily bomb use to apply the bomb reagents to his weapon as a swift action. A weapon treated this way deals fire damage as if it had the [flaming](magic/enhancement/flaming) weapon special ability. At 10th level, the weapon is treated as if it had the [flaming burst](magic/enhancement/flaming_burst) weapon special ability. The bomb reagents continue burning for 1 minute or until extinguished by dousing the weapon in water. An alchemist can use this ability with natural weapons, but he takes 1d6 points of fire damage per round for each natural weapon treated.",
			"",
			"**Gills** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source/pathfinder_#123_the_flooded_cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery grows a set of gills that allow him to breathe water in addition to breathing air. When on land, the alchemist risks his gills drying out and must bathe his gills with 1/2 gallon of water every 24 hours he is out of the water or take 1 point of Constitution damage every hour thereafter. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glimmering Infusion (Sp)** (*[Spymaster's Handbook](source/spymaster's_handbook)*): The alchemist can expend any prepared extract to produce a cube of glowing motes that act as per [glitterdust](spell/glitterdust). The area must be adjacent to the alchemist and covers one 5-foot square per level of extract sacrificed, and the effect's save DC is calculated using the level of the sacrificed extract. The alchemist must have the infusion discovery to choose this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a simulacrum. This works like the [simulacrum](spell/simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Greater Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist expands the set of objects he can create with his constructive dyes. The alchemist can expend one additional use of his daily bombs when using his constructive dyes discovery to create objects, as [major creation](spell/major_creation). The alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the constructive dyes and divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create lifelike images. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces sound, smell, and heat, as [major image](spell/major_image). The alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the divine inks and improved divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Healing Touch (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 round's effect of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. The alchemist's daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 &times; his alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the alchemist. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the spontaneous healing discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Improved Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create images accompanied by sound. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces minor sounds, as [minor image](spell/minor_image). The alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lasting Tinctures (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source/potions_and_poisons)*): The alchemist knows how to make [tinctures](unknown/tinctures) that last much longer than normal. The durations of the effects of any tinctures the alchemist brews using the Craft skill are doubled. When the alchemist uses this discovery to brew a longer-lasting tincture, the tincture imposes its normal penalties on the alchemist even if the alchemist has an ability that reduces tinctures' penalties (such as the [substance tolerance ability of the fermenter alchemist archetype](class/archetype/alchemist/fermenter) presented in this section). An alchemist with this discovery can brew tinctures with normal durations.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Plague** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source/advanced_race_guide)*): Any creature that must make a save against a disease caused by the alchemist's extract or other class ability must make a second save 1 round later to avoid doubling the duration of the disease effect. If the disease doesn't have a duration, this discovery reduces its onset time and frequencies by half. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Spirit (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist is familiar enough with the ties between his body and spirit that he lingers at death's door far longer than a normal person. He treats his Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills him (so an alchemist with a Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at -20 hit points instead of -10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes him unconscious and comatose, but he is only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, the alchemist must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks). An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Living Pigment** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source/heroes_of_golarion)*): The alchemist infuses his inks and dyes with a spark of animating force. As a standard action, he can expend one daily use of his bombs and a 1st-level extract he has prepared to create a creature, as [summon monster I](spell/summon_monster_1), using his level as the spell's caster level. The extract is expended as if the alchemist had consumed it. The alchemist can expend a higher-level extract when using this ability to create a creature using a [summon monster](spell/summon_monster) spell of a level equal to the level of extract expended. For example, if the alchemist expends a 4th-level extract, he can create a creature as if using [summon monster IV](spell/summon_monster_4). Additionally, the alchemist can expend an additional use of his daily bombs when creating a creature in this way to grant the creature the [celestial](monster/template/celestial) or [fiendish](monster/template/fiendish) template. The alchemist must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Material Mastery (Ex)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source/cohorts_and_companions)*): Your superior knowledge of the nature of matter enables you to ignore spell requirements more easily when crafting magic items. By expending an extract of the same school and level as a spell prerequisite when crafting a magic item, you take only a -2 penalty for ignoring that requirement, instead of -5.",
			"",
			"**Method to the Madness (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): The alchemist has learned to channel his madness into one of his alchemist class abilities. When the alchemist takes this discovery, he chooses one of either bombs or extracts. If he selects bombs, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus when determining the bonus to damage and the saving throw DCs of his bombs. If the alchemist selects extracts, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus to calculate bonus extracts per day. The alchemist must have the madness extraordinary ability to take this discovery. This discovery can be taken twice, allowing the alchemist to select both bombs and extracts.",
			"",
			"**Monstrous Graft (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): The alchemist can replace up to four of his own amputated limbs with those of a monstrous beast of the same size category. If the grafted limb is an arm, the alchemist gains either a climb speed of 15 feet or a claw or slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 for a Small alchemist). If the grafted limb is a leg, the alchemist gains one of the following benefits: a +5 bonus to land speed, a swim speed of 15 feet, or a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. For each limb the alchemist replaces in this manner, he takes a -2 penalty to Wisdom as he loses his sense of self. [Derros](unknown/derros) are immune to this penalty.",
			"",
			"**Mummification (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist has mastered preserving flesh and applied this knowledge to his own body, turning himself into an undeadlike creature. After learning this discovery, the alchemist must perform a 30-day regimen of a special diet, rigorous exercise, and drinking a mildly poisonous alchemical tea. At the end of this regimen, he falls unconscious for 24 hours, then awakens as a \"living mummy.\" The alchemist's type does not change, but he becomes immune to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the preserve organs discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Parasitic Twin (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist's vestigial limbs are part of a parasitic twin on his torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the vestigial limb discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within the alchemist's body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though the alchemist can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if the alchemist succumbs to a mental effect that would make him unconscious, helpless, or not in control of his own actions (such as [charm person](spell/charm_person), [feeblemind](spell/feeblemind), or [hold person](spell/hold_person)), he can reroll his saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can ignore it. Using this ability sickens the alchemist for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and he cannot use the twin's limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally. The alchemist must have selected the vestigial arm discovery twice before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Phantom Limb** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source/undead_slayer's_handbook)*): The alchemist can manifest a ghostly, incorporeal arm that juts out from his torso. This phantom limb does not grant the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, and it cannot hold or grab anything (including incorporeal objects). The alchemist may use his phantom limb to make a touch attack against a foe as a standard action, scraping away at the very fibers of the victim's soul. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage per alchemist level (Fortitude half ). Creatures that are immune to incorporeal attacks are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction except DR/ epic. The alchemist may suppress or activate this ability as a free action, and can use his phantom limb for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier (these rounds need not be consecutive). An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pheromones (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source/ultimate_wilderness)*): The alchemist exudes an imperceptible musk that grants him a permanent +3 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.",
			"",
			"**Preserve Organs (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist learns how to preserve and protect his vital organs, reducing the chance of a mortal wound. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the alchemist, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks (such as [fortification](magic/armor/moderate_fortification) armor). An alchemist can take this discovery up to three times; the effects stack, increasing this chance to 50% and then 75%.",
			"",
			"**Promethean Disciple** (*[Occult Adventures](source/occult_adventures)*): An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains [Craft Construct](feat/craft_construct) as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct. The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to. However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychokinetic Tincture** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source/undead_slayer's_handbook)*): Once per day, the alchemist can concoct a foul-tasting tincture that harnesses the power of the spirit. By drinking this tincture as a standard action, the alchemist can invite the latent spirits in the area to surround him. The alchemist can channel one spirit for every 4 alchemist levels he possesses. Each spirit channeled this way grants the alchemist a +1 deflection bonus to AC as the spirits whirl around his body. As a standard action, the alchemist can launch one of these spirits toward a target as a ranged touch attack. Launching a spirit this way reduces this discovery's deflection bonus to AC by 1. As a launched spirit passes through its target's body, it emits a terrible wail heard only in the target's mind, causing the target to become frightened for 1 round per alchemist level (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by this discovery again for 24 hours. The spirits whirl around the alchemist's body for 10 minutes per alchemist level, or until the alchemist has launched all of the spirits. An alchemist must be at least 4th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Baptism (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by [consecrate](spell/consecrate), for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the [consecrate](spell/consecrate) effect even if they leave the affected area. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remady Extract** (*[Healer's Handbook](source/healer's_handbook)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one nonmagical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sandstone Solution (Su)** (*[People of the Sands](source/people_of_the_sands)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can convert any potion or extract into a solution that, when thrown or applied, solidifies sand or dirt to the hardness of stone for 1 hour, affecting an area with a radius of 10 feet &times; the level of the potion or extract. If this solution is thrown at or applied to stone, it instead causes a 5-foot cube of stone to become crumbly and soft for 1 minute, reducing its hardness by double the level of the potion or extract.",
			"",
			"**Sleeper Agent (Su)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): The alchemist learns how to create a sleeper agent, whom he releases back into its original society none the wiser. The alchemist can create a sleeper agent in a ritual that takes 1 minute; the target must be unconscious for the ritual's duration. At any time during the next year, as long as he is within 1 mile of the sleeper agent, the alchemist can activate the agent's programming. When the sleeper agent is activated, treat her as if she were the target of a [dominate person](spell/dominate_person) spell with a caster level equal to the alchemist's level at the time the sleeper agent was created. If the sleeper agent is killed or the dominate person effect's duration expires, the sleeper agent is permanently released from the alchemist's control. The alchemist can also release any sleeper agent as a free action. The alchemist can have one active sleeper agent for every 6 alchemist levels he possesses. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Spell Knowledge** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source/cohorts_and_companions)*): Your studies into how all things are interconnected have taught you to cast a very limited number of spells. Select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least 2 levels lower than your highest-level extract known. You can prepare and cast this spell as an arcane spell. Preparing the spell uses up an extract slot 1 level higher than the spell's level. Your caster level is equal to your alchemist level, and your save DCs and concentration checks are Intelligence-based. You're considered to have this spell on your spell list for purposes of prerequisites, spell completion items, and spell trigger items. You may select this discovery more than once. Each time, it grants you access to another spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Healing (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. As a free action once per round, he can heal 5 hit points as if he had the fast healing ability. He can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner for every 2 alchemist levels he possesses. If the alchemist falls unconscious because of hit point damage and he still has healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until he is conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.",
			"",
			"**Subsumed Spirit (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): As the alchemist grows in power, his parasitic twin laps up a portion of his soul, like a dog feeding on its master's scraps. The alchemist's parasitic twin can now manifest or hide within the alchemist's torso as a move action. As a standard action, the alchemist can cause his manifested twin to babble, driving listeners insane. All creatures without the insanity special ability that are within 60 feet of the alchemist must succeed at a Will save or be affected by confusion for 1 round per alchemist level. The alchemist can urge his parasitic twin to babble a number of times per day equal to 3 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Creatures that successfully save can't be affected by this effect for 24 hours. The alchemist is immune to its sibling's babbling. This is a sonic, mind-affecting compulsion effect. The alchemist must have the parasitic twin discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Acclimation (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source/inner_sea_monster_codex)*): Time spent in the bright light of day has partially inured the alchemist to its effects. When the alchemist would normally take Constitution damage as a result of vulnerability to sunlight, he can attempt a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to negate the effects. The DC of this saving throw increases by 1 for each hour after the first spent in sunlight within the last 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Tentacle (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains a prehensile, arm-length tentacle on his body. The tentacle is fully under his control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The tentacle does not give the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, though he can use it to make a tentacle attack (1d4 damage for a Medium alchemist, 1d3 damage for a Small one) with the grab ability. The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as the alchemist's original arms can (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). Unlike an arm, the tentacle has no magic item slots.",
			"",
			"**Tumor Familiar (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist creates a Diminutive or Tiny tumor on his body, usually on his back or stomach. As a standard action, the alchemist can have the tumor detach itself from his body as a separate creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat, cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The tumor can reattach itself to the alchemist as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on the alchemist's caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as the alchemist's familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the [Alertness](feat/alertness) feat, and so on). When attached to the alchemist, the tumor has fast healing 5. An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.",
			"",
			"**Vestigial Arm (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains a new arm (left or right) on his torso. The arm is fully under his control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The arm does not give the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, though the arm can wield a weapon and make attacks as part of the alchemist's attack routine (using two-weapon fighting). The arm can manipulate or hold items as well as the alchemist's original arms (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, another hand to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb). The arm has its own \"hand\" and \"ring\" magic item slots (though the alchemist can still only wear two rings and two hand magic items at a time). An alchemist may take this discovery up to two times.",
			"",
			"**Webbed Extremities** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source/pathfinder_#123_the_flooded_cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery grows membranes between his fingers and toes, greatly improving his movement underwater. The alchemist gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Swim checks and can take 10 on a Swim check even if distracted or endangered while swimming.",
			"",
			"**Wet Coat** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source/pathfinder_#123_the_flooded_cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery has conditioned his body so that it never completely dries out when on land. He effectively becomes immune to any detrimental effects of his water dependency. Only an alchemist with the aquatic subtype and the water dependency special quality can select this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Wings (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)*): The alchemist gains batlike, birdlike, or insectlike functional wings, allowing him to fly as the fly spell for a number of minutes per day equal to his caster level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. An alchemist can select this discovery multiple times; each time he does so, he adds his caster level to the number of minutes per day that he can fly with the wings. This flight is an extraordinary ability. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery."

			"Each eidolon receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to give the eidolon new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. These abilities, called evolutions, can be changed whenever the summoner gains a new level, but they are otherwise set. Some evolutions require that the eidolon have a specific base form or the summoner be of a specific level before they can be chosen. A number of evolutions grant the eidolon additional natural attacks. Natural attacks listed as primary are made using the eidolon's full base attack bonus and add the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls. Natural attacks listed as secondary are made using the eidolon's base attack bonus - 5 and add 1/2 the eidolon's Strength modifier on damage rolls (if positive). If the eidolon only has a single natural attack, the attack is made using its full base attack bonus and it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with that attack, regardless of the attack's type.",

The caster level for this evolution is equal to the eidolon's Hit Dice. The save DC for this spell is 10 + the eidolon's Charisma modifier.

			"",
			"**Scent (Ex) ([(Advanced Player's Guide pg. 61)](source/advanced_player's_guide)):** An eidolon's sense of smell becomes quite acute. The eidolon gains the scent special quality, allowing it to detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents can be detected at twice the normal range. Scent does not allow the eidolon to precisely locate the creature, only to detect its presence. It can detect the direction with a move action. The eidolon can pinpoint the creature's location if it is within 5 feet. The eidolon can use scent to track creatures.",
			"",
			"**Shared Evolution (Su) ([(Legacy of the First World pg. 19)](source/legacy_of_the_first_world)):** Select a 1-point or 2-point evolution the eidolon has. As a standard action, the eidolon can touch the summoner and transfer the selected evolution to him. This functions as the summoner's aspect ability, and the same limitations apply.

			"",
			"**Slippery (Ex) ([(Champions of Corruption pg. 27)](source/champions_of_corruption)):** Due to its slimy hide or a slick exoskeleton, the eidolon is especially slippery. The eidolon gains a +4 bonus to CMD to escape a grapple and on Escape Artist checks.",

Swallowed creatures take an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to the eidolon's bite damage each round + 1d6 points of damage. A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, but can attempt to cut its way free with a light piercing or slashing weapon. The amount of damage needed to cut free is equal to 1/10 the eidolon's total hit points. The eidolon's AC against these attacks is equal to 10 + 1/2 its natural armor bonus. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the eidolon loses this ability until it heals this damage. Alternatively, the swallowed creature can attempt to escape the grapple as normal.

Fast healing does not restore hit points lost due to starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow the eidolon to regrow lost body parts (or to reattach severed parts). Fast healing functions as long as the eidolon is alive. This fast healing does not function when the eidolon is not on the same plane as its summoner.

This size change also gives the creature a -1 size penalty to AC and on attack rolls, a +1 bonus on combat maneuver checks and to CMD, a -2 penalty on Fly checks, and a -4 penalty on Stealth checks. If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains a reach of 10 feet. Any reach evolutions the eidolon possesses are added to this total.",

			"## Exploits of the Outer Rifts",
			"",
			"**Source** [Horror Realms pg. 6](source/horror_realms)",
			"",
			"Arcanists experiment with ancient knowledge and mystic lore, manipulating their own natural abilities to unlock powerful arcane secrets.Despite extensive effort, not all arcanists achieve the power they seek. Some discover that their blood lacks the innate power of a sorcerer's, or that deciphering mysteries in ancient tomes requires a degree of scholarly discipline they do not have. Undeterred, such individuals continue their quest by turning to the powerful mysteries of the Outer Rifts, be they blasphemous secrets found in lost ruins, tricks of magic etched into fiendish runestones, or any other dangerous form of sinister exploitation from these horrific realms.Not all arcanists who choose this route are necessarily evil-they justify these exploits by claiming to be in control of their actions and to use the tools of their enemies against them. Nevertheless, those who bend magic using exploits from the Outer Rifts should be wary of attracting the wrong attention or enabling a greater evil than that which they seek to defeat.",
			"",
			"All of the following exploits can be learned by arcanists of any alignment, but these exploits come with a risk. If you use an Outer Rift exploit and in doing so reduce your arcane reservoir to 0, you immediately gain the stain of one manifestation from the accursed, demonic, hellbound, or possessed corruption. The GM chooses which corruption, manifestation, and stain you receive; this stain persists for 24 hours. Reducing your arcane reservoir to 0 in this way multiple times within a 24-hour period results in a new stain for each such instance, and each time you do so you reset the timer for all stains gained in this manner to 24 hours. At the GM's option, multiple instances of abusing exploits in this manner could result in a permanent corruption, but otherwise these corruptions are temporary and do not progress.You can never gain a gift from a corruption in this way.",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise noted, the saving throw DC for an arcanist's exploit equals 10 + 1/2 the arcanist's class level + the arcanist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"### Blood Tears (Su)",
			"",
			"As a move action, the arcanist can expend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to cause his eyes to turn red and weep tears of blood. During this time, the arcanist's vision is blurred by blood, and he treats all gaze attacks as if he were averting his eyes from a creature, but that creature does not gain concealment against him. At a distance of greater than 30 feet, all creatures or objects viewed by the arcanist gain concealment. As a standard action that ends the blood tears exploit, the arcanist can wipe the tears from his face and flick them with a free hand, splattering all creatures in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a Will save to avoid becoming staggered with extreme pain and anguish for 1 round. If the arcanist doesn't wipe his bleeding tears away, the effects of this exploit can persist for a maximum duration of 1 minute per arcanist level.",
			"",
			"### Damnation Susurrus (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to manifest a choir of insidious whispers, which echo in the mind of a single target within 30 feet, urging the target to harm itself. A creature that fails a Will save to resist this effect becomes overwhelmed by the voices and succumbs to their suggestions. On its turn, it drops any objects it holds and harms itself, inflicting 1d6 points of damage. At 3rd level, and again at every 3 levels thereafter, the arcanist can target an additional creature with this exploit, to a maximum of 7 targets at 18th level. Damnation susurrus is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"### Fiendish Proboscis (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist's face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit's effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis's tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target's magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target's life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target's ability to use magic, the tongue's unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.",
			"",
			"### Rift Fog (Su)",
			"",
			"As a standard action, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to create a 5-foot-radius vortex of chilling fog adjacent to him. Hints of leering, fiendish faces whirl within the mist. As a move action, the arcanist can direct the cloud of rift fog to move in any direction at a speed of 30 feet to a maximum range of 60 feet from the arcanist. The fog may ascend or jump up to 30 feet to strike a target. Once the fog ends its movement, coils of its otherworldly mist surround any targets that are wholly or partially in its area. The fog's supernaturally cold temperature causes 1d6 points of cold damage to affected creatures. A creature damaged by rift fog becomes slowed (as per the [slow](spell/slow) spell) for the following round if it fails a Will save. Once created, rift fog persists for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round), or until the arcanist activates a new exploit.",
			"",
			"### Shadows out of Light (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to pull fiendish essence from the Outer Rifts into his own shadow. Malformed and nearly amorphous, the shadow-things swarm across his body, turning his eyes completely black and distorting his physical form. These shadows persist for 1 round per 2 arcanist levels (minimum of 1 round) and grant the arcanist a +2 deflection bonus to his Armor Class. The shadows are threatening, and as long as they persist the arcanist is considered armed for the purpose of flanking or threatening an attack of opportunity. Whenever a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the arcanist, he may make the attack of opportunity with his shadow, striking as a touch attack that deals a number of points of cold damage equal to 1d6 + the arcanist's Charisma modifier plus 1 point of Strength damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the Strength damage. This ability does not itself increase the number of attacks of opportunity the arcanist can make in a round, but feats like [Combat Reflexes](feat/combat_reflexes) do allow him to make multiple attacks of opportunity with his shadow. The shadows cannot be compelled to make normal attacks-they lash out in this way only as a reaction to being provoked.",
			"",
			"### Soulrider (Su)",
			"",
			"The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a \"soulrider.\" The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target's subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell's effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell's effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. [Detect magic](spell/detect_magic) and [detect evil](spell/detect_evil) can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of [status](spell/status), and the creature takes a -2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per [sending](spell/sending). Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"### Tentacles (Su)",
			"",
			"As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist's size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist's Strength score. The arcanist's reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach."

			"At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand discovery. He immediately learns two normal discoveries, but also learns a third discovery chosen from the list below, representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import. For many alchemists, the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.",
			"",
			"**Awakened Intellect** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's constant exposure to strange chemicals has expanded his mind. His Intelligence score permanently increases by 2 points.",
			"",
			"**Change Alignment, Greater (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source/champions_of_purity)*): The effects of the alchemist's change alignment infusion become permanent and can only be reversed by a [wish](spell/wish) or [miracle](spell/miracle). A permanent, forced change of alignment may be devastating, and some believe it is little better than zealous slavery or mind control. Others consider a good alignment brought about by any means but purity of heart an affront to freedom. This discovery remains controversial at best. An alchemist must take the change alignment discovery and the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Youth** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist has discovered a cure for aging, and from this point forward he takes no penalty to his physical ability scores from advanced age. If the alchemist is already taking such penalties, they are removed at this time.",
			"",
			"**Fast Healing** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's flesh responds to damage with shocking speed-he gains fast healing 5.",

			"**Philosopher's Stone** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist learns how to create a [philosopher's stone](magic/artifact/philosopher's_stone), and can do so once per month at no cost. Creating a philosopher's stone takes 1 day of work.",
			"",
			"**Poison Touch** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist gains a poisonous touch, as if under the effects of a [poison](spell/poison) spell. He can suppress or activate this ability as a free action. The physical appearance of how the alchemist generates and delivers his poisonous touch varies from alchemist to alchemist.",
			"",
			"**True Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source/advanced_player's_guide)*): The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +8 natural armor bonus and a +8 alchemical bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution.

			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Abominate (Sp)** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 28](source/magical_marketplace)): The witch transforms a creature within 30 feet into an aberration. This hex acts as baleful polymorph, except the target is transmuted into a Small, Medium, or Large aberration. The target's abilities are modified as monstrous physique IV. Whether or not its save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Animal Servant (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can use this hex to turn a humanoid enemy into an animal and rob it of its free will. The transformation works as [beast shape II](spell/beast_shape_2) and is negated by a successful Will save. The transformed creature retains its Intelligence score and known languages, if any, but the witch controls its mind. This effect functions as [dominate monster](spell/dominate_monster), except the creature does not receive further saving throws to resist the hex. The effect can be removed only with wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch also ends the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Curse of Nonviolence (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch can curse a creature to prevent it from attacking innocents. If the target fails its Will save, it cannot take violent actions or do anything destructive against any creature with fewer Hit Dice than itself. If another creature takes hostile action against the cursed creature, the cursed creature can act normally in regard to that creature only. This is an abjuration effect. The curse is permanent but can be removed with a break enchantment, miracle, or wish spell. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Curse (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): This powerful hex seizes a creature's heart, causing death within just a few moments. This hex has a range of 30 feet. The hexed creature receives a Will save to negate the effect. If this save is failed, the creature becomes fatigued the first round of the hex. On the second round of the hex, the creature becomes exhausted. On the third round, the creature dies unless it succeeds at a Fort save. Creatures that fail the first save but succeed at the second remain exhausted and take 4d6 points of damage + 1 point of damage per level of the witch. Slaying the witch that hexed the creature ends the effect, but any fatigue or exhaustion remains. Whether or not the saves are successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Death Interrupted (Su)** ([Healer's Handbook pg. 17](source/healer's_handbook)): A witch with this grand hex can pluck a dead creature's soul from the River of Souls and store it in her familiar for safekeeping and eventual resurrection. In order to use this ability, the witch must be adjacent to the target dead creature and her own familiar, and the ally's soul must be free and willing to return at the witch's behest. When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level. The witch must be within 300 feet of the creature's body to return it to life. If a creature's soul is in the witch's familiar and this effect expires, or if the witch attempts to return the creature to life but is out of range, the creature remains dead. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Dire Prophecy (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch curses the target so he is doomed to die (Will negates). As long as the curse persists, the target takes a -4 penalty to his Armor Class and on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. While the curse persists, the witch may end it by bringing its full force upon her victim all at once. Doing so gives the victim a penalty equal to the witch's caster level to his Armor Class or on any single attack roll, combat maneuver check, opposed ability or skill check, or saving throw. The witch must decide to apply this penalty before the roll to be modified is made. If the witch does not have line of sight to the target, the full force of the curse occurs when the GM considers it most appropriate, such as when the target is in mortal danger. A target can only have one dire prophecy upon him at a time. Whether or not the target's save against the hex is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex for 1 day. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Slumber (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch can touch a creature, causing it to drift off into a permanent slumber. The creature receives a Will save to negate this effect. If the save fails, the creature falls asleep and cannot be woken. The effect can only be removed with a wish or similar magic, although slaying the witch ends the effect. The witch can use this ability to poison food or drink, causing those who ingest it to make a save or fall into an eternal slumber. She can only have one such dose of poison at any one time, and it loses its potency after 1 minute if not consumed. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Forced Reincarnation (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to die and be immediately reincarnated into a new body. A Will save negates this effect. Those that fail are slain and immediately brought back to life with the spell reincarnate. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Lay to Rest (Sp)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch may target a single undead creature with this hex as if with an undeath to death spell. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Life Giver (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): Once per day the witch can, as a full round action, touch a dead creature and bring it back to life. This functions as resurrection, but it does not require a material component.",
			"",
			"**Natural Disaster (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch using this hex calls down the forces of nature to wreak havoc on an area. This functions as a storm of vengeance combined with an earthquake that occurs on the second round of the effect (while acid is raining from the sky). A witch must concentrate for the duration of this effect. If disrupted, the effect immediately ends. A witch can only use this ability once per day.",
			"",
			"**Summon Spirit (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 83](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch calls forth the ghost of a humanoid creature with no more than 18 Hit Dice. The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Hut (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 83](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as \"follow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."

			"Gunslingers spend grit points to accomplish deeds. Most deeds grant the gunslinger some momentary bonus or effect, but there are some that provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds stay in effect as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point. The following is the list of base gunslinger deeds. A gunslinger can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the appropriate amount of grit is spent to perform the deed.",
			"",
			"### 1st-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Deadeye (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, the gunslinger can resolve an attack against touch AC instead of normal AC when firing beyond her firearm's first range increment. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point per range increment beyond the first. The gunslinger still takes the -2 penalty on attack rolls for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger's Dodge (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an immediate action; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop prone to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.",
			"",
			"**Quick Clear (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 1st level, as a standard action, the gunslinger can remove the broken condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a standard action.",
			"",
			"### 3rd-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Gunslinger Initiative (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 10](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks. Furthermore, if she has the Quick Draw feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the initiative check.",
			"",
			"**Pistol-Whip (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a standard action. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the enhancement bonus of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger's size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/&times;2. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a combat maneuver check to knock the target prone as a free action. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.",
			"",
			"**Utility Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.",
			"",
			"- Blast Lock: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC. Arcane lock grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the Disable Device skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or Disable Device or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though knock can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an arcane lock can still bypass the wards of that spell.",
			"- Scoot Unattended Object: The gunslinger makes an attack roll against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot's origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.",
			"- Stop Bleeding: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single bleed condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an attack roll when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.",
			"",
			"### 7th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Dead Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many attack rolls as she can, based on her base attack bonus. She makes the attack rolls in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the attack rolls hit the target, the gunslinger's single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest base attack bonus -5. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the attack rolls are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.",
			"",
			"**Startling Shot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a standard action to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes flat-footed until the start of its next turn.",
			"",
			"**Targeting (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 11](source/ultimate_combat)): At 7th level, as a full-round action, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are immune to these effects.",
			"",
			"- Arms: On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger's choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.",
			"- Head: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"- Legs: On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked prone. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to trip attacks are immune to this effect.",
			"- Torso: Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19-20.",
			"- Wings: On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20 Fly check or fall 20 ft.",
			"",
			"### 11th-Level Deeds",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Wound (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 12](source/ultimate_combat)): At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a free action to have that attack deal extra bleed damage. The amount of bleed damage is equal to the gunslinger's Dexterity modifier. Alternatively, the gunslinger can spend 2 grit points to deal 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution bleed damage (gunslinger's choice) instead. Creatures that are immune to sneak attacks are also immune to these types of bleed damage.",
			"",

The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it's confused in this way, during any round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature's confusion result is 76-100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned it (attacking the hexer's enemies or performing such other tasks that the hexer can communicate to it).

			"While inquisitors often take on the domains permitted to the clerics of the faith, they are privy to special lore not open to priests and other agents of their religion. These divine pursuits, called inquisitions, grant inquisitors the tools necessary for the fight against enemies of the faith. An inquisitor may select an inquisition in place of a domain.",

			"If an inquisition's granted power calls for a saving throw, the DC of the save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's inquisitor level + her Wisdom modifier. Unless otherwise stated, the caster level for granted power spell-like abilities is equal to the inquisitor's class level.",
			"",
			"Inquisitions are intended for inquisitors, not for other classes that give access to domains. While a cleric or other domain-using class can select an inquisition in place of a domain (if appropriate to the character's deity), inquisitions do not grant domain spell slots or domain spells, and therefore are much weaker choices for those classes. These other classes use the appropriate class level as their inquisitor level for the purpose of inquisition granted powers (clerics use their cleric level as their inquisitor level, and so on).",

He can also choose to learn an [annointing](class/ability/annointings), instead.

			"**Amazing Inspiration (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 32](source/advanced_class_guide)): When using inspiration, the investigator rolls a d8 instead of a d6.

Anathemas count as poisons, but they can affect creatures that are normally immune to poison, as they exploit vulnerabilities in their very nature rather than their biology. When an anathema is created, select a creature type (and subtype, if applicable) from the ranger favored enemy list; the anathema functions only against this chosen type.

In addition, he always counts as having a running start when attempting Acrobatics checks to jump. By spending 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action, the monk gains a +20 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Improvised Weapon Proficiency (Ex, Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 31](source/blood_of_the_beast)) A monk with this ability does not take a penalty on attack rolls for using an improvised weapon. By spending 1 ki point, the monk can fight with a broken weapon without taking any penalties on attack rolls or damage rolls for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Insightful Wisdom (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points as an immediate action to give another ally within 30 feet just the right word of advice to prevent disaster. If the ally can hear the monk, she can reroll a single attack roll or saving throw. The ally must take the second result, even if it is worse. A monk must be at least 8th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Blocker (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a free action before making an unarmed strike against a foe. If the attack hits, the monk can interrupt the target's flow of ki. If the monk successfully damages the target of his attack, that opponent's cost to activate abilities with ki increases by 1 ki point for 1 hour. If the monk spends 2 points from his ki pool, he can use this ability to affect the target's arcane pool, arcane reservoir, grit points, inspiration, or panache points instead of its ki pool. The effects of this ability do not stack, but multiple hits increase the duration by 1 hour for each hit. A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Guardian (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As an immediate action before he rolls a saving throw against a targeted effect that also targets other allies or an area effect whose area includes other allies, a monk with this ability can spend any number of ki points and designate a number of adjacent allies equal to the number of ki points spent. The monk rolls one saving throw for each designated ally, using his bonus instead of the ally's. For each successful saving throw, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had succeeded at the saving throw, and for each saving throw failed, the corresponding ally treats the effect as if that ally had failed the saving throw. If the monk fails any of the saving throws (including his own original saving throw), the monk treats the effect as if he had failed the saving throw. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Hurricane (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As a full-round action, a monk with this ability can move up to twice his speed. At any point in that movement, the monk can spend 1 ki point to make the first attack in his flurry of blows. He can later spend another ki point to make the next attack in his flurry of blows, and so on, until he either stops spending ki points or has exhausted all the attacks from his flurry of blows. A monk must be at least 10th level and possess the sudden speed ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Meditation (Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 31](source/blood_of_the_beast)) A monk with this ability can spend 2 ki points to meditate as a full-round action, as if using Combat Meditation. Alternatively, he can spend 4 ki points to meditate as a move action instead. Using these ki points does not count as one of the monk's daily uses of Combat Meditation, but it grants him the usual benefits he would gain from his meditation feats for doing so. The monk must have the Combat Meditation feat before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Metabolism (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability uses his ki to control his metabolism. As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, the monk needs to eat and drink only 1/4 as often as normal, needs only 2 hours of sleep each night (including to replenish his ki pool), and can hold his breath for up to 1 hour per point of Constitution. As a move action, he can spend 1 ki point to enter a state of suspended animation, falling unconscious and appearing dead to all senses. At the time he enters this state, he indicates a preset period of time or a triggering condition, after which he awakens.",
			"",
			"**Ki Mount (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a standard action to grant 2 temporary hit points per monk level he possesses to his mount for 1 hour per monk level. As long as the monk and his mount are adjacent or the monk is mounted, the mount shares the benefits of whichever of the AC bonus, evasion, high jump, improved evasion, ki strike, perfect self, and still mind abilities the monk possesses. A monk must be at least 6th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Range (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to increase the range increment of any thrown monk weapon by 20 feet. Apply this benefit before doubling the range increment with the Far Shot feat.",
			"",
			"**Ki Sunder (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 20](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A monk with this ability can spend 1 ki point as a free action when attempting a sunder combat maneuver check to add his monk level as a bonus to the damage roll.",
			"",
			"**Ki Visions (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 17](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ability often sees visions of spirits or hears the voice of his departed mentor in his dreams. On any given night during which the monk dreams, he can use this ability to gain the benefits of a [divination](spell/divination). If he does, he spends 2 ki points from the next day's total. A monk must be at least 10th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Ki Volley (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) When a targeted spell or spell-like ability fails to overcome the monk's spell resistance from diamond soul, he can spend 2 ki points as an immediate action to send that spell back at its caster as [spell turning](spell/spell_turning). A monk must be 16th level or higher and possess the diamond soul ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Light Steps (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can move effortlessly across nearly any surface. Whenever the monk activates his feather balance ki power, he can also ignore all difficult terrain. In addition, while active, he can cross any solid surface, even if it would normally not support his weight. This does not allow him to walk on liquids. A monk must be at least 8th level and have the feather balance ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Master-Thought Koan (Su)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 20](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A monk with this ability can spend an additional 2 ki points when using either the breaking-down koan or building-up koan ki powers. When combined with master-thought koan, breaking-down koan affects a number of characters of your choice within 30 feet equal to the monk's wisdom modifier. When combined with master-thought koan, building-up koan can be used on an ally within 30 feet. A monk must be at least 12th level and have either the breaking-down koan or the building-up koan ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**One Touch (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) As long as he has at least 1 point remaining in his ki pool, as a standard action, a monk with this power can make an unarmed strike against a foe as a touch attack. He adds 1/2 his monk level as a bonus on the damage roll. He can spend 1 ki point to double this bonus for that attack. A monk must be at least 12th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Qinggong Power (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this power selects any of the qinggong monk ki powers for which he qualifies based on his monk level. A monk can select this ability multiple times. Each time, he must select a different qinggong monk ki power.",
			"",
			"**Quivering Palm (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. Using this ability is a standard action that costs 4 ki points, and the monk must announce his intent to use this ability (and spend the ki points) before making the attack roll. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the attack hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any time within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action); unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wisdom modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it can still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than one quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous one is negated. A monk must be at least 16th level before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Racing Current (Su)** ([Wilderness Origins pg. 31](source/wilderness_origins)) A monk with this ki power can create a wave to help him maneuver allies upon the battlefield, as if using the spell [slipstream](spell/slipstream). Using this ability is a move action that costs 2 ki points, and the ability remains in effect for 1 minute. A monk must be 6th level to select this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Slow Fall (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent by expending 1 point from his ki pool. When he uses this ability, he takes no damage from the fall (as if using [feather fall](spell/feather_fall)), but he must be adjacent to a wall for the length of the fall (although this can be used to reduce the damage from a fall if only part of it is adjacent to a wall).",
			"",
			"**Sudden Speed (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to grant himself a sudden burst of speed. This increases the monk's base land speed by 30 feet for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Water Sprint (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can spend 1 point from his ki pool as a swift action to gain the ability to walk on water, as if under the effects of [water walk](spell/water_walk).

			"",
			"**Wholeness of Body (Su)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 18](source/pathfinder_unchained)) A monk with this ki power can heal his own wounds as a standard action. By spending 2 points from his ki pool, he can heal an amount of damage equal to 1d8 + his monk level.",

A monk must be at least 8th level and have the high jump ki power before selecting this ki power.",
			"",
			"**Zephyr Blow (Su)** ([Wilderness Origins pg. 31](source/wilderness_origins)) By spending 1 ki point as a standard action, a monk with this power can disrupt the wind and create a sharp blast of air, as if using the spell [gust of wind](spell/gust_of_wind).

			"",
			"**Agony (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 67](source/advanced_player's_guide)): With a quick incantation, a witch can place this hex on one creature within 60 feet, causing them to suffer intense pain. The target is nauseated for a number of rounds equal to the witch's level. A Fortitude save negates this effect. If the saving throw is failed, the target can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",
			"",
			"**Animal Skin** ([Blood of the Moon pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_moon)): The witch can become any animal of a size from Tiny to Large whose skin she wears. This ability is similar to beast shape II, except she takes on the appearance of the specific individual from which the skin came.",
			"",
			"**Beast Eye (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can project her senses into an animal within 100 feet, sensing whatever it senses. She cannot control the animal's actions. She can project her senses from that animal to another within 100 feet of it as a standard action, and can continue to make these sensory leaps, potentially viewing things very far from her actual location. She may return her senses to her own body as a free action. Normal animals get no saving throw against this ability, but animal companions, paladin mounts, and similar unusual animals may resist with a Will save; the witch may use this ability on her own familiar as if it were an animal. If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet of her who also have the coven hex can see through this animal at will, although the acting witch still controls the ability. The witch can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments.",
			"",
			"**Beast's Gift (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can use her magic to grant her allies ferocious animal abilities. The witch can partially transform a willing ally, granting him natural attacks for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. Choose one: the creature gains one bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage and one secondary attack of the witch's choice that deals 1d6 points of damage, or the creature gains two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage each. These attacks follow the standard rules for natural attacks.",
			"",
			"**Cook People (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can create fabulous spells by cooking an intelligent humanoid creature in her cauldron, either alive or dead. Using this hex creates one meal or serving of food of the witch's choice, typically a delicious stew or a dough suitable for cookies, pastries, or other desserts. Cooking the victim takes 1 hour. Eating the food provides one of the following benefits for 1 hour: age resistance, bear's endurance, bull's strength, cat's grace, eagle's splendor, fox's cunning, neutralize poison (instantaneous) owl's wisdom, remove disease (instantaneous). Alternatively, the witch can shape the dough into a Small, humanlike creature, animating it as a homunculus for 1 hour. The witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex. Using this hex or knowingly eating its food is an evil act.",
			"",
			"**Delicious Fright** ([Blood of the Moon pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_moon)): The witch can feed on the fear of her victim. The target of this hex becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the witch's Intelligence modifier. As long as the witch remains within 30 feet of her target, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws as long as this effect persists. A successful Will save reduces the duration of this hex to 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.",

			"**False Hospitality (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witches of Iblydos are known for greeting travelers with warmth only to reveal their powers once their enemies have lowered their defenses.

			"",
			"**Hag's Eye (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 67](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with this hex can create a magic sensor that she can see through.

If the witch has the coven hex, all other witches within 10 feet who also have the coven hex can see through this sensor as well, although the witch that created it still controls it.

			"**Harrowing Curse (Su)** ([The Harrow Handbook pg. 15](source/the_harrow_handbook)): The witch can curse a target creature by touching it with a card randomly drawn from a harrow deck she owns. The target is affected as if by the spell bestow curse using the witch's caster level, except that the witch can decrease only the ability score that corresponds to the suit of the card drawn. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be targeted by this hex more than once in 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts as a major curse spell. A witch with the cartomancer archetype can combine this hex with her spell deck's deliver touch spell ability.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Home (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can conceal or disguise her home and the area around it as if using mirage arcana. Before using the hex, she must spend 1 day pacing out the border of an area that measures roughly 40,000 square feet (approximately 200 feet by 200 feet) to define her home territory. Thereafter, she can use the hex to change the appearance of that area as a standard action as long as she is within the area. The illusion persists until the witch changes or dismisses it. For the purpose of this ability, a witch can only have one \"home\" at a time.",

			"**Hoarfrost (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The target is rimed with a shell of frost needles that slowly work their way into its flesh (Fortitude negates). The target turns pale and blue, and takes 1 point of Constitution damage per minute until it dies, saves (once per minute), or is cured. Break enchantment, dispel magic, remove curse, and similar spells end the effect. If the target saves, it is immune to this hex for 1 day. This is a cold effect.",
			"",
			"**Ice Tomb (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): A storm of ice and freezing wind envelops the target, which takes 3d8 points of cold damage (Fortitude half). If the target fails its save, it is paralyzed and unconscious but does not need to eat or breathe while the ice lasts. The ice has 20 hit points; destroying the ice frees the creature, which is staggered for 1d4 rounds after being released. Whether or not the target's saving throw is successful, it cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day.",

Each time she uses this hex, the witch either chooses the blinded or deafened condition, or chooses a type of effect: curse, disease, or poison. If the target is or later becomes afflicted with the chosen condition or effect, that condition or effect is suppressed for a number of minutes equal to the witch's level. Alternatively, for 24 hours the witch can grant her target a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against effects that cause any two of the above conditions or effects (witch's choice; she can choose any combination of conditions or effects, as long as she chooses only two total). At 15th level, the witch can choose up to two total conditions or types of effects to suppress or three total conditions or types of effects to grant a circumstance bonus against each time she uses the major ameliorating hex. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",

			"**Major Healing (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): By calling upon eerie powers, the witch's touch can mend even the most terrible wounds of those she touches. This acts as cure serious wounds, using the witch's caster level. Once a creature has benefited from the major healing hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours. At 15th level, this hex acts like cure critical wounds.",
			"",
			"**Nightmares (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): Calling upon fell powers, a witch can place a hex on a creature within 60 feet that causes its sleep to be tormented by terrible nightmares.

			"",
			"**Pariah (Su)** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 28](source/magical_marketplace)): The witch can cause a creature within 60 feet to be shunned by its allies for a number of rounds equal to the witch's Intelligence modifier. Any other creature attempting to directly assist the target with a harmless spell or aid another action must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the aiding creature is unaffected by this hex. If the save fails, the aiding creature can't follow through, the action is lost, and the aiding creature can't directly aid the target for the duration of this hex. This hex does not prevent the target from benefiting from area of effect spells.",
			"",
			"**Prophecy (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 16](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The witch can call on her prophetic ancestors and cast [divination](spell/divination) once per day. She can spend a full hour casting the spell in place of providing the usual material components.",
			"",
			"**Regenerative Sinew (Su)** ([Healer's Handbook pg. 17](source/healer's_handbook)): The witch can cause the debilitating wounds of a creature she touches to quickly close, helping it heal rapidly. The target either gains fast healing 5 for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the witch's class level or it heals up to 4 points of ability score damage from any two ability scores (witch's choice). At 15th level, in addition to the chosen effect, the target's severed body members, broken bones, and ruined organs grow back, as per regenerate. Once a creature has benefited from this hex, it cannot benefit from it again for 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Restless Slumber (Su)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 10](source/potions_and_poisons)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to fall into a sleep riddled with nightmares. This functions as the slumber hex. Additionally, the restless nature of the sleep causes the creature to violently toss and turn, dealing 1d10 points of damage to itself each turn. This damage does not wake the creature. When it wakes, the creature's addled state causes it to be confused for a number of rounds equal to half the witch's level. The witch must have the slumber hexslumber to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Retribution (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch can place a retribution hex on a creature within 60 feet, causing terrible wounds to open across the target's flesh whenever it deals damage to another creature in melee.

			"",
			"**Speak in Dreams (Sp)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): The witch can contact a creature as if using dream. The witch can use this ability on a number of creatures per day equal to her Intelligence bonus, but can dream-speak to those creatures as often as desired throughout that time period.",

Additionally, the witch can change her voice to match that of any creature whose voice she has stolen with this hex, as per vocal alteration.",
			"",
			"**Vision (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with the vision hex can grant a glimpse of the future to a creature touched. Granting a vision takes 1 minute, during which time the witch and the target must remain in contact with one another. At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them. For example, the visions granted by a chaotic evil witch often show scenes of death and destruction, while those of a neutral good witch tend to be of joyous events or occasions. A creature cannot be subject to another vision until the current vision has either come to pass or been prevented. A witch cannot use this ability on herself. Unwilling creatures receive a Will save to negate the vision.",
			"",
			"**Waxen Image (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 68](source/advanced_player's_guide)): The witch can spend a full-round action to create a crude and unnerving wax duplicate of a creature she can see within 30 feet. Once the image is complete, the subject must make a Will save. If the subject fails, the witch gains a small measure of control over the creature. Whenever she exercises this control, the creature receives a new Will save to end the effect. This effect occurs on the witch's turn and does not impede the creature's actions on its turn. The witch can use the waxen image a number of times equal to her Intelligence modifier before it melts. As a standard action, the witch can cause the subject to do any one of the following things: move up to the creature's speed in any direction, attack itself once with any weapon in hand (this attack automatically hits), lay down on the ground, or drop anything held. Alternatively, she can spend one of her uses to simply torture the image, causing the creature to be both sickened and staggered on its turn. As soon as the creature has succeeded on a saving throw against this effect, it is immune to it for 24 hours. The is an enchantment (compulsion) effect.",
			"",
			"**Weather Control (Su)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 69](source/advanced_player's_guide)): A witch with this hex can use control weather once per day, but creating the weather takes 1 full hour of chanting, dancing, and communing with her familiar.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Bounty (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): The witch may bless a bush, plant, or tree that is planted in the ground, so that it creates a plentiful harvest. Each day at dawn, this blessed bush grows a number of goodberries equal to twice her witch level. Berries on the tree remain until they are picked, but the tree can never manifest a number of berries greater than twice her level at one time. The witch may only have one witch's bounty active at a time, but can shift her blessing to a new plant with a ritual requiring 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Brew (Ex)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 82](source/ultimate_magic)): When the witch uses her cauldron to brew a potion, she may spend double the cost to create 2 identical potions that day instead of just 1. At 15th level, she may spend triple the cost to create 3 identical potions that day. The witch must have the cauldron hexcauldron to select this hex.",
			"",
			"**Witch's Charge (Su)** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source/champions_of_purity)): Once per day when preparing spells, a witch can designate a willing creature as her charge. She gains a constant status effect on this creature and can target it with beneficial touch spells from a range of 30 feet. The creature remains her charge until she designates a new one.",
			"",
			"**Withering (Su)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 10](source/potions_and_poisons)): The witch causes a creature within 30 feet to age rapidly, empowering the witch in the process. The target ages to the next age category (adult to middle-aged, and so on). The witch gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + her witch level and a +2 enhancement bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution for a number of hours equal to her Intelligence modifier. These effects last for a number of hours equal to the witch's level. A creature cannot be aged past venerable age by this hex, and it can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect altogether. Once a creature has successfully saved against the withering hex, it cannot be affected by it again."

			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Deflection Field (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): Whenever the psychic casts a linked spell that grants her a deflection bonus to AC, she can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to automatically reflect the first ranged attack that misses her (as long as the linked spell remains active) back at the attacker. This reflected attack uses the original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychic's caster level.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Pulse (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic) spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.",
			"",
			"**Dual Amplification (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.",
			"",
			"**Mimic Metamagic (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.",
			"",
			"**Space-rending Spell (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as [dimension door](spell/dimension_door)). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Subordinate Spell (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level - 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.",
			"",
			"**Synaptic Shock (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Targeting (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): By spending 2 points from her phrenic pool, the psychic can target any creature with which she is in telepathic communication (whether via her *telepathic bond* ability, a creature's telepathy ability, or another effect) with the linked spell, even if the creature would normally be out of range. The linked spell must have the mind-affecting descriptor and must have a range of touch or greater.",
			"",
			"**Turning Shield (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of [spell turning](spell/spell_turning) for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell."

			"At 12th level, a mesmerist can choose one of the following masterful tricks in place of a mesmerist trick. He gains an additional masterful trick every 2 levels thereafter. Using a masterful trick consumes two uses of the mesmerist trick class feature instead of one.",
			"",
			"**Allay Pain** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject of this trick gains DR 15/- against one attack that deals nonlethal damage. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is hit with an attack that deals nonlethal damage.",
			"",
			"**Avian Escape** ([Occult Adventures pg. 43](source/occult_adventures)): The subject changes shape to elude an attacking enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an enemy's attack. The subject transforms into a bird (as [beast shape III](spell/beast_shape_3). Though the subject can appear as any Tiny bird, it uses the statistics for a raven. This is a polymorph effect.",
			"",
			"**Concealing Veil** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): When this trick is triggered, the subject is affected by a [nondetection](spell/nondetection) spell for 1 round per mesmerist level.",
			"",
			"**Cursed Sanction** ([Occult Adventures pg. 43](source/occult_adventures)): A ward curses an enemy who attacks the subject. While this trick is implanted, a visible, circular symbol appears on the subject's forehead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. The attacker takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks for 1 minute per mesmerist level (Will negates). This penalty applies to the triggering attack roll. This is a curse effect.",
			"",
			"**Faked Death** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The subject appears to die, but actually can stealthily move about. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is damaged by an attack. The subject seems to fall down dead (as [programmed image](spell/programmed_image)), but actually turns invisible (as [invisibility](spell/invisibility)) for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until she attacks. Once the subject becomes visible again, the illusory dead body disappears. These are illusion effects, and a creature that interacts with the false body can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The false body is a figment; the invisibility is a glamer.",
			"",
			"**Free in Body** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): When constrained, the subject can easily slip loose. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins its turn grappled or under an effect that impedes its movement (including paralysis, solid fog, slow, and web). The subject gains the benefits of [freedom of movement](spell/freedom_of_movement) for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Mask Misery, Greater** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): This trick functions as the mask misery trick, but can be used to ignore greater conditions as well. A mesmerist must have the mask misery mesmerist [trick](class/ability/tricks) to take greater mask misery.",
			"",
			"**Mental Fallback** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): Mental commands placed deep in the subject's mind trigger when she would fall under mind control, allowing the mesmerist to control her instead. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a charm or compulsion effect created by an enemy. The subject acts as though the mesmerist had cast the spell instead of the enemy. For instance, if the subject were affected by [charm monster](spell/charm_monster) cast by an enemy, that enemy can't try to give her orders, but the mesmerist could. If the charm or compulsion causes penalties or conditions (such as those imposed by confusion, crushing despair, or hold person), the subject can ignore any of those penalties or conditions the mesmerist chooses. This trick overrides the charm or compulsion for a number of rounds equal to the mesmerist's level or until the duration of the triggering effect elapses, whichever comes first. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Blend** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Stealth check while in an area of dim or darker light. The subject gains total concealment from all enemies (50% miss chance) as long as it remains within areas of dim or darker light. Against creatures with darkvision, the subject gains concealment (20% miss chance) rather than total concealment. Once triggered, this effect lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level or until the subject enters an area of normal or brighter light.",
			"",
			"**Spatial Switch** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist allows himself and an ally to physically swap places. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an enemy moves adjacent to or attacks either the subject or the mesmerist, provided the subject and the mesmerist are within 100 feet of one another. The subject and the mesmerist then swap positions. If this trick was triggered by an attack, the swap happens before checking to see whether the attack hits. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself. This is a conjuration (teleportation) effect.",
			"",
			"**Spell Anticipation** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist can choose a spell to strike back at enemy spellcasters. When the mesmerist implants this trick, he must expend one spell slot to couple a spell he knows of that level with the trick. That spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less and be able to target one creature (spells like dominate person that have more restrictive targeting can be used, but have no effect if triggered against creatures that don't match). He can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an enemy's spell. The mesmerist's spell then triggers, affecting only the enemy spellcaster. This takes effect only if the enemy spellcaster is within range of the spell (as measured from the subject of the trick), and functions as though the mesmerist were in the subject's square. The enemy's spell still has its full effect, even if the mesmerist's spell would normally protect against it or make the caster unable to cast it.",
			"",
			"**Umbral Transformation** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject of this trick turns into a living shadow for 1 round, as if affected by shadow body. After this trick ends, the subject is staggered for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Vision of Blood** ([Occult Adventures pg. 44](source/occult_adventures)): When an enemy is struck by the subject, it believes its wound is far more severe, and the shock overwhelms it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject hits with an attack using a weapon, a natural weapon, or an unarmed strike. The attack's target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. If the triggering attack was a critical hit, the target doesn't get a saving throw.",
			"",
			"**Willful Ignorance** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): The subject gains the ability to tell one undetectable lie. When the subject attempts to lie, the mesmerist can trigger this trick. That particular lie resists truth-detecting magic, and creatures attempting to use such magic must succeed at a caster level check against a DC equal to 15 + the mesmerist's class level to succeed; failure means the magic doesn't detect the subject's lie or force her to speak only the truth."

To attempt to assassinate a target, the ninja must first study her target for 1 round as a standard action. On the following round, if the ninja makes a sneak attack against the target and the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. This attempt automatically fails if the target recognizes the ninja as an enemy. If the sneak attack is successful and the target of this attack fails a Fortitude save, it dies.

For each additional successful attack roll beyond the first, the ninja increases the damage by 1d6. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this advanced talent.

			"## Ninja Tricks",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)  ",
			"As a ninja continues her training, she learns a number of tricks that allow her to confuse her foes and grant her supernatural abilities. Starting at 2nd level, a ninja gains one ninja trick. She gains one additional ninja trick for every 2 levels attained after 2nd. Unless otherwise noted, a ninja cannot select an individual ninja trick more than once.",
			"",
			"Tricks marked with an asterisk (&ast;) add effects to a ninja's sneak attack. Only one of these tricks can be applied to an individual attack and the decision must be made before the attack is made.",
			"",
			"**Bleeding Attack&ast; (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the ninja's sneak attack. Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleed damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleed damage bypasses any DR the creature might possess.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Range (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ninja trick increases the range at which she can deal sneak attack damage by 10 feet. A ninja can take this trick more than once. Its effects stack.",
			"",
			"**Ki Block&ast; (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can prevent a creature from using its ki pool. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, the target must make a Will save or be unable to spend any points from its ki pool for a number of rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The number of points in the target's ki pool is unaffected, and abilities that do not require the subject to spend ki still function.",
			"",
			"**Pressure Points&ast; (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can strike at an opponent's vital pressure points, causing weakness and intense pain. Whenever the ninja deals sneak attack damage, she also deals 1 point of Strength or Dexterity damage, decided by the ninja. Unlike normal ability damage, this damage can be healed by a DC 15 Heal check. Each successful check heals 1 point of damage caused by this trick. A ninja with this trick receives a +10 insight bonus on this Heal check.",
			"",
			"**Slow Reactions&ast; (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Opponents that are damaged by the ninja's sneak attack can't make attacks of opportunity for 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Acrobatic Master (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) As a swift action, a ninja with this trick can focus her ki to grant her a +20 bonus on one Acrobatics check of her choice made before the start of her next turn. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.",
			"",
			"**Arcane Backfire (Su)** ([Heroes from the Fringe](source/heroes_from_the_fringe)) When a ninja with this trick successfully attacks a creature that is holding a magic item that has a number of charges or uses per day, she can attempt a Use Magic Device check (DC = 20 + the item's CL) to cause the item to lose either one daily use or a number of charges equal to the number of the ninja's sneak attack dice.",
			"",
			"**Blood Debt (Su)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) A ninja with this ability gains [In Harm's Way](feat/in_harm's_way) as a bonus feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites. When the ninja intercepts an attack using this feat, she can spend 1 ki point to impose a blood debt on the aided ally. The ninja's ki pool is reduced by 1 until she ends this effect, which she may do as an immediate action. If the ninja ends the blood debt in response to a successful attack against her by a creature the indebted ally threatens, the ally (who must be willing) takes full damage from that attack and any associated effects instead of the ninja.",
			"",
			"**Breath of the Ancestors (Su)** ([Legacy of Dragons](source/legacy_of_dragons)) The ninja chooses one imperial dragon type (forest, sea, sky, sovereign, or underworld) when she gains this trick, and the choice can't be changed. She can use supplies similar to those used for ninja smoke bombs to produce an alchemical breath weapon that deals the same kind of damage as the selected dragon (piercing damage for forest dragons, fire for sea dragons, and so on). The breath weapon deals the same amount of damage as the ninja's sneak attack, with a Reflex save allowed for half damage. The breath weapon is a 15-foot cone (or a 30-foot line if the underworld dragon is selected). The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's class level + the ninja's Intelligence modifier. Using this ability is a standard action that expends up 2 ki points, and once used it cannot be used again for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Choking Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Whenever a ninja throws a smoke bomb, all living creatures in the resulting cloud must make a Fortitude save or become staggered by the choking black smoke for 1d4 rounds. The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. The ninja can decide to create an ordinary smoke bomb or add poison to this smoke bomb as normal. The ninja must have the poison bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.",
			"",
			"**Combat Trick (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja who selects this trick gains a bonus combat feat.",
			"",
			"**Darkvision (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) This trick allows the ninja to use her ki to enhance her sight, granting darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Using this trick is a standard action that costs 1 ki point. The enhanced senses last for 1 hour.",
			"",
			"**Deflect Arrows (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja who selects this ninja trick gains the [Deflect Arrows](feat/deflect_arrows) feat as a bonus feat. The ninja must have the [Improved Unarmed Strike](feat/improved_unarmed_strike) combat feat before taking this trick.",
			"",
			"**Fast Stealth (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can move at full speed using the Stealth skill without penalty.",
			"",
			"**Feather Fall (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) As an immediate action, the ninja can slow her descent as if using [feather fall](spell/feather_fall). This ability uses her ninja level as the caster level. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.",
			"",
			"**Flurry of Stars (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can expend 1 ki point from her ki pool as a swift action before she makes a full-attack attack with shuriken. During that attack, she can throw two additional shuriken at her highest attack bonus, but all of her shuriken attacks are made at a -2 penalty, including the two extra attacks.",
			"",
			"**Forgotten Trick (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can recall one trick taught to her by her ancient masters. When she uses this ability, she selects one ninja trick (not a master trick or rogue talent) that she does not know and can use that ninja trick for a number of rounds equal to her level. She must pay any ki costs associated with the trick as normal. Using this ability expends 2 ki point from her ki pool, plus the ki cost of the trick she chooses.",
			"",
			"**Herbal Compound (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A ninja with this trick can consume specially prepared herbs to strengthen her mind. The ninja can spend 1 ki point and smoke, eat, or inject an herbal compound as a move action. The ninja takes a -2 penalty to AC and on Reflex saves but gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Will saves for 10 minutes per ninja level.",
			"",
			"**Hidden Weapons (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this ability can easily conceal weapons on her body. The ninja adds her level on opposed Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal a weapon. In addition, she can draw hidden weapons as a move action, instead of as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**High Jumper (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) When a ninja with this trick makes a high jump, the DC for that jump is half the normal DC. The ninja must have the acrobatic master trick before taking this talent.",
			"",
			"**Kamikaze (Su)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) A ninja with this ability strikes without concern for her own well-being. The ninja can spend 1 point from her ki pool to give her unarmed strikes and any weapons she wields the vicious weapon special ability for 1 round per level. The ninja can spend 1 ki point to dismiss this effect.",
			"",
			"**Ki Charge (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) A ninja with this trick can invest a portion of her ki into a single thrown weapon, such as a shuriken, and throw it as a standard action. The thrown weapon explodes on impact in a 5-foot burst, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage plus 1d6 points of fire damage for every four levels of the ninja above 2nd, to a maximum 4d6 at 18th level. Creatures caught in the blast receive a Reflex save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + the ninja's Charisma modifier. If the thrown weapon hits a creature, that creature takes a -2 penalty on the saving throw. If the thrown weapon misses, treat it as a thrown splash weapon. Using this ability expends 1 ki point from her ki pool.",
			"",
			"**Ki Venom (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook](source/martial_arts_handbook)) A ninja with this trick knows how to make poisons from innocuous herbs or minerals. Creating ki venom is a full-round action that costs 1 ki point. The poison lasts for 24 hours before becoming inert. The poison deals either Strength or Dexterity damage, chosen when the venom is created. The ninja can spend additional ki as part of the process of creating the ki venom to improve the venom in one or more of the following ways: spend 1 ki point to increase the damage die to a d6, spend 1 ki point to change the ability damage dealt to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma damage, or spend 1 ki point to increase the number of saves required to cure the poison by 1.",
			"",
			">**Ki Venom:** *Type* poison, injury; *Save* Fortitude DC = 10 + 1/2 the ninja's level + her Charisma modifier  ",
			">*Frequency* 1/round for rounds equal to the ninja's Charisma modifier.  ",

			"",
			"**Poison Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) Whenever the ninja throws a smoke bomb, she can decide to include 1 dose of any inhaled poison she possesses. This poison affects all creatures in the smoke and lasts as long as the smoke lasts. She must pay for the poison normally. The ninja must have the smoke bomb ninja trick before selecting this trick.",
			"",
			"**Redirect Force (Ex)** ([Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)) If the ninja has a feat that allows her to attempt a combat maneuver without provoking attacks of opportunity, she can choose to provoke them anyway when she performs that maneuver. If she does so and takes damage from the attack of opportunity, the ninja adds the damage as a bonus on her attack roll instead of as a penalty.",
			"",
			"**Rogue Talent** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja can select a rogue talent in place of a ninja trick. The ninja cannot select a rogue talent that has the same name as a ninja trick. The ninja can select this talent multiple times.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Clone (Su)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja can create 1d4 shadowy duplicates of herself that conceal her true location. This ability functions as mirror image, using the ninja's level as her caster level. Using this ability is a standard action that uses up 1 ki point.",
			"",
			"**Slow Metabolism (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) The ninja has a slower-than-normal metabolism. She can hold her breath for twice as long as normal before needing to make Constitution checks (four times her Constitution score). In addition, whenever the ninja is poisoned, the time between saving throws (the poison's frequency) is doubled. Thus, a poison that has a frequency of -1/round for 6 rounds' would instead be -1/2 rounds for 12 rounds.-",
			"",
			"**Smoke Bomb (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat](source/ultimate_combat)) This ability allows a ninja to throw a smoke bomb that creates a cloud of smoke with a 15-foot radius. This acts like the smoke from a smokestick. The ninja can center this smoke on herself, or throw the bomb as a ranged touch attack with a range of 20 feet. Using this ability is a standard action. Each use of this ability uses up 1 ki point.",

		"description": [
			"While all paladins have their own codes of conduct, either taught by an order, handed down from the gods, or inspired by personal conviction, an oathbound paladin devotes herself to a singular cause, which grants her additional powers but also gives further edicts she must follow. An oathbound paladin swears an oath to eradicate a certain kind of evil. This powerful oath gives her access to new spells and adds to or alters typical paladin abilities.",
			"",
			"An oathbound paladin can take multiple oaths, but none of the other oaths can replace or alter the same class feature from the paladin class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin cannot take the Oath against Corruption and the Oath against the Wyrm because they both replace the aura of courage class feature.",
			"",
			"Paladins who take up an oath may make a sacred promise to their god or temple to perform some specific and grand action associated with the oath. For example, an oathbound paladin who takes the Oath of Vengeance may be tasked with killing the orc warlord who razed her home city, while a paladin with the Oath against the Wyrm may be asked to secure a nonaggression pact with a family of dragons. When a paladin completes the sacred promise, the oath is fulfilled, and she may abandon the oath if she so chooses; she may then select another oath or become a standard paladin or a different paladin archetype.",
			"",
			"If a paladin violates the code of her oath, she loses the class abilities associated with that oath until she atones. If she violates her paladin's code, she loses her oath abilities as well as her other paladin abilities.",
			"",
			"An oathbound paladin has the following class features.",
			"",
			"**Deity:** Some oaths are especially compatible with the faiths of certain deities; these deities are listed here. Other deities may allow these oaths as well, though only rarely do deities allow oaths conflicting with their teachings.",
			"",
			"**Code of Conduct:** The oathbound paladin must abide by the listed tenets of her oath in addition to the specifics of her god's code of conduct. In some cases, a deity's or paladin order's code may conflict with the oath's tenets; in most cases, these conflicts mean the oath is unsuitable for a paladin of that deity or order (such as the Oath against the Wyrm with respect to a good dragon deity or a dragon-riding order of paladins) and cannot be selected by the paladin.",
			"",
			"**Oath Spells:** A paladin's oath influences what magic she can perform. An oathbound paladin adds one spell to the paladin spell list at each paladin spell level she can cast (including spell levels for which she would only gain spells per day if her Charisma were high enough to grant bonus spells of that level). Her oath determines what spell is added to the spell list. If the paladin has multiple oaths, the spells from each oath are added to her spell list.",
			"",
			"If an oathbound paladin has more than one oath, she may prepare any one of her oath's spells in that slot (similar to a cleric choosing one of her two domain spells to prepare in a domain spell slot).",

			"| [Oath against the Whispering Way](oath/oath_against_the_whispering_way) | Detect Evil, 3rd-level Mercy, 9th-level Mercy, Aura of Resolve, Aura of Justice | A variation of the Oath against undead geared towards fighting the Whispering Way |",

			"| [Oath of Loyalty](oath/oath_of_loyalty) | Smite Evil | To most paladins, their word is everything. When they say something, it will be done. Those who take this oath put that ideal to the test every day. |",
			"| [Oath of the Mendevian Crusade](oath/oath_of_the_mendevian_crusade) | Aura of Resolve, Divine Bond, 9th-level Mercy | A variation of the Oath against Fiends dedicated to closing the Worldwound |",
			"| [Oath of the People's Council](oath/oath_of_the_people's_council) | Class Skills, Smite Evil, Aura of Justice, Holy Champion | Paladins swearing the oath of the People's Council serve the common good by finding and thwarting those who abuse their authority. |",
			"| [Oath of the Skyseeker](oath/oath_of_the_skyseeker) | Smite Evil, Divine Bond, Aura of Justice, Aura of Faith | Paladins with the oath of the skyseeker swear to defend the Sky Citadels their people retain and to help reclaim those the dwarves have lost, hoping to one day rebuild them on the greatest, most honorable ideals of the dwarven gods. |",

			"At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch's patron adds new spells to a witch's list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.",

			"A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.",

			"---",
			"",
			"**Biokinetic Healing (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic casts a linked spell from the transmutation school, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to regain 2 hit points per level of the linked spell.",
			"",
			"**Complex Countermeasures (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 60](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to increase by 2 the DCs of concentration checks or caster level checks the linked spell requires enemies to attempt. For example, if the linked spell were [nondetection](spell/nondetection), the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.",
			"",
			"**Conjured Armor (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool, the psychic grants any creature she conjures or summons with the linked spell a +2 deflection bonus to AC. This bonus lasts for 1 round per caster level or until the creature disappears, whichever comes first. This amplification can be linked only to conjuration (calling) or conjuration (summoning) spells. The bonus increases to +3 at 8th level and to +4 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"**Defensive Prognostication (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): When casting a divination spell, the psychic sees a glimmer of her future. By spending 1 point from her phrenic pool as she casts a divination spell, she gains a +2 insight bonus to AC for a number of rounds equal to the linked spell's level. She can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. This amplification can be linked only to divination spells.",
			"",
			"**Dragon's Breath (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to change a linked spell that has a line or burst area of effect into a 30-foot cone that emanates from the psychic's mouth as a breath weapon.",
			"",
			"**Focused Force (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): When casting a force spell, the psychic can increase the spell's damage by spending 1 point from her phrenic pool. Increase the die size for the spell's damage by one step (from 1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, 1d8 to 1d10, or 1d10 to 1d12). This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.",
			"",
			"**Intense Focus (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any concentration check she attempts as part of casting the linked spell. She can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Mind's Eye (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Some psychics train their visual and psychic senses, binding them together into a unified focus to better guide their ranged spells and place them with uncanny precision. While casting a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, the psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool and gain a +4 insight bonus on the attack roll. The psychic can spend 1 additional point to ignore penalties from cover (but not total cover).",
			"",
			"**Mindshield (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to give one target of the linked spell a +2 morale bonus on Will saves for 1 round per psychic level (maximum 10 rounds). The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.",
			"",
			"**Mindtouch (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of [detect thoughts](spell/detect_thoughts)). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.",
			"",
			"**Ongoing Defense (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can increase the duration of spells that improve her psychic defenses. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when she casts any [intellect fortress](spell/intellect_fortress), [mental barrier](spell/mental_barrier), [thought shield](spell/thought_shield), or [tower of iron will](spell/tower_of_iron_will) spell to extend the spell's duration by 1 round.",
			"",
			"**Overpowering Mind (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to increase the Will save DC of the linked spell by 1. At 8th level, she can choose to instead spend 4 points to increase the DC by 2. At 15th level, she can choose to instead spend 6 points to increase the DC by 3. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor and require a Will saving throw.",
			"",
			"**Perfect Body (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Some practitioners of psychic techniques extend their training to improve their bodies as well as their minds. When the psychic casts a linked transmutation spell, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on her next Reflex or Fortitude save.",
			"",
			"**Phrenic Strike (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): As long as the psychic has at least 1 point in her phrenic pool, she can attempt an unarmed strike in place of a touch attack as part of casting a spell with a range of touch. This unarmed attack still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless the psychic can otherwise make unarmed attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Defense (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Reading small, invisible cues allows the psychic to take advantage of social circumstances and subtly influence her target. Casting a linked spell during a social encounter and spending 1 point from her phrenic pool allows the psychic to add a +4 bonus on her next Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check.",
			"",
			"**Psychofeedback (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to sacrifice a linked spell of 2nd level or higher. Doing so grants the psychic a +1 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution per level of the sacrificed spell. This bonus lasts for 1 minute per psychic level.",
			"",
			"**Relentless Casting (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.",
			"",
			"**Telempathic Restoration (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic casts [telepathic bond](spell/telepathic_bond), she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove the dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, or stunned condition from one target of the bond. Doing so removes the status from the target of the linked spell, but applies it immediately (with any remaining duration) to the psychic.",
			"",
			"**Transfer Fear (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source/occult_origins)): When the psychic successfully affects a target with a fear effect, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove a fear effect from herself or one ally with whom she is in telepathic contact.",
			"",
			"**Undercast Surge (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): When the psychic undercasts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows [mind thrust III](spell/mind_thrust_3) but not [mind thrust IV](spell/mind_thrust_4) could cast [mind thrust II](spell/mind_thrust_2) and spend 2 points to treat it as [mind thrust III](spell/mind_thrust_3), but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as [mind thrust IV](spell/mind_thrust_4). This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.",
			"",
			"**Whisper of Ancients (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The psychic can send her consciousness into the Astral Plane for a glimpse of synchronous information. While casting a linked divination spell, the psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any associated skill check. She can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Will of the Dead (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source/occult_adventures)): Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor."

			"**Artificial Ascension** ([Occult Realms pg. 12](source/occult_realms)): You can upload your consciousness into a robot, becoming an artificial intelligence. Performing this ascension requires uninterrupted access to a construct with the robot subtype and at least 10 Hit Dice for 24 hours, during which time you cannot perform other tasks. Any interruptions cause the upload to fail. At the end of the 24 hours your consciousness is successfully uploaded into the robot. If the robot is not willing, it must attempt a Will save (DC = 1/2 your psychic level + your Intelligence modifier). If it is successful, the robot rejects your consciousness, rendering you staggered for 24 hours and unable to perform the ritual again during this time.",

			"If your consciousness is successfully uploaded, the robot's consciousness is destroyed and your physical body immediately dies and can't be raised, resurrected, or otherwise brought back to life. Your creature type changes to artificial intelligence, and your robot body gains the aggregate template, with all the adjustments made in the template's description.",

If the robot is not willing to serve as your vessel, it receives a Will save as above, except if it succeeds, your current robot body is staggered for only 1 minute. If it fails, you move from your current body to the new host body, granting it the aggregate template. Your previous robot body is immediately destroyed by the transference.",

			"**Disease Transference (Su)** ([Occult Realms pg. 12](source/occult_realms)): You are able to psychically control and manipulate all manner of diseases. You can cast diagnose disease as a spell-like ability at will. Additionally, you can touch a creature afflicted with a disease as a standard action and draw the disease into yourself, or transfer it to another willing living creature that is susceptible to diseases and that you (or the afflicted creature) are also touching. Attempt a caster level check against a DC equal to 10 + the disease's Fortitude save DC. If you are successful, the afflicted creature is no longer affected by the disease. If you move the disease into yourself or another creature you (or the afflicted) are touching, the target receiving the disease must immediately attempt a Fortitude save as if it were initially exposed to the disease. If the target fails, the disease affects it immediately with no onset time. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier. You must be at least 7th level to select this discovery.",

If you spend 2 points from your phrenic pool, the force field provides a number of temporary hit points equal to 10 + your psychic level (maximum 20 temporary hit points). The force field lasts for a number of minutes equal to your psychic level. If you spend 3 points from your phrenic pool, the force field lasts for twice as long, and it provides fast healing 2.

As a standard action, you can sacrifice an unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray of laser energy, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of fire damage plus an additional 1d6 points of fire damage for every level of the spell slot you sacrificed. You can't sacrifice 0-level spells in this manner.

			"## Ranger Traps",
			"",
			"Rangers are legendary for their ability to hunt down and capture their prey. Some rangers can create elaborate traps out of scraps, vines, and perhaps a little bit of specialized magic. Characters can learn how to set these traps by taking the [Learn Ranger Trap](feat/learn_ranger_trap) feat or by having the [trapper](class/archetype/ranger/trapper) ranger archetype.",
			"",
			"Setting a trap is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A trap fills a single 5-foot square, and cannot be placed in the same area as another ranger trap or a magical trap such as a glyph of warding. The ranger only needs simple materials to create the trap, such as a piece of cloth, a small amount of metal (such as a dagger, iron spike, or a few nails), a foot of rope or vine, and so on. The DCs for Perception checks to notice the trap, Disable Device checks to disable it, and for saving throws to avoid it are equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's level + the character's Wisdom bonus. All ranger traps are Trigger: location, and Reset: none.",
			"",
			"Ranger traps are either extraordinary or supernatural; extraordinary traps are Type: mechanical, and supernatural traps are Type: magic.",
			"",
			"Some of the traps listed below may be set as extraordinary traps or as magical (supernatural) traps; learning such a trap lets a ranger set it either way. An extraordinary trap has a -2 penalty to its DC. An extraordinary trap lasts 1 day per ranger level or until it is triggered, whichever comes first. A magical trap lasts only 1 hour per level or until triggered, whichever comes first. A trap's DC decreases by 1 for each full day (or hour, for a magical trap) that passes after it is set.",
			"",
			"Certain traps add to or modify the effects of another trap; a ranger can add one of these trap types to any standard ranger trap (this costs 1 additional use of the trap ability).",
			"",
			"Some supernatural traps can be created by a character who isn't a ranger (but who has the [Learn Ranger Trap](feat/learn_ranger_trap) feat) through including an additional magical component. This component-usually a scroll, potion, or oil-is expended at the time of the trap's creation. Including it increases the time to lay the trap to 1 full minute.",
			"",
			"### Acid Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is splattered with acid, taking a number of points of acid damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level to the triggering creature (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a dose of acid when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of [corrosive touch](spell/corrosive_touch)*",
			"",
			"### Alarm Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** When the trap is triggered, it also creates a momentary loud noise equivalent to the audible alarm version of [alarm](spell/alarm).",
			"",
			"### Anchoring Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Demon Hunter's Handbook](source/demon_hunter's_handbook)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap can be added to a supernatural *snare trap*. The trap briefly imprisons any called creature (such as those called by the [planar binding](spell/planar_binding) spells) for 1d4 rounds (Will negates). During this time the creature may not move from the location of the trap, though it may still use ranged effects and attack any creature within its reach. Additionally, anchoring traps disable the creature's ability to travel within or between dimensions. This includes casting [astral projection](spell/astral_projection), [blink](spell/blink), [dimension door](spell/dimension_door), [dimensional gate](spell/dimensional_gate), [ethereal jaunt](spell/ethereal_jaunt), [etherealness](spell/etherealness), [gate](spell/gate), [maze](spell/maze), [plane shift](spell/plane_shift), [shadow walk](spell/shadow_walk), [teleport](spell/teleport), [teleportation circle](spell/teleportation_circle), and similar spell-like abilities. The trap does not prevent the creature from using magic items that produce these effects, like [cubic gates](magic/wondrous/cubic_gate), [helms of teleportation](magic/armor/helm_of_teleportation), or [amulets of the planes](magic/wondrous/amulet_of_the_planes). The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold by one size category.",
			"",
			"### Blightburn Trap (Ex)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap strikes the target with a small shard of [blightburn](magic/material/blightburn), dealing 2d6 points of fire damage, 1d3 points of Constitution damage, and 1d3 points of Charisma damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the ability damage and halves the fire damage. The ranger must supply a sliver of blightburn, a dangerous task in itself, though storing the blightburn in a lead vial makes the task less risky.",
			"",
			"### Blighted Mark Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [People of the Wastes](source/people_of_the_wastes)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect This trap stains the victim with blighted plant matter, increasing its susceptibility to the attacks of creatures created or enthralled by the affliction. The target takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class against the attacks of creatures closely affiliated with the specific blight (typically demons, fey, plants, or undead) and on saving throws against effects created by such creatures. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per ranger level. A successful Will save negates this effect. Regardless of whether this is a extraordinary or supernatural trap, the ranger must supply a sample of the specific blight when setting this trap.",
			"",
			"### Bludgeoning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ranged Tactics Toolbox](source/ranged_tactics_toolbox)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap bludgeons the creature that triggers it. The trap makes an attack with a bonus equal to the ranger's character level + his Wisdom bonus. The triggering creature is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC if it was unaware of the trap. If the trap hits, it deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage for every 4 levels the ranger possesses (minimum 1d6). If it's an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide an object suitable for dealing lethal bludgeoning damage, such as a large branch or heavy stone.",
			"",
			"### Burning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a *fire trap*. If the triggering creature fails its Reflex save, it catches on fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn for 1d4 rounds. The burning creature can attempt a new save as a full-round action. Dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +4 bonus on this save.",
			"",
			"### Channeled Energy Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap creates a positive or negative energy effect designed to harm either undead or living creatures, respectively. The target takes a number of points of damage equal to 1d8 + the ranger's level from either positive energy or negative energy (Will save for half). If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a vial of [holy water](equipment/weapon/holy_water) (positive energy) or unholy water (negative energy).",
			"",
			"### Cleansing Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [People of the Wastes](source/people_of_the_wastes)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect The trap suppresses the target's ability to use one randomly selected attack, ability, or quality that creates a disease or poison effect; this lasts for 1 round per ranger level. If the creature has more than one such attack, ability, or quality that creates a disease or poison effect, the attack, ability, or quality to be suppressed when the creature is affected by this trap is determined at random from those not already suppressed.",
			"",
			"### Decoy Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ranged Tactics Toolbox](source/ranged_tactics_toolbox)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap creates a shadowy humanoid figment that appears to move away from the triggering creature or that follows a simple program of no more than 25 words defined by the ranger at the time when the trap is set. Unless programmed otherwise, the figment appears 60 feet away from the triggering creature or as close to that distance as possible, and then moves away toward the nearest exit, if any. The figment can move up to 60 feet per round. A viewer can attempt a Will save or a Perception check to disbelieve the illusion if she attacks it or otherwise interacts with it. The Will save DC to disbelieve the illusion is the same as the DC to avoid the trap; the DC of the Perception check to disbelieve the illusion is equal to 5 + the DC to avoid the trap.",
			"",
			"### Dirty Trick Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ranged Tactics Toolbox](source/ranged_tactics_toolbox)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** If the triggering creature fails its saving throw against the trap or is struck by the trap's attack, the trap also attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver against the triggering creature. The type of dirty trick is chosen when the trap is created, and if it isn't possible or isn't applicable to the triggering creature, the combat maneuver is wasted. The trap's CMB for the dirty trick is equal to the ranger's level + his Wisdom modifier.",
			"",
			"### Distraction Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is affected with irritation that detracts from its alertness. It takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks, initiative checks, and Reflex saves for 10 minutes per ranger level. If this is a supernatural trap, this is a mind-affecting effect. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a dose of [itching powder](equipment/weapon/itching_powder) or another alchemical irritant.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of [daze monster](spell/daze_monster)*",
			"",
			"### Exploding Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a *fire trap*. The trap explodes in fire, filling all squares adjacent to the trap and dealing a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an explosive material such as [alchemist's fire](equipment/weapon/alchemist's_fire) when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"### Fire Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap explodes in flames, dealing a number of points of fire damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level to the triggering creature (Reflex negates). If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an explosive material such as [alchemist's fire](equipment/weapon/alchemist's_fire) when setting the trap.",
			"",
			"### Firework Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can add this augmentation to a *fire* or *smoke trap*. The trap explodes in a flash of colored lights. All creatures within 10 feet must succeed at a saving throw (Fortitude if an extraordinary firework trap, Will if supernatural) or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an alchemical weapon when setting the trap, such as [flash powder](equipment/weapon/flash_powder) or a [firework](equipment/weapon/firework).",
			"",
			"### Freezing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap creates a burst of ice that damages and encases the triggering creature. The creature takes 1d3 points of cold damage + 1/4 the ranger's level and is entangled and stuck to the ground, similar to the effect of a tanglefoot bag. A successful Reflex save halves the damage and means the creature is not stuck to the floor by the ice. The ice is 1 inch thick per 2 Hit Dice of the ranger (minimum 1), has hardness 0 and 3 hit points per inch of thickness, and melts in 2d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"### Infected Snare Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [People of the Wastes](source/people_of_the_wastes)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Effect A ranger can add this only to a snare trap. The snare is made of diseased materials, which contain an aggressive blight that saps the energy and bodily health from the target creature. When initially caught in the snare, the trapped creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or immediately take 2 points of Constitution damage. Each subsequent hour, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take 2 points of Constitution damage. This effect lasts for 12 hours or until the creature makes two successful saving throws in a row, whichever comes first. This is a poison effect.",
			"",
			"### Lazurite Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** Lazurite radiation increases the victim's susceptibility to the attacks of undead creatures that are bolstered by the radiation. The target takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class against the attacks of undead creatures and on saving throws against effects created by undead. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per ranger level. A successful Will save negates this effect. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a [sliver of lazurite](equipment/material/lazurite).",
			"",
			"### Limning Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap sprays glowing dust into the trapped square and all adjacent squares. A creature covered in this dust glows like a candle (becoming visibly outlined if invisible) and takes a -20 penalty on Stealth checks. The dust's effects last for 1 round per ranger level or until the creature washes it off (a move action requiring water or some other cleanser). If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use alchemical components when setting the trap, such as [glowing ink](equipment/misc/glowing_ink) or [marker dye](equipment/misc/marker_dye).",
			"",
			"### Marking Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** If the triggering creature fails its save against the trap, it is marked with a dye and/or scent of the ranger's choosing. A scent mark decreases the DC of tracking the marked creature by scent by 4. The mark can be washed off with vigorous scrubbing, but fades on its own over several days.",
			"",
			"### Oversized Barbs (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is speared with barbs that penetrate and protrude from its body, making squeezing, climbing, and swimming challenging. The trap implants 1d4+1 barbs, each dealing 1 point of damage. A successful Reflex save halves the number of barbs. The target takes a penalty on Climb checks and Swim checks equal to the number of barbs attached, and is considered one size category larger for the purposes of determining what size of opening or passageway it must squeeze through as long as at least 1 barb remains attached. Each barb can be removed with a full minute of work and a Heal check that equals or exceeds the trap's DC. If this check fails, the barb is still removed but the target takes 1d4 points of damage. The barbs shake loose harmlessly after 10 minutes per ranger level.",
			"",
			"### Penetrating Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can only add this to a wounding trap. The damage die of a penetrating trap increases to 1d8. Choose either adamantine, cold iron, or silver. The trap counts as that material for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide 1 pound of the chosen material during the trap's construction.",
			"",
			"### Pit Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This simple pit is covered over with leaves or appropriate materials for the area. It's 5 feet deep plus 5 feet for every 4 ranger levels. A victim that succeeds at a Reflex save doesn't fall into the pit. If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger can set this trap only in terrain with soft ground.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of [create pit](spell/create_pit)*",
			"",
			"### Poison Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap poisons the creature that triggers it. If it is a supernatural trap, the poison deals 1d2 Con damage per round for 6 rounds. If it is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide 1 dose of contact, inhaled, or injury poison when setting the trap, and the trap uses that poison's effects and DC.",
			"",
			"### Quicksand Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap and all adjacent squares become quicksand as long as they contain loose sand or soil. The Swim DC to move in this quicksand is equal to the trap's save DC, and the Swim DC to tread in the quicksand is equal to the trap's DC - 5. The quicksand lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger's level. When the effect ends, any creature still in the quicksand is returned to the surface prone.",
			"",
			"### Rust Monster Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap throws up a cloud of dust ground from the antennae of a rust monster, dealing 1d4 points of damage to the target's metal armor and weapons. A ranger may increase the damage by 1 point for each additional daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap. A successful Reflex save negates this damage. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply a set of [rust monster antennae](monster/rust_monster).",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of [rusting grasp](spell/rusting_grasp)*",
			"",
			"### Selective Trigger (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The ranger adds a race, type, alignment, or minimum weight restriction to the trap's trigger. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger can choose only the minimum weight restriction.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *potion of [identify](spell/identify)*",
			"",
			"### Sleet Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The detonating trap creates a 20-foot-radius burst of sleet with the effects of a [sleet storm](spell/sleet_storm). The driving sleet lasts for 1 round, but the icy ground persists for 1 round per ranger level.",
			"",
			"### Smoke Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap bellows out thick, choking smoke that fills the trapped square and all adjacent squares. Any breathing creature in these squares must succeed at a Fortitude saving throws or take a -4 penalty to Strength and Dexterity every round it's within the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the smoke. The smoke lasts for 1 round per 2 ranger levels, and is dispersed by wind as fog cloud. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use an alchemical component when setting the trap, such as a [smokestick](equipment/misc/smokestick).",
			"",
			"### Snare Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap constricts around a limb or other part of the triggering creature's body (Reflex avoids). The creature cannot move from the location of the trap, unless the ranger included a \"leash\" when setting the trap, in which case the creature is limited to the length of the leash. The trapped creature can escape with an Escape Artist check (DC equal to the trap's DC) as a full-round action. The trap or its leash has a number of hit points equal to 1/2 the ranger's level, or can be burst as a full-round action with a DC 25 Strength check. The trap can hold up to a Medium creature; each extra daily use of the ranger's trap ability spent when the trap is set increases the maximum size of creature the trap can hold. At the ranger's option, if there is a tall object or structure nearby, she can have the trap lift the creature.",
			"",
			"### Spell-Stealing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is struck by a burst of abjuration that steals its magical ability. The target loses 1d4+1 levels of spells (of its choice). A ranger may increase the number of spell levels lost by 1d4 for each additional daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap.",
			"",
			"**Magical Component:** *scroll of [dispel magic](spell/dispel_magic)*",
			"",
			"### Spell-Storing Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap behaves like a [greater glyph of warding](spell/greater_glyph_of_warding), except the maximum level of spell it can hold is 1. A ranger may increase the maximum level by 1 for each daily use of his trap ability he spends when creating this trap. The spell contained must be supplied by either the ranger or another creature within 1 round of the trap being laid. The duration of this trap is dependent on the ranger's level, but a target receives only one save, that of the spell contained.",
			"",
			"### Summoned Ally Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ranged Tactics Toolbox](source/ranged_tactics_toolbox)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap summons a creature as [summon nature's ally I](spell/summon_nature's_ally_1) with a caster level equal to the ranger's level - 3. This trap functions as [summon nature's ally II](spell/summon_nature's_ally_2) at 8th level, [summon nature's ally III](spell/summon_nature's_ally_3) at 11th level, and [summon nature's ally IV](spell/summon_nature's_ally_4) at 14th level. The summoned creature or creatures appear in a location within the trap's range designated when the trap is set; if it's not possible for the creatures to appear in that location, they appear in the nearest unoccupied space. The ranger can choose a command of no more than 25 words when the trap is created; the creature or creatures follow those instructions, or otherwise attack the creature that triggered the trap.",
			"",
			"### Swarm Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap releases a [bat swarm](monster/bat_swarm), [rat swarm](monster/rat_swarm), or [spider swarm](monster/spider_swarm) that attacks all creatures in the area. The swarm remains in the general area for no longer than 1 round per ranger level, after which it disperses. If the trap is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must provide the creatures of the swarm (typically in a small box, cage, or crate); these creatures may die of starvation before the trap is triggered (an extraordinary trap lasts 1 day per level).",
			"",
			"### Tar Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The target is coated in a thin layer of sticky tar unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. It is entangled, and becomes susceptible to catching fire from any source of flame. If lit on fire, the tar burns intensely for 1 round; it deals 2d6 points of fire damage and is destroyed in the process. Unless burned away, the tar remains for 1 round per ranger level. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must supply [a dose of tar](equipment/misc/tar).",
			"",
			"### Telepathy Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Demon Hunter's Handbook](source/demon_hunter's_handbook)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** The trap resonates at a high-pitched frequency audible only to creatures that communicate via telepathy. If the triggering creature has the ability to communicate via telepathy, the creature becomes overwhelmed by psychic feedback. The trapped creature is staggered for 1d4 rounds (Will negates), and may not communicate telepathically during this time. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Creatures that lack telepathy are not affected by this trap, though they may still trigger it.",
			"",
			"### Toxic Fumes Trap (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Champions of Balance](source/champions_of_balance)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A ranger can add this to a smoke trap. The smoke this trap creates is extremely noxious. Any breathing creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (in addition to the Fortitude save for the smoke trap) or be nauseated every round it's within the smoke and for 1d4+1 rounds after leaving the smoke. If this is an extraordinary trap, the ranger must use a toxic material when setting the trap, such as [noxious aromatic](equipment/misc/noxious_aromatic).",
			"",
			"### Transdimensional Trap (Su)",
			"",

			"### Transpositional Trap (Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Demon Hunter's Handbook](source/demon_hunter's_handbook)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This pair of traps causes any creature that steps in one of the traps to be teleported to the location of the other trap (Will negates), as the spell [dimension door](spell/dimension_door). After having been transported, the creature may not take any other actions until its next turn. If one part of a pair of transpositional traps becomes blocked by a solid body or object, the trap does not function until the obstruction is removed. In order to create this trap, a ranger must set up two transpositional traps within 400 feet of each other, thus expending 2 uses of the ranger's traps per day. A ranger can only have one pair of transpositional traps set at a time; setting a third transpositional trap immediately causes the first to disappear and keys the second and third transpositional traps to one another.",
			"",
			"### Tripwire (Ex or Su)",
			"",
			"**Source** [Kobolds of Golarion](source/kobolds_of_golarion)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** A taut wire stretched between two vertical surfaces knocks the target prone unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. A running or charging creature takes a -6 penalty on its save.",

			"",
			"**Source** [Magical Marketplace](source/magical_marketplace)",
			"",
			"**Effect:** This trap makes a melee attack against the target using the ranger's base attack bonus + his Wisdom modifier for the attack roll. It deals an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the ranger's level. The ranger chooses whether this damage is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. If this is a supernatural trap, the attack counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction."

			"**Sever Alignment&ast; (Su)** ([Distant Realms pg. 13](source/distant_realms)): When making a sneak attack against an opponent with an alignment subtype, a slayer with this talent can forgo her sneak attack damage to scramble the creature's metaphysical nature. If the attack succeeds, the slayer deals weapon damage as normal, and the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier) or lose all damage reduction overcome by aligned weapons (such as DR 10/good), lose all regeneration overcome by aligned sources (such as regeneration 10 [good]), and lose the ability to cast spells and use spell-like abilities with alignment descriptors for 1 round for every 2d6 points of sneak attack damage the slayer would have dealt (minimum 1 round). The slayer must have the aligned sneak attack talent to select this talent.",

A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 of the slayer's level + the slayer's Intelligence modifier). Against creatures with multiple types of movement, the slayer must choose which movement type to affect. If the slayer affects a creature's flight movement, its maneuverability is reduced by one step; if it's airborne at the time, it falls unless it succeeds at a DC 10 Fly check. If the slayer targets a creature already affected by this ability, its speed and maneuverability are not further reduced; the slayer may either extend the duration of that effect by 1d4 rounds or choose another movement type to affect (keeping track of the duration of each affected movement separately).",

			"",

			"",
			"**Castling (Ex)** ([Elemental Master's Handbook pg. 9](source/elemental_master's_handbook)): The slayer treats soft cover granted by creatures of her size or larger as though it were cover instead. Cover the slayer gains from this talent does not allow her to attempt Stealth checks.",
			"",
			"**Catfolk Rogue Talent** ([Dirty Tactics Toolbox pg. 22](source/dirty_tactics_toolbox)): A catfolk slayer can select one of the following catfolk [rogue talents](class/ability/rogue_talents) in place of a slayer talent: deadly scratch, graceful faller, nimble climber, or vicious claws. Any talent effects based on rogue level use the slayer's class level. The slayer must fulfill any prerequisites.",

			"**Experience Across Ages (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 18](source/martial_arts_handbook)): (Samsaran only.) Once per day, a samsaran slayer can draw upon insights from his previous lifetimes to help identify a foe or recall a key piece of information.

When the slayer studies a target, he can immediately reduce the number of additional studied targets he can maintain. Reducing this number does not require an action. For each target reduced in this way, the DC of poisons used against his studied target increases by 1. The slayer must be at least 6th level and have the poison use talent to select this talent.",

			"**Inured to Terror (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 18](source/martial_arts_handbook)): (Samsaran only.) With their knowledge of the cyclical nature of existence, there are few experiences that can daunt samsaran slayers for long. As an immediate action when a slayer fails a saving throw against a fear effect, he can attempt the saving throw a second time to reduce the severity of the effect from panicked to frightened, frightened to shaken, or shaken to unaffected. Additionally, the DC of Intimidate checks to demoralize him increases by 2.",

			"",
			"**Jaguar's Pounce (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 4](source/heroes_of_golarion)): When a slayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage, he can attempt a disarm or trip combat maneuver as an immediate action as if the target were flat-footed (losing its Dexterity bonus to CMD). This combat maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The slayer must have the jaguar's grace talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Jaguar's Protection (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 4](source/heroes_of_golarion)): When a slayer with this talent deals sneak attack damage, he draws the target's attention away from his allies.

			"",
			"**Mountainside Ambush (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 18](source/martial_arts_handbook)): (Samsaran only). Fighting in the mountains of Zi Ha has trained samsaran slayers to strike the unwary with deadly attacks from above. If a slayer deals sneak attack damage to a creature that is unaware of his presence while he is standing on higher ground than his target, he does not have to roll sneak attack damage; instead, the sneak attack deals maximum damage. The samsaran must be standing on solid ground to use this ability.",
			"",
			"**Mystic Veil (Sp)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 18](source/martial_arts_handbook)): (Samsaran only.) Samsaran slayers are adept at obscuring the passes of their mountain homes from intruders. The slayer can cast silent image as a spell-like ability once per day for every 2 slayer levels he has, using his slayer level as his caster level. The slayer uses his Intelligence modifier on concentration checks when using this ability, and the DC to disbelieve the illusion is equal to 11 + the slayer's Intelligence modifier. The slayer must have an Intelligence score of at least 11 to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**One of Those Faces (Sp)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 21](source/spymaster's_handbook)): Each day, you can use disguise self as a spell-like ability for up to 10 minutes per character level.

Additionally, once you have used this ability, whenever you use it for the next 24 hours you must take the same alternate appearance.",
			"",
			"**Poison Use (Ex)** ([Blood of Shadows pg. 8](source/blood_of_shadows)): The slayer is trained in the use of poison, and can't accidentally poison herself when applying poison to a weapon.",
			"",
			"**Ranger Combat Style (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 53](source/advanced_class_guide)): The slayer selects a ranger combat style (such as archery or two-weapon combat) and gains a combat feat from the first feat list of that style. He can choose feats from his selected combat style, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites. At 6th level, he may select this talent again and add the 6th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the list. At 10th level, he may select this talent again and add the 10th-level ranger combat feats from his chosen style to the list.",
			"",
			"**Recall Training (Ex)** ([Martial Arts Handbook pg. 18](source/martial_arts_handbook)): (Samsaran only.) By calling on the memories of previous incarnations, a samsaran slayer can use martial techniques that transcend his usual capabilities. Once per day, the slayer can take a move action to gain the benefit of a combat feat he doesn't have. This effect lasts for 1 minute per slayer level he has. The slayer must meet all the feat's prerequisites.",
			"",
			"**Redirect Poison (Ex)** ([Potions and Poisons pg. 13](source/potions_and_poisons)): The slayer can divert poisoned attacks against him. When a creature unsuccessfully attacks the slayer with a poisoned weapon or a natural weapon that would poison him, the slayer can attempt to redirect the attack to a creature within his reach (including, possibly, the creature that unsuccessfully attacked the slayer). As an immediate action, the slayer can make an attack roll against the creature to which he would redirect the poison. On a success, the poison is redirected to the target, and the target must attempt a saving throw against the poison as normal. This attack only redirects the poison and does not otherwise damage the targeted creature. This ability cannot affect a creature that attacked the slayer with a poisoned natural weapon, but it can affect a creature that attacked him with a poisoned manufactured weapon.",
			"",
			"**Rogue Talent** ([Advanced Class Guide pg. 53](source/advanced_class_guide)): A slayer can select one of the following [rogue talents](class/ability/rogue_talents) in place of a slayer talent: *bleeding attack, camouflage, cloying shades, combat trick, demand attention, emboldening strike, extinguishing strike, fast stealth, feint from shadows, finesse rogue, firearm training, focusing attack, gloom magic, greater gloom magic, grit, hard to fool, lasting poison, mien of despair, obscuring blow, poison use, powerful sneak, rogue crawl, shadow duplicate, shadow's chill, slow reactions, snap shot, sniper's eye, surprise attack, swift poison, terrain mastery, trap spotter, umbral gear, underhanded trick, unwitting ally,* or *weapon training*.

			"",
			"**Scrying Familiarity (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 23](source/spymaster's_handbook)): You are well acquainted with scrying sensors. You can roll twice and take the better result on saving throws against divination (scrying) spells and effects, on Perception checks to notice scrying sensors, and on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance when you use a scrying spell or effect. If you notice a magical sensor, you can attempt a Stealth check opposed by the caster's caster level check to avoid being detected by the sensor.",
			"",
			"**Sticks and Stones (Ex)** ([Ultimate Wilderness pg. 86](source/ultimate_wilderness)): The slayer gains [Catch Off-Guard](feat/catch_off-guard) as a bonus feat.",
			"",
			"**Studied Ally (Ex)** ([Advanced Class Origins pg. 21](source/advanced_class_origins)): The slayer can study an ally or friendly creature he can see as a move action. The slayer gains a +1 bonus on checks and attack rolls to use the aid another action to help with that ally's skill checks, attacks, or AC. This bonus increases at the same rate as a slayer's studied target bonus. At 7th level, a slayer can study an ally as a move or swift action.

The vigilante gains the [Brilliant Planner](feat/brilliant_planner) feat except he can spend up to 100 gp per character level for his brilliant plan fund and only requires 1 minute to enact his brilliant plan. In addition, while in a settlement for at least 1 week, he can spend 24 hours and up to 500 gp per character level to create a stash somewhere within the settlement. Once per day, the vigilante can take 1 hour to retrieve a stash, retrieving any number of items that would have been available in a settlement he visited at the time of making the stash, regardless of the weight of the items. Once he retrieves a stash in this way, he subtracts the price of the items from the stash's value and the stash is exhausted and lost, regardless if he used the full value of the stash. The vigilante can maintain any number of stashes, but a stash is lost if he does not spend 1 hour to maintain the stash at least once per month. A vigilante's stash is well-hidden and only the vigilante knows the location of a stash he creates.",

If he already has ranks in a particular Knowledge skill, he gains a +4 bonus on checks with that skill. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Any Guise (Su)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 10](source/ultimate_intrigue)): A vigilante can use his everyman social talent to disguise himself as any specific person, even a king or high priest. Furthermore, if the actual individual wouldn't normally be able to be found via magic (such as by being dead or protected from divinations designed to locate the individual), such divinations always find the vigilante instead. A vigilante must be at least 17th level and have the everyman social talent to select this talent.",

The vigilante must have the songbird talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Beginner's Luck (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antihero's_handbook)): The vigilante appears so harmless and innocent that onlookers dismiss his incredible abilities as nothing more than beginner's luck. When the vigilante uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity, he can add the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise to his Disguise check to fool onlookers, so long as the number of onlookers witnessing him is no greater than his vigilante level. The vigilante's PC allies do not count as onlookers (and at the GM's discretion, a closely allied NPC might not count as an onlooker, either). He loses this bonus against onlookers who have already witnessed him using a vigilante talent in his social identity within the last week.",
			"",
			"**Bellflower Innuendo (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent has learned to pass secret messages more efficiently by observing the coded messages of the Bellflower Network or another secret organization. He can pass a secret message with Bluff in the same amount of time it would normally take to convey the message without encryption. The words and meaning of his secret messages cannot be gleaned from him or those he directly delivered the message to by divinations unless the caster succeeds at a caster level check (DC = 15 + the vigilante's level).",

			"**Case the Joint (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 10](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can use his social identity to learn important facts about a location before returning later in his vigilante identity. If he spends at least 1 hour in a location while in his social identity, he can attempt a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) check. If he succeeds, he gains the ability to later reroll any one failed skill check involving the location's layout (such as a Stealth check to sneak into the location, a Disable Device check to disable an alarm, or a Sleight of Hand check to snatch an object from a pedestal). For every 10 by which the check exceeds 20, the vigilante gains an additional reroll. If the vigilante fails to return to the location within 1 week, the situation changes too much and he cannot use the rerolls. A vigilante can't case the same joint more than once a week.",
			"",
			"**Celebrity Discount (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 10](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity is popular enough to receive discounts in his area of renown. Whenever he buys an item in his area of renown that costs 500 gp or less, he can buy it at 90% of the market price, rather than the full price. If he has the great renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 2,000 gp, and if he possesses the incredible renown social talent, the gp limit increases to 8,000 gp. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Celebrity Perks (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is a celebrity in his area of renown, and adoring fans are all too eager to shower him with the fundamental necessities. While within his area of renown, he can always receive common meals or lodging (worth up to 1 gp per meal or night) for free, and can avoid paying taxes or bribes of 1 gp or less. If he wants a particular nonmagical item worth 1 gp or less, he can spend 1d10 minutes interacting with people in his area of renown to receive the item from a fan (if he ever sells such a gift from a fan, he loses this social talent permanently). If he has the great renown social talent, he can receive gifts of up to 5 gp, receive fine food and lodgings (worth up to 10 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 10 gp or less. If he has incredible renown, he can receive gifts of up to 25 gp, receive exquisite food and lodgings (worth up to 100 gp per meal or night) for free, and avoid paying taxes or bribes of 100 gp or less. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Companion to the Lonely (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): Whether religiously motivated, as are followers of Arshea, Calistria, or Shelyn, or for purely carnal reasons, physical intimacy helps the vigilante cope with the loneliness of his double life. Once per day, the vigilante can spend at least 1 hour engaged in acts of physical pleasure with a willing partner to gain a pool of morale points equal to his Charisma bonus or his partner's Charisma bonus, whichever is higher. For the next 24 hours, the vigilante can spend a morale point as an immediate action to roll a Charisma-based skill check or a Will saving throw again after rolling the die but before learning the consequences; he must take the second result even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"**Conflicted Identity (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antihero's_handbook)): The vigilante's mind is in a constant state of turmoil, which makes him even more ethically and morally fluid than other vigilantes. When targeted by a harmful spell or effect that would affect the vigilante in his current identity but not his other identity (or when he would suffer a lesser effect in his other identity), he has a 50% chance of being affected as though he were in his other identity. This chance is rolled when the spell or effect is cast or triggered and before any spell resistance roll, if applicable. For example, if a vigilante has a lawful-neutral social identity and a neutral vigilante identity, he has a 50% chance of taking only half damage from a chaos hammer spell while in his social identity, since he would always take only half damage from a chaos hammer spell when in his vigilante identity.",
			"",
			"**Discreet Inquiries (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): The vigilante can attempt Diplomacy checks to gather information without being obvious he is seeking any, whether by buying the silence of informants or by talking foes into revealing information without realizing they are doing so. While the vigilante is in his area of renown, gathering information in this way takes 2d4 hours and costs 2d4 gp. Anyone who might take notice of the information gathering does not notice unless she succeeds at a Sense Motive check opposed by the vigilante's Bluff check. The vigilante gains a +4 bonus on this Bluff check.",
			"",
			"**Double Time (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day's work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he's chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Entrepreneur (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymaster's_handbook)): Select any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. The vigilante can use the selected skill to earn money as if he were using a Profession skill. If he selects Perform or Profession, the vigilante instead gains the skill unlock powers for those skills as appropriate for his number of ranks in that skill (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 82). If he has the social graceUI social talent, he can apply this benefit to all skills selected with the social grace talent.",
			"",
			"**Everyman (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to properly play the part of the individual. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the many guises social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Feign Innocence (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the innocence spell. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Gossip Collector (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 &times; 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn't allow him to gather information that isn't available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.",
			"",
			"**Great Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns).

			"",
			"**Guise of Life (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymaster's_handbook)): An undead vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of one living creature identical to the vigilante's appearance in life. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were a living creature, and he counts as living for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be a living creature, and remains vulnerable to positive energy and spells that effect undead. The vigilante must be a corporeal undead creature to select this talent. Humanoid vigilantes with the negative energy affinity racial trait can also select this talent, gaining a human social identity.",
			"",
			"**Guise of Unlife (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source/spymaster's_handbook)): A vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of an undead version of one of his existing social identities, such as a ghoul, vampire, or zombie. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were undead, and he counts as undead for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be an undead creature, and remains vulnerable to negative energy and spells that effect the living. The vigilante must be a living creature to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Hidden Magic (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antihero's_handbook)): The auras of magic items the vigilante is carrying are hidden (as per magic aura). The vigilante can suppress or reactivate this effect as a standard action. At 11th level, the vigilante and any magic items he is carrying appear to be nonmagical (as if he had cast greater magic aura). The vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Immediate Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can change identities as a move action, and he no longer needs to spend extra time to adjust his appearance and persona. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and must have the quick change social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**In Vogue (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's crafting or professional business is always at the height of the local trends, allowing the vigilante to gain more profits than usual. Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time and social grace social talents to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Incredible Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities.

			"",
			"**Kalistocrat's Acumen (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent must follow the dietary and sexual prohibitions of the Prophecies of Kalistrade (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 237) in his social identity or he loses the talent's benefit until he atones. He can treat settlements as one size category larger when determining their base values and purchase limits.

At 15th level, the vigilante can treat settlements as four size categories larger for the above purposes.",
			"",
			"**Loyal Aid (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week.",
			"",
			"Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Many Guises (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Mockingbird (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration spells. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to choose this talent.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Mask (Su)** ([Chronicle of Legends pg. 7](source/chronicle_of_legends)): The vigilante's physical form in his vigilante identity can differ significantly from that of his social identity, within the norms for his race&mdash;this can include changes to the vigilante's proportions, coloration, gender characteristics, and other physical characteristics. This increases the vigilante's bonus from seamless guise by 2 for every significant change, as per the Disguise skill. The vigilante always assumes the same form when using this ability. A vigilante with multiple natural forms, such as a [kitsune](race/kitsune), can alter each of his forms using this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Notorious Fool (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antihero's_handbook)): While in his social identity, the vigilante can feign absentmindedness, clumsiness, drunkenness, or eccentricity very convincingly. When he fails an opposed Sleight of Hand or Stealth check while in his social identity, he can immediately attempt a Bluff check opposed by the onlookers' Sense Motive checks to appear as though he had only blundered or stumbled in a spectacular fashion. If he succeeds at this Bluff check, the onlookers do not realize the vigilante was attempting the action that prompted him to attempt a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, although being in the wrong place or behaving in an inappropriate manner may still have negative consequences. This talent is ineffective against any onlooker who has already witnessed the vigilante faking a blunder within the last 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Obscurity (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante is relatively unknown socially. In fact, he makes a point of keeping the life of his social identity as ordinary as possible. This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks). ",
			"",
			"**Owl's Sight (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The vigilante gains low-light vision. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks in low light. The vigilante also gains a +2 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks at night.",
			"",
			"**Quick Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check. A vigilante must be at least 7th level to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village, if using settlement population ranges on page 203 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skill description on pages 93- 94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.",
			"",
			"**Safe House (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn't have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can't be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell. At 7th level, this protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house. At 13th level, the entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a mage's private sanctum.",
			"",
			"**Seemless Shapechanger (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante seamlessly adopts any persona he assumes with magic. The vigilante adds his seamless guise bonus to the bonus on Disguise checks that he gains to assume the shape of another creature with a polymorph spell or effect. A vigilante must have the shapechanger subtype to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Skill Familiarity (Ex)** ([Disciple's Doctrine pg. 23](source/disciple's_doctrine)): The vigilante choses four skills when he gains this talent. He can take 10 on checks with his chosen skills even when distracted or threatened. If he takes 10 on checks with these skills while not distracted or threatened, he gains a bonus on the check equal to one-quarter his vigilante level (minimum +2). A vigilante must be at least 9th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Social Grace (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante selects any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with the selected skill. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Songbird (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The vigilante gains the use of [animal messenger](spell/animal_messenger) once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to his character level. He also gains Handle Animal as a class skill.",
			"",
			"**Subjective Truth (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth. A vigilante must be at least 9th level and have the feign innocence social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Transformation Sequence (Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante's transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions. A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn't be from his vigilante class). A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.",
			"",
			"**Triumphant Return (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Well-Known Expert (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source/spymaster's_handbook)): The vigilante's social identity is known as an expert in numerous fields, including areas and topics the vigilante hasn't actually taken the time to study. As a result the vigilante is skilled at encouraging others to discover solutions to difficult problems themselves by asking probing questions, while appearing to give the information himself. ",
			"",
			"In his social identity, the vigilante can take 10 when attempting to aid another on Appraise, Craft, and Knowledge checks. He also gains a bonus equal to half his class level (minimum +1) on Bluff checks to appear knowledgeable in Appraise, Craft (all), and Knowledge (all). If he has the renownUI social talent, he grants a +3 bonus when he successfully aids another on these skill checks, rather than +2. ",
			"",
			"In his area of renown, the vigilante's social identity is so trusted as an expert that scholars are inspired to make amazing deductions and intuitive leaps in discussions with him. A creature that has already failed a Knowledge check on a specific subject can attempt one additional check to gain information on the same topic if it receives an aid another bonus from the vigilante when doing so."

If the attack hits, the monk can attempt a free combat maneuver check against the foe (using the base attack bonus of the attack used to hit the foe). If the check is successful, the foe is knocked 10 feet directly away from the monk. This distance increases by 10 feet for every 5 by which the check exceeds the foe's CMD, to a maximum distance equal to the monk's fast movement bonus. This movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The foe stops moving if it strikes another creature, barrier, or otherwise solid object. The creature is not knocked prone by this movement. The monk must attack with a kick to use this style strike.",

			"Swashbucklers and gunslingers perform impressive deeds through their grit and panache, but some are capable of truly spectacular acts known as renowned deeds. A swashbuckler or gunslinger (though not members of other classes) can select a renowned deed for her class upon reaching the class level listed in the deed's description. This replaces the specific listed deed or deeds; if the character would not gain the appropriate deeds, she cannot select the renowned deed, as if selecting an archetype.",

			"**Vengeful Heart (Ex):** Some swashbucklers are driven by vengeance above all else. At 1st level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's resolve class feature, treating her swashbuckler level as her samurai level. Whenever the swashbuckler spends a use of resolve, she must also spend a point of panache or a use of charmed life, or the use of resolve has no effect. This deed replaces the derring-do deed and one other 1st-level deed.",

			"**Hilt Hammer (Ex):** Precise strikes with a slender blade do little to hinder amorphous or incorporeal creatures; when encountering such threats, some swashbucklers abandon precision in favor of brutish strikes. At 3rd level, the swashbuckler can activate this deed before rolling the attack roll when making an attack that would benefit from precise strike. An attack altered this way deals only half the normal damage from precise strike, but this damage is not treated as precision damage. This deed alters (but does not replace) the precise strike deed and replaces one other 3rd-level deed.",

At 7th level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to move up to half her speed as a move action. If a creature makes an attack of opportunity against her due to this movement, she can attempt an Acrobatics check with a DC equal to the attacking creature's CMD. If she succeeds, the attack of opportunity misses, and the swashbuckler can make an attack of opportunity against the attacking creature instead. She can attempt to evade multiple attacks of opportunity during this movement, but the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 2 for each additional opponent that makes an attack of opportunity against her during this movement. If the swashbuckler has an ability that grants her additional attacks of opportunity, she can use them to respond to multiple missed attacks of opportunity with her own attacks. This deed replaces the swashbuckler's grace deed and one other 7th-level deed.",

			"**Vengeful Soul (Ex):** Sometimes vengeance can take years or even decades, forcing the aggrieved swashbuckler to push the limits of her endurance. At 11th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's greater resolve class feature. At 19th level, the swashbuckler gains the samurai's true resolve class feature. The swashbuckler must have the vengeful heart renowned deed to select this deed. This deed replaces the subtle blade and cheat death deeds, plus an additional 11th-level deed."

			"## Mesmerist Tricks",
			"",
			"**Source:** [Occult Adventures](source/occult_adventures)  ",
			"A mesmerist can create hypnotic bonds with his allies, implanting magical suggestions in their minds that he can later activate. Each day, he can implant a number of these tricks equal to 1/2 his mesmerist level (minimum 1) plus his Charisma bonus (if any). He can have only one trick implanted at a given time, and implanting a new trick ends the previous one (the mesmerist still loses the use of this ability he spent on the previous trick).",
			"",
			"To implant a trick, the mesmerist must take a standard action and either touch a willing creature or implant the trick in himself. A creature can be the subject of only one mesmerist trick at a time. The mesmerist can activate the trick as a free action when a triggering condition is met (as defined in the trick's description), even if it isn't his turn. The subject must be within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per level) for the mesmerist to trigger the trick. The mesmerist monitors for the trick's triggering condition through a subtle telepathic connection, so he doesn't need line of sight to trigger it&mdash;but anything that blocks telepathic contact prevents him from triggering tricks. An implanted trick lasts until the next time the mesmerist regains his spells.",
			"",
			"Once triggered, a trick is no longer implanted, and can't be triggered again until the mesmerist implants the trick again. The duration of the effect caused by triggering a trick is either instantaneous or appears in the trick's entry. The DC for any mesmerist trick or masterful trick that requires a saving throw or skill check is 10 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier.",
			"",
			"The mesmerist knows one trick at 1st level, and learns another trick at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter (to a maximum of 11 tricks at 20th level). Each daily use of mesmerist tricks can be used to implant any trick the mesmerist knows. Unless specifically noted in the mesmerist trick's description, a mesmerist can't choose a particular trick more than once.",
			"",
			"**Astounding Avoidance** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): The subject can avoid damage from magical and unusual attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw against an attack or spell that normally deals half damage on a successful save, before the subject rolls the save. If the subject succeeds at her save, she takes no damage. If the mesmerist is 12th level or higher, the subject takes only half damage if she fails her save. The benefits of this trick don't stack with those of the evasion or stalwart class features.",
			"",
			"**Break Stupor** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 18](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject is under an effect such as the fascinated condition or magical slumber as per the sleep spell that would be ended by the subject taking damage or by an obvious threat. The trick sends a momentary phantom threat and sensation of pain, ending the effect. This ability works fast enough to prevent a sleeping creature from falling prone or dropping what it is holding, if the mesmerist uses it immediately. The mesmerist can also trigger the trick if the subject becomes confused as per confusion, but if he does so, the subject attacks the mesmerist on its next turn, as if the mesmerist attacked the subject.",
			"",
			"**Chain of Eyes** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): The subject can share her senses with the mesmerist. The mesmerist triggers chain of eyes by closing his eyes and concentrating on the implanted subject, allowing the mesmerist to see and hear everything the target experiences with her own senses of sight and hearing (including any special senses or magical effects). Once triggered, chain of eyes lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until the mesmerist shifts his field of vision back to himself as a free action. While viewing events from the target's perspective, the mesmerist is flat-footed, even if he can see himself from another perspective.",
			"",
			"**Compel Alacrity** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A dash of mental speed lets the subject push past her physical limits to avoid an enemy. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject begins her turn within an enemy's reach. The subject can move 10 feet as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity. The distance the subject can move increases by 5 feet for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level. The subject can't move farther than her speed in this way. The movement from this trick doesn't count against the subject's movement speed for that round.",
			"",
			"**Enchanting Words** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 18](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject attempts a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to adjust a creature's attitude. The subject can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier instead of her own Charisma modifier on the check. If the subject uses Intimidate, the adjustment in attitude lasts an additional number of minutes equal to 10 &times; the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (minimum of 10 additional minutes).",
			"",
			"**False Flanker** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A duplicate of the mesmerist appears momentarily, as though he were fighting in tandem with the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into or begins her turn in a square where she threatens an enemy. An illusory duplicate of the mesmerist appears in any unoccupied space adjacent to that enemy. This duplicate counts as threatening the enemy for the purposes of determining flanking, but can't actually make attacks. The duplicate disappears at the end of the turn during which the trick is triggered. This is an illusion (figment) effect, and a creature that interacts with the false flanker can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect.",
			"",
			"**Fearsome Guise** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A veil of illusion makes the subject appear to be someone else and then transform into a hideous monster at an opportune time. While this trick is implanted, the subject's appearance is altered, as [disguise self](spell/disguise_self). The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attacks a creature. The illusory appearance briefly makes the subject appear monstrous, then ends. The mesmerist attempts an Intimidate check to demoralize the target of the triggering attack. The restrictions on attempts to demoralize a target (the target being within 30 feet and able to see and hear the creature attempting the Intimidate check) apply to the subject of the trick. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.",
			"",
			"**Fleet in Shadows** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the target enters an area with dim or darker light. The subject can move double its normal speed (up to an additional 30 feet) for 1 round, but only while moving through areas of dim or darker light. Additionally, the subject can move at its normal speed and use the bonus speed from this trick in areas of total darkness, even if it cannot see.",
			"",
			"**Gift of Will** ([Occult Adventures pg. 40](source/occult_adventures)): A small portion of the mesmerist's vast mental power buttresses his ally's mind. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Will saving throw or a Sense Motive check, or is targeted by an Intimidate check to demoralize her. For a saving throw, the subject uses the mesmerist's Will saving throw bonus instead of her own. For a Sense Motive check or Intimidate check, she adds the mesmerist's Charisma bonus as a morale bonus on the check or to the DC. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Levitation Buffer** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): A mesmerist's telekinetic assault renders foes around the subject less of a threat. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either an enemy moves adjacent to the subject or the subject begins her turn with one or more enemies adjacent to her. The mesmerist can either lift all enemies adjacent to the subject slightly into the air or push them all away from the subject. Lifting enemies causes them to move at half speed and take a -4 penalty to their CMDs against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts for 1 round (Will negates). The speed reduction and CMD penalty don't stack with those from hostile levitation. Pushing enemies away requires the mesmerist to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check using his mesmerist level + his Charisma modifier as his CMB. Any enemy that's successfully pushed moves away from the subject of the trick using the normal rules for a bull rush.",
			"",
			"**Life Revier** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 19](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts an Intelligence or Knowledge check to remember a previous experience. The subject receives flashes of her entire life up to this point. She can use the mesmerist's Charisma modifier in place of her Intelligence modifier on the check, and she can attempt the check untrained. The subject cannot learn information that she has not previously read, heard, or otherwise experienced at some point during her life when using this ability.",
			"",
			"**Linked Reaction** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): A hive mind allows the mesmerist and an ally to share one another's reaction times. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when either the subject or the mesmerist is surprised and the other isn't (even if the mesmerist would normally be unable to take actions because of being surprised). Both the mesmerist and the subject can act in this surprise round. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Mask Misery** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): The subject can shrug off a condition for a short time before succumbing to it. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject becomes affected by a minor condition listed under the touch treatment ability. The subject can ignore the effect of that condition for 1d4 rounds, after which the subject takes the full effect. This has no effect on any conditions affecting the subject other than the triggering condition, even if those other effects are also listed under touch treatment. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering effect still count against that effect's duration; if the duration of mask misery is longer than the effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the condition at all. If an effect that imposes more than one condition triggers this trick, the subject ignores all eligible conditions. If the mesmerist is 6th level or higher, he adds the moderate conditions to the conditions he can ignore with this trick, and this trick ends minor conditions entirely instead of suppressing them temporarily. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to choose or use this trick.",
			"",
			"**Meek Facade** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): The subject magically seems like a weak target, goading an enemy into attacking her. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject misses a creature with an attack (even if it's part of a full attack in which she hits that creature with another attack). The enemy must attack no one other than the subject, and the subject gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against the triggering enemy's attacks. Both of these effects last for 1 round. The bonus to AC increases by 1 for every 5 levels the mesmerist possesses. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect.",
			"",
			"**Mesmeric Mirror** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): An illusory image appears near the subject to throw off attackers. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is attacked or becomes the target of a spell that requires an attack roll. One duplicate of the subject appears, and the attacker must determine randomly which it hits (as [mirror image](spell/mirror_image)). For every 5 class levels the mesmerist possesses, one additional image appears, to a maximum of five images at 20th level. Each image lasts for 1 minute per mesmerist level or until destroyed. This is an illusion (figment) effect.",
			"",
			"**Mesmeric Pantomime** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): By orchestrating the movement of his ally's body, the mesmerist imparts to that ally his own skill at a physical task. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check. The subject either uses the mesmerist's bonus on the skill check in place of her own or gains a morale bonus on the check equal to the mesmerist's Charisma bonus, whichever results in a higher modifier. The mesmerist can't implant this trick on himself.",
			"",
			"**Misdirection** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): An enemy's perception of an attack by the subject shifts, making the foe unprepared to defend against the attack. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject makes an attack or uses a spell that requires an attack roll. The mesmerist attempts a Bluff check to feint against a single target of the subject's attack. Unlike a normal feint, this ability can be used on non-melee attacks. If the feint succeeds, the target of the attack is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The target doesn't suffer any additional effects that the mesmerist or the subject would cause on a normal feint or Bluff check. This is an illusion (glamer) effect.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Impression** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): Objects retain psychic impressions of those who come in contact with them, and a powerful mind can read these impressions. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject touches an object that another creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or more has touched in the last 10 minutes. The mesmerist receives a psychic impression of the emotional state of the last such creature to touch the object. This impression contains no images or languages and can't show the mesmerist who the creature was if the mesmerist doesn't already know.",
			"",
			"**Psychosomatic Surge** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): Psychic magic soothes the subject, alleviating her wounds temporarily. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage. The subject gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + 1/2 the mesmerist's level. If the damage from the triggering attack would have reduced the subject to 0 hit points or fewer, this trick grants an additional 1d8 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour or until discharged.",
			"",
			"**Reflect Fear** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is affected by a fear effect or is the target of an Intimidate check to demoralize it. When the trick is triggered, the subject suppresses the fear effect that triggered the trick for 1d4 rounds, and any creature that caused this effect must succeed at a Will save or become shaken for 1 round. The rounds during which the subject ignores the triggering fear effect still count against the effect's duration. If the duration of the reflect fear trick is longer than the fear effect lasts, the subject isn't affected by the fear effect at all.",
			"",
			"**Reflection of Weakness** ([Occult Adventures pg. 41](source/occult_adventures)): Psychic feedback causes an enemy to suffer from the same weakening effect it imposes on the subject. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when an attack or spell used by an enemy causes the subject to take ability damage, ability drain, bleed damage, or a minor or moderate condition listed under the touch treatment class feature. If the trick is triggered by ability damage, ability drain, or bleed damage, the amount of damage or drain the subject takes is reduced by 2 points (to a minimum of 0 points), and the creature that made the attack or cast the spell takes 2 points of ability damage to an ability score of the mesmerist's choice. The monster can attempt a Will save to negate the ability damage. This ability can be used if the attacker inflicts a curse, disease, or poison that deals ability damage or drain, but only if it deals that damage immediately, with no onset time. If the trick is triggered by the subject gaining a condition, the subject is still affected by the condition, but the attacker takes a condition of the mesmerist's choice for 1 round. This condition must come from the minor condition or moderate condition lists of the touch treatment class feature. The enemy can attempt a Will save to avoid gaining the condition. The mesmerist doesn't need to have touch treatment to select or use this trick.",
			"",
			"**See in Darkness** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject moves into an area of darkness.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Splinter** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): The mesmerist protects the subject against an attack and redirects the harm to someone else. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject takes damage from an attack. The damage the subject takes is reduced by an amount equal to 3 + the mesmerist's Charisma modifier (to a maximum of the total amount of damage the attack deals). Another creature within range of the original attack, other than the attacker, is affected by a shadow illusion that makes it appear as if the attacker is attacking that creature instead of the attacker's actual target. This second creature takes an amount of damage equal to the amount by which the attack's damage was reduced. This shadow doesn't require a roll to hit and ignores cover and concealment, but the target can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. If it succeeds at this save, it neither takes the damage nor believes the attacker targeted it. This trick can't be triggered if there's no eligible second creature within range to take the redirected damage. This is an illusion (shadow) effect.",
			"",
			"**Slip Bonds** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): While implanted with this trick, the subject gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks. If the subject becomes grappled, pinned, shackled, or otherwise personally restrained, the mesmerist can trigger the trick and cause the subject to become incorporeal just long enough to slip her bonds (unless they can otherwise restrain an incorporeal creature). This effect doesn't last long enough for the subject to move through walls or other barriers. If the mesmerist is 12th level, the subject remains incorporeal until the beginning of the mesmerist's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Spectral Smoke** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): A cloud of smoke pops up around the subject, foiling attacks. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by an attack or by a spell that requires an attack roll. A smoke cloud appears in the subject's square and in a 10-foot radius around it. This cloud lasts for 1 round per mesmerist level. The cloud functions as [fog cloud](spell/fog_cloud), but is an illusion (figment) effect that can't be dispersed by wind and can be used underwater. A creature that interacts with the cloud can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the effect. The radius of the cloud increases by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels the mesmerist possesses, to a maximum of 30 feet at 20th level.",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Link** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The subject can communicate telepathically with the mesmerist during a crisis. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject and her allies are outnumbered in combat. For 1 minute per mesmerist level, the subject and the mesmerist can communicate telepathically. If the subject and the mesmerist are more than a medium distance (100 feet + 10 feet per level) apart, the telepathic connection is severed and cannot be regained unless the trick is implanted again. The mesmerist and the subject must share a language to be able to communicate.",
			"",
			"**Umbral Shield** ([Occult Realms pg. 16](source/occult_realms)): The subject ignores any harmful effects of bright light or sunlight for 1 minute. The mesmerist can trigger this trick whenever the subject would be exposed to harmful bright light (such as sunlight is to a vampire). The subject is immune to the dazzled condition while this trick is in effect.",
			"",
			"**Unwitting Messenger** ([Occult Origins pg. 12](source/occult_origins)): The mesmerist describes a recipient to the subject while implanting this trick, then recites a verbal message no longer than five words per mesmerist level. The subject of unwitting messenger has no memory of the message or the target recipient. When the subject encounters the specified recipient, she repeats the message verbatim, but does not recall speaking the message or its contents. The message remains buried in the subject's subconscious for 24 hours, after which time it disappears if not delivered. The subject of unwitting messenger can be fooled by mundane disguises or illusions, causing her to deliver the message to the wrong recipient.",
			"",
			"**Vanish Arrow** ([Occult Adventures pg. 42](source/occult_adventures)): With a flourish, the mesmerist snatches a projectile from an enemy before it can be shot. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, before the attack roll is made. The mesmerist attempts a Sleight of Hand check opposed by the attacker's Perception check. If the mesmerist succeeds, that ranged attack automatically misses, and the projectile appears stowed on the mesmerist's person. If the attacker is making a full attack, this affects only one of the attacks (of the mesmerist's choice). If the attack is made with a javelin or other thrown weapon, the attacker gains a +4 bonus on its Perception check. Unusually massive ranged weapons (such as boulders or ballista bolts) and ranged attacks generated by natural attacks or spell effects are not affected by this ability.",
			"",
			"**Voice of Reason** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 9](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The subject can more easily pierce sight-based illusions with the mesmerist's aid. The mesmerist can trigger this trick when the subject attempts a saving throw to disbelieve a sight-based illusion effect, but only so long as the mesmerist is not affected by or has disbelieved the illusion himself. The subject receives an insight bonus on her saving throw to disbelieve the illusion equal to the mesmerist's Charisma modifier. This trick cannot be used for illusions that do not allow a saving throw."

			"Witch patrons are enigmatic entities, sometimes fair minded and other times malevolent. Some are demigods or powerful spirits, such as those that grant shamans their spellcasting. Others are manifestations of cosmic forces, created by the certainty of mortals and the fundamental need for balance in much the same way aeons manifest. While kindly patrons are rare-attracting worshipers more readily than agents-the majority are high-minded and neutral figures. They dispense arcane power to those whose interests and mindsets align with their needs, and once a witch drifts from the cause or refuses to pay the price for such power, her patron divests the spellcaster of her powers and departs. Wicked patrons enjoy longer-lasting relationships, however, manipulating the witches' minds and punishing disobedience in a manner far more personal than an evil god. The familiar of a wicked patron becomes equal parts power source and prison guard, forever studying its charge for disobedience.",
			"",
			"The various published witch patron themes present a wide array of concepts and priorities to align with a large variety of supernatural beings. Some specific patrons, however, might offer variations within the spells they grant. Special patrons swap out the spells normally provided by a patron theme at specific levels, and grant a specific hex and drawback at 1st level. Once a specific patron has been selected, a witch cannot change her patron or raise a hand against that entity without losing her spellcasting, hexes, and familiar. These categories are limited in the patron themes they can provide; their witches must select from one of the four listed for each entry. These patrons are extraordinary examples of their kind, often invested with unique or mythic powers and pursuing long-term agendas measured in centuries or eons.",

			"## Variant Channeling",
			"",
			"(Source: [Ultimate Magic](source/ultimate_magic))",
			"",
			"An iconic ability of clerics is their power to channel positive or negative energy, whether for healing, for damage, or to turn or command the undead. However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. The following categories are examples of alternative channeling abilities based on the nature of a deity's power; for example, a fire deity's negative energy channeling may deal fire damage as part of or instead of the damage from channeling.",
			"",
			"When you create a cleric character, decide whether she uses the standard form of channel energy or a variant presented here based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio. Once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. Variant channeling has the same area of effect, save DCs, uses per day, and other rules relating to channeling energy. Feats and abilities that modify or present alternative uses for channeled energy (such as Command Undead and Turn Undead) work normally with these variant channeling abilities.",
			"",
			"A variant channeling either modifies positive channeled energy when used to heal or modifies negative energy when used to harm. When using positive energy to heal, affected creatures gain only half the normal amount of healing but also receive a specific beneficial effect. When channeling negative energy to harm, affected creatures take only half the normal damage but take an additional penalty or harmful effect; a successful saving throw negates the additional penalty or effect but does not reduce the damage any further. Creatures that would normally ignore the effect of a particular channel (such as undead with respect to a positive energy channel used to heal) ignore the variant effect of that channel.",
			"",
			"Some variant channeling abilities are enhanced when used on particular creature types. Such channeling increases the normal healing or damage from channeled energy by 50% for that creature type, rather than the default half healing or damage for the alternative channeling. For example, a 7th-level cleric normally heals 4d6 points of damage with channeled positive energy; with the Nature alternative channeling, that cleric instead heals only half that amount (2d6) when channeling, but heals animals and fey an additional +50% over the unhalved value (4d6 + 50%).",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise stated, bonuses granted by a variant channeling are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. If an alternative channeled energy provides a \"channel bonus\" on rolls or statistics, the bonus is +1, increasing to +2 at cleric level 5 and for every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5). Likewise, a \"channel penalty\" is initially -1, increasing to -2 at cleric level 5 and every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of -5).",
			"",
			"A character who has the channel energy ability from a class other than cleric may use these variant channeling rules if the class's abilities are tied to serving a deity. For example, paladins can select alternative channeling abilities if they serve a deity, as can oracles with the Life mystery (as they serve many deities), but necromancer wizards cannot.",
			"",
			"The following is a list of example portfolios and the variant channeling abilities available to each.",

			"| Duty | Creatures gain a channel bonus on attacks of opportunity and bull rush and disarm attempts until the end of your next turn. | Creatures take a channel penalty on attacks of opportunity and bull rush and disarm attempts until the end of your next turn. |",
			"| Earth | Creatures gain a DR 1/adamantine until the end of your next turn. This DR improves by 1 at 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter. This does not allow recipients to overcome DR/adamantine with their own attacks. | All squares in the area are treated as difficult terrain for 1 minute. |",
			"| Envy | Creatures gain a channel bonus on disarm and steal combat maneuvers, Bluff checks, and Sleight of Hand checks for 1 minute. | Creatures must attempt a steal combat maneuver on their next turn against an adjacent enemy. This is a compulsion effect. |",

			"| Forge | Creatures in metal armor gain a channel bonus to Armor Class until the end of your next turn. Alternatively, you may repair damage to metal objects and metal constructs as if they were creatures, and this healing is enhanced. | The damage effect is enhanced against metal constructs and unattended metal objects. |",

			"Starting at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, a vigilante gains a vigilante talent. Unless otherwise noted, a talent can be selected only once. Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.",
			"",
			"---",
			"",
			"**Animal Patron (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 20](source/heroes_of_golarion)): The vigilante gains the benefits of one [minor shifter aspect](class/shifter) for a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + half his vigilante level. He can shift into this minor aspect as a swift action. The vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Another Day (Ex, Su)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): When the vigilante is dropped unconscious due to hit point damage, he automatically stabilizes, but he can also appear to be dead, unless an examining creature succeeds at a Heal check (DC = 20 + the vigilante's class level) or, if using magic such as deathwatch, a caster level check with the same DC (the ability to affect spells is supernatural; the rest of the ability is extraordinary). The vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the Constitution check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).",
			"",
			"**Aquatic Action (Ex)** ([People of the Wastes pg. 20](source/people_of_the_wastes)): The vigilante uses weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes in aquatic environments as though under the effect of freedom of movement, including when making melee attacks against targets in the water while the vigilante is on land. The vigilante ignores limitations and penalties on ranged attacks, including thrown weapons, imposed by being underwater for the first 15 feet. (See Underwater Combat on page 432 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information.) A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Armor Skin (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's armor is like a second skin. He doesn't apply the armor check penalty for light and medium armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks. This penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, he can move at full speed in medium armor.",
			"",
			"**Blind Spot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is so skilled at stealth, he can use the Stealth skill to hide from creatures with unusual senses that normally automatically detect creatures. This includes senses such as blindsense, blindsight, lifesense, scent, or tremorsense. For each such ability that the creature possesses, if the vigilante is not bypassing the sense in another way&mdash;such as the negate aroma spell for scent or flying for tremorsense&mdash;the creature gains a stacking +20 circumstance bonus on all Perception checks to notice the vigilante, rather than automatically noticing the vigilante. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 6th level can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Brutal Maneuver** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The first time each round that the vigilante uses a weapon, including a natural attack or unarmed strike, to perform a combat maneuver in place of making an attack (such as by performing a disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver in place of making a melee attack), he can choose to take a -5 penalty on all his attack rolls during the round. If he does so and succeeds at his combat maneuver check, the vigilante deals damage to the target of his combat maneuver as if he had hit that target with a normal hit from his weapon.",
			"",
			"**Chase Master (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): Whether he is the pursuer or the pursued, few can best a vigilante at a chase. He receives a bonus on all checks during a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) equal to half his vigilante level or +4, whichever is greater. ",
			"",
			"**Close the Gap (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): Each round, at the start of his turn, the vigilante can designate one foe within 20 feet that isn't adjacent to him. When he moves, he doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that foe as long as he ends his move adjacent to that foe. If he charges that foe, he does not take the -2 penalty to his AC on any attacks made by the designated foe.",
			"",
			"**Combat Expertise (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source/antihero's_handbook)): The vigilante gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. If he already has Combat Expertise, he instead gains another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Combat Expertise. If the vigilante's Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.",
			"",
			"**Combat Skill (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante gains any one combat feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat, but he is treated as though he had a number of fighter levels equal to half his vigilante level for the purpose of qualifying for this feat. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent, but he can select this talent more than once; each time he must select a different feat.",
			"",
			"**Concealed Strike (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source/spymaster's_handbook)): Whenever the vigilante attacks an opponent with a concealed weapon that his target wasn't aware of, he can attempt a Bluff check to feint that opponent as a move action. If he has the Improved Feint feat, he attempts this check as a free action instead. A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Cunning Feint (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can feint as a move action or in place of his first attack during a full attack. At 8th level, when the vigilante successfully feints, the opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks until the vigilante's next turn.",
			"",
			"**Deceitful Trick** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source/blood_of_the_beast)): The vigilante can perform a dirty trick combat maneuver in place of his first attack during a full attack. He can take a -4 penalty on his check in order to inflict two different conditions on his foe if he succeeds at his check. If the vigilante is successful, the target can remove both conditions as a standard action. A vigilante must have Greater Dirty Trick and Improved Dirty Trick in order to select this vigilante talent.",
			"",
			"**Environmental Weapon (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): When the vigilante gains this talent, he must select one type of terrain from the ranger's list of favored terrains. While in this terrain, as a swift action the vigilante can find an improvised weapon if there are any loose or moveable objects around (subject to the GM's discretion). He doesn't take a penalty for using these improvised weapons. For example, if the vigilante selected the urban environment, he might attack a foe with a chair, an empty bottle, or even a door. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels, the vigilante can select an additional type of terrain.",
			"",
			"**Evasive (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is hard to catch with area attacks. He gains the evasion ability, and at 12th level, he gains the improved evasion ability. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Expose Weaknesses (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante is able to use sneaky tricks to make it easier to damage a foe, whether it is throwing a bit of fine dust of cold iron over a fey creature or melting a glob of silver onto a lycanthrope's hide. The vigilante can add the ability to reduce a creature's damage reduction or hardness by 10 to the list of options when attempting a dirty trick combat maneuver check (Advanced Player's Guide 320). This does not stack with itself, and it does not work against creatures with DR/&mdash;.",
			"",
			"**Fantastic Stride (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source/spymaster's_handbook)): The vigilante gains Spring Attack as a bonus feat, ignoring its prerequisites. At 10th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the vigilante can designate one additional creature when he uses Spring Attack. The vigilante's movement this round does not provoke attacks of opportunity from any of these secondary creatures. A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Favored Maneuver (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante selects one type of combat maneuver to be a favored maneuver. He gains the Improved feat corresponding to that combat maneuver (if one exists). He gains a +2 circumstance bonus on combat maneuver checks with that combat maneuver against a foe that is unaware of the vigilante's presence at the start of his combat maneuver. A vigilante can select this talent more than once. Each time, it applies to a different combat maneuver.",
			"",
			"**Fist of the Avenger (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, if he doesn't have this feat already. In addition, whenever he successfully attacks with his fist or a gauntlet, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to half his vigilante level (minimum +1, maximum of +5). Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Gator Wrangle (Ex)** ([People of the Wastes pg. 20](source/people_of_the_wastes)): The vigilante gains a +8 bonus to his CMD against grapple combat maneuvers when using the grab ability, and he halves all damage from constrict attacks. When attacking a creature that is grappling him, an avenger vigilante deals an additional amount of damage equal to half his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"**Harsh Judgement (Su)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source/inner_sea_intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent can pronounce judgment upon his foes as per the inquisitor class feature (see page 38 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide). He can choose from among the following inquisitor judgments: destruction, piercing, purity, and smiting. For the purpose of determining the bonuses provided by this ability, the vigilante's level stacks with levels in any other classes that grant judgment or harsh judgment. The vigilante can use this ability once per day plus an additional time per day at 4th level and every 3 levels thereafter (up to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level). Only a vigilante with the zealot archetype can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Heavy Training (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante gains Heavy Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat, if he does not have that feat already. The armor skin vigilante talent also applies to heavy armor. At 16th level, if the vigilante has the armor skin vigilante talent, he can move at full speed in heavy armor. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Hide in Plain Sight (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante can use Stealth to hide even when being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of dim light (his own shadow doesn't count), he can hide without anything to actually hide behind. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 8th level can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Vigilante (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source/ultimate_intrigue)): The vigilante's powers of deduction are far beyond the norm. This ability functions similarly to the investigator's inspiration ability, but the vigilante's inspiration pool is equal to his class level (do not add his Intelligence modifier), the vigilante can never use this ability without expending a use of inspiration, and it doesn't count as inspiration for any effects that interact with or require the inspiration class feature.",

If the vigilante chooses to gain the benefits of multiple feats, the feats selected must share the same racial prerequisite.

By adhering to his vow's tenets, the monk's ki pool increases by the amount listed in the vow's description. Every vow comes with a penalty or limitation to offset this increase in ki. A monk can take a vow at any level, but it does not add to his ki pool until he gains a ki pool as a class feature. A monk who takes a vow never gains the still mind class feature, even if he abandons all his vows.",
			"",
			"If a monk knowingly and willingly breaks his vow, his ki pool is reduced to 0 (as if he had spent all of his ki points) and he cannot replenish his pool or use abilities that require ki or a ki pool until he has redeemed himself. Redemption requires a recommitment to his vow accompanied by an atonement spell. After the redemption, the monk's normal ki pool (without the bonus from the vow) returns. If he upholds the previously broken vow for a full month, his ki pool regains the additional points from taking the vow, and he can decide whether to continue with his vow or forgo his vow without penalty. Once a monk forgoes a vow in this fashion, she can never gain a ki point bonus from that vow.",

A celibate monk is not allowed to touch others or have others touch him (including touch spells from allies). Striking enemies in battle or being struck by enemies is not prohibited, but the monk shuns all peaceful or pleasurable contact.

			"**Fasting** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk eats nothing but rice (or a similar bland, staple food) and drinks nothing but water. On certain days (usually once per month or on a religious holiday), he may eat a small portion of other simple, bland food to maintain proper nutrition. The monk cannot use tobacco, drugs, potions, alchemical items requiring eating or drinking, or any other thing that could be considered a food or beverage. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Peace** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk must strive to attain peace and may only use violence as a last resort. He can never strike the first blow in combat. If attacked, he must use the fight defensively action or the total defense action for the first 2 rounds. He must always give his opponent the option to surrender, and cannot purposely slay another creature that could reasonably be influenced to flee or join a civilized society as a productive member (obviously this excludes many monsters). Many monks who have taken this vow learn how to grapple and pin opponents, tying them with specialized knots that allow them to work themselves free after sufficient effort. Many monks of peace are vegetarians. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Poverty** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 50](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk taking a vow of poverty must never own more than six possessions-a simple set of clothing, a pair of sandals or shoes, a bowl, a sack, a blanket, and any one other item. Five of these items must be of plain and simple make, though one can be of some value (often an heirloom of great personal significance to the monk). The monk can never keep more money or wealth on his person than he needs to feed, bathe, and shelter himself for 1 week in modest accommodations. He cannot borrow or carry wealth or items worth more than 50 gp that belong to others. He is allowed to accept and use curative potions (or similar magical items where the item is consumed and is valueless thereafter) from other creatures. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 2 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Silence** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 51](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk must speak no words and attempt to be quiet in his actions. Accidental noises and the sounds of battle (such as the sound of a fist or weapon striking an opponent) do not affect his vow, though most monks with this vow choose their weapons and opponents so as to minimize even these sounds. The monk is allowed to make a nonvocal noise to warn another of danger (such as by stomping or clapping). The monk is allowed to use gestures and motions to communicate with others (including sign language) and is allowed to write. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 6 monk levels (minimum +1).",
			"",
			"**Truth** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 51](source/ultimate_magic)) The monk is not allowed to deliberately speak any lies, including bluffing, stating half-truths with the intent to deceive, exaggerating, telling white lies, and so on. This applies to all forms of communication. If presented with circumstances where telling the truth would bring harm to another, the monk remains silent. Many monks of this vow also take a vow of silence to show their commitment. A monk with this vow increases his ki pool by 1 ki point for every 5 monk levels (minimum +1)."

			"When a character in tune with nature comes upon an area that a [kami](monster/family/kami) could ward but that is lacking a guardian, she has the option of making that area her ward in a symbiotic relationship. Whenever a character with the animal focus class feature is within 100 feet per class level of one of the wards listed below, she can use the associated ward aspect instead of one of the normal options for her animal focus class feature. Hunters can apply the benefits of a ward aspect to themselves, but not to their animal companions.",
			"",
			"If a character with the animal focus class feature spends 30 minutes meditating while within 10 feet per class level of the ward, she attunes herself to that ward. A character attuned to a ward can use the associated ward aspect while within 1 mile per class level. A character can be attuned to only one ward at a time, but depending on her surroundings, she could choose from among multiple wards. A character with the second animal focus class feature can still only use one ward aspect at a time, no matter how many aspects she has available to her.",
			"",
			"The following ward aspects are available to characters who meet the conditions described above.",
			"",
			"*Road:* The creature gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its base speed while running, charging, or withdrawing. This bonus increases to +20 feet at 8th level and +30 feet at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Shrine:* The creature gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Tree:* The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on saving throws against death effects and effects that deal negative energy damage. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Waymarker:* The creature gains a +4 competence bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.",
			"",
			"*Well:* The creature gains a +2 shield bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and +6 at 15th level."
