A bard or skald with an archetype that replaces versatile performance cannot select advanced versatile performance options.",

If the bard is already proficient with this weapon or later becomes proficient with it, he gains [Weapon Focus](feat:Weapon_Focus) with that weapon as a bonus feat instead.

Unwilling creatures may attempt a Will save against the effect of a masterpiece; the save DC for masterpieces is equal to 10 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma bonus.

In some cases, the bard can extend the duration of the masterpiece by expending additional rounds of bardic performance, just as if it were any other use of bardic performance. The bard expends the listed number of bardic performance rounds when he starts performing the masterpiece; if he is interrupted, the attempt fails and the spent performance rounds are lost.",

				"Chromatic and metallic dragons remain the most common dragons to impart their legacy onto other species. The bloodrager and sorcerer classes each include a draconic bloodline that assumes the character's lineage is somehow connected with the power of a chromatic or metallic dragon. Presented below are expanded options for the existing draconic bloodlines, increasing the selection of heritages to include the numerous new true dragons presented in the many Pathfinder RPG Bestiary volumes. Each of the draconic bloodlines below alters the bloodrager's or sorcerer's bloodline arcana.",
				"**Energy Types**: Several of these new draconic bloodline options include nonstandard damage types. For the sake of game balance, many of the damage types available to the bloodlines below somewhat differ from those produced by the parent dragon. Specifically, force energy, negative energy, and sonic energy have been altered to different types of energy. In cases where a dragon's energy type is listed as physical damage (such as bludgeoning or piercing), use that damage type when determining your breath weapon damage. For the purpose of the dragon resistance bloodline power, you gain DR equal to half the energy resistance you would normally gain against all attacks of that specific damage type. A character with the power of wyrms bloodline power gains immunity to her bloodline's damage type. For all other purposes, such as archetypes, bloodline powers, and feats, treat that dragon's energy type as fire.",
				"Esoteric Dragons",
				"Though many of the enigmatic esoteric dragons remain aloof or intentionally distant from mortal affairs, occult dragons are the most likely to imprint their bloodline onto humanoids. Often such draconic blood is the result of ongoing experimentation. Scions of other esoteric dragons are far more unusual; such bloodlines usually result from explorers traveling the realms where these distant dragons dwell and being exposed to some spectacular and illunderstood power.",

You can know only a number of psychic spells equal to the highest level spell you can cast from your class spell list, based on your current class level. When you're casting these spells, they function as psychic magic instead of arcane. You use thought and emotion components instead of verbal and somatic components when casting these spells.",

This is particularly true in Xa Hoi, where imperial dragons rule. Imperial dragons in other lands may vary in their interactions with humanoids, but universally accept the praise (and fear) of those around them. Their connection to the land makes the blood of these dragons a powerful arcane catalyst in the making of heroes.",

The hidden blood of an outer dragon in a family's lineage is difficult to detect or stamp out. On Golarion, these dragons most commonly find themselves drawn to the fabled land of Numeria and its alien technology, though they usually refuse to share any of their insights with that nation's residents.",

This effect occurs only when you're using spells that require an attack roll (such as [chill touch](spell:chill_touch) or [scorching ray](spell:scorching_ray)) or spells that allow a save (such as [fireball](spell:fireball) or [lightning bolt](spell:lightning_bolt)).

Allies must be able to see and hear you to gain this bonus. You can expend a spell slot as an immediate action to further increase this bonus by 1 per level of the spell slot expended until the beginning of your next turn.",
				"**Legacy Style (Su)**: At 8th level, select any one style feat. You can use this [style feat](unknown:style_feat) while bloodraging; however, if you do not meet all of the style feat's prerequisites, you must expend a spell slot when entering the style's stance, and the benefits last for only 1 round per level of the spell slot expended or for the duration of your bloodrage, whichever is shorter. If you already have this style feat, you can enter the style's stance as part of the free action to bloodrage.",
				"**War's Memory (Sp)**: At 12th level, you can manifest an illusion of an ancestor's bloody battlefield once per day. This functions as [hallucinatory terrain](spell:hallucinatory_terrain), except it can create only battlefields drawn from a civilization's past, and the effect ends when your bloodrage ends. The saving throw to disbelieve is equal to 10 + 1/2 your bloodrager level + your Constitution modifier. The horrifying scene causes creatures within the area of effect to take a -2 penalty on saves versus fear effects until they disbelieve the illusion. If a creature fails the Will save to disbelieve the illusion, it gains the shaken condition until your bloodrage ends, or until it leaves the area of effect. This is an illusion (glamer) and fear effect.",
				"**Legacy Conduit (Su)**: At 16th level, when using the legacy style bloodline power, you can expend a spell slot as a swift action to share the benefits of the selected style feat with all allies within 30 feet. The benefits last for 1 round per level of the spell slot expended. Allies must still enter the style's stance as a swift action.",
				"**Call to Arms (Su)**: At 20th level, you can summon a ghostly army from a fallen civilization once per day. This functions as [spiritual ally](spell:spiritual_ally) with a caster level equal to your level, except that it summons a number of allies equal to your Constitution modifier, and the allies use your Strength modifier for attack rolls. You can direct all of these allies with a single swift action. Each ally can attack a different target or the same target, as you direct. The allies remain until the spell's duration ends or your bloodrage ends, whichever comes first."

			"Although heirs to similar arcane bloodlines may share commonalities, the unique circumstances in which a bloodline enters a bloodrager or sorcerer's lineage can result in the manifestation of particularly strange or unusual bloodline powers known as mutations. Whenever a bloodrager or a sorcerer gains a new bloodline power, she can swap her bloodline power for a bloodline mutation whose prerequisites she meets. Once this choice is made, it cannot be changed, and a bloodrager or sorcerer cannot swap a bloodline power that she has altered or replaced with an archetype for a bloodline mutation. A bloodrager need not be in a bloodrage to use her bloodline mutation powers.",

			"Alternatively, a bloodrager or sorcerer can select a bloodline mutation in place of a bloodline bonus feat, provided her class level is at least equal to the level of the bloodline ability the mutation normally replaces."
