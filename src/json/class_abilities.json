			"At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level), an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery. Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once. Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries. Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (&ast;) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb. The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier.",
			"",
			"### Bomb Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Acid Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict acid damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from an acid bomb take an additional 1d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.",
			"",
			"**Anarchic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source:Champions_of_Balance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal chaotic divine damage. Lawful creatures that take a direct hit from an anarchic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, anarchic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Anarchic bombs have no effect on chaotic-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Anguish Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): You can throw bombs infused with psychic trauma. This discovery allows other alchemists to duplicate the anguish bombs used by [mnemostillers](unknown:mnemostillers).",
			"",
			"**Axiomatic Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Balance](source:Champions_of_Balance)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal lawful divine damage. Chaotic creatures that take a direct hit from an axiomatic bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, axiomatic bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Axiomatic bombs have no effect on lawful creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Blackstar Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source:Monster_Codex)*): This bomb crushes the target like a void bomb, then repels nearby creatures with a burst of gravity. The target takes damage as if hit by a void bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts. Creatures moved by a blackstar bomb are pushed directly away from the target's square. An alchemist must have the void bomb discovery to create blackstar bombs.",
			"",
			"**Blinding Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose for it to detonate very brightly. Creatures that take a direct hit from a blinding bomb are blinded for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves against the bomb are dazzled for 1 minute. This is a light effect. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Boneshard Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:Undead_Slayer's_Handbook)*): This discovery is popular among necromancers and necrologists alike; aside from its offensive potential, necrologists sometimes use it to turn uncooperative live creatures they wish to question into pliable undead. The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the [skeleton template](monster/template:skeleton). Skeletons that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell:animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Breath Weapon Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): Instead of drawing the components of, creating, and throwing a bomb, the alchemist can draw the components, drink them, mix them within his body, and then expel them as a breath weapon as a standard action. This breath weapon is a 15-foot cone and has the same DC as the bomb. Each creature within the cone takes damage as if it had suffered a direct hit from the alchemist's bomb, but succeeding at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier) halves the damage. Unlike throwing normal bombs, drawing, drinking, and expelling breath weapon bombs does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concussive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict sonic damage. Concussive bombs deal 1d4 points of sonic damage, plus 1d4 points of sonic damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a concussive bomb are deafened for 1 minute unless they succeed at a Fortitude save. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Confusion Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist's bombs twist the target's perception of friend and foe. A creature that takes a direct hit from a confusion bomb takes damage from the bomb and is under the effect of a [confusion](spell:confusion) spell for 1 round per caster level of the alchemist. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cursed Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:Champions_of_Corruption)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver a debilitating curse. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by [bestow curse](spell:bestow_curse). An alchemist must be at least 12th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cytillesh Bomb** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can infuse it with cytillesh extract. Cytillesh bombs deal 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a cytillesh bomb are sickened for 1 round per alchemist level unless they succeed at Fortitude saves. If a creature is rendered unconscious from this bomb or any other attack before it is able to remove the sickened condition, the victim loses all memory from the last hour and cannot form new memories for 8 hours. The lost and prevented memories might return later as dreams, and can be restored with a [restoration](spell:restoration) spell. This discovery doesn't stack with other discoveries that alter an alchemist's bomb.",
			"",
			"**Darkness Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes nonmagical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as [deeper darkness](spell:deeper_darkness).",
			"",
			"**Defoliant Bomb** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): These poisonous bombs clear away foliage, dealing extra damage to plant creatures. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal extra damage against plant creatures but less damage against other creatures. Against creatures with the plant type, a defoliant bomb deals 1d8 points of damage, plus 1d8 points of damage for every odd-numbered level the alchemist possesses, instead of 1d6. Against all other creatures, the defoliant bomb only deals 1d4 points of damage, plus 1d4 points of damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. This is a poison effect. A defoliant bomb kills all normal vegetation in the target's square and its splash area; any plant-based difficult terrain in the affected area becomes normal terrain.",
			"",
			"**Delayed Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist can place a bomb so that it explodes a number of rounds after the alchemist ceases contact with the bomb. This delay can be any number of rounds as chosen by the alchemist, up to a number of rounds equal to his level. If at any point the alchemist reclaims possession of the delayed bomb, he can end the timer and prevent the bomb's detonation. A delayed bomb detonates immediately if any other creature attempts to touch or move it, or if the bomb's contents are removed from the vial (such as if the vial breaks). The bomb deals damage as if it scored a direct hit to any creature in the square with the bomb when it detonates, and splash damage to all adjacent creatures as normal. An alchemist cannot have more than one delayed bomb at one time. If he creates another delayed bomb, the previous bomb becomes inert. [Dispel magic](spell:Dispel_magic) can neutralize a delayed bomb, as can a successful Disable Device check (DC equals 10 + the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Demolition Charge&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal damage to an object as if by a sunder combat maneuver. If the item is worn or held by an opponent, the item is considered the direct target, and the wearer/holder takes splash damage from the blast. If the object is unattended, a demolition charge deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on a direct hit. This bonus doesn't affect the bomb's splash damage. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Directed Bomb** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:Magical_Marketplace)*): The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone. If the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of the blast from where the bomb lands. This discovery can't be combined with the explosive bomb discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it dispel magic effects instead of deal damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a dispelling bomb are subject to a targeted [dispel magic](spell:dispel_magic) spell, using the alchemist's level as the caster level. This cannot be used to target a specific spell effect. The alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Dread Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): Your anguish bombs are tainted with fear and dread. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs become frightened for 1d6 rounds. A target that succeeds at a Will saving throw is instead shaken for a single round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ectoplasmic Bomb&ast;** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:Undead_Slayer's_Handbook)*): The alchemist can infuse her bombs with a special unction that damages incorporeal creatures and reveals the presence of undead creatures hiding in the area. Incorporeal creatures struck by an ectoplasmic bomb take full damage from the bomb. In addition, squares in the affected area of the bomb begin to faintly glow in the spaces where undead creatures have traveled in the last minute, including undead benefiting from invisibility or other forms of obscurity (such as [ethereal jaunt](spell:ethereal_jaunt)), effectively creating a glowing trail. Any undead creatures in the affected area at the time of the explosion likewise glow faintly. This glowing effect lasts for 1 minute, and is otherwise identical to [faerie fire](spell:faerie_fire).",
			"",
			"**Explosive Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist's bombs now have a splash radius of 10 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take a direct hit from an explosive bomb catch fire, taking 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 to the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames.",
			"",
			"**Fast Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can quickly create enough bombs to throw more than one in a single round. The alchemist can prepare and throw additional bombs as a full-round action if his base attack bonus is high enough to grant him additional attacks. This functions just like a full-attack with a ranged weapon. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Flesh-Eating Bomb&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:Monster_Hunter's_Handbook)*): The alchemist can create bombs that devour living matter. The alchemist's bomb deals damage one die step higher than normal (regular bombs deal d8s, concussive bombs deal 1d6, and so on), but they have no effect on inorganic matter. In addition, a creature with at least a +1 armor bonus to AC is less likely to be harmed; such creatures in the bomb's splash radius take no damage on a successful Reflex save, and the target of a direct hit can attempt a Reflex save against the bomb's save DC to take only half damage.",
			"",
			"**Force Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict force damage. Force bombs deal 1d4 points of force damage, plus 1d4 points of force damage for every odd-numbered level, instead of 1d6. Creatures that take a direct hit from a force bomb are knocked prone unless they succeed on a Reflex save. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Frost Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict cold damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a frost bomb are staggered on their next turn unless they succeed on a Fortitude save.",
			"",
			"**Glassfoot Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it cover the ground in volatile jagged crystals in addition to its normal effects. These crystals act like [caltrops](equipment/misc:caltrops), evaporating into a smelly but harmless gas in 2d6 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Grease Bomb&ast;** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb's splash radius in grease (as the [grease](spell:grease) spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling after a failed Acrobatics check is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. A grease bomb can't affect items or armor. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Plague Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [greater contagion](spell:greater_contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the plague bomb and smoke bomb discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grounding Goo&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): The alchemist's bomb applies a sticky residue after any damage from the bomb is resolved. If a creature damaged by the bomb has a nonmagical fly speed, its flight is severely impaired, and it takes a penalty equal to the alchemist's level on Fly checks for 1 minute.",
			"",
			"**Healing Bomb&ast;** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:Magical_Marketplace)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to expend an infused extract or potion containing a cure spell. A creature that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had imbibed the infusion or potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing them.",
			"",
			"**Hellfire Bomb&ast;** (*[Agents of Evil](source:Agents_of_Evil)*): This discovery is available to tiefling alchemists. When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can have it act as an explosive bomb, but deal half of its damage as fire damage and half as unholy damage that is not subject to fire resistance or immunity. An alchemist must be at least 9th level and have the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Holy Bombs&ast;** (*[Champions of Purity](source:Champions_of_Purity)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal good divine damage. Evil creatures that take a direct hit from a holy bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against neutral creatures, holy bombs deal half damage, and such targets are not affected by their staggering effect. Holy bombs have no effect on good-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Immolation Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have its substance coat the direct target's body, causing the bomb to deal its damage over time instead of all at once. The bomb's effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice the bomb would normally deal (for instance, a 5d6 bomb lasts for 5 rounds). When the bomb hits the direct target, the bomb deals 1d6 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier in damage, and those within the splash zone take damage equal to 1 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. It repeats this damage against the direct target of the bomb each round the immolation bomb lasts, dealing the damage at the start of the alchemist's turn. Splash damage is dealt again to any creature that is adjacent to the direct target when it takes damage from the immolation bomb. A creature taking damage from an immolation bomb's direct hit can attempt to extinguish the flames as a full-round action that requires a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligent modifier). Because of the alchemical nature of this bomb, rolling on the ground does not grant a bonus on the saving throw, and dousing a creature with water does not stop it from burning. These bombs can be used underwater. An alchemist must be at least 3rd level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Incendiary Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source:Villain_Codex)*): An incendiary charge is a bomb specifically designed to overcome the effects of any nonmagical object's hardness. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place an incendiary charge that burns and eats away at an object, dealing normal bomb damage to it. (The damage is not halved against an object with hardness, unlike most energy damage.) Furthermore, the incendiary charge ignores the first 5 points of hardness of the material being damaged. The alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inferno Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicate the effects of [incendiary cloud](spell:incendiary_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Inspired Bomb (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:Advanced_Class_Guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery and a pool of inspiration (by way of a class feature, a feat, or the inspiring cognatogen discovery) can expend two uses of inspiration to increase the bomb's damage by 1d6. The type of damage the bomb deals does not change. Unlike other a discoveries that affect bombs, this one can be applied to a bomb with another bomb discovery, though it cannot be applied to the same bomb more than once.",
			"",
			"**Jury-Rigged Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero's_Handbook)*): Unlike normal bombs, jury-rigged bombs can be created from whatever materials the alchemist has on hand; this makes them particularly handy in situations where the alchemist might find himself imprisoned or stripped of his equipment. Jury-rigged bombs can be crafted and thrown as a swift action (this counts against the alchemist's daily use of bombs), and they deal only 1d4 points of damage + additional damage equal to half the alchemist's Intelligence modifier on a direct hit. This damage increases by 1d4 at 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Despite being useful in a pinch, jury-rigged bombs are nonetheless crudely crafted and highly unstable; if the alchemist's attack roll results in a natural 1, the bomb explodes as he is creating it, and he takes damage as if he had taken a direct hit. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Madness Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist's bombs do more than sear flesh-they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). The amount of Wisdom damage dealt by a madness bomb is reduced by 1 for each madness bomb that hit the target in the past 24 hours, to a minimum of 1 point of Wisdom damage. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Melancholy Bomb** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): Your anguish bombs are filled with memories of sadness and regret. Creatures who take damage from your anguish bombs are also affected as per [crushing despair](spell:crushing_despair) for 1 round per alchemist level, or a single round if the target succeeds at a Will saving throw. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the anguish bomb class feature or the anguish bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Neutralizing Bomb** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to give it the potential to end certain ongoing effects instead of dealing damage. Each creature in the splash radius can attempt a new saving throw against any poison afflicting it and any ongoing conditions or ongoing acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. (If an effect did not allow a saving throw, this bomb doesn't allow affected creatures to attempt one.) Success counts as one successful save toward ending poison and immediately ends other conditions. Exposed poison in the splash radius is also rendered harmless. A creature with poison abilities that is directly struck by the bomb finds those abilities useless for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw. This discovery doesn't stack with any other that modifies bombs.",
			"",
			"**Ooze Blight&ast;** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:Monster_Hunter's_Handbook)*): A target hit by the alchemist's bomb loses the split special quality for 1d4 rounds. In addition, against creatures with the ooze type, this bomb deals untyped damage that bypasses all resistances.",
			"",
			"**Penetrating Charge** (*[Villain Codex](source:Villain_Codex)*): A penetrating charge is a bomb specifically designed to disable locks and similar mechanisms, though not other means of sealing a door, a container, or other sorts of devices. As a full-round action, the alchemist can place a penetrating charge on a lock. Instead of dealing damage, the penetrating charge seeps into the mechanism and eats away at it, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on any subsequent Disable Device checks against the mechanism. A creature can spend 10 minutes and attempt an appropriate Craft check (DC 15) to fix the lock and remove this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Plague Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [contagion](spell:contagion) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash area for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Plague Vector** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:Champions_of_Corruption)*): The effects of the alchemist's plague bomb operate as normal except for the following changes. The chosen disease's save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier. Any creatures affected by the chosen disease become vectors for it, spreading the disease to any creatures they come in physical contact with for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). The save DC to avoid contracting the disease from the vector is the same as the DC used for this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the plague bomb discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poison Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of [cloudkill](spell:cloudkill) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Poisoned Explosive&ast;** (*[Dirty Tactics Toolbox](source:Dirty_Tactics_Toolbox)*): When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can apply a dose of contact or injury poison to it, as if applying poison to a weapon. If the poisoned bomb hits its target, the bomb deals damage as normal, but the target must also succeed at a saving throw against the poison or be affected by that poison. No other creatures are affected by the poison. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and have the poison use class feature before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Bombs** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): Whenever the alchemist throws a bomb, he can select a number of squares equal to his Intelligence modifier that are not affected by the splash damage from his bombs. If the bomb misses, this discovery has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Profane Bomb&ast;** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:Champions_of_Corruption)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal evil divine damage. Good creatures that take a direct hit from a profane bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered on their next turn. Against a neutral creature, a profane bomb deals half damage, and the target is not affected by the bomb's staggering effect. A profane bomb has no effect against evil-aligned creatures. An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychoactive Bomb&ast;** (*[Blood of the Moon](source:Blood_of_the_Moon)*): Psychoactive bombs are mixed with neurotoxic extracts that heighten certain sensations. A creature struck by a psychoactive bomb takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against charm, emotion, fear, and pain effects, and the DC for Intimidate checks against the victim decreases by 2. This effect lasts for 1 hour per alchemist level. These penalties do not stack, and a creature can only be affected by a single psychoactive bomb at a time. A psychoactive bomb deals 1d6 fewer hit points of damage than normal. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remote Bomb** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:Heroes_of_the_High_Court)*): The alchemist can spend two uses of his daily bombs to create a special bomb that is manually detonated. When the bomb is created, the alchemist also creates a catalyst distillate, which requires no extra time or cost. A remote bomb is inert unless triggered by this distillate. The bomb is detonated as a standard action when the distillate fumes are exposed to the rest of the bomb. An alchemist must be within 60 feet of the bomb for the distillate to successfully trigger the bomb. A catalyst distillate can detonate a bomb even if the bomb has already been hurled at a target. Triggering the distillate outside of the 60-foot range or after 1 hour has no effect.",
			"",
			"**Rocket Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): ([Goblin](race:Goblin) only) Alchemists with this discovery can prepare special rockets to deliver their bombs. Rocket bombs travel farther and explode bigger than normal bombs, but cannot target individual creatures. Rocket bombs explode in a 20-foot radius, and all creatures in that area take the alchemist's normal splash damage. The range increment on a rocket bomb is 50 feet. Rocket bombs cannot be used with the precise bomb or fast bomb discoveries. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sand Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can pack the casing full of sand that explodes in an abrasive cloud on impact. A creature that takes a direct hit from a sand bomb is blinded for 1 round, as are any creatures in the splash radius that fail a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + his Intelligence modifier).",
			"",
			"**Scrap Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): ([Goblin](race:Goblin) only) When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save.",
			"",
			"**Shock Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it inflict electricity damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a shock bomb are dazzled for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Siege Bomb&ast;** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist infuses a single piece of ammunition on a loaded siege weapon with the power of his bomb. As long as the siege engine with this ammunition is fired before the start of the alchemist's next turn, the ammunition does damage normally, and also deals the damage of the alchemist's bomb. The splash radius of the bomb effect is 20 feet rather than 5 feet. Creatures that take the bomb's damage (either direct damage or splash damage), take 1d6 points of fire damage each round until the fire is extinguished. Extinguishing the flames is a full-round action that requires a Reflex save. Rolling on the ground provides the target with a +2 bonus on the save. Dousing the target with at least 2 gallons of water automatically extinguishes the flames. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must possess the explosive bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Smoke Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a cloud of thick smoke when it detonates. The cloud functions as [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level.",
			"",
			"**Solid Ground&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): The alchemist launches an explosive paste bomb that bonds with any earthen surface. Each application of this paste deals no damage and affects a 5-foot-cube of dirt, loose soil, or stone, transmuting the earth for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level. Creatures cannot use burrow, earthmeld, or similar abilities (such as the meld into stone spell) while the ground remains transmuted in this way.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Bomb** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The effects of the alchemist's bombs are persistent and continue to damage creatures for 1 round after the initial damage. Creatures that take a direct hit from a sticky bomb take the splash damage 1 round later. Bombs that have effects that would normally occur 1 round later instead have those effects occur 2 rounds later. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Stink Bomb&ast;** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb can duplicate the effects of [stinking cloud](spell:stinking_cloud) instead of [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud), filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round. An alchemist must possess the smoke bomb discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Strafe Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that splash in a 40-foot line rather than affecting a radius. The line starts at the alchemist and extends away from him in the direction he chooses. The alchemist designates one creature in the squares affected by the line to be the target of the bomb and makes his attack roll against that creature; all other squares in the line take splash damage. If the alchemist has the explosive bomb discovery and throws an explosive strafe bomb, the line of splash damage is 80 feet long instead of 40 feet.",
			"",
			"**Substantiating Bomb&ast;** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): Your bombs are infused with ectoplasm and a longing for life, lending ethereal creatures a measure of substance. You can throw a bomb that inflicts no damage but instead creates a 10-foot-radius cloud of fog that functions as [fog cloud](spell:fog_cloud) and lasts for 1 round per alchemist level. Incorporeal creatures that pass through this cloud become partially solid, taking half damage from nonmagic attacks and full damage from magic weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities. This effect lasts for the duration of the smoke cloud, even if the incorporeal creature moves outside the cloud's area. A creature affected by the cloud can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the substantiating effects of this bomb. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sunlight Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist can throw bombs that explode with a searing radiance equivalent to that of sunlight and that act as blinding bombs. Undead, fungi, molds, oozes, slimes, and creatures to which sunlight is harmful or unnatural take +2 damage per die from the bomb. Undead that are harmed by sunlight and that fail their saves against the bomb are staggered for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the blinding bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Syringe Stirge (Su)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:Cohorts_and_Companions)*): As a full-round action, you can expend two daily uses of bombs to create a syringe stirge, a tiny construct primed with a bomb (if you have multiple types of bombs, you must select which type the syringe stirge carries when created). Undirected, they take no actions except to flock around you in your square and follow you as best they can. They can be attacked normally, but gain cover while occupying your square. As a swift action, you can order one of your syringe stirges to attack an enemy it can see. Once ordered to attack that enemy, the syringe stirge will continue to attack every round, attempting to attach and deliver its payload. A syringe stirge has all of the statistics of a [stirge](monster:stirge) but lacks the blood drain ability. If it ends its turn attached to an opponent, it injects your bomb into the opponent's bloodstream, dealing damage as a direct hit plus the alchemist's Intelligence modifier (as the [Throw Anything](feat:Throw_Anything) feat-this injection is a direct attack and doesn't deal splash damage. A syringe stirge dies immediately after injecting its bomb. A syringe stirge lasts for 1 minute per alchemist level or until destroyed; if it has not attached to an enemy before the end of its life span it and its bomb payload fall inert. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tanglefoot Bomb (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): A creature that takes a direct hit from a tanglefoot bomb must save against the bomb's DC or be entangled and glued to the floor as if it had failed its save against a [tanglefoot bag](equipment/misc:tanglefoot_bag). Creatures in the splash area that fail their saves are entangled but not glued to the floor; those who make this save are not entangled at all.",
			"",
			"**Thorny Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deal piercing damage. Thorny bombs count as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
			"",
			"**Underwater Demolition (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including throwing from the air into the water. If the bomb travels through water, the range increment is reduced to 5 feet.",
			"",
			"**Void Bomb&ast; (Su)** (*[Monster Codex](source:Monster_Codex)*): (Drow only)  By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some drow alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of crushing those inside. Void bombs deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage, plus 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage for every 2 alchemist levels beyond 1st, instead of 1d6. A creature hit by the bomb must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC. If it fails, it is knocked prone and can't get up for 1 round. If it succeeds, all of its movement speeds are reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. Other creatures within 5 feet of the bomb's target take no damage, but must succeed at a Reflex save against the bomb's DC or have all their movement speeds reduced to 5 feet for 1 round. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Extract Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Aromatic Extract** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:Heroes_of_the_High_Court)*): The alchemist creates an inhaled version of an extract that is shared among multiple creatures. He must decide that an extract is an aromatic extract when he makes it. When used, the extract grants its benefit to all creatures within a 10-foot spread of the extract. The aromatic extract is treated as having the minimum caster level required for the original extract. An aromatic extract expends one of the alchemist's daily extracts as if it were an extract 2 levels higher. This discovery can be applied only to extracts with a range of touch. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Bottled Ooze (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist has learned how to preserve a sample of oozes in a sealed bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he actually throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the ooze, which reconstitutes and attacks the closest creature. The ooze is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The ooze remains for 1 round per caster level, and decays into powder when the duration expires. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a bottled ooze requires an extract with a level equal to the ooze's CR (so a CR 4 [gray ooze](monster:gray_ooze) requires a 4th-level extract). An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Combine Extracts** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can place two formulae into one extract. When the extract is consumed, both formulae take effect. This extract has a level two levels higher than the highest-level formulae placed in the extract. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infusion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. The extract created now persists even after the alchemist sets it down. As long as the extract exists, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An infused extract can be imbibed by a non-alchemist to gain its effects.",
			"",
			"**Intuitive Understanding (Sp)** (*[Champions of Balance](source:Champions_of_Balance)*): If the alchemist drinks an extract of the divination school while under the effects of a cognatogen, his effective caster level temporarily increases by 2. In addition, while under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist may use augury once as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to his alchemist level). At 10th level, he can use divination instead. An alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nostrum** (*[Heroes of the High Court](source:Heroes_of_the_High_Court)*): When the alchemist creates an infusion, he can mask a delayed poison within the mixture. A nostrum can contain only an ingested poison, and the save DC of the poison is reduced by 2. The poison takes effect a number of hours after being imbibed equal to the alchemist's Intelligence bonus (minimum 0) decided by the alchemist at the creation of the nostrum. The poison within a nostrum can be detected as normal by spells such as detect poison and similar abilities. Until the nostrum is consumed or destroyed, it continues to occupy one of the alchemist's daily extract slots. An alchemist must have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pickled Quasit** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:Champions_of_Corruption)*): The alchemist has learned how to seal a quasit in a bottle, which he can prepare for use as an extract. When the alchemist activates the extract, he throws the bottle at a square within 30 feet, releasing the quasit. The quasit is not under the alchemist's control, but is otherwise treated as a summoned creature. The quasit remains for 1 round per caster level, then collapses into its associated elements. If the alchemist has the infusion discovery, another character can use the infused specimen. Creating a pickled quasit requires a 4th-level extract. An alchemist must be at least 10th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Tainted Infusion** (*[Champions of Corruption](source:Champions_of_Corruption)*): The alchemist can mask murder behind beneficence. When preparing an extract with the infusion discovery, he can lace the extract with one of his bombs as long as the extract has a duration greater than instantaneous. If he chooses, the alchemist can reduce the duration of the extract to 1 round. As soon as the extract's duration expires, it detonates, dealing 150% of the alchemist's bomb damage to the drinker. This effect does not produce a splash radius. Producing a tainted extract consumes both an infusion slot and a daily bomb use. An alchemist must know both the delayed bomb and infusion discoveries to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Volumizer (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): The alchemist can use an extract slot of any level to create a reactive tablet that purifies water and doubles its volume. This works like purify food and drink for a maximum volume of water equal to 1 gallon for each level the alchemist has &times; the level of the extract slot the alchemist used to create the tablet. Additionally, if the alchemist has a receptacle of sufficient volume to gather the water, the tablet doubles the volume of pure water. The water volume increases over the course of 1 minute, but the effect stops before it can create significant water pressure on a container that's not large enough to hold the entire volume. An unused tablet remains usable until the next time the alchemist recovers extract slots.",
			"",
			"### Gloom Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bounding Gloom** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): The alchemist gains the ability to travel between shadows as if by means of a [dimension door](spell:dimension_door) spell. The limitation is that the alchemist's beginning and ending locations must be areas of dim light or darker, or within the radius of an umbral gloom that is lowering the light level. The alchemist can travel up to a total of 100 feet each day in this way. This distance must be used in 10-foot increments; for example, the alchemist can make a single jump of 100 feet or 10 jumps of 10 feet each. For every 2 levels beyond 10th, the distance the alchemist can jump each day doubles (200 feet at 12th level, 400 feet at 14th level, and so on). An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Debilitating Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or take a penalty to its Strength equal to 1d4 + 1 per 2 alchemist levels (maximum of 1d4+5) for 1 round per alchemist level. A target's Strength score cannot drop below 1. This penalty does not stack with itself. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): A creature struck by a direct hit with the gloom must make a successful Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the debilitating gloom discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glutinous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): The gloom creates an area in its splash radius that functions as [web](spell:web). The webbing lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grasping Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): The gloom creates an area equal to double its splash radius that functions as [black tentacles](spell:black_tentacles). The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to half the alchemist's level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Draining Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): A creature struck by the gloom must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the debilitating gloom and draining gloom discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Mucilaginous Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): The gloom leaves a chilly gray residue that turns each square in its splash radius into difficult terrain. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's level.",
			"",
			"**Rime-Bound Gloom&ast;** (*[Blood of Shadows](source:Blood_of_Shadows)*): The gloom creates an area of freezing shadow in its splash radius that deals 2d6 points of cold damage to all creatures in the area each turn. This effect lasts 1 round for every 2 alchemist levels. An alchemist must be at least 6th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Mutagen Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Bone-Spike Mutagen (Su)** (*[Antihero's Handbook](source:Antihero's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he mutates his skeletal structure, causing the bones on his elbows, knuckles, spine, and shoulder blades to grow massive and pierce his skin, exposing themselves as large spikes. While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist's natural armor bonus granted by the mutagen increases by 2. The spikes count as masterwork armor spikes with which the alchemist is proficient. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that heightens one mental ability score at the expense of a physical ability score. If the cognatogen enhances his Intelligence, it applies a penalty to his Strength. If it enhances his Wisdom, it applies a penalty to his Dexterity. If it enhances his Charisma, it applies a penalty to his Constitution. Otherwise, this ability works just like the mutagen ability (including the natural armor bonus). Anytime the alchemist would prepare a mutagen, he may instead prepare a cognatogen. All limitations of mutagens apply to cognatogens as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen at a time, a cognatogen that is not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes a non-alchemist sick, and so on. When the effect of the cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to the ability score penalized by the cognatogen. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to cognatogens.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Mutagen** (*[Magical Marketplace](source:Magical_Marketplace)*): The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type and a +2 competence bonus on an associated skill check. This resistance increases by 5 and the competence bonus by 2 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand mutagen, greater mutagen, and true mutagen. The elements and their associated energies and skills are air (electricity, Fly), earth (acid, Climb), fire (fire, Acrobatics), and water (cold, Swim). An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time. An alchemist can gain the benefits of only one elemental mutagen at a time, selected when he imbibes the mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Feral Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, he gains two claw attacks and a bite attack. These are primary attacks and are made using the alchemist's full base attack bonus. The claw attacks deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the alchemist is Small) and the bite attack deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if the alchemist is Small). While the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist gains a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate skill checks.",
			"",
			"**Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:Legacy_of_the_First_World)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a fey mutagen, a mixture that lends him some of the grace and power of the First World. When imbibed, a fey mutagen grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the alchemist's Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, and DR 2/cold iron. This otherwise works like the standard mutagen class feature and interacts with other effects as though it were a mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Grand Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist's cognatogen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third mental ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as long as the cognatogen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to each physical ability score when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:Legacy_of_the_First_World)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 10/cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](class:druid). In addition, he can choose not to allow spells and effects to affect him if they would not be capable of affecting both his original creature type and the fey creature type. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must have the greater fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:Advanced_Class_Guide)*): The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +4 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -6 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the item lore, tenacious inspiration, and underworld inspiration [investigator talents](class/ability:investigatortalents). An alchemist must be at least 16th level and have the greater inspiring cognatogen discovery to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +6 natural armor bonus, a +8 alchemical bonus to one ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), a +6 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score, and a +4 alchemical bonus to a third physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as long as the mutagen persists. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the greater mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Grand Rasugen** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): The alchemist's rasugen now grants a +6 alchemical bonus on all saving throws, 4 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison. The alchemist takes a -6 penalty to Intelligence and a -2 penalty to Charisma and Wisdom as long as the grand rasugen persists. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and have the greater rasugen discovery before selecting this discovery.",

			"**Greater Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second mental ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated physical ability scores as long as the mutagen persists, and takes 2 points of ability damage to both associated physical ability scores when the cognatogen ends. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the cognatogen discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Fey Mutagen (Su)** (*[Legacy of the First World](source:Legacy_of_the_First_World)*): The alchemist's fey mutagen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, a -2 penalty to his Strength, DR 5/ cold iron, and the [druid's woodland stride class feature](class:druid). An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the fey mutagen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:Advanced_Class_Guide)*): The alchemist's inspiring cognatogen now grants a +2 dodge bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to Reflex saving throws; a -4 penalty to Strength and Constitution; and the effects of having the amazing inspiration, eidetic recollection, and expanded inspiration [investigator talents](class/ability:investigatortalents). An alchemist must be at least 12th level and must have the inspiring cognatogen discovery or class feature to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist's mutagen now grants a +4 natural armor bonus, a +6 alchemical bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution), and a +4 alchemical bonus to a second physical ability score. The alchemist takes a -2 penalty on both associated mental ability scores as long as the mutagen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Rasugen** (*[Distant Realms](source:Distant_Realms)*): The alchemist's rasugen now grants a +4 alchemical bonus on all saving throws, 3 temporary hit points per alchemist level, and immunity to mind-affecting effects. The alchemist takes a -4 penalty to Intelligence as long as the greater rasugen persists. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and able to brew a rasugen before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Infuse Mutagen** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): When the alchemist creates a mutagen, he can infuse it with an extra bit of his own magical power. This inflicts 2 points of Intelligence damage to the alchemist and costs 1,000 gp in rare reagents, but the mutagen created persists on its own and is not rendered inert if the alchemist creates another mutagen. This allows an alchemist to create different types of mutagens and keep them handy for emergencies. This does not allow an alchemist to gain the effects of multiple mutagens-only the most recently imbibed mutagen has any effect.",
			"",
			"**Inspiring Cognatogen (Su)** (*[Advanced Class Guide](source:Advanced_Class_Guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery leans how to make an inspiring cognatogen, a mutagen-like mixture that grants him inspiration (as the investigator's class feature) at the expense of Strength and Constitution. Upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, the alchemist gains a pool of inspiration equal to 1/2 his alchemist level + his Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC and takes a -2 penalty to both Strength and Constitution. As a free action, the alchemist can add 1d6 to the result of an ability or skill check (including any he takes 10 or 20 on) by expending one use of inspiration. This ability works exactly like the [investigator's inspiration ability](class:investigator), except that the alchemist gains the pool of inspiration upon drinking the inspiring cognatogen, and any unspent inspiration is lost at the end of the cognatogen's duration. If the alchemist already has access to inspiration, the inspiration added by the inspiring cognatogen is added to his inspiration pool, but each time he expends at least one use of inspiration while this ability is active, he must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or become dazed for 1 round. He cannot use inspiration to augment this saving throw. All limitations of mutagens apply to an inspiring cognatogen as if they were the same substance-an alchemist can only maintain one mutagen or cognatogen (either the standard cognatogen or the inspired cognatogen) at a time, a cognatogen not in an alchemist's possession becomes inert, drinking a cognatogen makes non-alchemists sick, and so on. When the effect of an inspiring cognatogen ends, the alchemist takes 2 points of ability damage to Strength and Dexterity. The infuse mutagen discovery and the persistent mutagen class ability apply to an inspiring cognatogen.",
			"",
			"**Mutagen (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): This discovery gives the alchemist the mutagen class ability. (This discovery exists so alchemist archetypes who have variant mutagens, such as the [mindchemist](unknown:mindchemist), can learn how to make standard mutagens.)",
			"",
			"**Purging Mutagen** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer's_Handbook)*): The alchemist's mutagen combines ipecac and other purgative components. A non-alchemist who consumes the mutagen is nauseated for only 1 round, during which time her body rapidly metabolizes or expels all extant toxins, granting her an immediate second saving throw against each ongoing disease and poison currently affecting her. Each successful save counts as two consecutive successful saving throws for the purpose of curing the affliction. Any failed saving throws do not result in additional damage or other effects. A non-alchemist who consumes a second purging mutagen in a 24-hour period is instead nauseated for 1 hour. When an alchemist drinks the mutagen, he can choose whether or not to also be affected by this discovery in addition to the mutagen's other effects.",
			"",
			"**Rag Doll Mutagen (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): ([Goblin](race:Goblin) only) When the alchemist imbibes a mutagen, his body and bones become rubbery and easy to contort. The alchemist gains a bonus equal to his class level on Escape Artist checks, can squeeze through places as if he were one size category smaller, and can make a Reflex save (DC equal to 15 + 1 for every 10 feet fallen) to take half damage from falling. At 10th level, all falling damage is considered nonlethal damage, and the alchemist can squeeze through places as if he were two size categories smaller than his size while under the effects of this mutagen.",
			"",
			"**Splitting Mutagen** (*[Monster Hunter's Handbook](source:Monster_Hunter's_Handbook)*): Once per day while under the effects of his mutagen, the alchemist can split into two identical copies of himself as an immediate action after being damaged by a piercing or slashing weapon. Each copy has an ooze-like complexion, most often manifesting as a slimy sheen to his skin. The alchemist splits his current hit points evenly between the copies. The copies use the same statistics, share the same resources, and have identical equipment (except artifacts, which only one copy has). Similarly, if one of the copies expends a charge or daily use from a magic item that a copy has, the charge or daily use is expended from both copies. If one copy drops or gives away an item, the duplicate item disappears from the other copy as well. The two copies act independently and each one has a full set of actions. At the end of the alchemist's next turn, he selects one of the copies, which loses its ooze-like complexion as it becomes the alchemist; the other copy dissolves into a fine mist and dissipates. If one of the copies is destroyed before this happens, the remaining copy immediately becomes the alchemist, and he gains 1 permanent negative level. If both copies are destroyed simultaneously (such as from a [fireball](spell:fireball)), both copies collapse into formless goo; the alchemist can only be restored to life via [resurrection](spell:resurrection) or similarly powerful magic. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before he can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Poison Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Celestial Poisons (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:Champions_of_Purity)*): The alchemist is able to infuse poisons with celestial power so they can affect evil creatures that are normally immune to poison. Any poison the alchemist administers to a weapon can affect undead and evil outsiders, bypassing their inherent immunities. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its save, the poison acts as normal, but may have no effect on the creature, depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing Constitution damage to undead). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Concentrate Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): The alchemist can combine two doses of the same poison to increase their effects. This requires two doses of the poison and 1 minute of concentration. When completed, the alchemist has one dose of poison. The poison's frequency is extended by 50% and the save DC increases by +2. This poison must be used within 1 hour of its creation or it is ruined.",
			"",
			"**Deadly Excretions (Ex)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): When using his toxic skin ability, the alchemist can choose to excrete a Constitution poison instead of a Dexterity poison. This poison works the same as the normal grippli toxic skin poison except that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the [toxic skin racial trait](unknown:toxic_skin_racial_trait) before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Designer Poison (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:Potions_and_Poisons)*): The alchemist can create special poisons that are more effective against certain creatures. When crafting a poison, the alchemist can choose a single creature type (and subtype, if appropriate) from the [ranger's favored enemy list](class:ranger). Against creatures of the chosen type, the poison's saving throw DC is increased by 4. Against all other creatures, it is reduced by 2. The alchemist must choose the creature type and subtype (if appropriate) while crafting the poison and afterward cannot change this choice.",
			"",
			"**Elemental Destabilizers (Su)** (*[Elemental Master's Handbook](source:Elemental_Master's_Handbook)*): The alchemist is able to concoct reactive chemical compounds that affect elementals like poisons. The alchemist can craft poisons that affect only outsiders with the elemental subtype, bypassing their inherent immunity. Magical effects that negate poisons still apply. If a creature fails its saving throw, the poison acts as normal, but it may have no effect on the creature depending on the effect of the poison (such as dealing fire damage to a fire elemental). An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enduring Toxin (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:Potions_and_Poisons)*): The alchemist can alter the properties of a poison, causing it to persist longer in the victim's body. Altering a dose of poison in the way takes 1 hour, requires the expenditure of raw materials worth half the poison's market price, and exposes the alchemist to the poison, thereby affecting him if he is not immune. This doubles the poison's maximum duration. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Malignant Poison** (*[Dungeoneer's Handbook](source:Dungeoneer's_Handbook)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can increase the save DC of any poison by 4 and increase its duration by 2 frequency increments (for example, [large scorpion venom](unknown:large_scorpion_venom) lasts 8 rounds instead of 6 and [drow poison](unknown:drow_poison) lasts 4 minutes instead of 2). Additionally, malignant poisons take effect immediately and do not have an onset time. This alchemical change lasts until the poison's extended duration ends or for a number of minutes equal to the alchemist's level, whichever comes first. After that, the poison reverts back to its original state. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Nauseating Flesh** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): The alchemist's body is suffused with poison. Any creature that bites, engulfs, or swallows the alchemist must make a Fortitude saving throw or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery. The alchemist with this discovery does not suffer the effect of the poison of his own nauseating flesh.",
			"",
			"**Poison Conversion** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): By spending 1 minute, the alchemist can convert 1 dose of poison from its current type (contact, ingested, inhaled, or injury) to another type. For example, the alchemist can convert a dose of Small centipede poison (an injury poison) to an inhaled poison. This process requires an alchemy lab. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Precise Poison (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): The alchemist is adept at delivering poison to the most vulnerable areas of his targets. When the alchemist confirms a critical hit with a poisoned weapon, he increases the save DC of the poison by an amount equal to the weapon's critical multiplier.",
			"",
			"**Sticky Poison** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): Any poison the alchemist creates is sticky-when the alchemist applies it to a weapon, the weapon remains poisoned for a number of strikes equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"### Potion/Elixir Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Dilution** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can dilute any one potion or elixir, creating two doses of the same potion from one. Diluting a potion costs a number of gp equal to one-quarter of the potion's market value. A potion that has been diluted cannot be diluted again. This discovery cannot be used to dilute extracts or mutagens. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Elixir of Life** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): Once per day, the alchemist can brew an elixir of life. This special concoction costs 25,000 gp to create and takes 1 hour of work. An elixir of life, when administered by the alchemist who brewed it, restores life to a dead creature as per the spell [true resurrection](spell:true_resurrection). Alternatively, the alchemist himself may drink the elixir of life, after which point he is immediately targeted with a [resurrection](spell:resurrection) spell the next time he is killed. Used in this manner, the effects of an elixir of life persist only for a number of days equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier; if he does not die before that time expires, the effects of the elixir of life end. An alchemist must be at least 16th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Enhance Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks to function at a caster level equal to his class level.",
			"",
			"**Eternal Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): If an alchemist drinks a potion that he extends, the effects of that potion become permanent until he chooses to make another potion effect permanent. An alchemist must be at least 16th level and must possess the extend potion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Extend Potion** (*[Advanced Player's Guide](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)*): A number of times per day equal to his Intelligence modifier, the alchemist can cause any potion he drinks that does not have an instantaneous duration to function at twice its normal duration. This does not apply to extracts.",
			"",
			"### Other Discoveries",
			"",
			"**Air Lung** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source:Pathfinder_#123:_The_Flooded_Cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery has conditioned his body to adapt to life above water. He gains the amphibious special quality. Only an alchemist with the aquatic subtype can select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a [lesser simulacrum](spell:lesser_simulacrum). This works like the [lesser simulacrum](spell:lesser_simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Alchemical Zombie (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to animate a relatively complete corpse as an alchemy-powered zombie. This process takes 1 hour and costs 100 gp in alchemical reagents per HD of the corpse being animated; the dead creature gains the [zombie template](monster/template:zombie). Zombies that are created in this manner count as undead created by [animate dead](spell:animate_dead) for the purposes of determining how many undead the alchemist can control. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery. The created zombie is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Bitter Pill (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): The alchemist becomes bitter in flavor. Any creature that hits the bitter alchemist with a bite attack gains the sickened condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Constitution modifier). Any creature that swallows the alchemist whole gains the nauseated condition for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (same DC as above). If the alchemist is trapped in the creature's gullet and it becomes nauseated, the creature vomits him back out immediately as a free action at the start of the creature's turn; the alchemist lands prone adjacent to the creature.",
			"",
			"**Chameleon (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks. At 10th level, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +8.",
			"",
			"**Change Alignment (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:Champions_of_Purity)*): Once per day as part of his preparation of infusions, the alchemist can brew an infusion that shifts the imbiber's alignment to good. This change in alignment lasts for 10 minutes per alchemist level. An unwilling creature receives a Will save to resist this change. The alchemist may have only one such infusion at any one time. The effects of this infusion may have serious repercussions for a creature suddenly struggling with a new outlook. Many see it as little more than forced insanity, and some good faiths outlaw its use. An alchemist must be at least 12th level and have the infusion discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Collective Memory (Su)** (*[Champions of Balance](source:Champions_of_Balance)*): While under the effects of a cognatogen, the alchemist adds half his class level on all Knowledge skill checks and may attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained. This bonus does not stack with the second Intelligence bonus granted by the mindchemist archetype's perfect recall class feature. An alchemist must have the cognatogen discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist's dyes congeal and solidify, allowing him to make physical objects from them. The alchemist can expend two uses of his daily bombs to create a nonmagical object, as [minor creation](spell:minor_creation), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist can develop special pigments and combine them with his alchemical reagents to create unique dyes that cling to the empty space around him, allowing him to paint images in the air to fool his enemies. By expending two daily uses of his bombs, he can use the dyes to create an image in a space adjacent to him, as [silent image](spell:silent_image), using his alchemist level as the spell's caster level. The image he creates remains for a number of minutes equal to his alchemist level. He can dismiss this image as a standard action.",
			"",
			"**Doppelganger Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist learns how to create a [simulacrum](spell:simulacrum), a soulless duplicate, into which he can project his consciousness. As a full-round action, he may shift his consciousness from his current body to any one of his available doppelganger simulacra, which must be on the same plane as the alchemist. If killed in a simulacrum, he transfers to his own body automatically; if killed in his own body, he is dead. Unused simulacra (including his abandoned original body) appear to be lifeless corpses, though they do not decay. Creating a duplicate costs 1,000 gp in alchemical materials and requires 1 week to grow. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Calligraphy** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist can create especially volatile pigments that detonate when agitated. This requires expending one daily use of his bombs, but otherwise functions as [explosive runes](spell:explosive_runes) except that it deals damage as one of the alchemist's bombs. The alchemist can expend an additional daily use of his bombs to apply one discovery that applies to his bombs, such as acid bomb or dispelling bomb, to the runes created with this discovery. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Explosive Missile** (*[Ultimate Combat](source:Ultimate_Combat)*): As a standard action, the alchemist can infuse a single arrow, crossbow bolt, or one-handed firearm bullet with the power of his bomb, load the ammunition, and shoot the ranged weapon. He must be proficient with the weapon in order to accomplish this. When the infused ammunition hits its target, it deals damage normally and detonates as if the alchemist had thrown the bomb at the target. If the explosive missile misses, it does not detonate. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Fire Brand (Su)** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): ([Goblin](race:Goblin) only) An alchemist with this discovery can expend one daily bomb use to apply the bomb reagents to his weapon as a swift action. A weapon treated this way deals fire damage as if it had the [flaming](unknown:flaming) weapon special ability. At 10th level, the weapon is treated as if it had the [flaming burst](unknown:flaming_burst) weapon special ability. The bomb reagents continue burning for 1 minute or until extinguished by dousing the weapon in water. An alchemist can use this ability with natural weapons, but he takes 1d6 points of fire damage per round for each natural weapon treated.",
			"",
			"**Gills** (*[Pathfinder #123: The Flooded Cathedral](source:Pathfinder_#123:_The_Flooded_Cathedral)*): An alchemist with this discovery grows a set of gills that allow him to breathe water in addition to breathing air. When on land, the alchemist risks his gills drying out and must bathe his gills with 1/2 gallon of water every 24 hours he is out of the water or take 1 point of Constitution damage every hour thereafter. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Glimmering Infusion (Sp)** (*[Spymaster's Handbook](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)*): The alchemist can expend any prepared extract to produce a cube of glowing motes that act as per [glitterdust](spell:glitterdust). The area must be adjacent to the alchemist and covers one 5-foot square per level of extract sacrificed, and the effect's save DC is calculated using the level of the sacrificed extract. The alchemist must have the infusion discovery to choose this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Alchemical Simulacrum (Su)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to create a simulacrum. This works like the [simulacrum](spell:simulacrum) spell, except it costs 100 gp in alchemical materials per Hit Die of the simulacrum, requires 24 hours to grow, and decays into inert flesh rather than ice or snow if killed. An alchemist must be at least 14th level and must have the alchemical simulacrum discovery before selecting this discovery. The created simulacrum is a creature, not a supernatural effect.",
			"",
			"**Greater Constructive Dyes** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist expands the set of objects he can create with his constructive dyes. The alchemist can expend one additional use of his daily bombs when using his constructive dyes discovery to create objects, as [major creation](spell:major_creation). The alchemist must be at least 10th level and have the constructive dyes and divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Greater Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create lifelike images. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces sound, smell, and heat, as [major image](spell:major_image). The alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the divine inks and improved divine inks discoveries before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Healing Touch (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal other creatures. As a standard action, he may touch a creature and apply 1 round's effect of his spontaneous healing discovery to that creature; this counts toward his spontaneous healing limit for the day. The alchemist's daily limit for hit points healed by spontaneous healing increases to 5 &times; his alchemist level. This ability only functions if the target is the same type of creature (humanoid, undead, and so on) as the alchemist. An alchemist must be at least 6th level and must have the spontaneous healing discovery or class ability before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Improved Divine Inks** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist's unique dyes allow him to create images accompanied by sound. If he expends an additional daily use of his bombs, the image he creates with the divine inks discovery also produces minor sounds, as [minor image](spell:minor_image). The alchemist must be at least 4th level and must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lasting Tinctures (Ex)** (*[Potions and Poisons](source:Potions_and_Poisons)*): The alchemist knows how to make [tinctures](unknown:tinctures) that last much longer than normal. The durations of the effects of any tinctures the alchemist brews using the Craft skill are doubled. When the alchemist uses this discovery to brew a longer-lasting tincture, the tincture imposes its normal penalties on the alchemist even if the alchemist has an ability that reduces tinctures' penalties (such as the [substance tolerance ability of the fermenter alchemist archetype](unknown:substance_tolerance_ability_of_the_fermenter_alchemist_archetype) presented in this section). An alchemist with this discovery can brew tinctures with normal durations.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Plague** (*[Advanced Race Guide](source:Advanced_Race_Guide)*): Any creature that must make a save against a disease caused by the alchemist's extract or other class ability must make a second save 1 round later to avoid doubling the duration of the disease effect. If the disease doesn't have a duration, this discovery reduces its onset time and frequencies by half. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Lingering Spirit (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist is familiar enough with the ties between his body and spirit that he lingers at death's door far longer than a normal person. He treats his Constitution as 10 points higher than normal for the purpose of determining when hit point damage kills him (so an alchemist with a Constitution of 10 and this discovery dies at -20 hit points instead of -10). Reducing him to 0 Constitution or its equivalent (from ability damage, ability drain, Constitution penalties, and so on) makes him unconscious and comatose, but he is only killed after taking an additional 5 points of Constitution damage, drain, or penalty (in effect, the alchemist must be brought to -5 Constitution in order to be killed by these attacks). An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Living Pigment** (*[Heroes of Golarion](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)*): The alchemist infuses his inks and dyes with a spark of animating force. As a standard action, he can expend one daily use of his bombs and a 1st-level extract he has prepared to create a creature, as [summon monster I](spell:summon_monster_1), using his level as the spell's caster level. The extract is expended as if the alchemist had consumed it. The alchemist can expend a higher-level extract when using this ability to create a creature using a [summon monster](spell:summon_monster) spell of a level equal to the level of extract expended. For example, if the alchemist expends a 4th-level extract, he can create a creature as if using [summon monster IV](spell:summon_monster_4). Additionally, the alchemist can expend an additional use of his daily bombs when creating a creature in this way to grant the creature the [celestial](monster/template:celestial) or [fiendish](monster/template:fiendish) template. The alchemist must have the divine inks discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Material Mastery (Ex)** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:Cohorts_and_Companions)*): Your superior knowledge of the nature of matter enables you to ignore spell requirements more easily when crafting magic items. By expending an extract of the same school and level as a spell prerequisite when crafting a magic item, you take only a -2 penalty for ignoring that requirement, instead of -5.",
			"",
			"**Method to the Madness (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): The alchemist has learned to channel his madness into one of his alchemist class abilities. When the alchemist takes this discovery, he chooses one of either bombs or extracts. If he selects bombs, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus when determining the bonus to damage and the saving throw DCs of his bombs. If the alchemist selects extracts, he uses his Charisma bonus in place of his Intelligence bonus to calculate bonus extracts per day. The alchemist must have the [madness extraordinary ability](unknown:madness_extraordinary_ability) to take this discovery. This discovery can be taken twice, allowing the alchemist to select both bombs and extracts.",
			"",
			"**Monstrous Graft (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): The alchemist can replace up to four of his own amputated limbs with those of a monstrous beast of the same size category. If the grafted limb is an arm, the alchemist gains either a climb speed of 15 feet or a claw or slam natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 for a Small alchemist). If the grafted limb is a leg, the alchemist gains one of the following benefits: a +5 bonus to land speed, a swim speed of 15 feet, or a +5 bonus on Acrobatics checks when jumping. For each limb the alchemist replaces in this manner, he takes a -2 penalty to Wisdom as he loses his sense of self. [Derros](unknown:Derros) are immune to this penalty.",
			"",
			"**Mummification (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist has mastered preserving flesh and applied this knowledge to his own body, turning himself into an undeadlike creature. After learning this discovery, the alchemist must perform a 30-day regimen of a special diet, rigorous exercise, and drinking a mildly poisonous alchemical tea. At the end of this regimen, he falls unconscious for 24 hours, then awakens as a \"living mummy.\" The alchemist's type does not change, but he becomes immune to cold, nonlethal damage, paralysis, and sleep. An alchemist must be at least 10th level and must have the preserve organs discovery before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Parasitic Twin (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist's vestigial limbs are part of a parasitic twin on his torso, consisting of a head, a torso, and two arms (from the vestigial limb discovery). Normally, the twin is mostly recessed within the alchemist's body, with the visible arms acting like the vestigial arm discovery, though the alchemist can manifest or hide the twin as a standard action. The twin is helpless, fully subservient to the alchemist, and cannot be targeted or harmed. Once per day, if the alchemist succumbs to a mental effect that would make him unconscious, helpless, or not in control of his own actions (such as [charm person](spell:charm_person), [feeblemind](spell:feeblemind), or [hold person](spell:hold_person)), he can reroll his saving throw; success means the twin absorbs the effect and the alchemist can ignore it. Using this ability sickens the alchemist for the duration of the absorbed effect (removing the effect from the twin ends the sickened condition), and he cannot use the twin's limbs during that time, though passive effects (such as from rings worn on the vestigial limbs) continue normally. The alchemist must have selected the vestigial arm discovery twice before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Phantom Limb** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:Undead_Slayer's_Handbook)*): The alchemist can manifest a ghostly, incorporeal arm that juts out from his torso. This phantom limb does not grant the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, and it cannot hold or grab anything (including incorporeal objects). The alchemist may use his phantom limb to make a touch attack against a foe as a standard action, scraping away at the very fibers of the victim's soul. This attack deals 1d4 points of damage per alchemist level (Fortitude half ). Creatures that are immune to incorporeal attacks are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction except DR/ epic. The alchemist may suppress or activate this ability as a free action, and can use his phantom limb for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier (these rounds need not be consecutive). An alchemist must be at least 8th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Pheromones (Su)** (*[Ultimate Wilderness](source:Ultimate_Wilderness)*): The alchemist exudes an imperceptible musk that grants him a permanent +3 competence bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks.",
			"",
			"**Preserve Organs (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist learns how to preserve and protect his vital organs, reducing the chance of a mortal wound. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the alchemist, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. This does not stack with similar abilities that negate critical hits and sneak attacks (such as [fortification](unknown:fortification) armor). An alchemist can take this discovery up to three times; the effects stack, increasing this chance to 50% and then 75%.",
			"",
			"**Promethean Disciple** (*[Occult Adventures](source:Occult_Adventures)*): An alchemist with this discovery learns how to craft constructs by way of alchemical research rather than arcane magic. The alchemist gains [Craft Construct](feat:Craft_Construct) as a bonus feat without needing to meet its requirements. The alchemist substitutes his number of ranks in Craft (alchemy) for his total caster level and must use Craft (alchemy) to create the construct. The DC to create the construct still increases for any necessary spells that the alchemist does not have access to. However, the alchemist can use extracts in place of spells as spell prerequisites. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Psychokinetic Tincture** (*[Undead Slayer's Handbook](source:Undead_Slayer's_Handbook)*): Once per day, the alchemist can concoct a foul-tasting tincture that harnesses the power of the spirit. By drinking this tincture as a standard action, the alchemist can invite the latent spirits in the area to surround him. The alchemist can channel one spirit for every 4 alchemist levels he possesses. Each spirit channeled this way grants the alchemist a +1 deflection bonus to AC as the spirits whirl around his body. As a standard action, the alchemist can launch one of these spirits toward a target as a ranged touch attack. Launching a spirit this way reduces this discovery's deflection bonus to AC by 1. As a launched spirit passes through its target's body, it emits a terrible wail heard only in the target's mind, causing the target to become frightened for 1 round per alchemist level (Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the wail cannot be affected by this discovery again for 24 hours. The spirits whirl around the alchemist's body for 10 minutes per alchemist level, or until the alchemist has launched all of the spirits. An alchemist must be at least 4th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Ranged Baptism (Su)** (*[Champions of Purity](source:Champions_of_Purity)*): When the alchemist uses holy water as a splash weapon, any squares subject to its effects (including creatures affected by splash damage) or that contain creatures subject to its effects are also affected as if by [consecrate](spell:consecrate), for a number of rounds equal to the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. Undead struck by holy water remain affected by the [consecrate](spell:consecrate) effect even if they leave the affected area. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Remady Extract** (*[Healer's Handbook](source:Healer's_Handbook)*): When the alchemist creates an extract, he can add one nonmagical alchemical remedy (such as an antitoxin) to it. When the extract is consumed, both the formula and the alchemical remedy take effect. The extract has a level 1 higher than normal. This discovery cannot be combined with other methods of combining multiple consumed items or extracts into one. An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Sandstone Solution (Su)** (*[People of the Sands](source:People_of_the_Sands)*): As a full-round action, the alchemist can convert any potion or extract into a solution that, when thrown or applied, solidifies sand or dirt to the hardness of stone for 1 hour, affecting an area with a radius of 10 feet &times; the level of the potion or extract. If this solution is thrown at or applied to stone, it instead causes a 5-foot cube of stone to become crumbly and soft for 1 minute, reducing its hardness by double the level of the potion or extract.",
			"",
			"**Sleeper Agent (Su)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): The alchemist learns how to create a sleeper agent, whom he releases back into its original society none the wiser. The alchemist can create a sleeper agent in a ritual that takes 1 minute; the target must be unconscious for the ritual's duration. At any time during the next year, as long as he is within 1 mile of the sleeper agent, the alchemist can activate the agent's programming. When the sleeper agent is activated, treat her as if she were the target of a [dominate person](spell:dominate_person) spell with a caster level equal to the alchemist's level at the time the sleeper agent was created. If the sleeper agent is killed or the dominate person effect's duration expires, the sleeper agent is permanently released from the alchemist's control. The alchemist can also release any sleeper agent as a free action. The alchemist can have one active sleeper agent for every 6 alchemist levels he possesses. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Spell Knowledge** (*[Cohorts and Companions](source:Cohorts_and_Companions)*): Your studies into how all things are interconnected have taught you to cast a very limited number of spells. Select a single spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list that is at least 2 levels lower than your highest-level extract known. You can prepare and cast this spell as an arcane spell. Preparing the spell uses up an extract slot 1 level higher than the spell's level. Your caster level is equal to your alchemist level, and your save DCs and concentration checks are Intelligence-based. You're considered to have this spell on your spell list for purposes of prerequisites, spell completion items, and spell trigger items. You may select this discovery more than once. Each time, it grants you access to another spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list.",
			"",
			"**Spontaneous Healing (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains the ability to heal from wounds rapidly. As a free action once per round, he can heal 5 hit points as if he had the fast healing ability. He can heal 5 hit points per day in this manner for every 2 alchemist levels he possesses. If the alchemist falls unconscious because of hit point damage and he still has healing available from this ability, the ability activates automatically each round until he is conscious again or the ability is depleted for the day.",
			"",
			"**Subsumed Spirit (Ex)** (*[Inner Sea Monster Codex](source:Inner_Sea_Monster_Codex)*): As the alchemist grows in power, his parasitic twin laps up a portion of his soul, like a dog feeding on its master's scraps. The alchemist's parasitic twin can now manifest or hide within the alchemist's torso as a move action. As a standard action, the alchemist can cause his manifested twin to babble, driving listeners insane.

The tentacle is fully under his control and cannot be concealed except with magic or bulky clothing. The tentacle does not give the alchemist any extra attacks or actions per round, though he can use it to make a tentacle attack (1d4 damage for a Medium alchemist, 1d3 damage for a Small one) with the grab ability. The tentacle can manipulate or hold items as well as the alchemist's original arms can (for example, allowing the alchemist to use one hand to wield a weapon, the tentacle to hold a potion, and the third hand to throw a bomb).

As a standard action, the alchemist can have the tumor detach itself from his body as a separate creature vaguely resembling a kind of animal suitable for a familiar (bat, cat, and so on) and move about as if it were an independent creature. The tumor can reattach itself to the alchemist as a standard action. The tumor has all the abilities of the animal it resembles (for example, a batlike tumor can fly) and familiar abilities based on the alchemist's caster level (though some familiar abilities may be useless to an alchemist). The tumor acts as the alchemist's familiar whether attached or separated (providing a skill bonus, the [Alertness](feat:Alertness) feat, and so on). When attached to the alchemist, the tumor has fast healing 5. An alchemist's extracts and mutagens are considered spells for the purposes of familiar abilities like share spells and deliver touch spells. If a tumor familiar is lost or dies, it can be replaced 1 week later through a specialized procedure that costs 200 gp per alchemist level. The ritual takes 8 hours to complete.",

An alchemist must be at least 4th level before selecting this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Wings (Ex)** (*[Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic)*): The alchemist gains batlike, birdlike, or insectlike functional wings, allowing him to fly as the fly spell for a number of minutes per day equal to his caster level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. An alchemist can select this discovery multiple times; each time he does so, he adds his caster level to the number of minutes per day that he can fly with the wings. This flight is an extraordinary ability. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery."

					"**Command the Meek (Ex):** At 8th level, the cavalier treats all of her allies with the shaken condition as though they had the same teamwork feats as the cavalier for the purpose of determining whether the cavalier receives a bonus from her teamwork feats. Her allies do not receive any bonuses from these feats unless they actually have the feats themselves. The allies' positioning and actions must still meet the prerequisites listed in the teamwork feat for the cavalier to receive the listed bonus.

The ally must have the shaken condition or have no more than half the Hit Dice of the cavalier, and the ally gains a Reflex save to negate this ability's effect entirely (DC = 10 + half the cavalier's level + the higher of her Strength modifier or Charisma modifier). If the attack hits, the damage is split evenly between the cavalier and the ally. If the ally's save was a natural 1, the ally takes all of the damage, including any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.). An ally can purposefully fail this saving throw, but cannot purposefully roll a natural 1."

					"**Wild Mount Shape (Su):** At 8th level, an order of the of the beast cavalier gains the ability to turn his mount into a different Medium or Large animal and back again once per day. His options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions as [beast shape II](spell:beast_shape_2), except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per cavalier level, or until the cavalier chooses to change his mount back. Changing the mount's form (to a different animal or back to normal) requires the cavalier to touch his mount as a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

			"## Variant Channeling",
			"",
			"(Source: [Ultimate Magic](source:Ultimate_Magic))",
			"",
			"An iconic ability of clerics is their power to channel positive or negative energy, whether for healing, for damage, or to turn or command the undead. However, given the great variety of deities and their divine portfolios, it naturally follows that some deities would endow their mortal servants with the power to channel energies in other ways that more closely mirror their particular focus. The following categories are examples of alternative channeling abilities based on the nature of a deity's power; for example, a fire deity's negative energy channeling may deal fire damage as part of or instead of the damage from channeling.",
			"",
			"When you create a cleric character, decide whether she uses the standard form of channel energy or a variant presented here based on one aspect of her deity's portfolio. Once this choice is made, it cannot be altered. Variant channeling has the same area of effect, save DCs, uses per day, and other rules relating to channeling energy. Feats and abilities that modify or present alternative uses for channeled energy (such as Command Undead and Turn Undead) work normally with these variant channeling abilities.",
			"",
			"A variant channeling either modifies positive channeled energy when used to heal or modifies negative energy when used to harm. When using positive energy to heal, affected creatures gain only half the normal amount of healing but also receive a specific beneficial effect. When channeling negative energy to harm, affected creatures take only half the normal damage but take an additional penalty or harmful effect; a successful saving throw negates the additional penalty or effect but does not reduce the damage any further. Creatures that would normally ignore the effect of a particular channel (such as undead with respect to a positive energy channel used to heal) ignore the variant effect of that channel.",
			"",
			"Some variant channeling abilities are enhanced when used on particular creature types. Such channeling increases the normal healing or damage from channeled energy by 50% for that creature type, rather than the default half healing or damage for the alternative channeling. For example, a 7th-level cleric normally heals 4d6 points of damage with channeled positive energy; with the Nature alternative channeling, that cleric instead heals only half that amount (2d6) when channeling, but heals animals and fey an additional +50% over the unhalved value (4d6 + 50%).",
			"",
			"Unless otherwise stated, bonuses granted by a variant channeling are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. If an alternative channeled energy provides a \"channel bonus\" on rolls or statistics, the bonus is +1, increasing to +2 at cleric level 5 and for every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of +5). Likewise, a \"channel penalty\" is initially -1, increasing to -2 at cleric level 5 and every 5 cleric levels thereafter (to a maximum of -5).",
			"",
			"A character who has the channel energy ability from a class other than cleric may use these variant channeling rules if the class's abilities are tied to serving a deity. For example, paladins can select alternative channeling abilities if they serve a deity, as can oracles with the Life mystery (as they serve many deities), but necromancer wizards cannot.",
			"",
			"The following is a list of example portfolios and the variant channeling abilities available to each.",

Unlike many of her deific counterparts, Urgathoa champions the shepherding and protection of haunts and possessing spirits, even to the danger and detriment of her own followers. The faithful of the Pallid Princess believe that by prolonging the torment and tortured existence of a spirit, they create something akin to a beautiful piece of artwork. In a similar manner, servants of Urgathoa view the possession of a mortal body by a deceased spirit as a blessing.",

			"Highly skilled and tenacious fighters can gain *advanced armor training*, learning techniques and applications of the armor training class feature that give them special benefits in exchange for reducing their ability to mitigate their armor's armor check penalty and improve its maximum Dexterity bonus. Beginning at 7th level, instead of increasing the benefits provided by armor training (reducing his armor's check penalty by 1 and increasing its maximum Dexterity bonus by 1), a fighter can choose an advanced armor training option. If the fighter does so, he still gains the ability to move at his normal speed while wearing medium armor at 3rd level, and while wearing heavy armor at 7th level.",

			"The fighter can use his base attack bonus in place of his ranks in one skill of his choice from the following list: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (engineering), Profession (soldier), Ride, or Swim. The fighter need not be wearing armor or using a shield to use this option. When using adaptable training, the fighter substitutes his total base attack bonus (including his base attack bonus gained through levels in other classes) for his ranks in this skill, but adds the skill's usual ability score modifier and any other bonuses or penalties that would modify that skill. Once a skill has been selected, it cannot be changed and the fighter can immediately retrain all of his ranks in the selected skill at no additional cost in money or time. In addition, the fighter adds all skills chosen with this option to his list of class skills. A fighter can choose this option up to four times.",

While wearing the selected type of armor, the fighter adds one-quarter of his fighter level to the armor's armor bonus, up to a maximum bonus of +3 for light armor, +4 for medium armor, or +5 for heavy armor. This increase to the armor bonus doesn't increase the benefit that the fighter gains from feats, class abilities, or other effects that are determined by his armor's base armor bonus, including other advanced armor training options. A fighter can choose this option multiple times. Each time he chooses it, he applies its benefit to a different type of armor.",

			"While wearing armor, the fighter gains a bonus on Intimidate checks based upon the type of armor he is wearing: +1 for light armor, +2 for medium armor, or +3 for heavy armor. This bonus increases by 1 at 7th level and every 4 fighter levels thereafter, to a maximum of +4 at 19th level. In addition, the fighter adds half his armored confidence bonus to the DC of Intimidate checks to demoralize him.",

If the fighter is 19th level and has the armor mastery class feature, these DR values increase by 5. The DR from this ability stacks with that provided by adamantine armor, but  not with other forms of damage reduction. This damage reduction does not apply if the fighter is helpless, stunned, or unconscious.",

Since the object is enfolded in strands of aether, even if you use this power on a magic weapon or other unusual object, the attack doesn't use any of the magic weapon's bonuses or effects; it simply deals your blast damage. Alternatively, you can loosen the strands of aether in order to deal damage to both the object and the target as though you had thrown the object yourself (instead of dealing your normal blast damage). You substitute your Constitution modifier for your Strength modifier if throwing the object would have added your Strength modifier on the damage roll, and you don't take the -4 penalty on the attack roll for throwing an object that wasn't designed to be thrown. In this case, the object's special effects apply (including effects from its materials), and if the object is a weapon, you must be proficient with it and able to wield it with one hand; otherwise, the item deals damage as a one-handed improvised weapon for a creature of your size."

By using a bone or skull from the appropriate creature or a doll shaped like that creature, you can select any of the familiar choices available to a wizard. You can instead use a humanoid bone, doll, or skull, to give the puppet the base statistics of a homunculus, but without a fly speed or the poison bite or telepathic link abilities. No matter the form, this creature is a construct with an alignment matching your own. You can have no more than one soulbound puppet active at any given time.

These temporary hit points stack with those from other sources, but not with those gained through multiple uses of this ability. At 4th level, as long as the shroud remains, you also gain a resistance bonus on all saving throws against death effects, fear effects, and any spells or effects that bestow negative levels or deal negative energy damage (if the spells or effects allow a save). This bonus is equal to 1 + 1 for every 4 occultist levels you possess beyond 4th. You must be at least 3rd level to select this focus power.",

					"",
					"*Delay Affliction (Su):* Once per day as an immediate action, whenever you fail a saving throw against a disease or poison, you may ignore its effects for 1 hour per level. At 7th and 15th level, you can use this ability one additional time per day.",
					"",
					"*Energy Body (Su):* As a standard action, you can transform your body into pure life energy, resembling a golden-white fire elemental. In this form, you gain the elemental subtype and give off a warm, welcoming light that increases the light level within 10 feet by one step, up to normal light. Any undead creature striking you with its body or a handheld weapon deals normal damage, but at the same time the attacker takes 1d6 points of positive energy damage + 1 point per oracle level. Creatures wielding melee weapons with reach are not subject to this damage if they attack you. If you grapple or attack an undead creature using unarmed strikes or natural weapons, you may deal this damage in place of the normal damage for the attack. Once per round, if you pass through a living allied creature's square or the ally passes through your square, it heals 1d6 hit points + 1 per oracle level. You may use this ability to heal yourself as a move action. You choose whether or not to heal a creature when it passes through your space. You may return to your normal form as a free action. You may remain in energy body form for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level.",
					"",
					"*Enhanced Cures (Su):* Whenever you cast a cure spell, the maximum number of hit points healed is based on your oracle level, not the limit based on the spell. For example, an 11th-level oracle of life with this revelation may cast cure light wounds to heal 1d8+11 hit points instead of the normal 1d8+5 maximum.",
					"",
					"*Healing Hands (Ex):* You gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks. You may provide first aid to two people or treat two people for poison as a standard action (make a separate Heal check for each creature). When using the Heal skill to treat wounds from caltrops (and so on), treat deadly wounds, treat poison, treat disease, or treat long-term care, you may treat double the normal number of people you may treat at the same time. You may provide long-term care for yourself.",
					"",
					"*Life Link (Su):* As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have one bond active per oracle level. This bond continues until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same immediate action).",
					"",
					"*Lifesense (Su):* You notice and locate living creatures within 30 feet, just as if you possessed the blindsight ability. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Safe Curing (Su):* Whenever you cast a spell that cures the target of hit point damage, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity for spellcasting.",
					"",
					"*Spirit Boost (Su):* Whenever your healing spells heal a target up to its maximum hit points, any excess points persist for 1 round per level as temporary hit points (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to your oracle level).",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a perfect channel for life energy. You become immune to bleed, death attacks, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea effects, negative levels, and sickened effects. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce you below 1 in any ability score. You automatically make saving throws against massive damage. When you are below 0 hit points, you do not die until your negative total is in excess of twice your Constitution score."

					"",
					"*Brain Drain (Su):* You can take a standard action to violently probe the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 100 feet. The target receives a Will save to negate the effect and immediately knows the source of this harmful mental prying. Those who fail this save are wracked with pain, taking 1d4 points of damage per oracle level. After successfully attacking with this ability, you may use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to make a single Knowledge check using the victim's skill bonus.

You may enter your focused trance a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.",

You gain a +1 inherent bonus to Intelligence upon taking this revelation and another at every third oracle level gained thereafter. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Sidestep Secret (Su):* Your innate understanding of the universe has granted you preternatural reflexes and the uncanny ability to step out of danger at the very last second. Add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your Dexterity.",
					"",
					"*Spontaneous Symbology:* Your knowledge of the secret history of the world has unveiled the mysterious symbols that govern reality. You can cast any \"symbol\" spell using a spell slot of the appropriate level, even if the spell is not on your list of spells known. A symbol spell is any spell with the word \"symbol\" in its name. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Think On It (Ex):* Once per day, the oracle of lore can re-attempt any previously failed Knowledge check. On this attempt, add a +10 competence bonus on the check.",
					"",
					"*Whirlwind Lesson (Ex):* You can quickly browse through a magical tome or manual, gaining its benefits with only a single 8-hour study session (rather than the usual 48 hours over a period of 6 days). At 7th level, you may allow another character to join in your study; both of you gain the full benefit of having read the book. At 15th level, you may share your whirlwind lesson with a number of characters equal to your oracle level. The benefits to you are permanent, whereas your students gain the tome or manual's benefits for a number of days equal to your Charisma modifier but then forget what they have learned.",

At 11th level, as a standard action, you can focus on a specific object or area (the size of which can be no greater than a 10-foot-by-10-foot square) and see it as though with true seeing as long as the moon is shining on it. Moonless nights, cloudy skies, and shadows interfere with this ability.",
					"",
					"*Gift of Claw and Horn (Su):* As a swift action, you gain a natural weapon. The natural weapon lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your oracle level (minimum 1). You must choose a bite, claw, or gore attack. These attacks deal the normal damage for a creature of your size. At 5th level, your natural weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Mantle of Moonlight (Su):* Your innate understanding of the moon renders you immune to the curse of lycanthropy. Additionally, you may disrupt a lycanthrope's connection to the moon with a successful touch attack. This action automatically forces the lycanthrope into its humanoid form, in which it must remain for a number of rounds equal to your oracle level. Upon reaching 5th level, you can use this ability to force others into a rage, as the spell. Using this ability is a melee touch attack. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level plus one additional time per day for every 5 levels above 5th.",
					"",
					"*Moonbeam (Su):* You can fire a ray of moonlight as a ranged touch attack at any creature within 30 feet. This ray deals 1d6 points of damage + 1 for every 2 oracle levels you possess. In addition, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become blinded for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).",
					"",
					"*Moonlight Bridge (Su):* You summon a bridge of moonlight. The 10-foot-wide span touches the ground at a point adjacent to you. It can extend from this point in any direction for 10 feet per oracle level. The path persists until you have crossed over the bridge or for 24 hours, whichever is shorter. You may summon a moonlight bridge a number of times per day equal to your Charisma bonus. Should the bridge be attacked, treat it as a wall of force.",
					"",
					"*Moonlit Script (Su):* Once per night while you sleep, your hands produce mysterious writing that pertains to the future. At 1st level, the prophetic writing manifests as an augury spell with 90% effectiveness. At 5th level, the writing takes the form of a divination with 90% effectiveness.

					"",
					"*Prophetic Armor (Ex):* You are so in tune with your primal nature that your instincts often act to save you from danger that your civilized mind isn't even aware of. You may use your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) as part of your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma, instead.",
					"",
					"*Touch of the Moon (Su):* The exact effects of this revelation depend on whether you cast inflict or cure spells. If you cast inflict spells, these spells carry with them the taint of madness. Subjects who take damage from your inflict spells are also subject to confusion, as the spell, except the duration of this effect is a number of rounds equal to the level of the inflict spell. The save DC against this effect is 10 + 1/2 your oracle level + your Charisma modifier. Alternatively, if you cast cure spells, these spells are potentially more effective but entirely in the target's mind. Whenever you cast a cure spell, you can cast it as though it were enhanced with the Empower Spell metamagic feat by expending two spell slots, except these hit points are temporary. This does not increase the level of the spell. Hit points healed this way expire after a number of minutes equal to half your oracle level. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",

Once per day, you can transform into a lycanthrope of your choice for a number of hours equal to your Charisma modifier, gaining all the powers of a natural lycanthrope of that type, including the ability to change shape between human, animal, and hybrid form. In addition, you become immune to mind-affecting and language-dependent effects, as well as effects that specifically target only humanoids."

					"*Steel Scarf (Su):* As a swift action, you can harden a scarf, sleeve, cloak, or other piece of your clothing into something as hard as steel that stretches out to be up to 30 feet long. You can then strike outward with it as if it were a weapon making a melee attack. For the purpose of this ability, you are proficient with this weapon.

You may add your Charisma modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, to your Armor Class and CMD. Any condition that would cause you to lose your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class instead causes you to lose your Charisma modifier to your Armor Class.",

This effect acts as the spell polymorph any object, working on both magical and nonmagical nonliving objects. The duration is always permanent. Unlike polymorph any object, it cannot be used to mimic the effects of other spells. Items subject to this effect receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate the effect.

Eight hours later, you emerge having changed your type to plant, animal, or humanoid, gaining superficial physical characteristics as appropriate (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies.

Lawful creatures in a chaotic-aligned area take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks, as do good creatures in an evil-aligned area. At 11th level, the infusion makes the area strongly aligned, which causes the -2 circumstance penalty to apply on all Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based checks made by any creature that lacks the matching alignment component (these penalties stack with those from the lower-level effect).

At 1st level, you can affect light sources up to the size of a torch. At 7th level, you can affect any Medium or smaller nonmagical light source (such as a campfire). At 14th level, you can affect Large or smaller nonmagical light sources (such as bonfires) and magical light sources up to the size of an everburning torch. If a creature is holding the light source you are trying to affect, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to avoid the effect.",
					"",

					"",
					"*Eldritch Scar (Su):* Once per day when you damage a creature with a spell you cast, you may, as a swift action, cause your magic to leave an eldritch scar upon that creature. An eldritch scar appears as a normal scar, save that it flickers with faint radiance of a color of your choice. The next time that creature casts a spell, uses a spell-like ability, or activates a magic item, it triggers a primal magic event (see page 13) of a CR equal to your caster level. This causes the eldritch scar to vanish. A creature can be marked by only one eldritch scar at a time (a more powerful one replaces a weaker one). An eldritch scar fades automatically after 24 hours. It can be removed before that point via any effect capable of removing a curse (the curse's level equals your caster level), but if an attempt to remove an eldritch scar fails, that attempt triggers a primal magic event-an event triggered this way does not cause the eldritch scar to fade. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Magic Penetration (Ex):* You gain a +2 bonus on any caster level check made to dispel or remove a magic effect (such as when using the dispel magic or remove curse spell). If you are 9th level or higher, the bonus increases to +4.",

You may use this ability once per day, plus one additional time for every 5 levels. At 15th level, you can change a spell to deal sonic damage, though the damage is halved. At 20th level, you can change a spell to deal force damage, though the damage is halved. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Primal Mastery (Su):* Whenever a spell you cast triggers a primal magic event (see page 13), or whenever you use a rod of wonder, roll d% twice when generating the result. You may pick which of the two results actually occurs. You gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist primal magic events or magical effects caused by a rod of wonder.",

At 13th level, you can cause any creature in the act of activating a magic item to trigger a primal magic event (see page 13). At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. A spellcaster can make a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell's level) to focus the magic and avoid triggering a primal magic effect, but non-spellcasters activating magic items have no such option. You must be at least 9th level before selecting this revelation.",

					"",
					"*Earth Glide (Su):* You can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except worked stone and metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, you can even glide through lava. You glide at your base land speed. While gliding, you breathe stone as if it were air (you do not need to hold your breath). Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or sign of your presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are flings you back 30 feet, stunning you for 1 round unless you succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save. Activating this ability is a free action. You can glide for 1 minute per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments.

					"",
					"*Mighty Pebble (Su):* As a standard action, you can charge and throw a pebble (or other stone of similar size) that detonates when it strikes a target as a ranged attack. The pebble has a range increment of 20 feet and has a +1 enhancement bonus to attack and damage for every four oracle levels you possess. Any creature struck by the pebble takes 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage per two oracle levels you possess (minimum 1d6). Creatures in squares adjacent to the target take half damage, or no damage if they make a Reflex saving throw. If the attack roll misses, treat the pebble as a thrown splash weapon to determine where it lands. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",

Damage for a hurled rock is 2d4 for a Medium creature or 2d3 for a Small creature, plus 1-1/2 your Strength bonus.",
					"",
					"*Shard Explosion (Su):* As a swift action, you can cause jagged pieces of stone to explode outward from your body. These shards deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the broken shards make the area difficult terrain until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
					"",
					"*Steelbreaker Skin (Su):* As a standard action, you can harden your flesh so that weapons that strike you are damaged or destroyed. Anytime a melee or ranged weapon strikes you, the weapon takes an amount of damage equal to your oracle level. This ability does not prevent the weapon from harming you unless the damage destroys the weapon attacking you. You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 minute/level.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

					"*Final Revelation:* At 20th level, the oracle's body takes on the consistency of rock, and her touch carries the heat of a volcano. She gains the fire and earth subtypes and becomes vulnerable to cold. Any fire damage she deals ignores the first 10 points of fire resistance, but not fire immunity. The oracle gains a +4 bonus to natural armor. Her attacks with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, and metal-hafted weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage.

					"",
					"*Lignification (Su):* Once per day, you can turn a creature into wood. As a standard action, you may direct your gaze against a single creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature (along with all its carried gear) must make a Fortitude save or turn into a mindless, inert statue made out of wood for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level. This ability otherwise functions as a flesh to stone spell, except the target turns to wood instead of stone. This can be reverse by any effect that can reverse flesh to stone. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Speak with Wood (Sp):* You can talk to wood and learn what it knows. You must spend 1 minute meditating on and communing with the wood. At the end of this time, you can speak with the wood. This functions as the stone tell spell, except with wood instead of stones. You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. You can speak with natural or worked wood. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.",
					"",
					"*Thorn Burst (Su):* As a swift action, you can cause sharp splinters of wood to explode outward from your body. These splinters deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the sharp splinters count as caltrops in the area until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",

					"*Tree Form (Sp):* As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Large living or dead tree or shrub, as tree shape. At 9th level, you can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as plant shape I. At 11th level, you can assume the form of a Large plant creature, as plant shape II.

At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/slashing. You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. The armor vanishes if you remove it.",
					"",
					"*Wood Bond (Ex):* Your mystical bond with wood is such that your weapons become an extension of your body. You gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls when wielding a weapon made of or mostly consisting of wood (such as a bow, club, quarterstaff, or spear). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.",
					"",
					"*Wood Sight (Su):* As a move action, you can alter your vision to see through underbrush and plant growth that would normally grant concealment, up to a range of 60 feet (though darkness and other obstacles still may block your sight). At 7th level, you can use this ability to see through wood or other plant material as easily as if it were transparent glass, penetrating a number of feet of wood equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.",
					"",
					"*Wooden Weapon (Su):* You can create a wooden club, quarterstaff, longspear, shortspear, or spear that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your size. You are considered proficient with the weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp. At 3rd level, the weapon is considered masterwork. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 11th level, the weapon gains the keen weapon property (or the equivalent increase to its critical threat range, if it is a bludgeoning weapon). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.",
					"",
					"*Woodland Stride (Ex):* You can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.",
					"",
					"*Final Revelation:* Upon reaching 20th level, you become a living creature of wood. You are forevermore treated as the plant type rather than your original type for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Your skin takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and you gain a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and damage reduction 10/- against wooden weapons or any natural attacks made by a wooden or woodlike creature. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. At will, you can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as meld into stone, except wood only, and with no limit to how long you can remain in the wood)."

An oathbound paladin swears an oath to eradicate a certain kind of evil. This powerful oath gives her access to new spells and adds to or alters typical paladin abilities.",

			"An oathbound paladin can take multiple oaths, but none of the other oaths can replace or alter the same class feature from the paladin class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin cannot take the Oath against Corruption and the Oath against the Wyrm because they both replace the aura of courage class feature.",

For example, an oathbound paladin who takes the Oath of Vengeance may be tasked with killing the orc warlord who razed her home city, while a paladin with the Oath against the Wyrm may be asked to secure a nonaggression pact with a family of dragons. When a paladin completes the sacred promise, the oath is fulfilled, and she may abandon the oath if she so chooses; she may then select another oath or become a standard paladin or a different paladin archetype.",

A creature that fails its save doesn't need to continue making saves while it's confused by this aura, and becomes immune for 24 hours once its confusion ends. This is a mind-affecting effect. You're immune to your own hallucinogenic aura, as well as that of any other psychic. You can brew an antidote that protects the imbiber from your aura. Brewing 1 dose requires 1 hour and a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. One dose's effects last for 1 month."

You can suppress only one effect at a time with this ability, and choosing a new target ends the suppression for the character you previously chose."

			"A psychic develops particular techniques to empower her spellcasting, called phrenic amplifications. The psychic can activate a phrenic amplification only while casting a spell using psychic magic, and the amplification modifies either the spell's effects or the process of casting it. The spell being cast is called the linked spell. The psychic can activate only one amplification each time she casts a spell, and doing so is part of the action used to cast the spell. She can use any amplification she knows with any psychic spell, unless the amplification's description states that it can be linked only to certain types of spells. A psychic learns one phrenic amplification at 1st level, selected from the list below. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, the psychic learns a new phrenic amplification. A phrenic amplification can't be selected more than once. Once a phrenic amplification has been selected, it can't be changed. Phrenic amplifications require the psychic to expend 1 or more points from her phrenic pool to function.",

For example, if the linked spell were [nondetection](spell:nondetection), the DC of the caster level check for using a divination on the warded creature or item would increase. This increase also applies to checks to dispel, counterspell, or identify the linked spell. The bonus applies while the spell is cast and lasts for the spell's duration (if appropriate), to a maximum of 24 hours. The psychic can choose to spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead increase the linked spell's DCs by 4.",

This increases the size of each die rolled, so a spell that dealt 4d6+3 points of force damage would deal 4d8+3 points of force damage instead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that deal force damage, and only if that damage includes a die value. A spell that already uses d12s for damage can't be amplified in this way.",

The psychic can spend 1 additional point to ignore penalties from cover (but not total cover).",

The psychic can instead spend 2 points to increase the bonus to +4. If the linked spell affects more than one creature, the psychic can spend the same number of points for each additional creature she wants to affect with this amplification. She must choose to spend either 1 point for each creature or 2 points for each creature; she can't grant different bonuses to different targets.",

			"**Mindtouch (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 61](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to probe one target's mind if that creature is affected by the linked spell. If the target of the linked spell fails its saving throw or is hit by the spell, the psychic detects its surface thoughts (as the 3rd-round effect of [detect thoughts](spell:detect_thoughts)). If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the thought-detection effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to spells that affect a target or an area. If the linked spell can affect more than one creature, the psychic can attempt to detect more than one target's thoughts by spending 1 additional point per creature beyond the first. She must select these targets when she casts the spell and spends the points. This is a mind-affecting effect.",

This unarmed attack still provokes attacks of opportunity as normal unless the psychic can otherwise make unarmed attacks without provoking attacks of opportunity.",
			"",
			"**Psychic Defense (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)): Reading small, invisible cues allows the psychic to take advantage of social circumstances and subtly influence her target. Casting a linked spell during a social encounter and spending 1 point from her phrenic pool allows the psychic to add a +4 bonus on her next Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check.",
			"",
			"**Psychofeedback (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source:Occult_Origins)): The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to sacrifice a linked spell of 2nd level or higher. Doing so grants the psychic a +1 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution per level of the sacrificed spell. This bonus lasts for 1 minute per psychic level.",
			"",
			"**Relentless Casting (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to roll twice on any caster level checks to overcome spell resistance required for the linked spell and take the better result. Because she must decide to spend points from her phrenic pool when she starts casting a spell, the psychic must decide to use this ability before the GM calls for the caster level check.",
			"",
			"**Telempathic Restoration (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source:Occult_Origins)): When the psychic casts [telepathic bond](spell:telepathic_bond), she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove the dazed, frightened, panicked, shaken, or stunned condition from one target of the bond. Doing so removes the status from the target of the linked spell, but applies it immediately (with any remaining duration) to the psychic.",
			"",
			"**Transfer Fear (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source:Occult_Origins)): When the psychic successfully affects a target with a fear effect, she can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to remove a fear effect from herself or one ally with whom she is in telepathic contact.",
			"",
			"**Undercast Surge (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source:Occult_Adventures)): When the psychic undercasts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to increase the spell's effective level, essentially using up a lower-level spell slot to cast a higher-level version of the spell. This costs 2 points per spell level increased. She can't use this ability to cast a version higher than the version she knows. For instance, a psychic who knows [mind thrust III](spell:mind_thrust_3) but not [mind thrust IV](spell:mind_thrust_4) could cast [mind thrust II](spell:mind_thrust_2) and spend 2 points to treat it as [mind thrust III](spell:mind_thrust_3), but couldn't spend 4 points to treat it as [mind thrust IV](spell:mind_thrust_4). This amplification can be linked only to spells that can be undercast.",

			"**Whisper of Ancients (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 13](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)): The psychic can send her consciousness into the Astral Plane for a glimpse of synchronous information. While casting a linked divination spell, the psychic can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to gain a +2 bonus on any associated skill check. She can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to instead gain a +4 bonus.",
			"",
			"**Will of the Dead (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 62](source:Occult_Adventures)): Even undead creatures can be affected by the psychic's mind-affecting spells. The psychic can spend 2 points from her phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on creatures that aren't undead. This amplification can be linked only to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor."

This reflected attack uses the original attack roll plus a circumstance bonus equal to the psychic's caster level.",
			"",
			"**Dispelling Pulse (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can spend 3 points from her phrenic pool to entwine dispelling magic with a targeted spell. If the target is hit by the linked spell or fails its saving throw, it's affected as though the psychic had cast a targeted [dispel magic](spell:dispel_magic) spell on it. This effect can dispel only spells of the linked spell's level or lower. If the linked spell doesn't already require an attack roll or allow a saving throw, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the dispelling effect only; the DC is calculated using the linked spell's level (and all other bonuses that would apply if the linked spell allowed a Will save). This amplification can be linked only to a spell that targets one creature or object.",
			"",
			"**Dual Amplification (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source:Occult_Adventures)): When the psychic uses this major amplification, she chooses two other amplifications or major amplifications she knows to apply to the same linked spell. She must spend 1 point from her phrenic pool to do so, plus the full cost of the two other amplifications. She can't apply the same amplification to the linked spell more than once, even if she can use that amplification for multiple different effects.",
			"",
			"**Mimic Metamagic (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source:Occult_Adventures)): When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell's level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell's level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell's casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal. This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn't quicken a 2nd-level spell because she's unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn't require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day. A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.",
			"",
			"**Space-rending Spell (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 63](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can warp space with her mind, teleporting herself as she casts her linked spell. She teleports herself 10 feet per point she spends from her phrenic pool (as [dimension door](spell:dimension_door)). The maximum number of points she can spend in this way is equal to the linked spell's level.",
			"",
			"**Subordinate Spell (Ex)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can divide her mind to cast a less powerful spell upon herself alongside her linked spell. The linked spell can't be lower than 5th level and can't take less than a standard action to cast. This applies to the actual casting time, so the psychic can't add a subordinate spell to a quickened spell. The subordinate spell's casting time must be 1 standard action or less, and its level can be no higher than the linked spell's level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5. The subordinate spell must target only the psychic (even if it could normally affect other or multiple targets). The psychic must spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to 3 + double the subordinate spell's level. The subordinate spell acts as though it had been cast, and uses up one of the psychic's spells per day of its level. The effects of the two spells are separate, so each might require its own concentration check.",
			"",
			"**Synaptic Shock (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic manipulates an enemy's mind with brute force, causing mental harm beyond that done by her linked spell. She can spend 1 point from her phrenic pool when casting a mind-affecting linked spell to select one of the spell's targets. If the target is affected by the linked spell, that target is confused for 1 round after the duration of the spell expires (or immediately, if the spell has an instantaneous duration). If the target succeeds at its save against the linked spell, it is instead confused for 1 round immediately. For each additional point the psychic spends from her phrenic pool, she can confuse one additional target of the linked spell. This amplification can be applied only to a mind-affecting spell that can affect a number of targets or that has an area. It has no effect on creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects, unless the linked spell is able to affect such creatures (such as a spell that has both will of the dead and synaptic shock applied to it via dual amplification).",
			"",
			"**Telepathic Targeting (Su)** ([Occult Origins pg. 16](source:Occult_Origins)): By spending 2 points from her phrenic pool, the psychic can target any creature with which she is in telepathic communication (whether via her *telepathic bond* ability, a creature's telepathy ability, or another effect) with the linked spell, even if the creature would normally be out of range. The linked spell must have the mind-affecting descriptor and must have a range of touch or greater.",
			"",
			"**Turning Shield (Su)** ([Occult Adventures pg. 64](source:Occult_Adventures)): The psychic can turn her excess spell energy into a barrier that deflects weaker spells. She can spend a number of points from her phrenic pool equal to the linked spell's level to gain the benefit of [spell turning](spell:spell_turning) for 1 round per psychic level. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the level of the linked spell."

While disguised as a servant, she gains a +2 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information among servants. Because she is easily overlooked as a servant, she can gather information from those she serves without asking them questions directly or alerting them to her interest.

She must declare the use of knock-out blow before she makes the attack. If the attack hits, it does normal damage, but instead of dealing sneak attack damage (and instead of any effect that triggers when the rogue deals sneak attack damage), the target falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces this effect to staggered for 1 round. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the rogue's level + the rogue's Intelligence modifier.",

			"&Dagger;**Quick Shot (Ex)** ([Pathfinder Unchained pg. 24](source:Pathfinder_Unchained): Whenever the rogue rolls initiative, she can also make a single attack with a ranged weapon as a swift action.

			"",
			"**Rumormonger (Ex)** ([Ultimate Combat pg. 1](source:Ultimate_Combat)): A rogue with this talent can attempt to spread a rumor though a small town or larger settlement by making a Bluff check. She can do so a number of times per week equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The DC is based on the size of the settlement, and it takes a week for the rumor to propagate through the settlement. If the check succeeds, the rumor is practically accepted as fact within the community; succeeding by 5 or more over the DC decreases the time it takes the rumor to propagate by 1d4 days. A failed check means the rumor failed to gain traction, while failing by 5 or more causes the opposite of the rumor or some other competing theory involving the rumor's subject to take hold.",

A rogue with shrinewalk can create her own shrine simply by designating an area in any urban region by placing a unique marking or rune on a wall or the ground. This marking is not magical, and if it is defaced or erased, it can no longer be used by the rogue (the marking can be hidden from view without removing its usability, including painting over the marking in question). Once placed, the rogue can use word of recall once per day to return to the shrine. A rogue can maintain one shrine at a time; if a new marking is created in a new location, the previous shrine becomes inactive.",
			"",
			"&dagger;**Skill Mastery** ([PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 70](source:PRPG_Core_Rulebook)): The rogue becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.",
			"",
			"Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier.

For the purposes of selecting and using this talent, she counts as a 10th-level vigilante with the stalker specialization, regardless of her actual rogue level. Her sneak attack counts as a hidden strike with reduced damage for the purpose of determining the effects of her vigilante talent, which means, among other things, that she can't apply any of the vigilante talents marked with an asterisk (*) to her sneak attacks.",
			"",
			"**Stealthy Sniper (Ex)** ([Advanced Player's Guide pg. 1](source:Advanced_Player's_Guide)): When a rogue with this talent uses the Stealth skill to snipe, she only suffers a -10 penalty on the Stealth check, instead of -20.",

On Golarion, these spirits can often be found near old ruins in Osirion or the Sodden Lands, although they are also quite active throughout the county of Versex in Ustalav. Many shamans who invoke the spirits of the Dark Tapestry also worship one or several of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos, be it out of fear or misinformed adoration. Other entities associated with the Dark Tapestry, particularly the Dominion of the Black, seem less likely to be associated with that realm's spirits, so it may well be that the spirits that shamans call upon when they turn to the Dark Tapestry for power are in fact the idle thoughts of horrors such as Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, or even Azathoth.",

You can allow any creature you can see who has previously entered your mindscape to automatically disbelieve the illusion as a free action."

She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check.

This movement doesn't negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square.

			"**Companion to the Lonely (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source:Inner_Sea_Intrigue)): Whether religiously motivated, as are followers of Arshea, Calistria, or Shelyn, or for purely carnal reasons, physical intimacy helps the vigilante cope with the loneliness of his double life. Once per day, the vigilante can spend at least 1 hour engaged in acts of physical pleasure with a willing partner to gain a pool of morale points equal to his Charisma bonus or his partner's Charisma bonus, whichever is higher. For the next 24 hours, the vigilante can spend a morale point as an immediate action to roll a Charisma-based skill check or a Will saving throw again after rolling the die but before learning the consequences; he must take the second result even if it is lower.",
			"",
			"**Conflicted Identity (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source:Antihero's_Handbook)): The vigilante's mind is in a constant state of turmoil, which makes him even more ethically and morally fluid than other vigilantes. When targeted by a harmful spell or effect that would affect the vigilante in his current identity but not his other identity (or when he would suffer a lesser effect in his other identity), he has a 50% chance of being affected as though he were in his other identity. This chance is rolled when the spell or effect is cast or triggered and before any spell resistance roll, if applicable. For example, if a vigilante has a lawful-neutral social identity and a neutral vigilante identity, he has a 50% chance of taking only half damage from a chaos hammer spell while in his social identity, since he would always take only half damage from a chaos hammer spell when in his vigilante identity.",
			"",
			"**Discreet Inquiries (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source:Inner_Sea_Intrigue)): The vigilante can attempt Diplomacy checks to gather information without being obvious he is seeking any, whether by buying the silence of informants or by talking foes into revealing information without realizing they are doing so. While the vigilante is in his area of renown, gathering information in this way takes 2d4 hours and costs 2d4 gp. Anyone who might take notice of the information gathering does not notice unless she succeeds at a Sense Motive check opposed by the vigilante's Bluff check. The vigilante gains a +4 bonus on this Bluff check.",
			"",
			"**Double Time (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity is that of a skilled and respected artisan or professional, rather than a merchant or noble. In order to complete his day's work while still continuing his vigilante activities, he has learned to work faster than normal, hiding his progress so it seems like he is working full shifts at his day job rather than spending some of that time on other pursuits. The vigilante needs to spend only 6 hours each day for mundane uses of the Craft or Profession skill, rather than 8 hours. If he has the social grace social talent, he needs to spend only 4 hours for any skill he's chosen with social grace. A vigilante must have a social identity appropriate to the chosen skill to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Entrepreneur (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): Select any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. The vigilante can use the selected skill to earn money as if he were using a Profession skill. If he selects Perform or Profession, the vigilante instead gains the skill unlock powers for those skills as appropriate for his number of ranks in that skill (Pathfinder RPG Pathfinder Unchained 82). If he has the social graceUI social talent, he can apply this benefit to all skills selected with the social grace talent.",
			"",
			"**Everyman (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can take on the appearance of a specific individual whenever he assumes a mundane guise using his many guises social talent. The individual must be a farmer, laborer, or peasant. While disguised as this individual, the vigilante receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as that individual. Any spell or ability designed to locate the individual has a 50% chance of finding the vigilante instead of the actual individual, and divination spells and abilities used on the vigilante give results as if he were the actual individual. Although this doesn't grant the vigilante any special knowledge of the individual, the vigilante's training grants him a +10 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to properly play the part of the individual. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the many guises social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Feign Innocence (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's social identity seems so innocent that it is hard to believe he was involved in wrongdoing. Within his area of renown, this provides a nonmagical effect identical to the innocence spell. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have the renown social talent to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Gossip Collector (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante sits at the center of a web of gossip, granting him access to the latest scuttlebutt with baffling speed. Whenever the vigilante is presented with a topic about which he would normally need to spend 1d4 hours to gather information, he must spend only 1d2 hours instead. If he has the renown social talent and gathers the information in his area of renown, he must instead spend only 1d4 &times; 10 minutes, and if he beats the DC to gather a piece of information by 20 or more, he knows that piece of information without spending any time at all; he has simply already heard that gossip. This ability doesn't allow him to gather information that isn't available in the locale he is canvassing, even if that locale is his area of renown.",
			"",
			"**Great Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante is known on a broader scale. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 5,000 individuals (a large town) or up to two communities of no more than 2,000 individuals each (two small towns). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks from his renown social talent while he is in his vigilante identity increases to +6. A vigilante must be at least 7th level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Guise of Life (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): An undead vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of one living creature identical to the vigilante's appearance in life. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were a living creature, and he counts as living for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be a living creature, and remains vulnerable to positive energy and spells that effect undead. The vigilante must be a corporeal undead creature to select this talent. Humanoid vigilantes with the negative energy affinity racial trait can also select this talent, gaining a human social identity.",
			"",
			"**Guise of Unlife (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 26](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): A vigilante with this talent gains an additional social identity in the form of an undead version of one of his existing social identities, such as a ghoul, vampire, or zombie. Successful Knowledge checks reveal information about the vigilante as if he were undead, and he counts as undead for the purpose of divination spells and effects. He gains no other benefit from appearing to be an undead creature, and remains vulnerable to negative energy and spells that effect the living. The vigilante must be a living creature to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Hidden Magic (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source:Antihero's_Handbook)): The auras of magic items the vigilante is carrying are hidden (as per magic aura). The vigilante can suppress or reactivate this effect as a standard action. At 11th level, the vigilante and any magic items he is carrying appear to be nonmagical (as if he had cast greater magic aura). The vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Immediate Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can change identities as a move action, and he no longer needs to spend extra time to adjust his appearance and persona. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and must have the quick change social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**In Vogue (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's crafting or professional business is always at the height of the local trends, allowing the vigilante to gain more profits than usual. Goods he crafts with a Craft skill he chose with social grace are worth 1/3 more gp than normal due to his celebrity, without increasing the cost to create. Whenever he uses a Profession skill he chose with social grace to make money, he makes twice as much money. A vigilante must be at least 5th level and have both the double time and social grace social talents to take this talent.",
			"",
			"**Incredible Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante is incredibly famous in both identities. He can gain renown in a single community of up to 25,000 individuals (a large city) or up to two smaller cities of no more than 10,000 individuals each (two small cities). The bonus while he is in his social identity remains unchanged, but the circumstance bonus to Intimidate from his great renown social talent while in he is in his vigilante identity increases to +8. A vigilante must be at least 11th level and have the great renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Instant Recognition (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante is so well known that his name precedes him, even to other communities. It only takes 4 hours of effort to get the word out to transfer his renown benefits to a new community. A vigilante must be at least 13th level and have both the incredible renown and triumphant return social talents to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Intrigue Feats (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): The vigilante gains one of the following feats as a bonus feat: [Blustering Bluff](feat:Blustering_Bluff), [But a Scratch](feat:But_a_Scratch), [Call Truce](feat:Call_Truce), [Confabulist](feat:Confabulist), [Criminal Reputation](feat:Criminal_Reputation), [Cutting Humiliation](feat:Cutting_Humiliation), [Esoteric Linguistics](feat:Esoteric_Linguistics), [Intoxicating Flattery](feat:Intoxicating_Flattery), [Ironclad Logic](feat:Ironclad_Logic), [Nerve-Racking Negotiator](feat:Nerve-Racking_Negotiator), [Orator](feat:Orator), [Persuasive Bribery](feat:Persuasive_Bribery), [Play to the Crowd](feat:Play_to_the_Crowd), [Quick Favor](feat:Quick_Favor), [Rhetorical Flourish](feat:Rhetorical_Flourish), [Sense Assumptions](feat:Sense_Assumptions), [Sense Relationships](feat:Sense_Relationships), or [Street Smarts](feat:Street_Smarts). He must meet the feat's prerequisites. This talent can be selected multiple times; each time, the vigilante gains a new feat from the above list.",
			"",
			"**Kalistocrat's Acumen (Ex)** ([Inner Sea Intrigue pg. 33](source:Inner_Sea_Intrigue)): A vigilante with this talent must follow the dietary and sexual prohibitions of the Prophecies of Kalistrade (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 237) in his social identity or he loses the talent's benefit until he atones. He can treat settlements as one size category larger when determining their base values and purchase limits. At 9th level, the vigilante can treat settlements as two size categories larger for the above purposes. At 15th level, the vigilante can treat settlements as four size categories larger for the above purposes.",
			"",
			"**Loyal Aid (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 11](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante gains the service of a number of loyal allies who can help him gather information, cover for his two identities, or perform minor tasks. Inside his area of renown, a vigilante with this talent gains a bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information equal to half his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"In addition, if the vigilante wants, he can task his friends to help cover for him by spreading false tales of his location and activities to others. This has the effect of increasing the DC of Diplomacy checks to gather information about the vigilante and Survival checks to track him by an amount equal to his level. This lasts for 1 day, and can be used only once per week.",
			"",
			"Finally, once per day, the vigilante can ask his allies to perform a minor task for him. This usually involves delivering a message, purchasing a piece of mundane gear worth 100 gp or less (which the vigilante must pay for), or retrieving an object owned by the vigilante (that would be easily accessible by the ally). This task might take other forms as well, subject to GM discretion, but can never involve combat or danger. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Many Guises (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can take on any number of mundane guises. Whenever he changes his identity, he has a third option (instead of social or vigilante): he can become mundane. The mundane identity is not a specific individual. Each one is created at the moment it is assumed, and quickly forgotten as soon as it is removed. While in a mundane identity, the vigilante does not gain the benefit of either his social or vigilante identity, but instead appears as a member of his race, usually a common laborer, farmer, or peasant of any gender. His alignment is treated as neutral when he is in his mundane identity. While in this identity, he receives a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear like an ordinary member of his race. Spells and abilities that are looking for the vigilante in either of his other identities fail while he is in his mundane identity. He must build the appearance for this identity using whatever clothing and tools he has at his disposal. While he can use magic (such as a hat of disguise), his mundane identity can never be anything other than an ordinary member of a society or large group (subject to GM discretion). A vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Mockingbird (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can mimic almost any sort of voice, or even animal calls and sound effects, and he can throw his voice at a distance. This functions similarly to a combination of the ghost sound, ventriloquism, and vocal alteration spells. A vigilante must be at least 5th level to choose this talent.",
			"",
			"**Morphic Mask (Su)** ([Chronicle of Legends pg. 7](source:Chronicle_of_Legends)): The vigilante's physical form in his vigilante identity can differ significantly from that of his social identity, within the norms for his race—this can include changes to the vigilante's proportions, coloration, gender characteristics, and other physical characteristics. This increases the vigilante's bonus from seamless guise by 2 for every significant change, as per the Disguise skill. The vigilante always assumes the same form when using this ability. A vigilante with multiple natural forms, such as a [kitsune](race:kitsune), can alter each of his forms using this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Notorious Fool (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source:Antihero's_Handbook)): While in his social identity, the vigilante can feign absentmindedness, clumsiness, drunkenness, or eccentricity very convincingly. When he fails an opposed Sleight of Hand or Stealth check while in his social identity, he can immediately attempt a Bluff check opposed by the onlookers' Sense Motive checks to appear as though he had only blundered or stumbled in a spectacular fashion. If he succeeds at this Bluff check, the onlookers do not realize the vigilante was attempting the action that prompted him to attempt a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, although being in the wrong place or behaving in an inappropriate manner may still have negative consequences. This talent is ineffective against any onlooker who has already witnessed the vigilante faking a blunder within the last 24 hours.",
			"",
			"**Obscurity (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source:Blood_of_the_Beast)): The vigilante is relatively unknown socially. In fact, he makes a point of keeping the life of his social identity as ordinary as possible. This social talent functions exactly as the renown social talent, but instead of improving the starting attitude of all NPCs within the community, it empowers the vigilante so that he no longer needs to succeed at Disguise checks to appear as his social identity while assuming that identity within his area of obscurity. He still has to attempt Disguise checks when NPCs within this settlement are confronted with indisputable proof that the vigilante could be more than he appears to be, such as when he uses a vigilante talent while in his social identity. This social talent counts as renown for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of social talents that list renown as a prerequisite and can be improved by such talents. A vigilante with this talent cannot select renown, nor can he select any social talent that requires him to be famous (such as celebrity discount or celebrity perks). ",
			"",
			"**Owl's Sight (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)): The vigilante gains low-light vision. If he already has low-light vision, he gains a +4 competence bonus on Perception checks in low light. The vigilante also gains a +2 competence bonus on Sleight of Hand and Stealth checks at night.",
			"",
			"**Quick Change (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante learns to shift between his identities with ease. Instead of needing 1 minute to change his identity, he can now do so as a full-round action. If, after a quick change, he encounters any creature familiar with both of his identities, he must attempt a Disguise check to avoid the creature seeing through his hastily donned disguise and realizing that the identities are, in fact, the same person. The vigilante can spend 1 additional round adjusting and perfecting his appearance and persona to negate the need for this check. A vigilante must be at least 7th level to select this talent. ",
			"",
			"**Renown (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante becomes known for deeds and abilities regardless of his current identity. This renown grants him favorable treatment in civilized company and lends him an air of menace while facing down his enemies. While he is in his social identity, a vigilante can spend 1 week gaining renown among the locals of any community of no more than about 200 individuals (a village, if using settlement population ranges on page 203 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). This could be the entire community or a smaller neighborhood in a larger settlement. He must spend at least 4 hours each day socializing and making contacts. After spending 1 week doing this, whenever he is in his social identity, all NPCs in the community have a starting attitude toward him that is one category better, as long as each person's initial attitude would have at least been indifferent (see the Diplomacy skill description on pages 93- 94 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information). While he gains renown in an area using his social identity, he also spreads rumors and tales about his vigilante identity. Once he has gained renown in a community, he gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks whenever he is in his vigilante identity. This bonus applies only while he is near the community in which he has gained renown; he must be within a number of miles equal to his vigilante level.",
			"",
			"A vigilante can hold renown in a limited number of communities (normally one, with other social talents allowing two). If he gains renown in a new community, he must decide which one of his previous communities to lose. These effects are subject to GM approval. For example, the GM might rule that an NPC or monster has not heard any tales about the vigilante. Or, a foe may have a starting attitude toward him that's one category worse, rather than one category better.",
			"",
			"**Safe House (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can establish a safe house in his area of renown, and he can change it every time he changes his area of renown. If he doesn't have the renown talent, he can still select this talent and place the safe house in a single location to which he has access, but he can never move the safe house from its initial location until he gains the renown talent. This safe house must be an area no larger in volume than a cube that is a number of feet per side equal to 10 feet per vigilante level. The safe house can be arranged any way he likes and it can be part of a larger building, like a secret room or an underground cave. Objects within this safe house can't be located by any effect that is less powerful than a discern location spell. At 7th level, this protection from being located also applies to creatures in the safe house. At 13th level, the entire area is protected from scrying effects (though not mundane snooping) like a mage's private sanctum.",
			"",
			"**Seemless Shapechanger (Ex)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source:Blood_of_the_Beast)): The vigilante seamlessly adopts any persona he assumes with magic. The vigilante adds his seamless guise bonus to the bonus on Disguise checks that he gains to assume the shape of another creature with a polymorph spell or effect. A vigilante must have the shapechanger subtype to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Skill Familiarity (Ex)** ([Disciple's Doctrine pg. 23](source:Disciple's_Doctrine)): The vigilante choses four skills when he gains this talent. He can take 10 on checks with his chosen skills even when distracted or threatened. If he takes 10 on checks with these skills while not distracted or threatened, he gains a bonus on the check equal to one-quarter his vigilante level (minimum +2). A vigilante must be at least 9th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Social Grace (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 12](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante selects any one Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill other than Perception or Use Magic Device. Whenever the vigilante is in his social identity, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on checks with the selected skill. At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can select another skill (with the same restrictions) to gain this bonus.",
			"",
			"**Songbird (Su)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 19](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)): The vigilante gains the use of [animal messenger](spell:animal_messenger) once per day as a spell-like ability, with a caster level equal to his character level. He also gains Handle Animal as a class skill.",
			"",
			"**Subjective Truth (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's disparate identities allow him to defeat magic that detects lies. As long as what he says is true from the point of view of his current identity, it detects as true to effects such as discern lies, and he can say it in effects such as zone of truth that force him to speak the truth. A vigilante must be at least 9th level and have the feign innocence social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Transformation Sequence (Su)** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source:Blood_of_the_Beast)): The vigilante's transformation between identities is assisted by magic. This makes it faster than usual, but also more noticeable. The vigilante can complete the switch between his identities in 5 rounds, improving to a standard action if he has the quick change social talent, and to a swift action if he has the immediate change social talent. However, the transformation causes quite a spectacle, involving loud sounds or music, brilliant colorful energies, and swift motions. A vigilante can select this talent only if he is able to cast spells or spell-like abilities (this needn't be from his vigilante class). A vigilante with the magical child archetype effectively gets this social talent for free at 1st level.",
			"",
			"**Triumphant Return (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's tales are never truly forgotten. This makes it easier to establish his renown in a place he has established it before. In any settlement where the vigilante previously gained renown, it takes only 3 days, rather than 1 week, to gain renown again. A vigilante must be at least 3rd level and have the renown social talent to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Well-Known Expert (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): The vigilante's social identity is known as an expert in numerous fields, including areas and topics the vigilante hasn't actually taken the time to study. As a result the vigilante is skilled at encouraging others to discover solutions to difficult problems themselves by asking probing questions, while appearing to give the information himself. ",
			"",
			"In his social identity, the vigilante can take 10 when attempting to aid another on Appraise, Craft, and Knowledge checks. He also gains a bonus equal to half his class level (minimum +1) on Bluff checks to appear knowledgeable in Appraise, Craft (all), and Knowledge (all). If he has the renownUI social talent, he grants a +3 bonus when he successfully aids another on these skill checks, rather than +2. ",
			"",
			"In his area of renown, the vigilante's social identity is so trusted as an expert that scholars are inspired to make amazing deductions and intuitive leaps in discussions with him. A creature that has already failed a Knowledge check on a specific subject can attempt one additional check to gain information on the same topic if it receives an aid another bonus from the vigilante when doing so."

Some talents require the vigilante to meet prerequisites before they can be chosen, such as possessing another vigilante talent, possessing a particular specialization, or attaining a minimum level. Once a talent has been selected, it can't be changed.",
			"",
			"If the vigilante uses any of these talents while in his social identity, he must succeed at a Disguise check against the Perception checks of all onlookers (without the +20 circumstance bonus from seamless guise) or the onlookers will realize that he is more than his social identity appears to be and perhaps discover the social and vigilante identities are one and the same. If a talent calls for a saving throw, the DC for that save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's level + the vigilante's Charisma modifier, unless stated otherwise.",
			"",

			"**Animal Patron (Ex)** ([Heroes of Golarion pg. 20](source:Heroes_of_Golarion)): The vigilante gains the benefits of one [minor shifter aspect](class:shifter) for a number of minutes per day equal to 1 + half his vigilante level. He can shift into this minor aspect as a swift action. The vigilante must be at least 5th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Another Day (Ex, Su)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): When the vigilante is dropped unconscious due to hit point damage, he automatically stabilizes, but he can also appear to be dead, unless an examining creature succeeds at a Heal check (DC = 20 + the vigilante's class level) or, if using magic such as deathwatch, a caster level check with the same DC (the ability to affect spells is supernatural; the rest of the ability is extraordinary). The vigilante counts as having received aid and automatically succeeds at the Constitution check to become conscious after 1 hour (unless he has actually died in the meantime).",
			"",
			"**Aquatic Action (Ex)** ([People of the Wastes pg. 20](source:People_of_the_Wastes)): The vigilante uses weapons, natural weapons, and unarmed strikes in aquatic environments as though under the effect of freedom of movement, including when making melee attacks against targets in the water while the vigilante is on land. The vigilante ignores limitations and penalties on ranged attacks, including thrown weapons, imposed by being underwater for the first 15 feet. (See Underwater Combat on page 432 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for more information.) A vigilante must be at least 8th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Armor Skin (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's armor is like a second skin. He doesn't apply the armor check penalty for light and medium armor on Acrobatics, Escape Artist, or Stealth checks. This penalty applies on other skill checks as normal. At 8th level, he can move at full speed in medium armor.",
			"",
			"**Blind Spot (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 13](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante is so skilled at stealth, he can use the Stealth skill to hide from creatures with unusual senses that normally automatically detect creatures. This includes senses such as blindsense, blindsight, lifesense, scent, or tremorsense. For each such ability that the creature possesses, if the vigilante is not bypassing the sense in another way—such as the negate aroma spell for scent or flying for tremorsense—the creature gains a stacking +20 circumstance bonus on all Perception checks to notice the vigilante, rather than automatically noticing the vigilante. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 6th level can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Brutal Maneuver** ([Blood of the Beast pg. 15](source:Blood_of_the_Beast)): The first time each round that the vigilante uses a weapon, including a natural attack or unarmed strike, to perform a combat maneuver in place of making an attack (such as by performing a disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver in place of making a melee attack), he can choose to take a -5 penalty on all his attack rolls during the round. If he does so and succeeds at his combat maneuver check, the vigilante deals damage to the target of his combat maneuver as if he had hit that target with a normal hit from his weapon.",
			"",
			"**Chase Master (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): Whether he is the pursuer or the pursued, few can best a vigilante at a chase. He receives a bonus on all checks during a chase (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 232) equal to half his vigilante level or +4, whichever is greater. ",
			"",
			"**Close the Gap (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): Each round, at the start of his turn, the vigilante can designate one foe within 20 feet that isn't adjacent to him. When he moves, he doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from that foe as long as he ends his move adjacent to that foe. If he charges that foe, he does not take the -2 penalty to his AC on any attacks made by the designated foe.",
			"",
			"**Combat Expertise (Ex)** ([Antihero's Handbook pg. 16](source:Antihero's_Handbook)): The vigilante gains Combat Expertise as a bonus feat, even if he doesn't meet the prerequisites. If he already has Combat Expertise, he instead gains another feat he qualified for at the level when he chose Combat Expertise. If the vigilante's Intelligence score is less than 13, it counts as 13 for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of combat feats.",
			"",
			"**Combat Skill (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante gains any one combat feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat, but he is treated as though he had a number of fighter levels equal to half his vigilante level for the purpose of qualifying for this feat. Only an avenger vigilante can select this talent, but he can select this talent more than once; each time he must select a different feat.",
			"",
			"**Concealed Strike (Ex)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 27](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): Whenever the vigilante attacks an opponent with a concealed weapon that his target wasn't aware of, he can attempt a Bluff check to feint that opponent as a move action. If he has the Improved Feint feat, he attempts this check as a free action instead. A vigilante must be at least 6th level to select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Cunning Feint (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can feint as a move action or in place of his first attack during a full attack. At 8th level, when the vigilante successfully feints, the opponent is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against all attacks until the vigilante's next turn.",
			"",

He can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. The vigilante can takes this talent multiple times. Each time he does, he can use the ability one additional time per day and he gains one alchemist discovery that can modify bombs, treating his vigilante level as his alchemist level for any prerequisites.

The vigilante can make a separate choice for each target.",
			"",
			"**Weapon Familiarity (Ex)** ([Disciple's Doctrine pg. 23](source:Disciple's_Doctrine)): The vigilante selects either two simple or martial weapons or one exotic weapon when he gains this talent.

In addition, if he is at least 6th level, he also gains the Improved Whip Mastery feat.

			"",
			"**Foe Collision (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante can shove one of his foes into another. When the vigilante deals hidden strike damage to a corporeal foe with a melee attack, he can also deal an amount of nonlethal damage equal to his reduced hidden strike damage to an opponent adjacent to the first (even if the second opponent is out of his reach). The damage is bludgeoning damage, and if the colliding foe has any natural attacks, the damage is also considered magic, evil, or any other type of damage the natural attack deals. Unlike normal vigilante talents that affect hidden strikes, this vigilante talent applies in all cases when the target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC. Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Leave an Opening (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 14](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's hidden strike leaves an unbalancing opening in a foe's defenses, setting up the foe to be attacked again. At the beginning of the foe's next turn, if the vigilante threatens the foe, the foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the vigilante. Multiple attacks against the same foe don't create multiple attacks of opportunity in the same round (but attacks against several foes can cause each to provoke one attack of opportunity). Only a stalker vigilante can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Mighty Ambush (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 15](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): Once per round, when the vigilante succeeds at a hidden strike, he can instantly drop the damaged enemy unconscious for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates this effect (DC = 10 + 1/2 the vigilante's class level + the higher of the vigilante's Strength and Dexterity modifiers). Whether or not a creature's saving throw is successful, it can't be affected by that vigilante's mighty ambush again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 10th level can select this talent.",
			"",
			"**Throat Jab (Ex)** ([Ultimate Intrigue pg. 16](source:Ultimate_Intrigue)): The vigilante's hidden strike jabs his opponent in the throat, preventing that opponent from speaking until the vigilante's next turn. (If the vigilante uses this ability on the surprise round, it lasts until the end of his first full turn after the surprise round.) This prevents the target from calling out for help, using spells with verbal components, or doing anything else that requires speaking. The target cannot be affected by that vigilante's throat jab again for 24 hours. Only a stalker vigilante of at least 4th level can select this talent."

At the end of this time, the subject receives a brief image of the future, usually no more than 1 year from the time of the vision, subject to GM discretion. This is only one possible version of the future, making such visions unreliable at best. Most visions are slanted toward the alignment of the witch that granted them.

When the witch touches the creature's remains (some small portion of the creature's body must still exist, and it may have been dead for any amount of time), its soul enters the body of the witch's familiar as per familiar melding, as if the witch's familiar were the target's familiar. The creature's soul can remain within the witch's familiar for up to 1 hour per class level the witch has. During this time, the witch can telepathically communicate with the creature's soul (though the soul cannot do anything else), and the witch can return the ally to life. Doing so is a standard action that returns the creature's soul to its body, brings it back to life with a number of hit points equal to 5d8 + 1 hit point per the witch's caster level.

The ghost has its own personality and desires, but is willing to bargain with the witch, as if she had cast greater planar ally. To seal an agreement with the witch, the ghost requires life energy equal to 1 temporary negative level (this is in addition to the standard payment for the ghost's service). This negative level persists as long as the ghost remains in the service of the witch; the witch can end the agreement as a standard action, immediately removing the negative level.",

			"**Witch's Hut (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 83](source:Ultimate_Magic)): The witch can animate a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction as an animated object. The hut can be of up to Huge size (approximately 15 feet by 15 feet). The animated hut's hardness increases to 8 and its hit points double. The witch can give the hut the following commands: guard (the hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using the witch's Perception modifier and screams if it spots any), hide (all entrances are hidden by illusory wall spells and locked with arcane lock), and move (moves at speed 60 on giant bird or bone legs as directed by the witch, even obeying commands such as \"follow me from 100 feet away\"). The hut remains animate for 24 hours, until she dismisses it or she animates another, at which time the hut stops where it is and reverts to its nonmagical state."

			"At 1st level, when a witch gains her familiar, she must also select a patron. This patron is a vague and mysterious force, granting the witch power for reasons that she might not entirely understand. While these forces need not be named, they typically hold influence over one of the following forces. At 2nd level, and every two levels thereafter, a witch's patron adds new spells to a witch's list of spells known. These spells are also automatically added to the list of spells stored by the familiar. The spells gained depend upon the patron chosen. Each patron is listed by its theme. Its actual name is up to the GM and the witch to decide.",

			"Witch patrons are enigmatic entities, sometimes fair minded and other times malevolent. Some are demigods or powerful spirits, such as those that grant shamans their spellcasting. Others are manifestations of cosmic forces, created by the certainty of mortals and the fundamental need for balance in much the same way aeons manifest. While kindly patrons are rare-attracting worshipers more readily than agents-the majority are high-minded and neutral figures. They dispense arcane power to those whose interests and mindsets align with their needs, and once a witch drifts from the cause or refuses to pay the price for such power, her patron divests the spellcaster of her powers and departs. Wicked patrons enjoy longer-lasting relationships, however, manipulating the witches' minds and punishing disobedience in a manner far more personal than an evil god. The familiar of a wicked patron becomes equal parts power source and prison guard, forever studying its charge for disobedience.",
			"",
			"The various published witch patron themes present a wide array of concepts and priorities to align with a large variety of supernatural beings. Some specific patrons, however, might offer variations within the spells they grant. Special patrons swap out the spells normally provided by a patron theme at specific levels, and grant a specific hex and drawback at 1st level. Once a specific patron has been selected, a witch cannot change her patron or raise a hand against that entity without losing her spellcasting, hexes, and familiar. These categories are limited in the patron themes they can provide; their witches must select from one of the four listed for each entry. These patrons are extraordinary examples of their kind, often invested with unique or mythic powers and pursuing long-term agendas measured in centuries or eons."

			"Wizards spend much of their lives seeking deeper truths, hunting knowledge as if it were life itself. The wizard's power is not necessarily the spells he wields; spells are merely the outward, most visible manifestation of that power. A wizard's true power is in his fierce intelligence, his dedication to his craft, and his ability to peel back the surface truths of reality to understand the fundamental underpinnings of existence. A wizard spends much of his time researching spells, and would rather find an undiscovered library than a room full of gold. A wizard need not be a reclusive bookworm, but he must have a burning curiosity for the unknown. Arcane discoveries are the results of this obsession with magic. A wizard can learn an arcane discovery in place of a regular feat or wizard bonus feat.",

Whenever you cast a summon monster spell, you can summon two creatures from a single list 1 or more levels lower than the level of the spell.

Anytime you target and successfully affect a single creature with a charm or compulsion spell and that creature is within 30 feet of another opponent, your spell has a chance of affecting the second creature as well. As a swift action immediately after affecting a creature with a charm or compulsion spell, you can cause the spell to carry over to the nearest creature within 30 feet.

If you choose this arcane discovery at 1st level, you gain a dull gray ioun stone as a bonded object at no cost. A bonded ioun stone must be orbiting your head to have effect. At 12th level, you can turn a bonded dull gray ioun stone into another kind of ioun stone as if you possessed the Craft Wondrous Item feat; if you die or replace a bonded ioun stone that has been transformed in this way, the stone reverts to a dull gray ioun stone.

			"",
			"**Multimorph (Su)** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 86](source:Ultimate_Magic)): Your studies in transmogrification have increased your control over shapechanging spells. When you cast a spell of the polymorph subschool on yourself, you may expend 1 minute of the spell's duration as a standard action to assume another form allowed by the spell. You can do this as often as you like, subject to the duration of the spell. You must be at least a 5th-level wizard to select this discovery.",

			"**Observant Illusion (Su)** ([Spymaster's Handbook pg. 23](source:Spymaster's_Handbook)): You can project your senses into any ongoing figment or shadow illusion you create with a spell of at least 3rd level. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a swift or move action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to choose this discovery.",

Select one wizard opposition school; preparing spells of this school now only requires one spell slot of the appropriate level instead of two, and you no longer have the -4 Spellcraft penalty for crafting items from that school. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.",

			"**Psychic Preperation** ([Magic Tactics Toolbox pg. 3](source:Magic_Tactics_Toolbox)): You have learned a limited way to access psychic magic. When you first prepare your spells for the day, you can prepare one spell as a psychic spell. This spell must be at least 2 levels lower than the highest-level wizard spell you can cast, and takes a slot 1 level higher than the spell's actual level. When you cast this spell, it operates as a psychic spell, including using emotional and thought components in place of somatic and verbal components, and only having expensive material components.",

			"**Resilient Illusions** ([Magical Marketplace pg. 18](source:Magical_Marketplace)): You are able to conjure illusions so lifelike that they defy disbelief. Anytime a creature tries to disbelieve one of your illusion effects, make a caster level check. Treat the illusion's save DC as its normal DC or the result of the caster level check, whichever is higher. You must be at least an 8th-level wizard to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Split Slot** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 86](source:Ultimate_Magic)): Once per day when you prepare spells, you may treat any one of your open spell slots as if it were two spell slots that were two spell levels lower. For example, a 9th-level wizard can split a 5th-level slot into two 3rd-level slots, preparing fireball and lightning bolt in those 3rd-level slots. For all purposes, the two lower-level slots are treated as that lower level (so the split 5th-level slot used for a fireball has a DC as if it were in a normal 3rd-level slot). Splitting a 2nd-level slot lets you prepare two additional cantrips (which you can cast over and over, just like normally prepared cantrips). This discovery has no effect on cantrips or 1st-level spells. You may select this discovery multiple times; each time you select it, you may split another spell slot when you prepare spells. You cannot split a slot that you created by splitting a higher-level slot. You must be at least 5th level to select this discovery.",
			"",
			"**Staff-Like Wand** ([Ultimate Magic pg. 87](source:Ultimate_Magic)): Your research has unlocked a new power in conjunction with using a wand. Similar to using a magic staff, you use your own Intelligence score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against spells you cast from a wand, and you can use your caster level when activating the power of a wand if it's higher than the caster level of the wand.

			"**Steward of the Great Beyond** ([Champions of Purity pg. 27](source:Champions_of_Purity)): Whenever a creature attempts to use a teleportation effect or summon a creature within 30 feet of you, you may attempt to block the effect. Make an opposed caster level check (1d20 + caster level) as an immediate action. If the check succeeds, the spell or effect fails and is wasted; otherwise, it is unaffected. You can use this ability once per day plus one additional time for every 5 wizard levels you possess beyond 10th. You must be at least a 9th-level wizard to select this discovery.",

This ability acts as the time stop spell, except that you gain only 1 round of apparent time.

This outsider can have no more than 12 Hit Dice. Once per day, you can speak the common name by which the outsider is known, and the outsider travels to you as if you had cast planar binding upon it. It must obey you to the best of its ability, without pay or bargaining for its services, for its fear that you might release its true name to the wider world is enough to bring even the most recalcitrant of outsiders to bear.",
			"If the creature is within 100 feet, as a move action, you may punish it by deliberately mispronouncing its name, wracking its very essence and giving it the sickened and staggered conditions for 1 round (even if the creature is normally immune to these conditions). You cannot use true name in an area of silence, but the creature does not have to be able to hear you for it to be harmed by the ability.",
			"It is in your best interest to call this creature only sparingly, and occasionally reward it in some fashion to mollify its wrath. If you repeatedly fail to offer it a reward appropriate to its type and ethos, the creature may begin plotting ways to destroy the bond between you, whether by creating an accident that will destroy your memory of the name, by plaguing you with nuisances or dangers until you vow never to call on it again, or by actively seeking to destroy you through its own devices or those of an underling. If this creature is of a lawful type and you are violating its ethos, its superiors may even destroy it or you rather than allow you to contaminate their servant further. Worse, they may establish situations where it is necessary for you to summon this outsider, opening gateways to infernal or angelic interference, in order to gain a foothold on the Material Plane.",
			"You may select this discovery multiple times. Each time you select this discovery, it applies to a different, specific outsider. You must be at least an 11th-level wizard to select this discovery. If you select this discovery at 15th level or higher, the creature may have up to 18 Hit Dice and the call acts as greater planar binding instead of planar binding.",

While in werewolf shape, you gain all the effects of the werewolf template instead of the spell's normal benefits. You act in all respects as a natural lycanthrope for the duration of the spell, including the ability to inflict the curse of lycanthropy using the spell's save DC. You must be at least a 15th-level wizard to select this arcane discovery.",

This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school's spell list (see Chapter 5). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school (air opposes earth, fire opposes water). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.",

			"In some lands, scholars of magic insist that material things consist of five elements, not four: fire, earth, metal, water, and wood. Rather than directly opposing each other, these five elements counter and generate each other in a wheel-like formation: wood overcomes earth, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, and metal overcomes wood. Similar to the four types of elemental wizard schools, some wizards specialize in the schools of magic based on metal or wood. Like a normal arcane school, an elemental school grants a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the elemental school's spell list (see below). Unlike a normal arcane school, each elemental school requires the wizard to select his opposed element as his opposition school-in the case of the five-element system, he must choose the element that overcomes his element as his opposition element (so a metal elementalist must select fire as his opposition school because fire overcomes metal). He does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal."

Once per day, while wearing a signifer mask, you can use vision as a spell-like ability, treating your total character level as your caster level.

Additionally, if a creature in the area has died within 1 round and this brings its hit point total to a negative amount less than its Constitution score, the creature returns to life and stabilizes.

Though unaware of your probing, the target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this ability (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier).

					"**1: Mute (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, you can target a single creature within 100 feet. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier), the creature cannot make any sounds for a number of rounds equal to your character level. This prevents the target from speaking, otherwise making noise, casting spells with verbal components, and using similar abilities with auditory effects. Each round on its turn, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This effect is dismissable. It does not make the target immune to sonic or language-based attacks, spells, or effects.   ",
					"**2: Dismantle (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, you can cause a cloud of thick, brown fog to arise from a chosen point within 200 feet. This cloud functions as per fog cloud, using your character level as your caster level, except the fog spreads in a 10-foot radius, and every creature or object within is affected as per rusting grasp, without any touch attacks required. Attended metal objects, including weapons and armor, receive a Fortitude saving throw to negate this effect using their wielder's Fortitude saving throw bonus (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). Creatures within the cloud are affected by the rusting effect only once, not every round, but creatures that move back into the area are exposed again. You and your possessions can enter the cloud and not be affected. This effect is dismissable.   ",

Rather than let the southern edge of Cheliax fall to Rahadoumi, 300 Hellknights of the Chain took over the posts and held the border for 30 years. At the civil wars conclusion, a number of the Hellknights stayed on to protect the border, and now the Order of the Wall is charged with defending the boundaries of civilization."

			"At 3rd level, a Hellknight gains access to his first discipline, choosing one associated with his specific order. At 6th level, the Hellknight gains a second discipline, choosing from any listed as being available to \"any order.\" At 9th level, the Hellknight gains his third discipline, choosing this one from any of the disciplines listed below, even those from another order, with the exception of pentamic faith. When applicable, the save DC to resist a discipline's effect is equal to 10 + the Hellknight's level + his Charisma modifier. The Hellknight can use any one discipline a number of times per day equal to the total number of disciplines he has access to, so at 3rd level he can use his discipline once per day. At 6th level, he can use both disciplines twice per day each. At 9th level, he can use all three of his disciplines three times per day.",

			"**Brand (Sp; Order of the Pyre)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 278](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): The Hellknight can use [mark of justice](spell:mark_of_justice) as a spell-like ability.",
			"",
			"**Call Armor (Su; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): As a move action, the Hellknight can cause her armor to instantly appear on her body. Alternatively, she can dismiss it as a move action, causing it to vanish. (Doing either of these counts as one use of this discipline.) Where the armor appears from or vanishes to can be anywhere the Hellknight designates, but it must be a place the Hellknight has seen on the same plane of existence where she is, or be in an extradimensional space she controls, such as a bag of holding. This armor is a specific suit of Hellknight plate that the Hellknight designates when she selects this discipline. The Hellknight can attune this ability to a new set of armor, but doing so takes 1 week.",
			"",
			"**Censor (Su; Order of the Rack)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 278](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): When the Hellknight uses smite chaos on a creature, he can strike the creature mute for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a successful Will save. A mute creature cannot speak, nor can it cast spells that have verbal components or use language-dependant effects.",
			"",
			"**Command (Sp; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can use greater command as a spell-like ability, using her character level as her caster level.",
			"",
			"**Dispel Chaos (Sp; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can use dispel chaos as a spell-like ability, using her character level as her caster level.",
			"",
			"**Favored Quarry (Ex; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight chooses a creature type from the ranger favored enemy table (usually humanoid with a specific subtype, but this is not required). The Hellknight gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against creatures of her selected type. She can also attempt Knowledge skill checks untrained to identify those creatures. Each time the Hellknight chooses an additional discipline, this bonus increases by 2 (to a potential maximum of +6 at 9th level).",
			"",
			"**Fearsomeness (Ex; any order)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): A Hellknight who uses the Intimidate skill to cause a creature within 10 feet to become shaken can instead cause that creature to become frightened.",
			"",
			"**Invoke Glyph (Sp and Ex; Order of the Glyph)** ([Pathfinder #107: Scourge of the Godclaw pg. 47](source:Pathfinder_#107:_Scourge_of_the_Godclaw)): The Hellknight can use glyph of warding as a spell-like ability. While this ability does not require an expensive material component, a single Hellknight can maintain only one glyph of warding at a time; if he uses this spell-like ability a second time, the previously created glyph of warding vanishes. In addition, the Hellknight gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against glyph of warding or symbol spells.",
			"",
			"**Mental Intrusion (Sp; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can use telepathy (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 189) as a spell-like ability, using her character level as her caster level.",
			"",
			"**Onslaught (Su; Order of the Nail)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): Once per day as a free action, a Hellknight increases his base speed by +10 feet and gains a +4 bonus to his Strength for 1 round. If the Hellknight is mounted, these bonuses also apply to his mount.",
			"",
			"**Pentamic Faith (Ex; Order of the Godclaw only)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): This ability allows the Hellknight to select one of the following domains: Artifice, Glory, Knowledge, Law, Magic, Nobility, Protection, Rune, Strength, Travel, and War. The Hellknight gains all of the granted powers (but not domain spells) of that domain, treating his Hellknight levels as cleric levels to determine what domain abilities he has access to.",
			"",
			"**Seek the Taken (any order)** ([Pathfinder #98: Turn of the Torrent pg. 67](source:Pathfinder_#98:_Turn_of_the_Torrent)): When a member of the Order of the Torrent becomes a 3rd-level Hellknight, he gains his first discipline: seek the taken. This enables the Hellknight to use an enlarged locate creature as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to his total character level. At 9th level, when a Order of the Torrent Hellknight gains his third discipline, he cannot choose the summon devil discipline.",
			"",
			"**Shackle (Su; Order of the Chain)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): When the Hellknight uses smite chaos on a creature, he can impede its mobility. The creature can negate this effect with a Will save; otherwise, it is affected as if by a slow spell for 1d4 rounds.",
			"",
			"**Shadow Step (Sp; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can use enlarged shadow step as a spell-like ability, as if the Enlarge Spell metamagic feat were applied to the spell, using her character level as her caster level.",
			"",
			"**Summon Devil (Sp; Order of the Gate)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): The Hellknight may use summon monster V as a spell-like ability to summon 1 bearded devil. At 6th level, this spell-like ability is replaced by summon monster VI, allowing him to summon 1d3 bearded devils, or 1 erinyes. And at 9th level, this spell-like ability is replaced by summon monster VII, allowing him to summon 1d4+1 bearded devils, 1d3 erinyes, or 1 bone devil.",
			"",
			"**Summon Servant of Law (Sp; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can summon a creature or creatures to help her, as if using a summon monster spell. At 3rd level, she can summon 1d3 hell hounds. At 6th level, she can summon 1d3 advanced hell hounds or one axiomite (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 36). And at 9th level, she can summon 1d4+1 hell hounds, 1d3 axiomites, or one zelekhut inevitable (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 167).",
			"",
			"**Trace (Su; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can study a single personal belonging of a creature for 1 minute, after which she knows the general direction of the creature's current location as long as it is within 1 mile and on the same plane. She also learns the direction the creature is currently moving, if any. This effect lasts for 10 minutes per character level. An object can be used as the focus for this ability only once. For the purposes of this ability, a \"personal belonging\" is any object a creature owned or carried with it for more than a week. If the target is under the effects of nondetection or a similar spell or effect, or is on a different plane, this ability gives no result.",
			"",
			"**Tracker (Sp; any order)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): The Hellknight can summon a creature to aid him, either in battle or to track an enemy, as if using a summon monster spell, save that the summoned creature lingers for 1 hour before vanishing. A 6th-level Hellknight can summon either an eagle, a riding dog, a wolf, or a leopard. A 9th-level Hellknight can instead opt to summon a dire wolf or a hell hound.",
			"",
			"**Versatile Intimidation (Ex; any order)** ([Path of the Hellknight pg. 59](source:Path_of_the_Hellknight)): The Hellknight can use Intimidate to reproduce the effects of another Charisma-based skill. Choose one of the following: Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, or Perform (oratory). Each time the Hellknight wishes to use that skill, she can attempt an Intimidate check and treat it as if it were a check of the desired type. At 9th level, the Hellknight can choose an additional skill from the list above and use Intimidate to reproduce its effects.",
			"",
			"**Vigilance (Su; Order of the Scourge)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): The Hellknight gains low-light vision (this effect is constant). In addition, as a full-round action, the Hellknight can see through up to 5 feet of stone, wood, or similar barriers as if they didn't exist. Metal or denser barriers block this effect. Each use of this ability lasts as long as the Hellknight concentrates, up to a number of rounds equal to the Hellknight's level.",
			"",
			"**Wrack (Su; any order)** ([Inner Sea World Guide pg. 279](source:Inner_Sea_World_Guide)): The Hellknight may make a touch attack as a standard action to cause a creature to suffer incredible pain. The creature touched takes 1d6 points of damage + the Hellknight's Charisma modifier, and must make a Will save to avoid being staggered for 1d4 rounds."
