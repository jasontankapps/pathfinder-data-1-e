Poisons in this section with onset triggers list the specific triggers in their Onset entries (rather than a number of rounds, minutes, or days). A character who fails his Fortitude saving throw upon exposure doesn't start attempting saving throws against the poison's effects until exposed to the listed stimulus.",

The first time after an affected character triggers the poison and fails a saving throw to resist the poison, the character suffers the initial effect. If the affected character fails any subsequent saving throws, he suffers the secondary effect. Unless noted otherwise, a triggered poison that isn't triggered after 1 day has no effect."

On Golarion, only the few dream crystals that remain in the crashed Lirgen's Glory can be used to create more of this toxin, but if the Emissary from Beyond establishes a domain in Dustpawn, it can create more dream crystals, given time. Dream crystal toxin introduced in significant quantities to a water supply dilutes the venom so that any who drink the water suffer a lesser version of its effects-see the curse of bestial dreams on page 4 for details. In any event, dream crystal toxin counts as both a poison and a curse for determining what can negate its effects. A creature must be immune to both poison and curses to be immune to dream crystal toxin."

An attempt to divine its nature via [detect poison](spell:detect_poison) fails unless the caster succeeds at a DC 25 caster level check, and use of a spell like [diagnose disease](spell:diagnose_disease) always misidentifies the venom as a disease unless the caster succeeds at a DC 25 caster level check.

[Neutralize poison](spell:Neutralize_poison) and [slow poison](spell:slow_poison) function normally on a person suffering from fool's leprosy, but spells like [remove disease](spell:remove_disease) do not, as the condition is a poison effect, not a disease effect. [Heal](spell:Heal) can cure the effects of fool's leprosy but does nothing to educate the caster about the nature of the effect it removes. As long as the truth about fool's leprosy remains hidden, a successful DC 35 Heal check is required to recognize that someone suffering from its effects is affected by poison, not a disease."
